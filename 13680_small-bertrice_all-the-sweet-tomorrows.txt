favorite sir christopher hatton another of the queens favorites and captain of the gentlemen pensioners lettice knollys countess of essex the queens cousin the algerians osman a famous astrologer and skyes old friend allma his french wife prologue this is all your fault you meddling old man skye omalley burke shouted at her fatherinlaw the macwilliam of midconnaught her bluegreen eyes flashed fire and her marvelous long black hair unbound and unruly swirled about her shoulders as she paced furiously about the room youve gone and widowed me wasnt it enough that your wicked machinations kept niall and mc separated all those years now youve widowed me god curse you for it old man ill never forgive you never then she burst into tears collapsing onto the carved oak settle by the fireplace the old mans face disintegrated under her fierce attack and he seemed to shrink in size as if seeking to escape the terrible harsh truth of her words how could i stop him skye lass niall is a man long grown his voice quavered he would not listen to me how could i stop him she looked at him scornfully and he withered further under her look of contempt you knew that darragh cneil was a madwoman for all her religious calling old man you knew still you let my husband ride off to her and to his own death she closed her eyes a moment and more tears spilled down her cheeks oh niall she whispered brokenly niall niall niall came the mocking echo in her mind the old man sniffed piteously as he wiped his nose on his sleeve then said at least weve got the children skye lass weve got nialls son and daughter you have nothing she told him coldly i will take my children and leave this place i will go home to innisfana i have always hated burke castle but for nialls sake i lived here now my husband is dead and i will stay no longer suddenly the macwilliam grew angry a bit of his old spirit coursing back through his tired veins youll not take nialls children from me he thundered at her they are my heirs the boy in particular you cannot take them her fair features darkened with outraged fury and he could have sworn that sparks shot from her blazing blue eyes do you think that i would let you have my babes she hissed angrily at him ill see you in hell first youve no choice skye lass padraic is my heir with his father gone and wee deirdre after him ill not let you take them from me for a brief moment he felt sure afid strong again old man youll not stop me from whatever i choose to do skye omalley declared then she rose from the settle and stormed from the room not seeing his tired shoulders slump forward defeated by the knowledge that she would leave him if she chose taking his only grandchildren with her he coughed deeply and turning spit a clot of black blood into the pewter basin on the table the blood had been coming up for several weeks now his instinct told him that he did not have a great deal of time left to live until now it had not worried him particularly for his son had been a strong wise man mature for his years now however niall was dead and his only living male heir was six weeks old the babe was strong but anything was possible if the child died before reaching his majority the english would eat up his holdings as they had so many in the past several years they might anyway where had the time gone the macwilliam wondered it only seemed a short time ago that he had been a young man in his full vigor ready and eager to bed a hotblooded wench now he was but a broken old man clutching his faded memories and shattered dreams about him like a tattered cloak his thin white hair lank upon his bony shoulders the macwilliam sighed sadly god help irelandfor surely no one else would the irish stood quite alone england to one side of them the open sea on the other in a way it was their own fault for they had no one ruler to rally them but rather a thousand petty bickering chieftains each jealously guarding his own holding and each making the alliances best suited to himself not necessarily to ireland it was no wonder that the english with their one strong ruler could overcome the irish irishmen twas true would not be conquered by war but rather by their own weaknesses still and here the macwilliam smiled a dark grim smile his beautiful and willful daughterinlaw was a very powerful woman in her own right in ireland skye was the chieftaincss of the wealthy seagoing omalleys of innisfana even though the omalley brothers were grown they showed no great hurry to take the familial responsibilities their late father had bequeathed them far preferring as he had to stay on their ships skye was the one with the head for business in england she was the dowager countess of lynmouth a fine old english title her son from that union was the current earl true the goldenhaired lad was but six years old but he was the english queens godson and quite in her favor even now he was being raised at court and was bess tudors pet page the queen had a weakness for attractive males even little ones yes the macwilliam thought bitterly whatever happened skye omalley would survive she had more damned lives than a cat a solitary tear ran down his worn and wrinkled face if his son had had her blessed luck he might be alive today darragh oneil he silently cursed the day he had ever forced his son into marriage with that cold bitch niall had originally been betrothed to her older sister ceit that lass had died in an epidemic but as both the oneils and the burkes were eager for a match between their families the younger sister had been brought from her convent as a substitute bride darragh oneil had been within a few hours of taking her final vows and she was a born nun she had not wanted niall burke she had not wanted any husband but after a good thrashing from her father she had done as she was told the marriage had of course been a disaster niall had been wildly in love with skye omalley then the oflaherty of ballyhennesseys wife and when she was widowed he was unable any longer to hide that love his own marriage had been conveniently annulled by skyes uncle the bishop of connaught and darragh had hurried gratefully back to her convent niall and skye were then betrothed but once more the fates had playfully separated them skye was captured by barbary pirates lost her memory and endured much before they were finally reunited then however she was again another mans wife and had not even recognized niall he too had another wife the unfortunate constanza who mercifully died as for skye she also lost her new husband to death her english husband whom she had loved deeply by then her memory of niall had returned but she had remained true to her geoffrey and the macwilliam admired her for it she was a remarkable woman and he deeply regretted the years she and his son had lost at last skye and niall had been married not mind you in any fancy ceremony with gladsome feasting afterward but by proxy the bride still mourned her english husband in her english castle not even aware that her wily uncle the bishop of connaught had taken advantage of an old law that made him technically head of the family and used that tenuous authority to marry her off the macwilliam chuckled hoarsely remembering the deception he and seamus omalley had used to wed the reluctant pair his son had gone off to england expecting a warm welcome he had not received it the stubborn wench had led niall a merry chase almost driving him to violence in the end however their love had won out as niall had accepted that his wife was no longer the unworldly girl he had once adored but rather an intelligent and passionate woman who had been the beloved of other men she had been on her own long enough to learn to wield the great responsibility that was hers and she was not about to give up her power to anyone even a loved husband what was hers remained hers when he had accepted skye for what she was the marriage had flourished and been blessed with two healthy strong children within thirteen months of each other the macwilliam shook his head sadly it had all been going so well the burkes had pledged their fealty to englands queen in hopes of gaining a measure of peace in hopes of surviving many of the noble irish families had done the same in order to save their lands and their people most had been betrayed for the english were not only incredibly savage when they chose to be but insatiably greedy for the sweet green lands of ireland still they had so far left the burkes and their own alone baby padraics inheritance was intact and the macwilliam knew that he could trust his daughterinlaw to keep it that way had she not fought so valiantly for her english sons lands and title she would fight as fiercely for her irish son also he knew the wench knew her duty as well as any man and often did it better skye omalley she was a beautiful and gallant woman and he wondered if she would ever be allowed any peace she seemed destined to find love only to lose it through no fault of her own damn darragh oneil damn her mad soul to hell he began to cough again and his blood bright hot crimson streamed and steamed into the polished pewter basin as his tired heart hammered against his thin chest his son his handsome fine boy was dead and their immortality rested with a suckling infant not even old enough to lift his head up another bout of coughing wracked his ancient frame weakening him so that for a moment he did not hear the door to his private chamber reopen there was a gasp and then skyes voice said resignedly old man will you stop at nothing to force me to remain will you even die on me now he grinned wanly up at her ive had my way in this life almost as much as you have skye lass she would have laughed but the sight of his bright blood in the basin sobered her instead she put an arm about his shoulders ah rory she sighed she used his christian name only rarely why did you not tell me of the blood if im meant to die now then ill die he said fatalistically ill send for my sister eibhlin she said quietly and then she helped him to rise and reach his bed he was hard put not to grin mischievously at her so apparent was her concern over him fate had conspired with him to keep her and the children here shed not leave a dying man for all she talked eibhlin omalley a nun at the island convent of st brides of the cliffs was famed in connaught for her midwifery and her healing skills she was in great demand and her service among the wealthy had greatly enriched her small convent her service among the poor and there were so many poor had convinced eibhlin that if there were a hundred of her it wouldnt be enough between her religious devotions and her growing medical practice she averaged but two to four hours sleep a night at home in her convent for a short rest she still came quickly across a stormy winter sea when called by her younger sister skye im surprised that hes still alive she told skye drily after she had made a careful examination of the old man can we do nothing skye was troubled she was still angry at rory but she loved him as she had loved her own father you can make him comfortable eibhlin said and you can promise him not to take the children back to innisfana did he tell you i was going to take them skye fenced with her elder sister well isnt that what you threatened eibhlins pretty face peered sharply at her younger sister from between the folds of her starched wimple i cannot bear this castle without niall i have never liked it but without niall it is impossible skye wailed it is padraics inheritance sister you need not remind me of that sister skye retorted sharply he will have it did i not protect lynmouth for robin can i do any less for nialls son have you cried yet skye eibhlin looked closely at her sister skyes face was a closed and tight mask i have cried she said for all the good it did me which was none i should be used to it by now eibhlin how many husbands have i buried four no i take that back i have only buried three nialls body was not found it is lost at sea the very sea that has enriched the omalleys so a harsh laugh escaped her our fierce old sea god mannanan maclir has taken his price from me but tis too dear a price eibhlin tis too dear her voice was trembling skye eibhlin put a loving arm about her sister but she felt totally helpless how could she possibly comfort her sibling for such a loss niall burke had been skyes first great love and when they had finally wed everyone expected him to be her last love as well she killed him without mercy eibhlin skye said darragh oneil murdered my husband and do you know why no skye eibhlin replied gently i know nothing but that lord burke is dead and tragically at the hands of sister mary penitent sister mary penitent skyes voice shook with anger darragh oneil twas darragh oneil who murdered my husband darragh oneil for all her religious calling she lured him to her side by saying she was dying and wanted to make her peace with him instead she stabbed him to deathand condemned her own soul to eternal damnation she has wantonly widowed me and cruelly orphaned my two children id like to kill her with my own two hands eibhlin but her convent protects her says she is mad i dont believe it i dont believe it but they will not let me in to speak with her they say that the mention of my name sends her into fits fits indeed the bitch knows full well what she has done tis naught but a ploy to escape me gods bones id like to set the english upon that convent skye eibhlin was shocked the english in ireland were at this very time as systematically attempting to wipe out all the religious houses as their late sovereign henry viii had destroyed those same establishments in his own england it was not as easy in ireland however as it had been in england the irish did not love their english rulers and this attack on their church gave them one thing to which they could all rally honestly peasant and noble alike oh i wouldnt eibhlin skye said contritely uncle seamus would have my head if i did but id like to do it i will get uncle seamus to aid us eibhlin said as the bishop of connaught he must order an investigation into lord burkes death i will ask him to send me to do the interrogation skye darraghs order is a cloistered one skye said hell get nowhere with her mother superior she was aigneis obrien and shes prouder than all the damned high oneils put together she will say nothing other than sister mary penitent is mad sister mary penitent is being restrained that the nuns of st marys will pray daily for lord burkes soul eibhlins palegray eyes darkened with anger and the tone of her voice was more omalley warrior than humble nun with or without uncle seamuss aid i shall get into st marys she said and i will find the truth of it for you skye i do not understand why after all these years darragh sought to seek out and kill lord burke he did her no harm their marriage victimized him as much as it did her and he helped to restore her to her precious convent i dont understand why she suddenly felt it necessary to kill him but i shall find out skye i shall find out the two sisters embraced and suddenly skye began to weep a harsh bitter sound of such intense grief that eibhlin holding her and attempting to comfort her felt her own cheeks wet with silent tears how long they stood there swaying with their sorrow clinging to each other eibhlin never knew but suddenly daisy skyes faithful english tiring woman was running into the room and urgently begging them to follow her tis the old man m lady hes dying daisy said you must hurry for he wants you she quickly turned from them hastening out of the room skye and eibhlin swiftly composed themselves and followed daisy moving through the icycold castle corridors to the warm chamber in which rory burke the macwilliam lay eking out his last few moments upon this earth already the castle priest knelt by his side aclministering the last rites to the old man lying in his bed hung with winecolored velvet still the macwilliams rheumy eyes lit up at the sight of skye and feebly he motioned her to his side while at the same time impatiently waving the nervous cleric aside youll not be going home to innisfana now skye lass he whispered at her with an attempt at humor no rory ban ill not be going now she answered him gcntly please dont die on me old man she silently thought youre the last little bit ive left of my niall oh the bofs his son but hes a babe and we have no memories in common dont die old man stay with me the first time i saw you do you remember the first time i saw you he asked yes she said twas the feast of twelfth night and youd called all your vassals together to celebrate i was wed but a few months to dom and was already carrying his first child ah rory when you first saw me you regretted the oneil match you did she smiled at the memory of the proud young thing shed been then i did he finally admitted to her but in the end skye lass you became nialls wife and the mother of my only two heirs protect them skye dont let the english take padraics heritage by tomorrow hell be the macwilliam and you must hold his inheritance until he comes of age promise me skye lass the years were sliding away and she was a young girl again and her dying father was thrusting the entire responsibility of the omaileys of innisfana upon her slender shoulders all the ships her five younger brothers the goods and the warehouses and the peopleall her personal responsibility she had it still then too there was her second husband khalid el beys vast fortune to administer and the monies and estates of her third husband geoffrey southwood the late earl of lynmouth as well as the care of her four other children besides deirdre and padraic burke now suddenly niall was torn from her and his dying father was pressing more responsibility upon her it was far too much for one woman alone and yet she could not refuse him how could she would there ever come a time when she might be just a woman she was so tired of it all yet she couldnt let him down ill do my best rory she said wearily ill do my best he smiled up at her trusting and satisfied then closing his eyes he quietly died exhausted she walked from the room as her sister and the priest their beads magically in their hands fell to their knees and began to say the rosary daisy walked a step behind her only hurrying ahead of her mistress as they reached skyes apartments so she might open the door get me some wine skye said as she sought the relative comfort of a large chair by the fireplace sitting down she watched the low flames darting among the peatfire and wondered what she would do how long did she have before the english would come arrogantly to confiscate her infant sons holdings the old macwilliams death would be the perfect excuse for them for the wily old man had given them no cause while he lived to abuse him not that the english in ireland needed excuses to ill treat the irish no one would come to her aid when it happened and she couldnt blame them more than likely one or more of her irish neighbors would try to steal some of the burke lands too her very gentler gave them the excuse they needed a woman and child were easy prey for the cowards they all were well theyll not have it she said aloud as daisy put the goblet into her hand whats that mlady who not have what daisy was puzzled the damned dublin english daisy and our irish neighbors thats who theyll not have burke castle or burke lands those are my padraics and i intend that it remain so but what can you do about it my lady if we were in england you might appeal to the queen but england is far and london farther im going to england daisy but youve been forbidden mlady theyll clap you back in the tower of london they will you cant go daisys eyes were round with her genuine concern she had been with her mistress for seven years and she loved her dearly she also knew her well when skye made up her mind little if anything could stop her ive been banished from court daisy but not necessarily from england skye said craftily i shall go to lynmouth and from there i shall appeal to the queens secretary of state lord burghley if it is elizabeth tudors intention to aid me i shall be permitted to travel to london if not i shall still try to make my appeal from devon i cannot sit here daisy and just wait for the english to come and take padraics inheritance when southwood died i protected his son and i must protect nialls son too he can have nothing of the omalleys for though i bear the title and the responsibilities of the omalley it all belongs to my brothers and their heirs if i cannot save burke castle and its lands for its rightful heir then my poor padraic will be landless and nameless the ghosts of a hundred generations of burkes would haunt me into eternity if i let that happen daisy when will you go neither daisy nor her mistress had heard the door open and close but eibhlin now stood within the room now skye said i cannot lose a minute sister the word will be in dublin quickly enough that rory burke is dead i cannot even stay long enough to bury him but he most of all would understand my haste eibhlin nodded then ill be on my way to st marys convent to learn what i can of nialls death uncle seamus would approve i know who will you leave in charge here connor fitzburke skye replied nialls bastard brother is that wise skye connor is the most loyal man i know eibhlin he is a simple and good fellow without ambition it would not occur to connor to usurp padraics inheritance he will protect the children and their inheritance with his own life i cant take the children with me i must travel too quickly listening daisy winced and then wondered why she even bothered her bottom had been beaten to leather by now in mistress skyes service one more midnight ride wasnt going to kill her she never doubted that she would travel with her mistress after all no one else could do her ladys hair for court the way she could and daisy did not doubt that theyd be back at court nor did anyone else know the correct jewelry that went with each magnificent gown no she would be riding out with her mistress before the dawn even considered breaking daisy the tiring woman looked up smiling within the hour my lady she asked fully knowing the answer skye nodded smiling back aye daisy just when i thought that our adventures were over were off again daisy couldnt resist a mischievous grin i cant say i mind mlady it was getting a bit quiet for me around here god ha mercy eibhlin cried shes surely become one of us and not a bad thing either skye replied as daisy hurried off a tiring woman who can keep up with me on a horse is a valuable asset sister then she sobered will you see to the servants for me eibhlin i will need time to gather my wits before i speak to connor ill see to it was the quick reply and then skye found herself alone once more she rose and walked over to the windows to look down across the darkened countryside a waning moon cast its pale weak light across the soft shadowed hills somehow she thought it should have been a wild and stormy night that rory burke took his leave of this earth not this calm and windless time for all of irelands rich mystical heritage there hadnt been a sign or sound of the ghostly death coach come to take rory burkes soul away neither had there been the faintest wail of a banshee she pushed the casement open and heard the frantic scream of a rabbit as a hunting owl found his prey and then all was silent again life went on she noted no matter the changes life went on skye omalley sighed deeply there was no more time for mourning part england chapter it was the strong sense of family that the omalleys possessed that brought seamus cmalley to his niece before her hurried departure for england in his fine stone bishops house a few miles down the road from burke castle he had awakened suddenly in the middle of the night and known that she needed him the old man had gotten up from his warm bed dressed himself and ridden off up the hill to aid her seamus omalley agreed with his nieces assessment of the situation she had to go to england for the tudor wenchs help the bishop was a realist he didnt like the english but they held the whip hand he suggested that the news of the macwilliams death be kept secret that he be buried surreptitiously it was easy enough to do for the entire castle still slept and the guards on the walls couldnt see what went on inside the building with the aid of the family priest and rory burkes personal servant the body was placed in the family crypt the final mass was said in the early dawn after skye had ridden off under cover of darkness then seamus took up residence in burke castle and in league with the priest the servant and connor fitzburke conspired to keep the rest of ireland from learning of rory burkes death while skye hurried to gain english aid before little padraic burkes inheritance was stolen the lady of the castle said to be keeping a vigil for the ailing macwilliam was in truth galloping across ireland to waterford harbor where several of her ships were presently berthed the need for haste was so imperative that skye and daisy rode eighteen hours a day stopping only to change horses to eat a hot meal and to rest a few hours daily they stayed only with trusted friends sleeping in the chilly lofts of their barns during the daylight hours to avoid curious eyes and more curious questions even the most loyal servants gossiped at waterford skye took passage upon her stepmothers vessel the banrigh aceo queen of the mist no sooner had the ship cleared the harbor than she commanded the captain kelly set a course for lundy island then she disappeared into the masters cabin with her tiring woman daisy sighed with relief at feeling the swell of the open sea and the chill latewinter wind that filled the sails every mile we galloped i thought sure the dublin english would be after us my lady skye laughed relieved herself she always felt vulnerable upon the land but upon the sea none was her equal daisy you speak as if you were irish yourself she teased her tiring woman have you been with me so long that youre beginning to feel irish im english all right mlady but im devon english and thats a whole lot better than being dublin english in devon were kind people but those dublin english are wolves of the worst sort skye nodded in agreement and then said weve a good strong breeze behind us with luck well make lundy in two days time hell be glad to see you daisy remarked quiedy understanding her ladys need like most trusted servants she knew all the intimate details of her mistresss life they had been together a long time and if skye had grown more beautiful with the years daisy had changed not a whit small and applecheeked her soft brown eyes were loving of skye and watchful of others she was no beauty and never had been being as freckled as a thrushs egg but her gaptoothed smile was warm and merry i have to see him skye replied he is the only friend i have left daisy besides robert small and robbie is at sea he is not expected back for at least another month i must talk with adam she curled up on the large masters bed drawing a down coverlet over her gods bones daisy but im tired take the trundle and get some sleep yourself girl weve ridden hard these past three days daisy needed little urging to pull the trundle from beneath the bed unbind her soft brown hair lie down and fall quickly asleep but her mistress for all her exhaustion lay awake and thinking while daisy snored making gentle little blowing noises skye thought back over the last few years and of how she had met adam de marisco the lord of lundy island skyes third husband geoffrey southwood the earl of lynmouth had died in a spring epidemic along with their younger son their older son robin had been put in the custody of the queens favorite robert dudley the earl of leicester dudley however had used his office to rape skye and when she had complained to the queen elizabeth had bluntly told her that if she made dudley happy then that was that outraged skye had decided to wage her own private war on elizabeth tudor to pirate the ships and the cargoes that england needed so badly to enrich its coffers she had enlisted for a share of the profits the pirate lord of lundy island adam de marisco had fallen in love with her but believing that she could never fall in love with him he had setded for being her friend she had for a brief time been his mistress when after her marriage to niall burke she had been arrested by elizabeth tudor for piracy it was adam de marisco who had come up with the plan to free her from the tower she knew despite his denials that he still loved her perhaps now it was unfair of her to seek him out although she frequendy wrote to him it had been well over a year since they had met and so much had happened during their separation but he would understand why she came she did need him so much she needed to hear his deep booming voice calling her little girl to feel his lean hardness against her if only she might love him the way he had always loved herbut no it was better that she didnt she had been widowed four times she was bad luck to the men who wed her i will never marry again she said drowsily to herself she had not realized how tired she actually was padraics birth followed by nialls murder the macwilliams death her breakneck race across ireland to the sea it had all taken its toll she fell into a deep sleep her last thoughts were of eibhlin and whether she had breached the walls of st marys eibhlin had and now stood quietly before the reverend mother aidan born aigneis obrien the reverend mother was a short plump woman with a plain expressionless face it is very good of you to see me reverend mother she said smoothly she could see that she was not very welcome at st marys we could scarcely refuse our lord bishop was the icy reply reverend mother aidans smooth white hands adorned with her plain gold wedding band and the more ornate ring of her office moved restlessly in her lap you know why i am here i do but i do not understand it my sister lord burkes death was admittedly a terrible tragedy but your investigation cannot bring him back her hands clutched at each other in an effort to still themselves good eibhlin thought shes nervous i wonder what it is she hides the bishop wishes to know why sister mary penitent lured lord burke to this convent to murder him reverend mother eibhlin said provocatively she did not lure him came the quick reply dear heaven my sister you make sister mary penitent sound like a loose woman reverend mother aidan flushed beet red at the boldness of her own words perhaps lure is not a good word reverend mother nonetheless she brought him here under false pretenses eibhlin shifted her weight from one foot to the other she was tired having traveled all night that has not been proven the denial had a hollow ring it has the bishop has in his possession the message that sister mary penitent sent to lord burke in it she declared that she was dying that she wished to make her peace with him before she returned to god reverend mother be sensible eibhlin said with far more patience than she was feeling lord burke had not seen sister mary penitent since the day she left burke castle to return here he wanted their marriage no more than she did if she was injured by the union then so was he he held no grudge obviously she did else she would not have killed him that is not madness that is revenge she is mad my sister came the reverend mothers shaky voice and what is worse she is cursed i am not sure that this convent is not cursed as well the superior was pale now and her breath came in shallow pants ah eibhlin thought here is something new please explain yourself reverend mother the bishop is most interested and so am i sit down sit down my sister the reverend mother finally invited eibhlin who willingly complied when both women were settled the convents superior began her story from girlhood sister mary penitent was always more devout than the others her devotion almost bordered on the hysterical still she was obedient and gentle a perfect daughter of the church when she returned to us after her marriage was annulled we received her joyfully and although more nervous than she had been in the past she seemed to readjust quickly to our simple convent life there was nothing out of the ordinary here until several months ago when sister mary claire came to us she seemed to single out sister mary penitent from among us and was with her at every opportunity suddenly the poor girl was jumping at every sound and weeping at the slightest provocation we tried to learn what was troubling her but she claimed it was nothing after lord burkes murder sister mary claire disappeared and we have not seen or heard of her since we fear that poor sister mary penitent has has killed her also though why we do not know may god have mercy upon both their souls reverend mother aidan sought the comfort of her beads this sister mary claire reverend mother where did she come from surely you did not allow a stranger into your house eibhlins instincts were already alert she claimed to have come from our sister house at ballycarrick which was destroyed several months ago by the english we did not know that any of our sisters there had survived for it was said they barricaded themselves within their church and that the english put it to torch killing them all sister mary claire claimed that she was in the nearby village nursing an old woman when the english came she said the people hid her until she could reach us it was not unlikely my sister it has happened a hundred times in ireland this year eibhlins heartbeat had increased in tempo as the convents head spoke sister mary claire it couldnt be it couldnt be yet it was the sort of foul trick that dom oflahertys sister claire would involve herself in for sweet revenges sake tell me reverend mother what did this sister mary claire look like can you describe her to me she had blue eyes a fait complexion and blond hair came the reply blond hair reverend mother eibhlin was growing more sure she said she had not yet taken her final vows that she had a year to go before that holy day claire oflaherty it simply had to be claire oflaherty reaching out once more with her evil hand to strike at skye and niall reverend mother i must now speak with sister mary penitent i have no other choice eibhlin said urgently the mother superior sighed resignedly and reached for the small silver bell by her hand to the nun who answered its call she said please take sister eibhlin the bishops representative to sister mary penitents cell eibhlin rose and followed the obedient nun from the reverend mothers closet and through the halls of the convent her guide finally stopped before a simple cell and said in there my sister eibhlin carefully lifted the dark linen covering that hung across the doorway and moved quietly into the plain tiny room it was no different than the cells within her own convent whitewashed walls with no decoration other than a crucifix and no furniture other than a simple pallet bed set on the floor kneeling now before the cross was darragh oneil deep in prayer eibhlin waited politely for a few moments and then spoke softly sister mary penitent i am sister eibhlin the bishops representative i have come to speak with you on the matter of lord burkes death at first eibhlin thought that darragh did not hear her but then the kneeling woman crossed herself and rose from her prayers eibhlin had never seen darragh oneil before she looked nothing like her aunt who was the superior at eibhlins island convent of st brides ethna oneil was a beautiful and serene woman but her nieces face was pinched and tortured she was clearly suffering and putting an arm about her eibhlin helped to seat her upon the pallet bed joining her there she looked again upon the womans face and knew that darragh was sane for the moment but how long she would remain sane she could not tell she did know that she must act quickly if she was to learn the truth sister mary penitent she repeated softly i am sister eibhlin the bishops representative youre an omalley came the dull despairing reply and his grace the bishop is another omalley have you come to wreak your vengeance upon me looking at this poor creature so obviously enslaved by her fears eibhlin suddenly felt sorry for darragh oneil it is not our place to punish you my sister she said only god truly knows what is in your heart and soul but the bishop must know why you have done this terrible deed why did you kill lord burke sister mary penitent why did you throw his body into the sea darragh oneil lifted her eyes to meet those of eibhlin omalley the paleblue eyes were filled with pain and guilt and totally lacking hope i did not want to kill him she said slowly but sister mary claire told me that if i did not he would draw me once again into carnal bondage into his lustful power i had to kill him if i had not he would have taken me back she said it darraghs voice had now risen to a frightened pitch but why would you believe such a thing my sister eibhlin gently inquired you had neither seen nor communicated with lord burke since the day you left burke castle for most of your marriage you did not cohabit as a man and wife do why did you believe the slanders of this strange woman whom you barely knew she knew the truth darragh oneil declared she came from the convent at ballycarrick lord burke managed those lands for a royal ward and twas known that he was a bold lustful man unable to keep his hands from any woman who took his fancy why sister mary claire told me that he even raped two novices of her convent raped and bewitched them so totally the mother superior at ballycarrick was forced to drive the two poor damned souls from her convent for lord burke had roused their baser instincts so uncontrollably that they did terrible and shameful things to themselves and each other in plain sight of their gentle sisters it was wicked as she left the convent one of the two women shouted that lord burke had developed a taste for nuns that his first wife was a nun that he had told her he intended reclaiming her and making her his leman i could not let him do that to me i could not surely you a woman called to god as i was also called understand that eibhlin was frankly curious as to what else claire oflaherty had told poor darragh to rouse her enough to commit murder and so she asked her darraghs weak blue eyes grew round and she lowered her voice it was not so much the telling she said she showed me several times she came to my cell in darkest night and she showed me what lord burke had done to those two novices what he would do to me she sucked and bit my poor breasts until they were sore and she put her long fingers inside of me pushing them back and forth just like he used to put his big weapon within me when i was forced to be his wife god how i hated it when he climbed atop me i couldnt let him do that to me again not again she shuddered her revulsion darragh was trembling now and eibhlin angry as she was hid her anger for fear of frightening the unfortunate creature any further how could you believe her sister mary penitent she asked lord burke has a beautiful wife and two fine children why would he want other women in the time in which you lived at burke castle did he ever mistreat the servant women or the peasants he has never been a man to abuse women what made you believe the woman who called herself sister mary claire lord burkes wife is dead darragh said sister mary claire told me that skye omalley is dead in childbirth my sister is very much alive eibhlin replied darragh shook her head in the negative no she said firmly skye omalley is dead and lord burke was a wicked and lustful man i could not let him force me back into carnal bondage i could not darragh oneil was quickly sliding away again into her mindless and mad world why did you throw his body into the sea eibhlin asked quickly what has happened to sister mary claire please tell me for a brief moment darraghs reason returned pricked by the urgency in eibhlins voice we lay his body on the beach for the incoming tide there was so much blood so much blood the sea was lapping at his feet the last time i turned to look at him hell not come back to get me now that wicked lustful man sister mary claire persisted eibhlin is she not still here was the reply we returned from the beach together she was my friend darraghs eyes grew vacant again and she arose from the bed knelt before the crucifix upon the wall her rosary clutched tightly in her hands i must pray that the devil will not be too harsh on lord burke she said in a suddenly prim voice it is my duty to pray for him despite his many sins eibhlin could see that she had lost the unfortunate womans attention she knew now what she needed to know the halfmad darragh oneil had been used by the vengeful claire oflaherty to murder niall burke it was a pity that niall hadnt killed the woman himself the last time they had locked horns in london he had had the queens blessing to dispose of her but instead he had simply driven her from the city and he had supposed from his life it had never occurred to niall for he was simply not that kind of man that claire would seek to harm him further claire oflaherty eibhlin arose from the pallet bed where she had been sitting with darragh oneil and walked from the tiny cell claire oflaherty skyes sisterinlaw from her first marriage whose incestuous relationship with her brother dom had driven skye to leave her husband claire oflaherty she was the most evil the most wicked the most venal woman eibhlin had ever known if the devil had truly fathered a daughter then claire oflaherty was that daughter mlady daisy shook skyes shoulder firmly mlady you will have to awaken slowly skye opened her marvelous bluegreen eyes and turning over onto her back gazed up at her servant how long have i slept almost a full two days mlady and captain kelly says well be at lundy shortly before sunset i thought you might want to freshen yourself looking down at her travelstained garments skye grimaced the edges of her doubledlegged skirt and her sturdy woollen hose were filthy how could her hose be so dirty when she wore boots over them she shook her head the boots she noted stood cleaned by her bed she swung her legs over the edge of the bed and stood up her silk shirt was stained beneath the arms and her doublet was wrinkled oh daisy i am a disaster she said shaking her head daisy chuckled a bath will fix you right up mlady they loaded an extra keg of water aboard for you in waterford and its heating in the galley right this minute captain kelly understands your peculiarities ill have a man bring the water in along with a small tub mlady get me something to eat too daisy im famished skyes stomach rumbled in confirmation of this statement while daisy saw to her meal and her bath skye walked outside and around the deck greeting her men as she went the breeze was still brisk and fresh and clean with the first early days of spring straining her eyes she could just begin to make out the far dark rock that was lundy island in less than two hours she would be there and he would comfort her as he had so many times before skye returned to the masters cabin of the ship where a seaman was just exiting after having delivered the small oak tub and the hot water skye stripped off her grimy garments handing them to daisy as she did so completely nude she stepped into the little tub and sat down ahhh she breathed pleased that is so good daisy i didnt feel my aches until just now reaching out she picked up the small cake of rosescented soap that daisy had left on the floor by the tub and began to lather it between her hands daisy moved in behind her mistress pinning her marvelous dark hair atop her head then taking the soap from skye she briskly washed her back and commanded her to stand so she might wash her buttocks and long legs quickly she rinsed skye commenting its too chilly in this cabin for you to remain for a soak mlady we cant have you getting sick now can we the tiring woman reached for the large rough towel upon the bed and wrapped it about skye as she stepped from the tub swiftly daisy rubbed her down bringing a rosy flush of color to skyes gardenia skin and then said get back into that bed mlady until youre good and warm again ive got nutbrown ale fresh bread and some fine cheese for you to feast upon skye settled herself and began hungrily to eat daisys simple but g offerings well im clean but ill have to get back into those filthy clothes of mine worse luck daisy smiled i had a feeling that youd not reach devon without a stop at lundy i did the cabin boy is brushing the mud from your skirt and your hose and ive a clean shirt for you in my saddlebags along with some fresh undergarments skye flashed her tiring woman and old friend a grateful look how well the faithful daisy knew her when she had finished eating and brushed the crumbs from captain kellys bed she arose again and began to dress the clean silk underthings and creamcolored shirt felt good against her skin daisy handed her first the finely knit dark green woollen hose and then her matching doublelegged skirt amazingly they were clean now and quite restored to respectability daisy helped her lady back into her kneehigh boots while skye fastened a wide leather belt about her tiny waist the belts buckle was a greenish bronze oval inlaid with black and gold enamel in a celtic design skye sat again upon the bed while daisy brushed her long black hair out freeing it of its sleep tangles then she pulled it back and twisted it into one long plump braid which she fastened with a bit of dark wool a quick knock upon the door followed by skyes permission to enter brought captain kelly into the cabin he was the youngest of her captains a man with brightred hair and warm brown eyes he was slender and not a great deal taller than skye but he had a quick mind and was a daring seaman were entering lundy harbor mlady have you any instructions for me while youre ashore i want you to go on immediately to lynmouth she said daisy will stay with you please remain at lynmouth until i advise you further skye turned to daisy see that the castle is made ready for my arrival i will come the day after tomorrow send to wren court for dame cecily and my daughter willow i will want to see them both ill wait till youre safely ashore mlady and i know that youve made contact with lord de marisco captain kelly said macguire would keelhaul me from here all the way to the giants causeway if i didnt macguires behaving like an old woman these days skye grumbled but she couldnt help but be pleased that sean macguire the senior captain of her fleet yet pulled that kind of weight with the other men macguire was her voice on many occasions and she valued him highly are you sure you dont want me to go with you daisy asked no daisy ill be fine lundy is no place for a respectable girl such as yourself captain kelly chuckled nay he said in a happy voice there is not a respectable lass on the island praise god why kelly skye teased im surprised at you well im not daisy snapped he has the look of a lecher about him mistress daisy kelly protested quickly contrite skye her glance moving swiftly between the two suddenly realized that bran kelly cared what daisy thought and daisy obviously cared for the handsome young man now daisy she soothed a sailor without a true love is apt to have a roving eye and so far ive not heard that captain kellys pledged his heart to any lass and none is apt to accept him if he continues so fickle in his affections daisy warned ominously skye hid a little smile and said daisy take my saddlebags on deck please i shall be out shortly daisy bobbed a curtsey to skye then tossed her head in a snub toward the captain and hurried from the cabin as bran kelly looked longingly after her seduce her skye said warningly and youll answer to me kelly shes no lightskirt and she is under my protection as well as being very dear to me im thinking of settling down kelly replied im past thirty now and its time when you make up your mind in the matter ill give you permission to court her if it pleases her until then keep your codpiece tightly fastened kelly bran kelly looked into the serious blue eyes of the omalley of innisfana his overlord and his mistress and nodded blushingly id best go topside he said and see to the landing lundy harbor is tricky as you well know she smiled at him he understood ill come with you and thanks for the use of your quarters this trip together they went out onto the deck and while captain kelly saw to the lowering of the ships anchor skye gazed upon lundy it had been over a year since she had seen it the great granite cliffs rising above the sea the lighthouse at one end of the island de mariscos halfruined castle before her she sighed sadly she had never again expected to see lundy or to lean so shamelessly upon adam de marisco but dear god she needed someone to comfort her and only adam would understand that need the boats ready to lower mlady kelly advised her large ships such as the banrigh aceo anchored in lundy bay away from lundys dangerous cliffs and rockstrewn shore my thanks kelly for a good trip she called up to him as she climbed into the small boat your saddlebag mlady said daisy leaning over the rail and proffering it to her mistress i wont be needing it now daisy skye replied with a quick smile and then she commanded the lone sailor who would row her lets away the cockle seemed to skim just atop the bobbing waves as it was rowed swiftly into the shore and the long stone quay that served de marisco as a landing place the sun bright scarlet with streamers of gold and purple was beginning to sink into the dark western sea as they reached their destination from the grog shop in the bottom of the old castle a giant figure emerged and strode down the quay toward them skye scrambled from the boat and then she began to move quickly forward adam de marisco his unruly shock of tousled dark hair blowing in the light breeze hurried toward her though he had spent his youth at both the tudor and the french courts he was no elegant gallant as his thighhigh leather boots his doeskin jerkin with the horn buttons and his opennecked silk shirt showed despite the chill he wore no cloak adam she called running adam little girl is it really you his deep voice boomed across the quiet evening and then he was sweeping her into his bearlike embrace burying his face for a long moment into the scented softness of her neck his blue eyes warm with longing oh adam she breathed feeling his familiar bulk and knowing with certainty now that everything would be all right im sorry about niall little girl she pulled away from him and looked up into his handsome face you knew how a ship put in here several days ago and its captain told me they had met with an omalley ship and learned the news from them he put an arm about her and together they began to walk down the stone quay to his castle was the babe you were carrying a boy aye praise god she answered then at least the old macwilliam has his heir skye they entered the lower level of the castle and walked through the rather dirty and disreputable tavern there skye nodding to those she knew de mariscos evillooking retainers and the everpresent glynnis whose ample blowsy charms were well known by the men who passed through lundy together they mounted the stairs to de mariscos tworoom apartment in the one remaining whole tower of the castle safely inside the big antechamber with its blazing fireplace skye turned to adam de marisco and said the macwilliam is dead my infant son padraic is now heir to the burke lands he drew a deep breath its not public knowledge yet is it not yet the dublin english have had their eyes on the burke lands for some time now adam but as long as the old man and niall were alive they knew they had not a chance we were fortunate in that elizabeth tudor needed my omalley ships and dared not to offend me i intend to send word from lynmouth to lord burghley that i must see him if i am to protect my burke sons inheritance from predators i must have the queens blessing each day englands fleet grows larger and stronger if i and my ships are no longer of use to the queen she will divide the burke lands among her courtiers without another thought and padraic will be landless and nameless i cant let that happen adam i cant he moved over to the oak sideboard and poured them each some rich sweet wine the crimson liquid cascading gracefully into heavy carved silver goblets turning he handed her a goblet and said so little girl youre in the same defenseless position you were three years ago when geoffrey died now however elizabeth tudor has an old score to settle with you and you are even more vulnerable with two more babes to support she nodded and her sapphire eyes filled with tears which spilled uncontrolled from beneath her black lashes onto her pale cheeks damn she whispered i am prone to weeping these days i dont know whats the matter with me adam he snorted impatiently skye my sweet sweet skye you are human is what is the matter with you for all your great strength you are human in the last ten years you have buried four husbands three of whom you loved dearly you have borne seven children altogether one of whom you lost in a terrible epidemic you have fought the queen of england and won despite your imprisonment in the tower all these things cannot help but have taken their toll on you now you must once more unprotected and alone fight for your children you wonder why you weep easily my darling i dont i stand in awe of you little girl i am amazed you have not gone mad from it all she looked up at him the tears still spilling down her face i need you adam she said low i have no right to ask it but i need you so very much i am here for you skye he said quietly i have always been here for you and i always will be tenderly he looked down at her and then tipped her face upward to his bending he gently brushed her mouth with his youre tired and youre worn little girl shall i comfort you as i once did it seems so long ago sweet skye that we gave of ourselves to each other oh adam what kind of woman am i she whispered low my husband is dead but a monthand i loved niall dear heaven how i loved him still i need you he could see that she was trembling with emotion and with pure exhaustion she was not really ready to make love with him and he thought she might never be ready again he loved her he had always loved her but adam de marisco was a realist once she had asked him to marry her but as desperately as he had wanted her he had to refuse for he knew that he had neither the power nor the great name that he felt skye omalley deserved and needed reaching out he lifted her into his strong arms and carried her into his bedroom as he carefully deposited her upon his huge bed he said i want you to get some sleep little girl afterward we will discuss our needs but first you will rest and calm yourself he drew the fur coverlet over her she nodded strangely grateful to him but sure she would not sleep he watched over her as she finally did wanting her with every ounce of his being the wine in his goblet grew less and he rose to refill it returning quickly to his post adam de marisco was a handsome man standing six feet six inches tall with a body proportioned to match his black hair was the color of a ravens wing and his beard once full was now barbered as elegantly and neatly as any court dandys the round of his mustache giving his mouth a very sensuous appearance he had heavy black eyebrows and thick lashes that tangled themselves over his heavylidded smoky blue eyes his aristocratic nose long and narrow at the nostrils was a gift from his norman ancestors his wine now finished he placed the goblet on a nearby table and fully clothed lay down next to her sometime in the night she whimpered with a bad dream and he half woke to draw her into the safety of his arms sliding his big body beneath the coverlet murmuring comfort in her ear until she quieted and slept peacefully again once more he slid into sleep himself the scent of her damask rose perfume in his nose clinging to his silk shirt bringing back a hundred memories that for him were as clear as when they had happened the knowledge that he was holding her again gave him a wonderful comfort and he slept heavily contentedly adam de marisco dreamed an incredible dream he dreamed that he was nude and being attacked by a flock of brightly colored tiny butterflies playfully they fluttered over his bare thighs and belly tangling themselves in the thick mat of black hair on his chest he could feel an ache of longing in his groin and with a little moan he opened his eyes the first thing he saw was skyes dark head bent over his chest and he realized that the butterflies were her lips that kissed him lovingly celtic witch he muttered yanking her up by her hair so he might see her face her beautiful blue eyes stared half shyly at him and then she said blushingly ineed you adam his breath caught in his throat she was naked her pert small breasts as beautiful as he remembered the dainty pink nipples thrusting forward she ran a teasing finger down his thigh and he realized with some shock that he was practically nude himself seeing his look she chuckled a distinctively mischievous sound and said you sleep far too heavily lord of lundy were i an enemy the castle would now be mine while you snored and made little happy noises i removed your pantaloons drawers and hose your shirt alas i could only unfasten moving her aside he sat up and took off the offending shirt youre a shameless and bold wench skye omalley he said through gritted teeth but i want to fuck you gods bones i want to fuck you she reached up pulling him back down to her and adam de marisco did what he had craved doing all night he kissed her his mouth closed fiercely over hers demanding more of her than he had ever asked he bruised her soft lips with his own her arms slid around his neck and pulled him as close to her as was humanly possible and her tongue licked at his lips he could feel the sweet small mounds of her breasts pressing against his furred chest and he groaned guiltily he had sworn to himself when he had realized that skye could never be his that he would never again make love to her but he knew tonight that that was a promise he couldnt keep she said she needed him and by god he needed her her softly taunting tongue was almost unbearable in its sweetness his lips parted and he allowed that tongue to dart within his mouth to explore tease and caress as it met with his own tongue now he took the initiative chasing her tongue back to her own mouth where he proceeded to harry and badger it with his own until she pulled her head away moaning as a great shudder raced through her beautiful body and her nipples grew rigid with her desire adam de marisco smiled as he looked down on her face she was the most marvelously sensuous woman he had ever known she gave herself totally and completely to him trusting him as no other woman had ever trusted her eyes opened and he said softly you are so lovely little girl when i contemplate all the delights that you offer me i dont know where to begin she smiled at him and lowering his great dark head he nuzzled at her breast she sighed and made a soft mmmmm of pleasure for a long moment he contemplated those beautiful breasts he had always thought that she had the loveliest little tits sweet and small rounds of honied flesh with their dainty pink nipples he gently bit at one of them while his big hands kneaded her other breast hungrily she threaded her fingers through his thick black hair one hand moving low to caress the back of his neck her touch sent a flash of heat through him and he shuddered raising his head up he rained kisses on her upturned face her slender throat soft shoulders and palpitating breasts he swept lower tonguing her navel covering her belly with scorching kisses and she blossomed beneath his loving hands and mouth ohh adam she murmured oh yes he couldnt resist a chuckle despite his own passion she was so damned honest even in her desire remember what i once told you little girl love making is a great art i will not hurry our pleasure especially as i will not allow this to happen again between us adam she tried to sit up but he gently pushed her back and caught her gaze with his i will not be your lover skye omalley and as i once told you i have neither the name nor the power to be your husband you are dearer to me than any other person on this earth and i would slay dragons for you but i will not be your lover she did not have to ask him why for she knew he loved her and she loved him but it was not the abiding love that a woman gives her husband they both knew it along with her business partner robert small he was the best friend she had in all the world and she had treated him shabbily by coming to him and asking nay practically begging that he service her as her prize stallion serviced her mares she flushed with shame at that thought and said oh adam i beg your pardon let me up i shall go from you now for i had no right to come here at all nay he gently pinioned her beneath him have you become a wanton tease sweet skye that having roused the beast in me you would now leave me he laughed softly you said you needed me little girl well now i need you and i am weary of talk talk is for the afterward his mouth made feathery movements down her body in a swift assault that caught her totally by surprise and left her breathless adam she gasped be silent my darling he answered her and then his tongue was gently seeking at the honey of her sending small love darts of pure blazing heat into her very soul his tongue was wildfire stroking at the velvet of her greatest secret rousing her to pleasures both known and unknown her beautiful body responded with the hunger of one long denied and indeed she had had no lovemaking since the fifth month of her last pregnancy she moaned as the liquid fire bathed her body as his tongue sought and found tantalized and pleasured loved and pained her in both body and soul adam de marisco took great delight in skyes response and when at last she was writhing and creamy with her passion he sat back on his haunches his great lance thrusting forward lifting the almost unconscious woman up he lowered her carefully onto his weapon as he cradled her in his arms he was gentle for she was tight with her abstinence and as he filled her she cried out her rapture together they rocked back and forth until skye shuddered violently and with a whimper went limp satisfied that she had attained her fulfillment he took his own laying her back now on his enormous bed to tower over her as he thrust deep and hard and sweet within her throbbing sheath then satisfied he withdrew from her and rolled away to catch his breath again before he drew her back into the comfort of his arms they slept for several hours awakening as the early light came through the single window in the tower bedchamber she knew that he slept no longer by the sound of his breathing and for a few long minutes she remained silent unable to speak not knowing what she might say to him he solved the problem for her saying quietly in his deep voice how can any mortal woman give such pleasure hide girl how i wish that i were the man for you skye omalley i wish you would wed with me adam for youre the strongest man i have ever known i have always felt safe with you and you know youve always told me that without a man my wealth and beauty make me vulnerable to those in power i am ashamed to have used you so but i did need you i did skye there is no wrong in a woman desiring a man but tis not reason enough for a marriage between us you know that he laughed in an effort to lighten the situation i cannot help but think that there isnt a man at elizabeths court who wouldnt have sold his soul to be in my boots last night he raised himself up on an elbow and looked down at her you do understand however why i will not seriously entertain your proposal i understand adam we are friends he smiled down at her and i should hate you to meet a man you could really love and turn him away because of mistaken loyalty to me there will be no one else she said firmly gods bones adam i have outlived four husbands in fifteen years dom of course was no loss the pig khalid however and geoffrey and niall are another matter i loved them adam and i cannot go through the death of another man that i love i am beginning to believe that i am bad luck for the men that love me i think i have had enough of husbands my six children are enough to satisfy any woman from now on i shall be free free to run my own life and to choose my own companions and your lovers he said quietly perhaps she said slowly and then she blushed i find that i am not a woman to do without a man is that so awful adam you could do without a man if you chose little girl he said last night was different you needed to be with a friend with someone who loves you with someone who could comfort you ah adam she teased him no one has ever comforted me better than you their eyes met and both remembered their first encounter when he had offered her his help badly needed if she would spend one night in his bed she had been in pain then too suffering over the loss of geoffrey and the loss of their youngest son johnny when she had broken down and wept in his arms he had made passionate love to her let me comfort you little girl he had said since then it had been a joke between them and now both laughed with the same memory how long will you be at lynmouth he asked her when their laughter had died that will depend on cecil first i must send a message to him and then i must await his decision as to whether i am allowed to go to court so i may petition the queen for padraics lands and if you are not allowed back at court skye then i petition the queen from lynmouth robbie will be back soon and he can speak for me if i am forbidden the queens presence he nodded where are your children now not all together i hope nay adam i am too wise for that my oldest son ewan oflaherty is on his lands at ballyhennessey my uncle has sent my eldest brother michael to oversee ewan he is thirteen now almost a man in three years we will celebrate his marriage to gwyneth southwood geoffreys daughter by his first wife ewans younger brother murrough oflaherty is with the earl of lincolns household he will need influential contacts as he is landless i can give him wealth but i cant give him lands those he must gain himself adam willow is with dame cecily small my eldest daughter does not like ireland i think it must be her fathers blood in her that makes her prefer a slightly milder climate so i allowed her to winter with dame cecily as robbie has been away they are good company for each other and dame cecily is teaching her all the housewifely arts thank god robbie and his sister adopted her formally and gave her their name as well as made her their heiress having a spanish father could harm her socially and if it were known that willows father was once the great whoremaster of algiers skye shuddered as much as i loved khalid his daughter shall never know that then she was forced to chuckle it would amuse khalid to know his offspring is a most proper little english girl but without robert smalls name to protect her she would be lost most people assume she is actually related to robbie my little earl of lynmouth is page at court you see adam i am forbidden court but my robin is elizabeths favorite pet he grows more like geoffrey every day i am told she smiled softly they called geoffrey the angel earl our son robin is known at court as the cherub how proud geoffrey would be of him she said my burke children are safe in their castle no cecil cannot use my children against me only robin is readily available to him and as one of englands premier noblemen he is inviolate besides cecil is too softhearted to war with children thank god a soft heart is the curse of an honorable man adam and lord burghley is an honorable man for all he is elizabeth tudors creature you havent forgiven her have you skye no adam i will never forgive her for what she did to me nor will i forgive her the time she stole from niall and me especially now that niall is is dead skye sweet skye he took her in his arms and held her against his hard chest no more wars with bess tudor little girl promise he was suddenly afraid for her i promise you adam i am a wiser woman than she who pirated the queens ships from right under her nose the fart that elizabeth could never prove it was victory enough we were lucky that time skye he admonished her gently she chuckled throatily i only regret the loss of the emeralds she said and he laughed with her then she pulled away from him dammit adam i am ravenous youre a poor host not to feed me i thought you had all you wanted from me little girl he teased her ducking the pillow she threw at him ive not had a decent meal in several days does glynnis cook tis one of her best talents he remarked waggling his heavy black eyebrows at her skye laughed as de marisco continued ill have her fetch us something now that youre obviously up and determined to be on your way skye sobered aye adam i have to go my messenger must be off to cecil this morning within the hour glynnis made her way from the taproom below to the tower antechamber her sturdy legs bowed under the weight of the tray that she carried ive brought a bit of everything she said with a friendly grin yell not go hungry this day mlady glynnis then bobbed a curtsey and left them to contemplate the bounty that she had prepared for them there were two steaming bowls of oat porridge smothered in stewed pears a covered silver dish badly tarnished of eggs poached in heavy cream dry spanish wine and dill a platter of pink country ham sliced thickly a hot loaf of wheat bread wrapped in a linen napkin to keep it warm sturdy stoneware crocks of sweet butter and thick honey a silver pitcher of brown ale completed their repast gods bones skye exclaimed delighted with the meal glynnis can have a job in my kitchens anytime adam then she took up a simple wooden trencher and filled it up the porridge was quickly eaten the eggs and ham devoured and skye sitting back in her chair wrapped in de mariscos huge silk shirt her long legs stretched out quaffed down half a goblet of brown ale and then reached for the loaf of bread carefully she sliced herself a piece and spreading it first with butter and then with honey she proceeded to eat it down adam no mean trencherman himself watched her with fond amusement and indulgence he had always admired her fine appetite women who picked at their food believing it good manners annoyed him skye enjoyed good cooking and ate as if she did ill sail you to lynmouth myself he said and she nodded her mouth still full do you want me to stay with you until you hear from cecil she swallowed no better cecil not be reminded of your existence i may need to run and lundys a safe port for me always little girl he agreed with a smile that warmed her to her toes they left lundy as the sun was beginning to creep over the horizon and with a fresh southwest breeze they were easily and quickly at lynmouth he brought his small boat into the little cove beneath the castles cliffs where a hidden cave had served the earls of lynmouth as an escape hatch for several centuries he would not stay the wind will die by midday and ill be becalmed here if i dont go now sweet skye i dont particularly relish rowing home eleven miles he pulled her roughly into his arms and kissed her quickly tenderly behave yourself little girl if you need me use the old signals ill have a boy on watch round the clock then while she watched easy tears pricking at her eyelids he sailed away from the landing out into the cove and from there to the beckoning blue sea she brushed the wetness from her eyes and mounting the worn stone steps within the cave hurried unseen upward into lynmouth castle emerging from the narrow passage of the stairway into a corridor in the oldest part of the castle she gained her own apartments good morning mlady daisy chirped cheerfully as she came through the doors as luck would have it i saw lord de mariscos little boat as it was sailing into the cove shall i get you something to eat no skye replied i have already eaten is wat mason here daisy aye mlady fetch him at once daisy hes to ride to whitehall with a message for lord burghley lord burghley is here in devon mlady at sir richard de grenvilles home he is skye was surprised the old spider rarely leaves court i wonder what has brought him down here the news is of rebellion mlady daisy said her voice bright with importance ever since last year when the queen of scots fled to england there have been murmurings there is fear of a rebellion in the north among the marcher lords they say those who would revolt would bring back the old religion begging your pardon mlady its all right daisy i was born a roman catholic and i see no reason to change my ways but i also see no reason to involve myself in a damned rebellion over religion religion should be a personal and private thing between a soul and god the northern lords are fools if they think that theyll dislodge elizabeth tudor and replace her with her cousin mary stewart but then they dont know harry tudors daughter as well as i know her theyll lose everything the idiots and the church wont restore what theyve lost better to keep ones faith and ones possessions separate now go get wat mason hell have to go to de grenvilles house with my message daisy hurried from the room and skye sat down at her small writing table to pen her note to the queens secretary of state and most powerful adherent william cecil lord burghley she had no doubt that the old fox would see her but whether he would take her part was another thing still cecil didnt need any more trouble in ireland especially with rebellion brewing in england thank god for mary stewart skye thought ive never laid eyes on her nor she me but she has done me a good turn just by being in england for the malcontents to rally about the note skye wrote was a brief one greeting lord burghley and saying that the countess of lynmouth would like an audience with him before his departure for court she would either go to him or be pleased to entertain him at lynmouth would he kindly return his answer with her groom daisy returned with wat mason who knelt in respectful greeting to his mistress skye sealed the message with her heavy gold signet ring the omalley sea dragons pressing themselves into the hot green wax looking up she handed the letter to wat and said take this to lord burghley the queens secretary of state and lord treasurer he is at sir richard de grenvilles home deliver it into his hands only and then wait for his reply do you understand me wat you will give my message to no one but william cecil himself aye mlady i understands wat rose from his knees and hurried from the room and now skye thought the game begins to her surprise however she did not have to wait long wat was back at lynmouth by days end bringing with him a reply from william cecil eagerly skye tore the message open and read then she smiled with satisfaction and relief cecil would come to her he would arrive at lynmouth in two days time and stay the night before returning to london she wondered what he would want in return from her his help would not come cheaply but padraics inheritance and name must be saved mlady daisy flew into the room theyre here skye looked up startled and for a moment unable to think what daisy could possibly mean then before she could gather her thoughts her small daughter willow ran into the room mama willow threw herself enthusiastically into skyes arms skyes arms closed about her daughter and she hugged her hungrily ah my little love how i have missed you she said and suddenly she was weeping happy tears at the sight of khalids daughter so very much like him with his ambergold eyes fringed in long thick dark lashes and her black hair will you be here for my birthday mama willow squirmed from skyes arms and fixed her with a serious gaze is it april already skye pretended to consider it oh mama of course it is april and my birthday is in five more days i shall be nine so you shall willow i shall soon have to find a husband for you i shall find my own husband thank you willow replied pertly and skye was reminded of herself willow might look like her father but she was her mothers daughter too you shall only marry the man you love my darling skye promised her oldest daughter you spoil her a familiar voice snapped and skye smiled over willows head at dame cecily who was just entering the room so do you she chuckled i did not expect you in england dame cecily said settling herself in a comfortable chair by the fireplace skye sat in the chair facing the older woman and taking willow onto her lap replied i had to come i have bad news the old macwilliam is dead and without an adult heir my wee padraics inheritance is in danger lord burghley is at de grenvilles and will be here in two days time to speak with me dame cecily nodded does he know ofthe old mans death no one does skye said we buried him in secret and my uncle seamus is now in control of burke castle ive come to present my petition to the queen if burghley will allow me back at court if not i dont know what i will do perhaps dickon de grenville will speak for me and then when robbie returns next month he can help me also dame cecily sighed deeply dearest skye she said i will go to the queen for you myself if necessary then she reached out and taking skyes slender hand in her plump one said i am so very sorry about niall her honest blue eyes filled with sympathetic tears before skye might answer her however willow spoke up will you get me another father mama she asked i never knew my real papa but i did so like geoffrey and niall i dont think i shall ever marry again my love skye said four husbands are quite enough for your mama and i think i have all the children i shall ever need you have not yet seen your new brother padraic he is a fine little boy just like niall will you come home to ireland with me this summer and see him willow nodded sleepily for it had been a long day for her skye nodded to daisy who came forward saying come along mistress willow and i shall give you a good supper of toasted cheese and sweet devon cider then i shall tuck you into your own bed willow climbed from her mothers lap and taking daisys hand departed the room have you heard from robbie skye asked dame cecily aye his advance ship put into plymouth just last week the portuguese may think that they have a monopoly on the spice islands but robbie has his friends too the holds of his fleet are bulging with cloves nutmegs peppercorns and cinnamon he also told me to tell you that he has some particularly nice gemstones for you well make another small fortune with this trip skye remarked even after the queens share we will have a fat profit she smiled almost grimly its all i have left dame cecily the children and making a fortune you will love again my dear not this time skye said if i can insinuate myself back into the queens good graces i shall not need a man to protect me remember skye that it was the queen who caused you to need a husbands protection the last time dame cecily reminded skye but the queen knows that should she do to me again what she did last time i shall revenge myself on her once more as i did before even if she couldnt prove that it was me pirating her ships she knew make no hasty decisions now my child dame cecily chided wait until you have spoken with lord burghley he may be the queens man but he is a fair man for all of it aye skye replied he is an honorable man she kept that thought in her mind as she prepared the castle for lord burghleys brief visit with its young lord away at court and herself on her estates in ireland lynmouth had been like a sleeping prince its mistress back however the servants polished and scrubbed dusted and swept every corner of the castle great porcelain bowls of spring flowers began to appear in the main hall and in the bedrooms herbscented sheets and comforters appeared on the beds when william cecil and sir richard de grenville and their train arrived two afternoons later they rode slowly up the raked gravel drive admiring the wellmanicured green lawns and brightly colored gardens around the castle the moat round lynmouth had been filled in in geoffreys fathers time skye greeted her guests in the great hall noting as she came forward that all the men in the party were most admiring of her she had chosen to wear a black velvet gown its very low neckline exposing her creamy chest and the soft swelling of her small breasts her neck wisk a standing fanshaped wire collar was of silver lace as were the ribbons on her legofmutton sleeves and her underskirt about her neck was a necklace of silver and persian blue lapis her dark and luxuriant hair was tucked beneath a fetching little silver lace cap curtseying prettily she said welcome my lords welcome to lynmouth christs bones skye sir richard de grenville said you dont look any older than when we first met and i hear youve finally given the old macwilliam his longawaited heir he kissed her loudly on both cheeks and then sobered i was sorry to hear about niall he finished awkwardly it was a bad end to a good man william cecil observed good day to you madam i am happy to see you once more in england if i am in england then i cannot be fomenting rebellion in ireland skye chuckled devilishly the queens man gave a dry bark of a laugh as always lady burke we understand each other he said now how may i be of service to you may we speak in private sir he nodded dickon she said to de grenville will you lead your gentlemen into the hall and avail yourselves of the refreshments my servants have laid out i know it has been a dusty ride for you all she turned again to william cecil i have some rare burgundy in my library my lord he followed her from the great hall and down a corridor through great double oak doors into a fine booklined room with a beautiful aureole window the sun pouring through the window at that moment made the room warm and inviting skye gestured will you be seated my lord he sat himself in a large comfortable chair and gratefully accepted the silver goblet of fragrant wine that she poured him after pouring herself one skye raised her goblet the queen she said the queen he answered they both drank and then skye leaned forward and said the old macwilliam is dead and my infant son is now the new lord burke i had not received that information he answered admiring the way in which she came right to the point most women shillyshallied about things like this what was the matter with his irish spies there is nothing wrong with your intelligence from ireland mlord skye said amused reading his thoughts i had my fatherinlaw buried in secret and my uncle now holds the castle and lands for me your dublin english and my fine irish neighbors believe that rory burke lies dying and even now they wait to steal his lands that is why it is not public knowledge at this moment and that is why i have come to you without the queens blessing and protection little padraic burke will be not only landless but nameless as well must appeal to you my lord allow me to return to court so that i may plead my case with her majesty my omalley ships harry the spanish for england my fleets share their huge profits with the crown i ask nothing for myself mlord i only ask for my son the rightful heir to the burke lands and titles william cecil stared into his goblet in the north the marcher lords lumley and arundel northumberland and westmoreland were already causing difficulties because of mary stewart the queen of the damned scots he knew that because of their religion they were considering pressing her claim to the english throne god only knew that the queen had been more than lenient with the roman catholic lords elizabeth tudor preferred her own brand of catholicism to the popes but did not abuse her catholic subjects provided they were loyal to england before rome lord burghley swished the wine about in his goblet watching as the ruby liquid slid down the polished silver sides of the goblet there was going to be trouble in england before summers end if the crown did not confirm little padraic burkes place he knew that what skye feared would happen the dublin english and her equally greedy irish neighbors would swarm over burke lands fighting for the least little scrap of it the irish of course would then fight the english it didnt matter who won the angloirish lords would demand monies and men to fight the burkes and the omalleys and the queen would have to send those monies and men ireland was a bottomless pit for armies and gold william cecil decided the crown needed no more enemies or trouble in ireland at this time especially enemies who commanded a fleet of ships and were not reluctant to use them against england skyes ships patrolled the english channel and the bay of biscay for the crown taking spanish treasure galleons whose cargoes enriched elizabeths coffers they needed omalley ships which meant that they needed skyes friendship as well hmm william cecil said he had no intention of giving lady burke what she wanted cheaply and he had suddenly thought of a marvelous use for her madam i can see to it that your infant sons rights are upheld by the crown but in return the crown would exact a favor from you i have no choice skye answered him what is it you want of me there is a small independent duchy tucked just between provence and the languedoc in france it is called beaumont de jaspre the current duc has recently made overtures of friendship to the queen he has offered us trading agreements and hospitality for english trading vessels we would like to accept his offer for it will give us a safe port in the mediterranean and a valuable listening post into france the duc seeks an english wife for he has only one child a boy who rumor says is feebleminded the queen has not been able to think of whom we might send to beaumont de jaspre an untried girl would be of little use to us her mind would be apt to be filled with thoughts of love and romance you madam will have no such illusions and will do your duty by england if you will go as the ducs bride then i will personally see that your sons rights are fully protected the boy will grow up as her majestys personal ward are you mod the look on skyes face was pure shock i cannot leave ireland and england my life is here my lands my wealth my children besides have sworn to never wed again mlord i cannot lose to death another man whom i love you cannot ask this of me but she knew that he could and he did madam you have never even met the duc de beaumont de jaspre therefore you cannot love him if he departs this life it should be no matter to you he is said to be in failing health for all his desire to father children in all likelihood you will be widowed in a year or two but in the meantime england will have a listening post in frances bedchamber you are heartless sir skye cried ask anything else of me and i will gladly comply but you cannot ask this i can madam and i do the only way i will support your sons rights is if you will agree to go to beaumont de jaspre as the ducs bride his dark brown eyes looked straight at her i shall appeal directly to the queen you are forbidden court appear without the queens permission and youll return to the tower where you can do your son no good besides the queen will accept my advice in this matter an infant heir is so vulnerable madam without strong protection who stronger than the queen a grateful queen think madam skye knew that she was beaten she could refuse william cecils infamous proposal and return to ireland where she would be forced to fight off the dublin english and her irish neighbors for the next fifteen years until her son was old enough to fight himself or she could agree to become a strangers wife the idea was totally alien to her but she had no other choices still she would not give in to the crown without having certain conditions guaranteed her i want the same kind of marriage contract that i had with southwood and lord burke she said firmly what belongs to me remains mine alone i will not give over my wealth to anyone else women are hapless enough creatures as it is in this mans world but i will not be helpless as well dependent on someone else for every pennypiece i spend if the duc will not agree then nothing lord burghley not even your threats can make me go he nodded it will not be easy but if your dowry is sufficiently generous madam we should have no difficulties with the duc it is a simple enough matter to convince him that your estates are entailed to your children as for your children themselves they will remain here she nodded in answer to him it would break her heart to leave her children especially her burke babies behind but it would be safer for them padraic and deirdre must remain on their lands as a symbol to their people my uncle the bishop of connaught must be allowed to govern burke lands for my son she said agreed william cecil said old seamus omalley might be a papist but he was an honest one and a popular one he would give the crown no difficulties if they put an englishman or one of the angloirish in charge of the infant heir the regent would eventually appropriate the childs inheritance besides the safety of the burke children themselves would be guaranteed in their granduncles care my other children will remain where they are now skye said then you should have no difficulty madam in readying yourself fairly quickly i shall return to the queen tomorrow you are to follow in seven days time you will advise me of your arrival in london and i will arrange for you to come to court once more where do you intend staying i will stay at greenwood skye said lynmouth house is too large to open for one person for such a short time he smiled his frosty smile at her pleased as he always was by her sense of economy like his mistress lady burke was generous but frugal she understood that wealth was to be husbanded and increased not squandered idly he fully approved her insistence on keeping her wealth in her own hands she was an excellent manager far better than most men he knew then madam he said our business is now concluded i shall look forward to seeing you at court she showed him to the apartments where he would spend the night and then quickly hurried to her own rooms she could not believe what had just happened she had vowed never to marry again and now here she was about to be betrothed to a foreign duke and sent from england and ireland this man wanted children and she was certainly a proven breeder she shuddered how could she allow a man she did not know to touch her to make love to her the mere thought of it was repellent to her nature lord burghley had said that the duc was not in good health perhaps by the time she got there the ducs health would have deteriorated to a point where he could not fulfill his marital duties one could hope dame cecily hurried through the door demanding well will cecil support you and arrange for you to go to court to see the queen aye skye replied but the price is steep i am to leave here and journey to a small independent dukedom between provence and the languedoc where i will wed with its ruler what the older womans face looked horrified and her hand flew to her heart surely lord burghley jests with you skye he cannot ask such a cruel thing of you but he has and i must comply with his request as he knew i must when he suggested it the duchy has offered england a base on the mediterranean as well as a listening post into france and i suspect the kingdoms of italy although lord burghley did not say so the duc is supposed to be in failing health and cecil says i shall probably be home in two years or less and afterward will they use the burke children again in order to gain your aid dame cecily demanded outraged gods foot has cecil then turned pimp for the crown i dont know skye said wearily i can only hope that lord burghley will accept this sacrifice i make as payment in full i ought to give william cecil a good piece of my mind dame cecily huffed furiously i cannot imagine what he is thinking of to separate you from your children skye had to laugh dearest dearest dame cecily from the moment skye had arrived in england several years ago robert smalls plump widowed sister had taken her under her wing had been a second mother to her had loved her and willow and all of skyes children she was a grandmother to willow and robin but most of all she was a good and loyal friend do not trouble yourself with lord burghley skye gently admonished the older woman it will change nothing i will not however leave england until i have seen robbie and your burke children skye if i go back to ireland now to bid them a farewell i shall not be able to leave them and i cannot take them with me it is a long and dangerous trip i make i do not know anything about this man whom i must marry besides deirdre and padraic are both babies they will not miss me as long as uncle seamus sees that they are loved and well cared for and perhaps if this marriage works out i shall be able to send for them i must ask you to care for willow the oflaherty boys are both safe where they are now a small sob escaped her as she thought of nialls children so young and so helpless how long would it be before she saw them again padraic would not even know her he was just over two months old now deirdre however was almost sixteen months old would she remember her mother skye doubted it and the tears flowed lord burghley and his party departed lynmouth the following morning and for the next few days skye went about the business of writing her uncle her stepmother and the others necessary to the smooth running of her world of her plans to travel to beaumont de jaspre these letters went off to their destinations by the fastest of the lynmouth horses for skye wanted to hear from her family prior to her departure she had decided to travel upon an omalley ship and asked that her flagship the seagull be awaiting her by months end in the london pool she would insist that she be given a proper naval escort to avoid the danger of pirates and so she might reach her destination safely remembering the evil capitan jamil in algiers she worried about reaching beaumont de jaspre at all yet she felt she should reach the duchy easier by sea than by having to travel through france during troubled times and indeed france was in turmoil at the moment just prior to her departure for london skye received a long letter from her sister eibhlin who wrote of her visit to st marys and of what she had learned regarding the tragic death of niall burke darragh is truly mad eibhlin wrote as for the evil claire she has disappeared as mysteriously as she appeared skye crushed between her two hands the parchment upon which her sisters letter was written claire oflaherty damn your black soul to hell she whispered fiercely i swear by st patrick himself that if our paths ever cross i will kill you with my own hands having said the terrible words she felt better skye had decided to take willow to london with her in order to have more time with her eldest daughter and so willow might see her beloved halfbrother robin she had carefully explained her difficult situation to her daughter and willow had understood she was very much her mothers daughter with regard to finances and knew that without property and gold a person was helpless even with them as her mother was one was helpless to supreme authority can i not come with you mama was her only question not until i know if this marriage is to work out my love skye said i do not even know the duc by reputation willow he may turn out to be a fine gentleman whom i may learn to care for and who will be good to my children but he also might turn out to be not quite as nice in which case i would prefer that my children are safe in england and ireland do you understand i think so willow said quietly if he is not a nice man and i were with you he might use threats against me to make you do things you would not do otherwise like lord burghley god bless me dame cecily cried she is but nine and already understands the way of the world better she does skye said and then she will not be disillusioned you are correct my love then it is better i remain here with dame cecily willow said calmly much better her mother agreed at least for the present chapter exactly one week after william cecil had departed lynmouth castle for london the countess of lynmouth followed after him the great traveling coach with the southwood family crest emblazoned upon its sides lumbered along the muddy spring roads toward the capital inside however skye dame cecily willow and daisy were quite comfortable the vehicle itself was well sprung the red velvet upholstery hid suitably full horsehair and wool padding which made for comfortable seats and tucked at their feet were hot bricks wrapped in flannel which along with the coachs red fox lap robes made for luxurious warmth skye absently rubbed the soft fur remembering other and happier times when it had covered her and geoffrey the coachman and his assistant sat upon the box controlling the four strong horses that pulled the vehicle six armed outriders preceded the coach and six rode behind them the horses were changed regularly allowing them to keep up a fairly even rate of speed and a rider had gone on ahead of them to arrange for overnight and midday accommodations in the best inns they arrived in london some four days later and passing through the bustling city entered the tiny quiet village of chiswick where skyes house was located upon the strand on the green which bordered the river thames it was the last house in a prestigious row that included the great homes of salisbury worcester and the bishop of durham next to skyes home greenwood stood lynmouth house which now belonged to her little son robin greenwood a threestoried house of mellow pink brick stood within its own private grounds as skyes coach drove through the open iron gates past the bowing and smiling gatekeeper and his brightly curtseying wife she remembered how shabby the house had been on her first visit seven years ago now the manicured lawns edged with their private woods stretched out invitingly toward the house a thought crossed her mind its good to be home she smiled to herself greenwood had always been a happy place for her welcome home mlady the majordomo said as they entered the house i have a message from lord burghley for you where shall i have it brought the library she said quickly willow my love go along with daisy and dame cecily skye hurried to the library drawing off her paleblue scented kid gloves and flinging them on a table as she entered she unfastened her hooded cloak pushing back its ermineedged darkblue velvet hood to shrug the garment off the attending footman quickly caught the cape and hurried out with it as the majordomo hurried in with her message upon a silver salver skye took it up and said i wish to be alone as the door closed shut she quickly opened cecils letter greeting madam and welcome to london the queen will receive you at eight oclock this evening at whitehall you are not to wear mourning as the duc de beaumonts nephew will be present but rather dress to suit your rank and your wealth a sarcastic smile touched her lips she would have to mourn niall in her heart for she was not to be allowed a decent period of grief by the crown oh no she was to be paraded this very evening before the ducs representative and had been ordered to dress in her finest feathers cecil had never even considered the possibility that she might not show up in london that she might run for ireland and barricade herself in burke castle with his customary efficiency he had known that she would arrive today and had sent his message she laughed seeing the dark humor in the situation and left the library to climb the stairs to her apartments where she instructed daisy which dress she would wear that evening at a few minutes before eight oclock skyes town coach arrived at whitehall palace as her footman helped her down some half a dozen gallants stopped and stared openmouthed at her she wore a magnificent gown of deep purple velvet with a very low square neckline her breasts pushed up by a boned undergarment swelled dangerously over the top of the gown its sleeves full to just below the elbow were slashed to show their lavender silk inserts and the turned back cuffs of the sleeves were embroidered as was the lavender silk underskirt with gold thread tiny seed pearls gold and little glass beads beneath her gown skyes legs were sheathed in purple silk stockings embroidered in twining gold vines her slender feet were encased in narrow pointed highheeled purple silk shoes her hair parted in the middle was arranged in the french fashion that she preferred a soft chignon at the nape of her neck there were silk parma violets and white silk lilies of the valley sewn to a long comb placed at the top of the chignon the silk flowers were a delicious extravagance from france about her neck skye wore an incredibly opulent necklace of diamonds and amethysts set in gold and in her ears were her famous pearshaped diamonds that fell from baroque pearls she wore but one ring this night a heartshaped pink sapphire on the third finger of her left hand she had faintly highlighted her eyes in blue kohl and reddened her lips but her cheeks were pink with a combination of excitement anger and nerves wrapped in a gentle cloud of her damask rose perfume she moved forward into the palace one of the young gallants foolishly stepped into her path doffing his feathered cap and bowing low just a word oh exquisite one and i shall die happy he lisped stand aside you silly puppy skye snapped irritably the reality of why she was here was beginning to sink into her soul the gallant almost fell back at the sharp tone in her voice and she swept on by him finding her way with quick familiarity as old memories began to assail her turning a corner she bumped into a courtier and stepping back to apologize gasped as the courtier caught at her hands imprisoning them in his own dudley she hissed at the smugly grinning earl of leicester sweet skye he murmured i could scarcely believe my good fortune when bess said you would be retiirning to us widowed once more the implication was plain and it was all she could do not to shudder with disgust robert dudley slipped an arm about her waist and pulled her close his mustache tickled her ear as he kissed it and then he whispered you do run through husbands sweet skye marry me and ill never let you wear me out angrily she pulled away from him looking at him with distaste robert dudley the earl of leicester was as handsome and elegant as ever but she still found his manner offensive and overbearing unhand me this instant dudley i am here because the queen has special plans for me and if you should attempt to attack me again i shall make the most outrageous scene this court has ever seen lord burghley will protect me this time you swine she tore his arm from about her waist you will crush my gown and what special plans has bess for you sweet skye he was completely unperturbed by her anger i am sure that you shall know that shortly my lord now you will excuse me i am expected in the queens chambers i will escort you he said taking her arm she did not deny him that courtesy for she knew that once her betrothal became public knowledge dudley would be forced to leave her be silently they made their way to elizabeth tudors privy chamber where the doors were flung wide at their approach by the queens own guardsmen as they entered skye recognized only two faces among the women in the queens rooms lettice knollys and lady elizabeth clinton born a fitzgerald lady clinton was the countess of lincoln in whose household skyes second son murrough was a page suddenly a small blond boy dressed in pale blue velvet and silver lace stepped forward good evening mother he said good evening robin skye answered her eyes devouring her son she wanted to hug him but knew she could not do so publicly skye lettice knollys came forward smiling how good to see you again her eyes nicked to dudley so thats how it is now skye thought amused lettice dear it is good to see you also she turned slightly beth how are you lady clinton nodded i am well and your murrough is a delight skye never have i had such a gracious wellmannered page in my household i hope you will let me keep him for a while longer he writes me that he is happy skye replied i see no reason to remove him from your care beth he is a lucky little boy to be in such a fine house i hope however i may see him while i am here at court my visit is not to be a long one send word whenever you want him elizabeth clinton replied graciously dearest skye every head in the room turned at the sound of elizabeth tudors voice and skye swept the queen a low and graceful curtsey we welcome you back to court dearest skye the queen said i am grateful that you have let me come majesty returned skye rising as she spoke and thinking bess tudor had aged little she was still a handsome and elegant young woman come into my privy chamber skye elizabeth said the rest of you are to wait here at my pleasure the two women entered into the queens small private library and elizabeth tudor sat down motioning skye into a chair opposite her you know why i am here majesty skye began aye i know you wish me to confirm little lord padraic burkes rights so that the english in dublin pale will not seize burke lands now that there is no adult male burke to defend them skye nodded you are willing to aid me in return the queen demanded i have ever been your majestys most loyal servant was the reply even when pirating my treasure ships elizabeth said drily that was never proven skye replied quickly ha the queen chuckled that handsome brute de marisco saved your pretty neck that time skye but i know it was you it had a womans fine hand about it it was subtle yet hurtful men are more blunt dearest skye she fixed skye a piercing look you are willing to go to beaumont de jaspre as the ducs bride i am not willing majesty but i will go if you will guarantee my sons rights i will go you understand that we will also expect you to listen and pass on to us any interesting and pertinent tidbits you learn with regard to france spain the papal states and the holy roman empire i understand majesty the queen nodded then i will confirm your sons rights madam cecil tells me that you wish your uncle the old bishop of connaught to be the boys governor aye majesty he is a good man and a wise one as well very well the queen said i can find no reason to object the duc de beaumont will be quite surprised to see the beauty that i am sending him too many state brides are a disappointment to the grooms too many grooms are an equal disappointment to the brides came the pert reply the queen chuckled again i remember when poor anne of cleves arrived as fourth wife to my father she reminisced anne was far plumper than her portrait would have had you believe and nervousness had caused her fair skin to blotch it was instant dislike on both parts and my father was furious with his artist hans holbein who had painted the princess of cleves portrait of course my father was no prize either having grown fat and middleaged but he didnt see himself as such he was plagued with gout in his right foot and could be very irritable especially when his foot hurt which unfortunately it did on her arrival she graciously gave him a quick divorce the queen smiled again at the memory and then she said it is time for us to begin the dancing dearest skye we will introduce you this evening to the ducs nephew edmond de beaumont he has come to escort you back to beaumont de jaspre you will find him an interesting man i cannot leave london until sir robert small has returned majesty he is due back sometime this month from a most successful voyage his advance ship is already in plymouth and i have had word that the spices he carries will enrich your majestys coffers greatly elizabeth tudor smiled you do not have to leave us until sir robert has returned and you have had time to make your arrangements with him i know the businesswoman that you are she took skyes arm in her own and together they strolled from the queens privy chamber come ladies come dudley my feet itch to dance and it grows late the queens party made their way through the corridors of whitehall palace to a large room with walls of linenfold paneling and a fine parquet floor the musicians were already set up in a corner of the room upon a small raised platform elizabeth and her party passed through a line of bowing courtiers as they walked to a gilt throne set up at the end of the room the queen sat gracefully upon the red velvet cushion set upon the throne and motioned skye to one of the low maidofhonor chairs by her side the other women quickly found their seats one being forced to stand behind the queens chair and the courtiers began to come forward to pay their respects to the queen some faces were familiar to skye others were not and she paid little attention to the pageant about her it bored her court usually bored her only when most of the courtiers had paid homage to the queen and the majordomo called out edmond petit sieur de beaumont was her interest revived and she looked up although her kerryblue eyes widened slightly skye gave no other sign of her surprise and shock for the man coming toward her was one of the handsomest she had ever seen he was also a dwarf he was not misshapen like so many dwarfs but rather well formed and he was certainly dressed in the height of fashion his doublet was made from cloth of gold sewn all over with tiny golden brilliants and edged in gold lace at the neck and the sleeves his short round clothofgold breeches were lined in stiff horsehair in order to puff them out fashionably his stockings were gold silk embroidered in gold brilliants and tiny black jet beads and his flatsoled shoes were of gold leather with black rosettes his short cape was of black velvet lined in cloth of gold and trimmed in silver fox at his waist hung a gold sword proportioned to his size and twinkling with rubies and diamonds as he reached the foot of elizabeth tudors throne he bowed smartly majesty he said in a deep voice a rather large voice for one so small welcome edmond de beaumont elizabeth said i hope that you have been enjoying your stay here in england english hospitality is justly famous your majesty was the reply lady burke come forward the queen commanded and skye rose from her low seat and came to stand next to the queens chair msieur de beaumont may i present to you lady skye burke who has agreed to go to beaumont de jaspre as your uncles bride around them there was a hum of surprise skye curtseyed to edmond de beaumont noting with some embarrassment that as she bowed low he was treated to a fine indeed almost indecent view of her breasts as she rose he said softly my uncle is a very very fortunate man your majesty skye blushed to the roots of her raven hair yet as she raised her eyes to edmond de beaumont she saw that though his face was polite and serious his violetcolored eyes were laughing i can only hope your uncle is as charming as his nephew msieur de beaumont she replied i do not think that charming is a word one would use in connection with uncle fabron was the reply and again the eyes were laughing at her oh dear skye said without thinking and she bit her lip in obvious worry edmond de beaumont burst out laughing are you always so honest lady burke he asked our dear skye is most candid is she not dudley remarked the queen indeed majesty dudley replied lady burke always says what she thinks a most refreshing and often stimulating trait msieur de beaumont skye shot dudley a look of undisguised venom which edmond de beaumont was quick to note now why he wondered does the lady so obviously dislike the earl of leicester did he perhaps rebuff her no de beaumont thought she did not look like the type of woman who would chase after a popinjay like lord dudley you are to go with msieur de beaumont dearest skye for you will have many questions to ask him about your future home i am sure the queen coyly simpered skye stepped from the queens side and accepted edmond de beaumonts outstretched hand together they turned bowed to the queen and turning again moved through the crowded room they made an almost comical sight for the petit sieur was only three feet four inches tall and skye stood five feet seven inches in her bare feet no one however dared to laugh for the queen was a tyrant where good manners were concerned and this little man was her honored guest and do you have many questions to ask me lady burke skye paused a moment and then said i suppose i shall msieur i am only now getting used to the idea of marriage with your uncle edmond de beaumont led her to a quiet alcove with a window seat she sat and he helped himself to two goblets of chilled white wine from a serving mans tray handing her one he sat facing her do you not wish to marry my uncle i do not have a real choice msieur i must obey the queen is there another gentleman that you prefer to my uncle no msieur de beaumont there is no one else my husband is dead but two months and i shall mourn niall for the rest of my life he drank deeply he was relieved that there was no one else it was possible that she would learn to love his uncle and that they would be happy god only knew that it would save him a great deal of difficulty his cousin garnier de beaumont his uncles only living child was a halfwit and so his uncle had made edmond his heir but if he became the duc de beaumont then he must marry and what girl would have him oh he was well enough favored but he was tiny how often he had been mocked by men and women alike because of his height his size certainly did not affect his intelligence but no one ever bothered to find that out about edmond de beaumont because he stood only three feet four inches tall this extravagantly beautiful woman however did not seem either amused or appalled by his size she spoke to him plainly and without guile he looked up at her again and said quietly i respect your grief lady burke then to change the subject he asked do you have children her smile lit her whole face and she said i have four living sons and two daughters they will like beaumont de jaspre he assured her the climate is mild and pleasant most of the year and your children will enjoy bathing in the sea my children will not be coming with me msieur but why he was surprised and now he understood the reason for the sadness that lurked deep in her fabulous bluegreen eyes my eldest son ewan must remain on his lands msieur his full brother murrough is a page with the earl of lincolns household and must remain with the court if he is to earn lands and possibly a peerage of his own my third son is the earl of lynmouth he is the queens favorite page the small boy who now stands on her majestys right as for my youngest son lord burke he is but two and a half months old he too must stay on his lands and he is much too tender to travel besides my daughters are to remain here also willow is nine and heiress to my business partner sir robert small deirdre is just sixteen months old and like her baby brother too young to travel i do not understand lady burke why you agreed to this marriage edmond de beaumont said i have been told that you arc outrageously wealthy in both monies and lands and now you say you have children much too young to leave surely you are not one of those women who seek a great title if the choice were truly mine msieur de beaumont and your uncle the holy roman emperor himself i should not wed with him but the choice is not mine it is the queens will that i do so and therefore i must why he was distressed for her because i am irish msieur de beaumont and the english have had a stranglehold on my homeland for several centuries now i agreed to marry your uncle because if i did not my infant sons lands would have been parceled out among the angloirish those sycophants of the english monarchs i am a realist msieur de beaumont skye continued i could not hope to beat the english in a fair fight for unfortunately the irish are not a nation able to unite behind one ruler if we were the english would not be in our homeland my duty is to my children and to the memories i have of their fathers i am responsible for the lands of four families as well as an enormous commercial interest and a fleet of vessels should i beggar myself and my children for an ideal i think not madame i wonder if you are the right woman for my uncle why she smiled at him because i am outspoken msieur my uncle is used to a more complacent type of female he smiled back and she thought that he had a beautiful smile if you complain to the queen that i am not suitable she said in a more serious tone elizabeth will wonder what i have done to incur your displeasure msieur that would endanger my infant son lord burke i promise you that i shall be exactly the type of wife your uncle seeks they tell me that he is old and not in good health i vow to nurse him most tenderly who on earth told you that my uncle is elderly lady burke edmond de beaumont was surprised uncle fabron is but fortyfive and is in excellent health he saw the shock upon her face my god they have lied to you in order to gain your cooperation she was very pale and he placed a surprisingly warm hand over her trembling clenched ones lord burghley said that your uncle was an older man in ill health that i should be home within a year or two at the most dear god my babies i shall never sec my babies again this is infamous edmond de beaumont accepted the fact of arranged marriages but this beautiful woman was being used in a terrible way i shall speak to the queen myself he said you cannot be made to leave your children like this no her blue eyes were huge and frightened msieur de beaumont you must not speak to anyone of this you will do me no kindness and i shall lose everything i have accepted my lot and so must you she turned her hand so she might grasp his tiny one please msieur she said madam i am already your devoted servant he answered it will be as you wish i would be your friend you already are msieur de beaumont and since you are i think you should call me skye she calmed herself now assured by his gentleness and air of concern with pleasure skye if you will call me edmond across the room robert dudley sneered to the queen look how she simpers at the dwarf so sweetly it sickens me is the duc a dwarf also how amusing that would be bess it would take two of them to equal one geoffrey southwood or niall burke he laughed nastily are you jealous my lord elizabeth tudors voice was sharp i thought you had gotten over your passion for lady burke do not try my patience robert i have been most generous with you and you will repay my kindness i adore you bess you well know it but you will not marry me i am only a man madam fie rob lower your voice the queen chided others are looking at us and in answer to your question the duc de beaumont is not a dwarf his nephew showed me his miniature which was sent for his intended bride he is a wellfavored gentleman lady burke should not be overly unhappy in beaumont de jaspre she will be out of the way dudley answered you do not fool me bess i know you far too well lady burke is in your subtle mind an enemy by sending her to beaumont de jaspre you rid yourself of that particular enemy i also gain a spy against france spain and the papal states the queen said quietly i have no doubt that lady burke will hear many interesting things that she can pass on to us by god bess lord dudley said admiringly you are totally ruthless the queen smiled archly at the earl of leicester dance with me rob she said and we shall discuss what to give lady burke as a wedding gift skye and edmond de beaumont were watching the queen and lord dudley capering merrily to a sprightly tune played by the musicians when william cecil came up to sit with them so you have made friends with the petit sieur de beaumont lady burke and you msieur see the exquisite prize we are sending to your uncle do you think that he will be pleased how could he not be lord burghley the queen has decided that you will depart here at the end of april lady burke msieur de beaumont will travel with you and your party to beaumont de jaspre the queen has promised me that i may remain in england until sir robert has returned my lord i will not go until then what is all this indecent haste about i will leave by midmay i must first have a trousseau made for the gowns i have to wear here in england and ireland will be totally unsuitable in a warmer climate would you have me arrive to wed the duc in my shift edmond de beaumont chuckled aloud at the look of discomfort upon the face of the queens secretary of state and lord treasurer there is no great rush lord burghley he said after all my uncle is in robust health and the miniature i shall send him tomorrow of lady burke should increase his ardor if we leave in midmay as skye suggests we will be in beaumont de jaspre by june a perfect time for a wedding especially there ah yes yes william cecil began to edge nervously away you have been most kind my lord skye said sweetly but her eyes were blazing with anger how fortunate i am that my husbandtobe is in such fine health indeed indeed madam lord burghley murmured and then turned and hurried off into the crowd you are no mean opponent edmond de beaumont laughed what miniature skye demanded of you i intended to paint it tonight he answered her you are an artist i do competent portraits he said if you would give me but a few minutes i shall do a quick sketch of you for your miniature would it be easier if i sat for the portrait edmond you would be willing he was delighted i would be willing besides your company is far preferable to that of the hangerson here at court i am sure that the queen will excuse us if we ask her elizabeth tudor was delighted yet at the same time she felt irritated she was relieved that skye was accepting this marriage to the duc de beaumont so easily but she wondered why what were skyes thoughts she had become friendly quickly enough with the ducs charming dwarf nephew was she planning some sort of mischief the queen smiled brightly at skye and edmond de beaumont of course you may be excused msieur de beaumont you also dearest skye i hope that msieur has been able to answer your many questions indeed majesty skye replied sweetly he is a veritable font of knowledge and i am now most anxious to reach beaumont de jaspre the queen murmured politely and held out her hand for edmond de beaumont to kiss he did so with exquisite grace and elegance and elizabeth remarked gracious sir your lack of height does not seem to impede your manners such delicacy and style was it not you madame who once remarked that what a person is physically should not deter him in any way the queen laughed heartily you are welcome at my court at any time msieur de beaumont i like men of beauty and wit and although your beauty is small your wit is great skye curtseyed politely and then she and edmond de beaumont made their way from the hall when they had exited the overly hot and noisy room skye asked where are you taking me msieur i am housed here at whitehall my apartments are not far he moved swiftly along his short legs seeming to take greater strides than her own long ones finally he turned down a corridor and entered the second apartment on the left skye recognized the section of the palace as the one in which state visitors were housed a swarthy man hurried forward as they entered the antechamber good evening msieur de beaumont he said guy this is lady burke who is to marry my uncle i am going to do her miniature tonight and ship it off to the duc tomorrow fetch my paints my felicitations madame guy said your paints msieur at once he has been with me since my childhood edmond de beaumont said sit over there on that tapestried chair skye damn me my dear you are beautiful arent you your skin i dont think i have the skill to capture its luminescence when we get back to beaumont de jaspre i want to do a full portrait of you he rattled on nonstop while guy brought him his easel a canvas his paints and brushes he was quickly and totally absorbed in what he was doing would madame enjoy some chilled wine guy was at her elbow inquiring politely i should thank you guy the servant was quickly back with a delicate venetian crystal goblet of a fruity palerosecolored wine it is msieurs favorite he explained i think you will enjoy it madame la duchesse madame la duchesse gods bones skye thought i am to be madame la duchesse then she thought of how cecil had lied to her about the ducs health well there was nothing she could do about that now but if the duc turned out to be a kind man she was going to try to bring her younger children to beaumont de jaspre ewan and murrough were old enough to survive without her her poor oflaherty sons they had had so little of her she sighed there was no help for it now the others however she must have with her true robin and willow were already away from home for part of the year but she had always been able to see them being sent to live in another country was a totally different thing the lynmouth holdings would be safe from plunder for their little earl was an englishman richard de grenville and adam de marisco would see to it for her uncle seamus would have to oversee the burke lands and she would ask elizabeth fitzgerald clinton the countess of lincoln to help him beth was an irish woman and would understand her plight it was a chance that would have to be taken for skye could not leave her babies with the queens support and her strong family ties she felt she could protect her childrens wealth even from as far as beaumont de jaspre how heartless of cecil he knew that the duc was relatively young and healthy and yet he had deliberately misled her into believing otherwise so she would agree to go and aid his mistress the queen by her sacrifice it mattered not a whit to cecil that padraic was but newly born and wee deirdre yet an infant he cruelly and selfishly tore her from her children simply in order to advance the queens political aims i will never trust the english again she thought yet there was her beloved geoffrey who had never hurt her and adam de marisco and robbie and dame cecily gods nightshirt she swore youre frowning edmond de beaumont said dont frown sweet skye give me that little halfsmile you have when you are deep in thought as you have been she smiled at him tell me about beaumont de jaspre she said its a fairyland he answered it is no more than five miles in width sandwiched in between provence and the languedoc it extends inland a little over ten miles from the mediterranean we are fortunate that above our town of villerose the land plateaus until it reaches the mountains that are the border of the duchy the plateau is fertile and so between our fine crops and the sea we are quite selfsufficient that is how we have managed to remain independent from the french although they would like to gobble us up frances queen mother catherine de medici offered our duc her daughter marguérite to wife and the duc asked the english queen for a wife instead i find that hard to believe edmond a french princess would have been quite a prize for your duc the offer was not genuine and uncle fabron knew it the princesse de valois is meant for henri of navarre what is your uncle like she asked he is a serious man skye bookish and learned i will be frank with you i think that he would have been happier as a religious man rather than having the responsibility of a duchy such as ours still he is a man who accepts his obligations well you will be his third wife the first marie de breil died after many years of stillbirths and miscarriages the second blanche de toulon died giving birth to garnier the ducs son it is a great pity that he too did not die for he is a halfwit my uncle has been widowed now for five years until recently he could not bring himself to wed again that is why he made me his heir but i have convinced him that a healthy male child of his own blood would serve the duchy better than the dwarf son of his younger brother you have no brothers i have four very normal and to me very tall sisters he laughed they are all older than i and after i was born my parents felt they could not take the chance of having another such as myself consequently there are no other legitimate male de beaumonts except my uncle fabron garnier and myself my father died when i was twelve that is why it is so important to me that my uncle remarry and have a son if i inherit the duchy i must marry and what woman would have such a fellow as myself what kind of children would we produce he put down his paintbrush and came over to stand by her knee dear sweet skye you are our last hope she shivered do not say that edmond it frightens me to be the hope of survival for a duchy such as beaumont de jaspre he smiled his incredibly sweet smile at her and skye thought what a pity it was that it could not be he whom she was to marry edmond might be small in stature but he was kind and amusing and obviously quite intelligent what are you thinking he asked her honestly he nodded that i wish it were you i was to wed he looked stunned for a moment and then he said slowly madam never have i received such a magnificent compliment then taking both of her hands in his he kissed them passionately i have not regretted my height in many years skye but this night i do then i have done you a disservice edmond for i would not hurt you for the world you have not hurt me he answered his marvelous violetcolored eyes looking warmly into her kerryblue ones and she knew he desired her then he quickly changed the subject back to his uncle what else would you like to know about the duc skye what he looks like she said with feminine curiosity he stands about two inches taller than you his eyes are black his hair the same he has not your beautiful coloring she said disappointed no his mother was florentine mine castilian i inherited her honeycolored hair and violet eyes uncle fabron is more imposing than i am for his features are regal whereas mine are soft he turned and went back to his easel we have plenty of time to talk skye but let me finish this miniature while we do you must indulge my curiosity now who is this sir robert small you will not leave england without seeing robbie she smiled broadly robbie is one of the two best friends i have in this whole world he is my business partner a marvelous man and i adore him he has never married and his sister dame cecily is a childless widow my second husband was a spaniard and he died before my eldest daughter willow our only child was born robbie and his sister adopted her and made her their heiress with all the bad feeling between england and spain it is better for my daughter that she have an english surname be an englishwoman although her parentage is no secret little is thought of it because she is willow mary small this sir robert he is due back from a voyage shortly edmond de beaumont asked aye his advance ship arrived in plymouth a short while ago and robbie could appear any time between today and the end of the month she said happily to skyes surprise robbie appeared the very next morning shouting her name as he entered greenwoods paneled reception hall skye lass dammit skye where are you sir robert small sea captain and owner of wren court an exquisite devon house stood with his legs spread wide his homely freckled face anticipatory skyes secretary jean morlaix came hurrying downstairs from the library where he had been working a smile upon his usually serious features good day to ye jean how is your marie and the children very well captain jean morlaix greeted robbie it was a good voyage i trust splendid was the enthusiastic reply robbie skye stood at the top of the staircases second landing her long black hair was tousled from sleep her feet bare her paleblue quilted silk dressing gown open at the neck with a glad cry she flew down the stairs and into his arms oh robbie you are home safe he hugged her lovingly she was the daughter he might have had had he ever taken the time to marry then he kissed her on both cheeks asking as he did so is niall with you lass jean morlaix stiffened and skyes smile faded niall is dead robbie he was murdered this past february by his first wife the nun that bitch claire oflaherty insinuated herself into st marys convent attached herself to poor mad darragh like a bloodsucking leech and then tortured her with the idea that niall was coming to reclaim her claire terrorized darragh to the point that she was amenable even to murder to save herself darragh told the mother superior of her convent that she stabbed niall several times and there was a great deal of blood then she and claire dragged his body to the beach and the last thing darragh remembers of the event is the waves lapping at nialls body when the mother superior and the other nuns hurried to the beach they found the tide fully in and nialls body gone christs body robbie swore softly and then his arms went back around her for a moment she wept softly moving her head into his shoulder for refuge and his weathered square hand stroked her dark hair comfortingly ah lass ah lass robbie is here now and ill make it all right see if i dont skye lass the macwilliam is gone also robbie she said regaining some control i kept his death a secret and came to england to gain the queens protection for my infant son padraic she will confirm his title and his lands but only for a price i am to become the wife of the duc de beaumont de jaspre i must leave england by midmay the devil you say he cried this is some plot of william cecils i vow what of your children has that old spider thought of your children aye ill wager he has hes thought what fine hostages theyll make would he separate a mother from her babies aye he would to serve the queen beaumont de jaspre is at the moment of vital interest to england robbie and the duc requested that the queen send him a wife i am the bride they have chosen i must go skye sobbed its indecent robbie raged youve not even had the proper time to mourn niall decently i dont like it i dont like it one bit what is this duc fellow like tell me does the queen know the sort of man shes sending you to wed with shes as quick to send you off to marry as she is to sidestep the issue of marriage herself i met the ducs nephew only last night at whitehall robbie she slipped from his protective embrace and took him by the hand come upstairs with me and we will have something to eat i have not eaten yet and im ravenous he followed along next to her aye im famished myself i came directly from the pool i was so anxious to see you the captain of the royal harry sent a small sailing vessel out of plymouth to intercept my mermaid to tell me to dock here in london as you were at greenwood aye i could eat something beef she tempted him a nice haunch of juicy rare beef robert smalls kindly blue eyes grew soft with longing do you know how long its been since i tasted beef he said aye robbie i know salted meat and hardtack filled with weevils no matter how carefully its stored is what youve had to eat these last months they had reached her apartments and daisy came forward smiling as they entered welcome home captain small she said sliding an arm about her waist robbie gave the girl a smack on her rosy cheek daisy my girl youre as pretty as ever daisy giggled thank you sir she said dodging his hand that made to swat at her bottom sir robbie chuckled ive missed that too skye lass he said skye laughed not in the least shocked for robbie had a prodigious appetite where women were concerned it was probably the reason he had never married no one woman could satisfy him for long which was just as well for big or little fair or dark blondes brunettes and redheads robbie adored them all captain small and i would like some breakfast daisy and see that cook roasts a bit of beef for the captain yes mlady daisy curtseyed and hurried from the room come sit by the fire robbie skye invited seating herself in a tapestried wing chair the mornings still have a chill to them what is the ducs nephew like he demanded not losing sight of the subject as he settled himself in the matching chair opposite her in the fireplace a good oak blaze crackled warmly taking the dampness from the riverview room edmond de beaumont is a dwarf she said is the duc nay edmond says his uncle is at least a couple inches taller than i am you will like edmond robbie when you meet him at dinner this evening he is an amusing intelligent man you like him it was a statement aye i like him he is as outraged as you were that i am forced to leave my babies behind he offered to speak to the queen for me you forbade him i trust of course skye replied he says that his uncle is a serious and bookish man the duc has no children robbie asked one a boy of five but the child is a halfwit and the duc has made edmond his heir until he has a son of his own so youre being sent to play the brood mare to this ducs stallion in hopes that youll give him children i dont like it actually i dont think the queen cares one way or another whether i give the duc children she is more interested in the bits and pieces of information i may pick up from france spain and the papal states to send back to her i am to be elizabeth tudors ears he nodded i see now why they are sending you a young girl would be apt to fall in love with her husband and become totally engrossed in having and raising a family no use at all to the queen and cecil you however are more mature and youll keep your mind on the queens business aye robbie she teased him i am to shortly celebrate my twentyninth birthday i am most mature he smiled at her then sobered you know what i mean he said you have experienced great love in your life not just once but three times you are barely widowed and not apt to fall in love easily again your duke doesnt sound like the sort of man who will go out of his way to capture your heart he marries to beget children you will therefore have the time to serve the queen which is exactly what elizabeth tudor and william cecil have in mind i dont like it skye it could be very dangerous my lass i have no intention of going out of my way for the queen robbie this marriage is not to my liking once again the queen has betrayed my loyalty and my friendship i am cornered like an animal as she knew i would be when she approved lord burghleys plan but i had no choice but go to her for aid i am a woman alone i chose the strongest ally even if i cant trust her entirely robert small nodded skye had done the best she could in a very difficult situation he knew that no one not even a man could have done better im coming with you he said what her blue eyes were wide with surprise im coming with you he repeated listen to me lass i will make beaumont de jaspre my home port on the mediterranean for the time being the way i did in algiers there is plenty of trading to be done along the north african coast in spain why in istanbul itself i dont want you cut off from everyone you love at least not until i know what kind of man this is and if youll be happy robbie i thank you skye said and her eyes were damp i was so afraid and until now i did not even dare admit it to myself yere only human he muttered gruffly and she hid a smile i saw adam de marisco before i came to london skye said he noted the brief sad look that filled her eyes for a moment have you told him of your impending marriage no tell him he may want to see you before you leave england be fair skye i cant hurt him anymore robbie we cannot see each other that we dont end up in bed i love him as a friend and i would be happy to be his wife but adam says no he says it isnt enough for me even if i dont know it he also told me that he will not be my lover youll break his heart skye if you dont tell him let him make the choice of coming up to london or not but at least tell him you cant go off to some mediterranean duchy for god knows how long without telling him very well i will write him this morning and send one of the grooms to lynmouth theyll see it gets to him from there the door to skyes dayroom opened and daisy entered followed by several maidservants laden down with trays of food and pitchers of drink which were placed on an oaken sideboard set that round table between the chairs daisy directed and when it was done she spread a fine linen cloth on it herself next came the plates highly polished pewter rounds and matching goblets as well as heavy linen napkins from a long narrow black leather case daisy took two twinpronged gold forks the newest invention from florence and placed one by each plate ive used these before robbie noted you spear the food with them aye skye answered him theyre very handy and help to keep the fingers clean wine or ale captain daisy demanded nutbrown ale he asked and his eyes sparkled yes sir ive not had ale in months daisy lass pour away daisy poured the ale into the pewter goblet from a frosty blue earthenware pitcher then went to the sideboard for a platter that held a thick slab of rare beef swimming in its own juices taking his fork she lifted the beef from the platter onto his own plate then replaced the fork on his plate and handed him a knife cook says youre to eat every morsel of that beef captain with a quick glance of apology at skye robbie crossed himself in blessing and fell upon the beef cutting a wedge popping it in his mouth chewing it down a beatific smile lighting his rugged features as he did so in the middle of the table daisy placed stone crocks of sweet butter and honey and a small cutting board with a fresh steaming loaf of bread next came a bowl of valencia oranges from spain daisy served her mistress from a small serving dish spooning onto skyes plate a fluffy mixture of eggs and tiny bits of ham and green onion wine mlady the white please said skye crossing herself then she took up a forkful of the eggs their mistress and her guest fed the servants withdrew skye and robbie ate in silence for the next few minutes then as robbie mopped a piece of bread about his plate sopping up the beef juices she said edmond gave me a miniature of the duc would you like to see it aye came the reply is he plain or fair if he smiled perhaps he would be fair he is certainly not plain she rose from the table and moved into her bedchamber returning she handed him a small oval edged in gold studded with pearls robert small took the miniature from her and stared down at it the man pictured was cleanshaven his skin bronzed by his climate he had a high forehead and a square jaw his nose was long and aquiline the nostrils flaring slightly his mouth was large the lips thin his black eyes were almondshaped and tipped up just the tiniest bit at the corners his black hair was cut short and was curly he looked at the viewer directly his face impersonal and cold robert small did not like what he saw there was a hint of cruelty in the mans mouth a touch of overbearing pride in the way he held his head he would not be an easy man he did not look to be a man whose heart could be softened by a sweet smile or a gentle hand and he was certainly not the type of man to be given a beautiful wife more than likely he would be insanely jealous of any other man who looked upon his bride damn elizabeth tudor robbie thought she was undoubtedly one of the finest rulers england had ever had for all she was a woman but she had no heart that was her greatest failing she used people playing with them as a child plays with her toys moving her subjects this way and that way to suit her own convenience without thought for their happiness or wellbeing it saddened him doubly once for the queen herself for she was basically a good woman and secondly for skye whom he loved with all his heart she was like his own daughter for all she had been born an omalley and he didnt want to see her hurt well she looked directly at him and he quickly masked his thoughts youre right he said the duc would be fair if he smiled as it is he looks stem but then perhaps he was nervous posing for his bride youll undoubtedly bring a smile to his lips when he meets you theres something about his eyes that frightens me she said quietly nonsense robbie replied with bluff reassurance dont form any opinions lass until youve met the gentleman it makes no difference she said i must wed him like him or no before they might continue their conversation the door to skyes apartments opened and the young earl of lynmouth ran into the room mama he flung himself into her arms robin oh my dearest robin then she began to cry mama robin southwoods voice held an amused note that reminded skye of his late father geoffrey and she wept all the more gods bones uncle robbie said the boy i think i had best leave dont you dare skye wiped her eyes on her handkerchief hastily retrieved from her dressinggown pocket it is just that i am so very glad to see you robin and you look and sound more like your rather each day she held him at arms length you have grown taller are you happy at court robin i was so proud of you last night but you are so young to be a page are you sure that you wouldnt rather live at lynmouth my love or perhaps you will come with me to beaumont de jaspre beaumont de jaspre where is that mama why on earth are you going to a place called beaumont de jaspre robin had been out of the room when the queen had briefly announced skyes betrothal the previous evening he had been sent to fetch her majestys pomander i can see that the court gossip has not caught up with you robin the queen is sending me to beaumont de jaspre which is a small duchy between provence and the languedoc i am to be bride to its duc that is outrageous the boys small face was a mask of stunned anger my stepfather is barely cold in his grave and she asks you to marry with another surely you have misunderstood her mama the queen would not do such a thing to you she wouldnt skye could not destroy his faith in elizabeth tudor he was an englishman and not just any englishman despite his youth he was one of englands premier noblemen but his title and all his wealth would amount to nothing if he did not give his complete loyalty to the crown and skye understood that robin she said quietly as she drew him toward her the queen needs my help very badly she must have a safe haven for english ships in the mediterranean and beaumont de jaspre will provide that haven she must have a listening post into france and spain and again beaumont de jaspre will provide her with it all the duc requires of england in return is a wife it is the queens decision that i be that wife and i am proud that she trusts me to aid her even though i am irish skye said wryly niall would be proud of me as would your father and willows too i had not thought about it that way mama he said but his limegreen eyes filled with tears and his small lower lip trembled will i ever see you again mama oh robin she hugged him quickly i have only to get settled and then you will come to me you and willow and deirdre and your new baby brother padraic even murrough and ewan if they want to come also when do you go mama his little voice quavered slightly within the month robin she kissed him soundly once on each cheek come now my little love ive been in ireland since last autumn and you didnt miss me at all i vow you are having far too much fun with the court my lord of lynmouth a small smile touched his lips and he looked up at her with a look so like his fathers that skyes heart almost broke with the rush of memories perhaps madam he allowed and she laughed you are a villain she teased him and you grow more like geoffrey every day robin southwood willow stood in the dayroom door her small foot impatiently tapping how long have you been in our mothers house and not come to bid me good day robin pulled from his mothers embrace and turning made his halfsister a most elegant leg sweeping his small dark green velvet cap with its pheasants feather from his blond head as he did so your servant mistress small he said as he bowed low willow curtseyed prettily spreading the skirts of her rosepink velvet gown as she did so good day to you my lord earl she said then with a giggle and a whoop the two children were hugging each other as their mother smiled happily at their antics is there room for me too a slightly deeper voice inquired skye turned to see a tall darkhaired boy standing in her doorway murrough good morning mama he came forward and kissed her lady clinton has released me from my duties as long as you are in london with the court i hope that will be all right he looked anxiously at her thank god she thought guiltily there was nothing of his father about him dearest murrough i am delighted and so grateful to elizabeth clinton for letting you come skye hugged her second eldest son you have grown thin are you eating properly i know how it is with pages you are always so busy there isnt enough time to eat or to sleep he grinned down at her yes i am eating but i have grown four inches in the last year mama i guess now that my meals have to go further i need to eat even more if i am to satisfy you how is ewan hes fine she replied then you miss him dont you aye i miss him and ireland too you understand why you must stay here murrough aye mama i understand i am landless and even if you settle monies on me a man without his own land is nothing there is joan southwood to think of too murrough she deserves her own home how is she he asked growing quite lovely murrough her hair has become a beautiful golden brown and reaches to her hips and her eyes have just a hint of geoffreys green in them they are quite a delicious hazel color she is of course as sweetnatured as ever and works quite diligently on the items of her trousseau she believes you will appreciate she is half through a large tapestry depicting a knight slaying a dragon anne says she is a very accomplished needlewoman she is going to make you a fine wife i know mother and i thank you for making me such a good match joan is a good girl and will suit me admirably ill win her and the children we will have someday fair lands in the queens service see if i dont i know that you will murrough skye gave him another hug you know of my impending marriage aye is it what you want no but i have no choice i must protect your halfbrothers lands and the angloirish in the dublin pale eye the burke lands like ravenous wolves i needed a favor from the queen and royalty never gives from the heart he nodded in understanding murrough oflaherty was twelve years old he had been two when his mother disappeared and six when he had been reunited with her again he was nine when his stepfather geoffrey southwood the earl of lynmouth had died and ten when he had been sent into service as a page with the earl and countess of lincolns household of necessity he had grown to maturity quickly he knew that with his mothers money he should never want for the material things in life but he also knew that if he was to win his own lands and he hoped a title it must be in the service of englands queen he comprehended perhaps better than any of his brothers and sisters his mothers difficult position do you want me with you he asked her half hopefully for he loved her dearly skyes eyes filled with quick tears which she rapidly blinked away thank you murrough she said when i am settled i will want you to visit me and meet your new stepfather but i will not spoil the progress you have made here at court she touched his cheek gently in a maternal gesture of gratitude go and speak with your brother and sister now my knight errant he moved off and robbie who had been sitting opposite her the entire time sniffed loudly theyre a fine litter your children he muttered go see dame cecily now she scolded him she is probably up and wondering where you are when is edmond de beaumont coming hes been asked for seven i think i shall have the children too there are no other guests just you your sister and myself he nodded well not be late i have some business to see to this evening skye laughed well not be late she said knowing that his evening business was with a whorehouse the beef was good he said rising and then ambled out of her dayroom patting the childrens heads as he went who wants to go riding with me skye demanded of her children and they all noisily assented go and change then she ordered them i shall be ready in fifteen minutes and anyone whos not wont go the two boys and the girl scattered out the door of her apartments and skye called to daisy it was one of those rare very warm april days in england there was not a cloud in the flawless blue sky and the sun shone with a clear yellow light the flowering trees were all in bloom the meadows bright green with new growth skye and her children rode along the river enjoying their time together afterward they picnicked in the garden behind greenwood house watching the river traffic as it passed them by the children gorging themselves with meat pastries early wild strawberries and watered wine stuffed and sleepy they lay upon their backs talking and blowing at the bumblebees and butterflies who ventured near them as the afternoon lengthened they all fell asleep in the soft warm air it was there daisy found them skye her arms spread wide and protective about her two sons willow sleeping across her mothers lap for a moment skyes faithful tiring woman gazed upon her mistress and the three children they looked so peaceful that it seemed a shame to awaken them a tear and then another slid down daisys honest english face as she thought of the exile that she and skye were facing it wasnt fair of the queen to send them away send her lady who was always such a good mother from her children but then what would the childless elizabeth tudor know of maternal feelings the tears poured freely down daisys face now and she wept for herself as well what would happen now between herself and bran kelly he had been close she knew to declaring himself she wondered if she would ever see him again you dont have to come with me to beaumont de jaspre daisy said skye looking up at her servant seeing the tears and knowing why daisy wept daisy plumped herself down in the grass next to her mistress and who would take care of you mlady if i stayed behind it is several weeks before i leave you could train a clever lass in that time it wouldnt be the same mlady no daisy it wouldnt but id not have you unhappy you have been my friend as well as my servant thats part of it mlady youre going to a strange place to a strange man and who knows what youll find in this beaumont de jaspre youll need me i couldnt leave you mlady i couldnt in her heart skye was relieved as it was she was dreading the journey she must make and knowing that daisy was going with her made it a lot easier will it help if i tell you that captain kelly will be frequently in beaumont de jaspre daisys face lit up and she smiled her gaptoothed smile yes mlady it helps a great deal she said happily then added oh mlady i came to tell you it is time for you and the children to return to the house and dress for dinner msieur de beaumont will be arriving soon the sound of the adult voices had awakened the three children and they stirred each sitting up and stretching wide come poppets skye said moving willow from her lap and standing up our guest will soon be arriving and we must be dressed and ready to receive him daisy and the three children scrambled up and together the five gathered up the picnic things then made their way back through the garden to the house you will all take baths skye commanded her children yes mama willow replied dutifully but murrough and robin groaned loudly rolling their eyes at each other in mock horror skye ignored them and with daisy moved upstairs to her own apartments where the two undermaids already had her oaken tub filled with steaming water fragrant with bath oil of damask rose her personal fragrance the tub had been set before the bedroom fireplace where a cheerful blaze now burned while their mistress stood quietly the undermaids removed her clothing and riding boots then hurried off with the garments to clean and freshen them daisy helped skye up the small ladder and into her tub pinning her mistresss hair up quickly you want a few minutes to soak i can tell daisy said skye nodded ill call she replied dont let me daydream too long she sunk deep into the water seating herself on the little stool placed within the tub so she might relax in hot water up to her neck she had dictated a quick note to adam de marisco that morning before she went riding with the children telling him that the queen had made a political marriage for her and that she would be leaving england very soon tell him she said to jean morlaix tell him that i want to see him that he must come to london the letter had been off immediately by one of the lynmouth grooms and sitting now in her scented tub skye wondered whether adam would come to her robbie was right of course she couldnt leave england without seeing him a final time dearest adam adam who wouldnt marry her for fear he might ruin her life by taking her from some great new love she was going to find she almost laughed aloud at the thought from the looks of the duc he did not fit that description how much better off she would have been if adam had wed with her before she had gone to cecil at least adam was her friend and her confidant her sometime lover and she enjoyed being with him she had been vulnerable when she had appealed to lord burghley and he had used that vulnerability against her it was the very thing adam had feared she sighed the die was cast and for all intents and purposes she was on her way to beaumont de jaspre daisy she called drawing herself out of her reverie im here mlady came the reply as daisy hurried in to help bathe her mistress ive laid out a black velvet gown mlady the one with the black and silver brocade underskirt skye nodded not particularly interested in her clothing at this moment she could trust daisy to see that she looked her best dressing was no longer any fun when she had had khalid and geoffrey and niall to dress for then she had cared her bath finished she climbed from the tub and stood quietly while daisy dried and powdered her automatically skye put on her undergarments her black silk underblouse and her black silk stockings which she fastened with elegant silverribboned garters silently she slipped her feet into plain black silk shoes with silver rosettes then came the underskirt and finally the dress with its slashed sleeves showing matching brocade jewelry daisy asked pearls her mistress replied pink pearls that long doublestrand necklace the matching earrings and the hair ornaments very good mlady daisy hurried to get the jewel case containing these treasures and coming back with it she reverently lifted each piece from the red morocco leather case lined in palest blue silk and handed it to her mistress skye looped the necklace over her head and the pearls settled down upon her chest coming just above her deep cleavage her earbobs fat pink pearls hung from her ears on thin gold wires while skye saw to her jewelry daisy busied herself brushing out her mistresss long blueblack hair and styling it into the soft french chignon that skye favored she then affixed to the heavy silky mane the pink pearl and gold hair ornaments that matched skyes necklace and earrings rings daisy held out another open jewel case skye pondered the selection picking up several rings and discarding them as quickly she finally settled on a heartshaped ruby a black pearl and a large round diamond these will do she murmured pushing them onto her slender fingers then reaching for her scent bottle she daubed her rose fragrance between her breasts at her wrists and behind her ears had she been dressing for a lover she would have spent far more time perfuming herself and daisy knew it there skye said and she stood up i am ready and our guest has not yet arrived i shall go downstairs to await him daisy will you see to the children as she descended the stairs however edmond de beaumont was coming through the door he was beautifully attired in green velvet madam he called to her you are even fairer today if such a thing is possible he caught her hand up and kissed it welcome edmond she returned his greeting and led him into her reception salon where to her surprise robbie was already waiting the sea captain turned his glance closed and thoughtful why robbie skye said i didnt know that you were down already edmond de beaumont my dearest friend and my business partner sir robert small robbie this is the petit sieur de beaumont edmond de beaumont the two men greeted each other cautiously and then edmond said thank heavens when you mentioned this man skye i feared that he might be your lover my lover her first thought was to be offendedand angry she didnt need this sort of thing her lover indeed then suddenly she saw the humor in the situation and she giggled the situation was made even funnier to her mind by robbie who having recovered from his initial shock at edmond de beaumonts words began to roar with outrage christs bones thats a filthy french thought if i ever heard one has the queen given you to a froggie then skye ill not have it her lover his hand went to his sword youve been insulted and so have i no robbie skye cautioned edmond de beaumont had quickly realized his mistake but he was a proud young man and robert smalls furious tone had begun to offend him it was up to her to defuse the situation reaching out she touched robbies hand in a gesture of conciliation edmond meant no harm robbie then she turned to the younger man i was not aware that you misunderstood the situation msieur her tone was cool you said he was your cher ami madame was the reply i said he was one of the two best friends that i had in this world edmond she bit her lip to keep from laughing god only knows what you will think when you meet adam de marisco my other friend i will think him a very lucky man madame and i beg that you forgive me you also sir robert in beaumont de jaspre a woman is not a friend she is a wife a mistress a mother or a servant you understand what i am saying he looked very anxious robert small shook his head you cant do this skye even for the burke lands you cant marry this duc you hear his nephew they have no respect for a womans intelligence in this place you will be a thing to this man an animal to be bred no more i cant allow you to destroy yourself in this manner robbie i must obey the queen i cannot fight off the angloirish and their english friends i need a strong ally and elizabeth tudor is that ally her price is high but pay it i must if i balk now she will destroy me entirely it will be all right you will see the duc and i shall come to a comfortable arrangement between us robert small looked to edmond de beaumont but now the young mans face was smooth and devoid of emotion well msieur de beaumont robbie demanded will skye be able to come to an agreement with your uncle or will it be as i have said my uncle is an oldfashioned man sir robert but he has a good mind he is intelligent and although lady burkes independence will come as a bit of a shock to him he will come to understand that this is the way she is and i think he will even enjoy it his first wife was a distant cousin from florence and a very timid lady my uncles second wife was the daughter of a neighboring nobleman she was a vapid little thing really more a child than a woman you skye are far different from either of those ladies be patient with uncle fabron it will take you a little time but i know that you will win him over and he will appreciate your intelligence as well as your beauty you are the perfect wife for him you must not be concerned for i live at the castle and i will always be there to be your friend ill be there also robbie said be warned msieur de beaumont that i will be making my home in beaumont de jaspre until i am sure that skye is safe and happy he put his arm about her this is the daughter i never had and she is most dear to me and to my sister her eldest daughter is my heiress for all our lack of blood ties she is my family and i will not have her hurt edmond de beaumont could not help the admiring look that crept into his violet eyes he had not doubted from the moment he had first seen skye that she was a woman that men loved but that she could command such loyalty was indeed impressive you may trust me sir robert he said skye will be happy in beaumont de jaspre i promise it the doors to the salon opened and dame cecily and the children entered edmond de beaumont noted the proud loving look on skyes face but remembering her manners she introduced him to sir roberts sister before drawing her children forward to meet him dame cecily warned to his size greeted him courteously before turning to her brother saying i heard you roaring like a lion all the way to the second landing robert i hope that you are not giving msieur de beaumont a bad impression of england and the english on the contrary madam edmond de beaumont quickly interjected your brother has given me the very best possible impression of the english i want you to meet my children edmond skye now said this she gestured gracefully with her hand to a tall boy who looked so very much like her is my son murrough oflaherty the boy dressed elegantly in black velvet white silk and lace bowed beautifully a lock of his hair falling across his forehead as he lowered his head msieur de beaumont i am pleased to greetyouhe said in a voice that edmond could hear was but newly changed and i you sir edmond replied courteously my daughter willow skye said and willow gowned in red velvet curtseyed prettily edmond de beaumont bowed in return mademoiselle willow my son robin the earl of lynmouth skye said msieur de beaumont edmond looked at the slender boy in skyblue velvet and exquisitely done lace his features were incredibly beautiful if slightly arrogant the boy had dark blond hair and unusual limegreen eyes he was obviously his fathers son my lord earl edmond de beaumont said politely and then turned to skye you have fine children madam if these three are an example i only wish my uncle could see them should our mothers marriage to your uncle prove a felicitous union murrough oflaherty said then your uncle will meet us all msieur our duties here in england can spare us for a short time edmond de beaumont was amused the older boy was obviously spokesman for his younger brother and sister despite the disparity in their ranks the children were obviously disapproving of their mothers marriage and who could blame them i hope you will come to beaumont de jaspre soon he said you will like our small country the weather is like summer most of the year round and the sea bathing most delightful i have never bathed in the sea willow said ah mademoiselle said edmond de beaumont looking up at her i shall take you myself when you come our sea is the blue of your english sky and as clear as crystal the water is warm and the sea bottom golden sand can you swim willow shook her head then i shall teach you mademoiselle would you like that oh yes msieur willows face was pink with pleasure and edmond noted to himself that she too must favor her father will you teach me to swim too robin asked indeed my lord it would be my pleasure edmond replied i know how murrough said loftily my brother and i learned early we are a seafaring family msieur can you sail sir edmond de beaumont demanded l can then you also will enjoy beaumont de jaspre the sea about us makes for excellent sailing perhaps msieur but i doubt that your waters can equal our fine irish seas murrough skye was somewhat shocked by her elder sons intractable attitude please tender your apologies to msieur de beaumont for what the boy looked surprised our irish seas are true seas worthy of our seafaring talents i have been told that the mediterranean is naught but a placid turkish lake edmond de beaumont laughed heartily indeed the turks seem to think so young murrough oflaherty but would you not enjoy going turkhunting in your own ship someday murroughs face lit up with a smile indeed msieur i would then perhaps you will use beaumont de jaspres fine harbor facilities for your home base after all young murrough your mother will be our duchesse the boy nodded it is a good deepwater harbor msieur it is murrough smiled again then perhaps i shall not find your beaumont de jaspre such a dull place after all msieur skye looked in annoyance at her elder son i dont know what has gotten into him she said to edmond growing pains i suspect plus the fart that he really doesnt like to see you leave england edmond remarked he is very protective of me she said softly how funny it is that my son should be so murrough had moved away from them now settling himself with his younger siblings robbie and dame cecily were having a cozy chat by the fireplace skye sat herself down in a black oak chair with a tapestried seat and back edmond de beaumont sat by her side i do not think it strange that your son is protective of you he said i find it charming and very touching i am going to miss my children edmond this is what makes it hard for me to go willingly to your uncle it will only be for a short while he reassured her you have been separated from them before my uncle loves children and will welcome yours you will give him children of his own too you are a healthy beautiful woman and he needs you very much let me take you to beaumont de jaspre to a man who will love and cherish you my uncle fabron needs you skye he truly needs you she sighed we will travel on my own ship she said and the queen must give us an escort to get us safely past the barbary pirates and we leave he cocked his handsome head to one side will the beginning of may suit msieur there was a small smile upon her beautiful face you will not regret your decision to come to beaumont de jaspre skye he said fervently i hope not edmond she said quietly i hope not chapter adam de marisco had read skyes message and his first thought was to refuse her another meeting between them was sure to result in one of their passionate couplings he had never known a woman who was so sexually attuned to him to even think about her was to want her unbearably damn he growled softly he loved her so terribly but he had always known that he would never have her permanently his small kingdom this island of lundy was all he had ever really claimed oh he had had his time in the outside world his lovely mother was a frenchwoman and he had spent many years at the elegant french court but in the end he had returned to this small lonely rock that was his heritage and his inheritance he had known for many years that his seed was barren the result of a childhood fever and so he had never married he enjoyed women but until he had met skye omalley there had never been one he wanted to keep but he wasnt enough for her oh sexually he was more than her equal and his family tree was as noble as hers but he was a simple man an island lord a man of no power or influence he might have been he had the wealth necessary for both power and influence but he had chosen to avoid such responsibilities court intrigues were simply not in his nature not that they were in hers but she was a beautiful woman a woman who had had several husbands of wealth and stature that was her right it never occurred to adam de marisco that skye would have been happier living a quiet life he loved her too deeply to see clearly in the end however his great love for her won out over his common sense he traveled to london to bid her farewell it was very likely that they would never see each other again he would return to lundy and she would travel on to a small mediterranean duchy where she would undoubtedly live out her life the wife of a wealthy lordling who would be welcome at both the french and the english courts his big heart leapt in his chest as he entered greenwood and she flung herself into his arms in greeting with a helpless groan he buried his face in her hair her glorious perfumed hair adam oh my darling adam i knew that you would come i told robbie that you would she snuggled into his arms when do you leave he asked her dreading the answer a few days she squirmed from his bearlike grasp and looked up at him dont i get a kiss she demanded yes he said slowly as all his good intentions and his willpower disappeared yes i think you most certainly do get a kiss and then his shaggy head dipped downward his mouth found hers and he mercilessly took possession of it her lips softened beneath his parting just slightly enough to pleasure enough to tempt him onward witch he muttered against her mouth how is it you can wreak this mayhem with me his big hand gently caressed her upturned face im so glad that you came she answered him i dont think i could have borne to go away and never see you again then quick tears came to her eyes oh adam why are you so stubborn i have been bartered into a marriage with a stranger if only you had married me i should not be forced from my homeland and my children what could i offer you skye lundy he laughed harshly i once told you that i was not a star catcher and you were a bright and brilliant star how could i pen up a star skye you have always deserved more than i could give you i dont need things adam you could have given me the one thing in this world that i need you could have given me love my darling but you could not have given me the same in return skye he said seriously we have been over this a hundred times and it always comes to the same thing i love you as i have never loved another woman in my life and you love me you do not however love me as a woman should love a man you love me as a friend and that is not enough little girl i have my pride too skye omalley youre too much of a romantic adam you will not have me because i love you as a friend but you will stand by while i am sent away to marry a virtual stranger who from the looks of him never loved anyone somehow your logic escapes me adam he chuckled if this duc of yours turns out to be the great love of your life skye you will thank me i think instead i shall make you regret your foolishness she said ominously her slender hands slipping beneath his doublet to rub against his silkcovered chest shall i make you regret your decision adam he could feel the warmth of her palms through the fabric of his shirt will you be my lover just this once more she whispered boldly standing on her toes so she might kiss him in the sensitive spot just beneath his ear she could feel his mighty heart pounding beneath her hands youre a betrothed woman he protested faintly but his hands were already pulling her closer to him she nibbled upon his earlobe i may never see you again my darling she said low and then she ran her little pointed tongue around the inner shell of his ear why are you doing this it was his last defense because in four days i am sailing to a place i dont know i will marry a man i dont know and then i will get into bed with him and he will mate with me like some animal for that is all he wants of me adam heirs heirs for his tiny duchy and for my body my healthy and proven fertile body he will give england a safe harbor on the mediterranean and a listening post at frances back door for my part i have the queen of englands word that she will not allow her angloirish lordsor anyone else for that matterto pillage my burke sons lands this is not a love match adam it is a business arrangement and so before i leave all that is familiar and dear to me i want a little loving a little tenderness a little caring with someone that i care for adam de marisco damn you skye he said softly then enfolded her back into his arms she sighed with such obvious relief that he laughed gently and smoothed her dark hair ive never known such an honest woman as you are my darling sometimes it can be a little bit frightening edmond de beaumont watching all of this from behind the bannisters on the secondfloor landing of skyes house could not quite make out the words said between the two people below what was obvious was that the giant of a man was deeply in love with lady burke and she cared for him also as the young earl of lynmouth came abreast of him edmond asked the boy who is that man with your mama robin robin southwood looked to the main floor of the house and a smile lit his beautiful features ignoring the petit sieur de beaumont he ran downstairs calling uncle adam what are you doing in london pure delight was written all over his young face edmond de beaumont hurried after the boy in time to hear the giant reply in a thunderdeep voice as he swept the lad up into an embrace i have come to bid your mother a safe voyage my lord earl have you come from your duties at court to do the same we have been here almost a whole month uncle adam willow and murrough and me we have gone riding with mother and we have gone on picnics and we have shopped and seen the dressmaker mothers having all new gowns made for the climate in beaumont de jaspre is warm almost year round edmond says so and who is edmond my lord earl i am edmond de beaumont a voice replied and adam de marisco looked about puzzled he could see no one i am down here msieur the voice came again and adam de marisco looked down i am edmond de beaumont petit sieur de beaumont he repeated adam was astounded is this the man you are to marry he demanded his voice tight no adam this is his nephew sent to escort me to beaumont de jaspre is the duc as he adam was considering throttling william cecil i msieur am an accident of birth edmond said my uncle is quite as other people i assure you edmond this is adam de marisco the lord of lundy island remember that i told you i had two best friends in this world well this is the other adam de marisco looked down at edmond de beaumont and then he bent and lifted the dwarf up balancing him so that he sat in the curve of his muscled arm so that they were eye to eye this is how two men should speak msieur he said agreed my lord giant how tall are you i stand six feet six inches replied adam then you are nearly twice my size for i stand but three feet four inches skye stood amazed as adam walked calmly off holding edmond de beaumont upon his arm the two men now talking in earnest what an excellent way for them to speak robin observed how clever of uncle adam to think of it skye smiled to herself it was clever of adam but then he had always had the knack of putting people at their ease elizabeth tudors court had really lost a valuable courtier in him though he preferred his island home to london and she could not blame him at all when edmond de beaumont had returned to whitehall robbie gone off prowling the seamier sections of london and dame cecily and the children settled themselves for the night then and only then did skye and adam come together again she had ordered her cook to prepare a supper for two choosing the menu herself for adam was somewhat of a gourmet due to his days in france they would begin with mussels in a white wine broth and thinsliced dover sole with carved lemon wedges followed with a second course that was simplicity itself boned breast of capon upon a bed of watercress with a delicate gravy of champignons and white wine a salad of new lettuces and radishes freshly baked bread and newly churned sweet butter and lastly fresh strawberries with thick clotted devon cream it was a plain meal but one that skye knew would delight adam her mode of dress would also delight him for she was wearing one of her algerian caftans a rosecolored silk garment with wide long sleeves and an open neckline with tiny pearl buttons that moved downward from just below her breasts her slippers were delightful confections of matching silk heelless with turnedup toes her hair was loose freshly washed and sundried that afternoon she wore no jewelry i dont know why you didnt marry the lord of lundy daisy remarked to her mistress because he wouldnt have me skye replied go on with yese mlady daisy was astounded yere running with me no im not daisy he thinks that i should have a great and powerful lord for a husband not a simple island chieftain then hes a fool daisy said bluntly as a knock sounded at skyes bedchamber door open the door daisy her mistress commanded and then you may retire for the evening the supper is safe on the sideboard and ill not need you for anything else tonight daisy curtseyed and opened the door to admit adam de marisco good evening rnlord she said brightly curtseying again and then she was gone closing the door behind her youre beautiful he sajd quietly his smoky blue eyes devouring her with love she smiled back at him ive had my cook prepare you a delicious gourmet meal youre the only thing i want tonight skye he reached out for her but she easily sidestepped him would you offend my cook her blue eyes were dancing with merriment if you leave this marvelous supper untouched you will cause a scandal for my household will ask why when i went to the trouble to have a supper prepared for us we did not eat it one kiss you irish witch he said one kiss and i am lost you villain i see i must treat you like my children you cannot play adam until you have eaten your supper she attempted to look stern and he laughed very well i shall eat settling himself in one of the two chairs that had been placed on either end of the small rectangular oak table he waited as skye served him a plate of steaming mussels and poured him a goblet of pale golden wine she seated herself and silently they ate the first course clearing the table she offered the second and he hummed his approval your cook had a french teacher skye lass ive not tasted this dish since i was last in paris the mushrooms are exquisitely fresh and the wine sauce as delicate as any ive ever tasted i will tender my compliments in the morning she smiled at his pleasure but ate little they were going to make love soon she knew despite the fact that he had sworn never again to be her lover as she absently nibbled on a radish she wondered why it was she did not love him with the passionate and allconsuming love that she had felt for her last three husbands they too had been her friends they too had been as skilled and as tender as adam was at lovemaking geoffrey and niall and khalid had all been vital interesting ambitious men adam was certainly vital and interesting but he was not ambitious he was content to sit upon his island and that was not enough for her for all her desire for a quiet life skye knew that she was never happier than when she was in the midst of things adam however wanted peace and if the price of his peace was to sit upon lundy growing old never having a true and abiding love then he would pay that price she wondered why he had insulated himself so it was not the decision of an intelligent man and adam de marisco was an extremely intelligent man suddenly she was aware that he was staring at her and she raised her eyes to his a guilty blush coloring her cheeks his smoky blue eyes were very serious and for a brief moment she wondered if he could have been reading her thoughts i was just thinking she said lamely about me about us yes and have you decided that perhaps it is not a good idea that we be lovers again skye no i have decided that there is a mystery about you adam i know now what it is that keeps me from loving you with all my being you dont love me enough to fight for me adam he looked stunned thats not so skye yes adam it is you say you love me but that you cannot marry me because i deserve a powerful man for a husband and you are a simple island chieftain well adam de marisco money buys power and we both have gold enough to spare you say that you cannot wed with me because one day i might meet the great love of my life and stay with you out of misguided loyalty making myself unhappy which you could not bear with the exception of my first husband i have loved completely and well all my other husbands none was ever slow to take me to wife for fear i might meet someone else later on in my life they wanted me enough to overcome all obstacles yet you will not take such a chance in a few short days i will leave england for what cecil promised me would be a shortlived marriage to an ill man the duc de beaumont de jaspre is not however either elderly or ill according to his nephew he is a healthy man in early middle life i may never see cither you or my own ireland again and believe me adam this marriage is not a love match she stood up and moving to the sideboard opened a drawer and took out a miniature here she said handing him the tiny painting look upon the face of my betrothed and tell me if that looks like a man who will be a great love to me it is a cold face adam and his eyes frighten me his nephews reassurances are not encouraging although edmond seems to have a genuine affection for the duc so i must go to the powerful husband you felt best for me my darling but before i go we will have a glorious few days we deserve it adam and perhaps in that time you will tell me why you have not loved me enough to fight for me which my dearest is why i have never been able to love you completely you lack ambition adam and i wonder why and do you intend to punish me for it he queried her no adam i intend to love you as i have always loved you perhaps not enough to satisfy your vanity but then you have not given completely of yourself either one gets out of a relationship what one puts into it put this thing away he said sharply handing her the miniature back she took it from him and replaced it in the drawer of the sideboard a tiny smile touched the corners of her mouth she had at last reached him true it was too late now for them to do anything about being married that opportunity was gone and she would keep her word to elizabeth tudor but if she had roused adam enough then perhaps he might find someone to really love she hated the thought of his being alone even though she knew it would take a very special girl to love adam de marisco and to live with him on lundy coming back to the table skye brought with her a basket of early strawberries and bowls of clotted cream and sugar set upon a silver tray setting them down she plucked a large berry from the basket dipped it in the sugar swirled it in the thick cream and popped it into her mouth neatly detaching the stem and leaves he grinned at her relieved then standing up he said later lecher she purred at him holding her ground his smoky blue eyes narrowed with contemplation and then reaching out he slowly began to unbutton her rosecolored caftan his big fingers surprisingly nimble with the tiny pearl buttons skye started unbuttoning the silver buttons on his padded dark blue velvet doublet he unbuttoned her to the navel and slid his hands inside the gown to fondle her breasts delighting in her nipples which hardened at his gentle touch thrusting forward like thorns on a rose to push against his palms she pushed his doublet off and loosened his shirt at the neckband it opened easily beneath her touch baring him to the waist playfully her slender fingers marched up his chest through the dark mat of hair to clasp themselves about his neck his hands slid upward to work her caftan off her shoulders it fell with a silken hiss to her ankles leaving her nude his hands moved to tangle themselves in the heavy raven mass of her hair drawing her head to him so he might kiss her he hesitated just a second long enough to see her gorgeous eyes close the thick dark lashes fluttering like dragonflies upon the soft pink of her cheeks only then did his sensuous mouth begin a delicate exploration of hers he kissed her as if it were the very first time tenderly tasting her lips sending delightful shivers of anticipation up and down her spine he felt her response and exerted more pressure upon her mouth gently forcing it open his tongue plunged into that sweet cavern to dance a mad caper with hers until suddenly they were stroking each other with sensuous abandon their passions flamed simultaneously as he tore his mouth away from hers and began kissing her closed eyes her cheekbones the corners of her mouth her determined chin the elegant tip of her nose with hungry ardor while she moved her hands to pull frantically at his shirt to loosen his breeches sweet skye he murmured softly sweet sweet skye she succeeded with his shirt but before she could entangle him in his halfloosened breeches he swept her up in his arms and carried her to the bed nay my love i can do that faster and a great deal more easily than you can he gently admonished her then do it dammit adam i am not ashamed to admit that i want you and i want you now he threw his great leonine head back and laughed with pure delight gods nightshirt skye youre an incredible woman you want me and you tell me so well my blueeyed celtic witch i want you also and i suddenly find that i want you for all times not just a few nights what have i done to us in my pride skye she reached up and drew his big body down to hers later she soothed him we will speak on it later my darling he didnt argue his hands were sliding down her long torso molding themselves along her waist filling themselves with her hips caressing her long legs she kissed his face ardently and he groaned with the total pleasure that was beginning to envelope them she lay upon her back and he said in a quiet voice i dont want you to do anything sweet skye but let me love you let me adore the perfection of your beautiful body for tonight at least you belong to me he lowered his head and with his hot tongue began an encirclement of her nipple around and around and around until she began to whimper deep within her throat and he took the entire nipple in his mouth sucking hard sending a knifesharp pulse of rapture through her body he began again this time with the other nipple and when he felt her trembling like a small wild thing beneath him he ceased the torture moving his large body down the bed taking one of her slender feet in his hands he kissed it then began licking it sensuously his tongue thrusting between the toes slipping along the outside curve of the arch his hungry mouth kissed his tongue lapped tenderly in the hollows of her ankle and when he reached her knee he began again with the other foot pulling himself back up level with her he licked her chest and quivering breasts his tongue slid easily over her torso not missing an inch of skin as he moved along he turned her over and she felt the warm wetness against her shoulders along her spine the curve of her waist the mounds of her bottom the length of her legs the soles of her feet dear jesu adam she gasped stop you will drive me mad he rolled her onto her back again then we shall be mad together sweet skye he said and lowered his head once more this time his tongue snaking out to touch her in her most sensitive place ohh yes she breathed as she began to flame wildly beneath his impassioned touch her beautiful body twisting under his hungry mouth he felt as if he would burst with his desire as he tasted and breathed the musky sweetness of her finally he could no longer control his own passions and raising his head he drew himself up swinging over her to thrust within her honied sheath like some unearthly creature she wrapped herself about him moaning wildly pushing her hips up to meet his frantic rhythm a soft scream told him that she was near her release and mercilessly he pushed her to the brink only to force her back she cursed him furiously and he laughed softly admonishing her you hurry too much i hate you she gasped you want me he countered and i want you i have always tried to teach you patience in pleasure give me release she begged in answer he drove deep into her forcing her body into the mattress with each downward plunge of his hips she had been grasping him tightly with her hands but now his subtle torture sent her sharp nails clawing down his back bitch he groaned and then he took her mouth in a savage kiss forcing her lips apart to catch her tongue which he proceeded to suck fiercely skye thought she would die in that very minute her love juices released themselves in a hot wild rush crowning the head of his throbbing manhood which liberated its own salute to her in the same instant they shuddered together lost in a world of whitehot desire that drained them leaving them weakened and only halfconscious he rolled off her and instinctively she sought for the comfort of his embrace his strong arms tightened about her as her head fitted itself into the hollow of his shoulder his breathing was ragged hers came in soft pants his big hand began to stroke her gentle long touches that soothed them both he sighed and then began you know that i am unable to have children as a young boy i suffered a severe fever that burned the life from my seed praise god it never destroyed my enjoyment of the fair sex but i cannot give a woman a child i learned my fate when i was twenty and had already fallen in love with a girl i sought to marry i might have said nothing and let her believe that it was she who could not conceive but instead i was honest with her and her family her father said he would rather she enter a convent than be childless my love said that if i could not be a real man she didnt want me he sighed again her father was a downattheheels french count she was his eighth child fifth daughter her dowry so small that not even a religious order would have her as they later found i loved her back then skye i do not love her now and yet i can still hear her voice condemning me for my lack of manhood for my inability to father a son on her or any other woman i left france then and returned to lundy i had been its lord since i was ten when my father had died my mother returned to france with me and my two younger sisters a year after his death she remarried when i was twelve and gave her new husband several children after my betrothal was broken lundy was my refuge and no one there knew or cared about my inability i am known as the lusty lord of lundy for my prodigious appetite for women several have even claimed their bastards are mine and i have paid them off glad to have my prowess attested to but i know the truth then you came into my life skye and i loved again but i never admitted it to you i have never admitted it aloud even to myself not until now i have always called you a star a bright and shining star and so you are my darling in wealth we are equal in lands you far surpass me but it matters not for you know i care little for such things you have given children to each of your husbands skye and perhaps that is what bothered me if you wed with me you could have no other child i could not do that to you you were afraid i would scorn you she answered him yet on two occasions i have asked you to marry me adam and i have known for some time that your seed was barren ah he answered her if you had wed me after geoffrey had died then you would have once again been separated from niall burke you would not have had your little deirdre and your infant son padraic i will wager my love you dont regret those two innocents no i dont regret them adam but i wonder if the fates ever really meant for me to be wed to niall for years everything had conspired to keep us apart if i had not wed him then claire oflaherty would not have revenged herself upon him for there would have been no need now he is dead and because i must protect those two burke children i have accepted marriage to a man i dont even know how much simpler had you wed me my darling my dearest dearest adam i could love you really love you had you cared enough to fight for me you feared getting hurt again more than you wanted me as your wife and if i suddenly changed my mind skye would you marry me i would have adam but it is too late now i cannot break my word to the queen we have an agreement for better or worse and i will keep my part of that agreement as long as elizabeth tudor keeps faith with me had my marriage to you been a fact and had i then gone to cecil the burke lands might have been safe by virtue of my strong new husband i however went helpless to the queen and she took the opportunity to use me for her own ends cecil knows that my word is my bond how i love you he whispered against her hair and what a fool i have been my sweet skye we have the next few days adam and when i am gone i want you to find yourself another woman to love if that french girl had really loved you your barren seed would not have bothered her she was not worthy of you adam but somewhere there is a girl or a woman who is someone who will love you for yourself not for what you can or cannot give her do not be afraid to seek that woman out my darling when khalid el bey died i told robbie i should never love again that loving only led to pain but without the pain adam how can one know or enjoy the sweetness there may be pain in your search but when you find your love it will be all the better for the pain he hugged her close and she snuggled deeper into his big shoulder not seeing the tears in his smoky blue eyes as he turned his head away from her he knew that she was right and having unburdened himself to her he felt better than he had in years still with the unburdening came the terrible knowledge that he loved her deeply perhaps too deeply to ever love another woman again only time would tell the answer but at least they had the next few days to be together to love each other to make memories to carry them through the long years he envisioned ahead for two days and two nights they stayed within her rooms talking and loving and even fighting a bit over what she termed his monumentally stubborn nature and he termed her irish pigheadedness the children joined them in the afternoons to chatter and play their games though only young murrough oflaherty understood the relationship between his mother and adam de marisco why didnt you marry him he asked his mother in a private moment when robin and willow were totally engrossed in some tale that adam was telling them because he didnt ask me in rime she answered murrough nodded i dont suppose you could get the queen to change her mind mother then you could stay here and we should not lose you to some strange land and a man whom we do not know could you ask her majesty she admires you very much skye hugged her son lightly i wish it were possible my love but it is not the duc has been sent word of my coming as well as my miniature he would be greatly offended if a substitute bride were sent we could say you died murrough suggested hopefully i do not think that msieur de beaumont would lie to his uncle my love i am afraid i must go she patted murrough it will be all right my son it will be all right they went to court the next day an unusually hot one for early may and skye wore one of her new gowns a beautiful dress made just for beaumont de jaspre it was a limegreencolored silk its underskirt embroidered with gold thread flowers and butterflies the sleeves sheer and full to just below the elbow her forearms bare the neckline extremely low in the french fashion several gentlemen of the court gaped quite openly as she glided by them flanked by adam de marisco and sir robert small tis my emeralds no doubt that fascinate them she teased her escorts and both men chuckled in spite of themselves ah now robbie countered and i was thinking that it was the roses in your hair garbed in red velvet and cloth of gold the queen awaited them her long graceful hands were outstreched in welcome dearest skye her smile was friendly so you come to bid us farewell her gaze swept skye appraisingly i know the duc will appreciate our generosity in sending him one of this nations most beautiful women to wife your majesty is most gracious skye answered her eyes modestly lowered yes elizabeth purred in subtle warning i am my fathers daughter in many ways she smiled again you will be pleased to know dear skye that i have confirmed your sons rights and appointed his granduncle the bishop of connaught as his guardian in your absence she lowered her voice you need have no fear dearest skye the english and the angloirish in the dublin pale have been warned that any breach of my sworn word to you will be considered by me as a personal affront as to your own wild irish neighbors your uncle will have to contend with them thank you majesty she replied i am grateful to you and i will do my part and we all envy the duc lord dudley murmured for i can vouch that lady burke knows how to please a man well why is it lord dudley skye asked sweetly that your bravery only comes to the fore when you are surrounded by others since you have certainly never pleased me i cannot know how it is you know that i please a man well robbie and adam dropped their hands from their swords they did not need to protect skye in this instance she fought dudley far better with words than they could have with swords while the queen and the courtiers about them chuckled at the pompous earl of leicesters discomfort skye said in honied tones your majesty knows my two sons murrough oflaherty and robin southwood but i have brought my daughter willow to greet you elizabeth tudor turned a kindly glance upon willow totally adorable in a burgundycolored silk gown willow curtseyed gracefully gaining further approval from the queen how old are you my child she demanded i have just had my ninth birthday your majesty willow replied and what do you study you do study aye madam i study french latin and greek as well as mathematics music and philosophy mama says i must begin italian and spanish as well this year i will one day have a great estate to administer the queen was amused as well as pleased had she a daughter of her own she would fully approve such a curriculum can you dance she asked willow aye madam the dancing master comes at eight in the morning four days weekly and the wifely arts mistress willow do you learn those also aye replied willow i like them although i love gardening best you are a good child i can see the queen said perhaps in another year or two your mama will allow you to come to court as one of my maids of honor would you like that mistress willow willows golden eyes grew round with delight and she looked to her mother oh mother may i she asked in a year or two skye answered if the queen still has need of you willow you may certainly come now please thank the queen for her kindness oh thank you madam willow said fervently curtseying again you are fortunate to have such a good little maid for a daughter elizabeth remarked i am fortunate in all my children skye replied even the babes i must leave behind the queen had the good grace to look momentarily uncomfortable but then she recovered quickly you will take the duc de beaumont de jaspre our personal greetings dear skye and you will tell him that england is grateful for the safety of his harbors as to the rest i know that i may rely upon you it was a dismissal and it was a warning skye curtseyed low and at least two of the gentlemen standing near the queen almost fell over in their efforts to gaze at her almost bare breasts have you really known her dudley one courtier asked shes as hot and juicy a piece as you could imagine in your wildest fantasies dudley replied low i had her right after her husband the earl of southwood died hed always kept her well serviced and she could hardly wait for me to put it in her oh yes my friend i know skye omalley well what a shame the queen is sending her away the courtier said dudley chuckled bess knows skye will make the duc a happy man and a happy man is a grateful man grateful to the england who gives him this delicious sugarplum to eat up the two men snickered lewdly but by then skye and her escort had already left the queens reception room when is the next tide skye asked robbie about six this evening he replied it doesnt give us much time does it well lets get back to greenwood my loves so that i may change they hurried through the corridors of whitehall palace to the old palace stairs the public landing on the river and there skyes barge awaited them the barge sped down the river to greenwood and skye flew into the house to change her clothing the undermaids hurriedly packed her beautiful gown away and the last of the trunks was sent on to the pool where skyes own flagship the seagull awaited her arrival edmond de beaumont was already aboard the ship and waiting having taken his leave of the queen the night before skye dressed in the clothes she habitually wore aboard ship a splitlegged skirt of light black wool naturalcolored woollen stockings and dark leather boots a creamcolored silk shirt and a wide leather belt with a silver buckle her black hair was twisted into one thick braid a simple hairstyle that would not blow into her eyes adam had sat watching her as she dressed handing her her garments in daisys place as the maid had been sent on ahead dont come with me to the ship skye said to him i dont think i can bear to see you receding as the ship sails off he nodded understanding and silently agreeing best that their goodbyes be said in private ill take murrough and robin back to whitehall and then tomorrow ill see dame cecily and willow safely back to devon he said will you keep an eye on the children for me adam not just here in england but in ireland as well my brother michael is a good man but hes a priest and uncle seamus is elderly far too elderly even to take on the responsibilities he has now my son ewan can use the strong influence of a real man she flung herself against his broad chest my babies she wept its so hard to leave the others but my babies are too young even to know me please look out for them adam i can trust you you will write to me he said it was more a statement than a question i will write to you she answered i will pray for you also he said quietly and she looked up at him startled he laughed i know men dont speak a great deal about god skye but i believe and i do pray tears moistened her eyes again i will pray for you also my darling i will pray that you find a woman to love and to keep he smiled down at her and then his lips met hers in a kiss of incredible sweetness their mouths melted into one another until there was no beginning and seemingly no end she wanted the kiss to go on forever for his touch had transported her beyond the world she knew and into a realm of light and love so pure that she knew nothing would ever be the same again for either of them she protested when he reluctantly lifted his head from hers his arm fell from about her waist and he touched her cheek lightly with his fingers farewell skye omalley farewell until we meet again then adam de marisco turned and left her for a moment skye stood rooted to the floor filled with a feeling of such terrible loss that she thought her heart would surely break if he had been a fool then she had been a bigger one she should have insisted that he marry her now it was too late mother she started at the sound of the voice and looking down saw her sons standing before her murrough robin she said we came to bid you farewell mother murrough said lord de marisco is going to take us back to whitehall now she bent down and hugged her elder son then straightening she took his face in her hand i am proud of you murrough oflaherty she said you are a good lad and i love you remember what we have spoken of and act accordingly only you can win your lands my son i know you will make me proud then she kissed him quickly and stepped back releasing him murroughs eyes were damp but he manfully forced back his tears i will make you proud mother and when you are settled you will let me come to you you will all come to see me she promised and then she turned to her younger son robin flung himself into her arms and although he was silent his little shoulders shook skye waited until he had composed himself robin like his father had great dignity finally he looked up at her and his mouth trembled as he said my father would not like this mother he would not approve of what the queen has done sending you from your children no robin she admitted geoffrey would not like what the queen has done but he would accept her decision and abide by it for your papa was in all things the queens most loyal servant whatever your feelings in this matter i expect you to do what your papa would have done he would have accepted the queens choice and so must you he would have accepted it with good grace and you must do the same she smoothed his wavy dark blond hair gently will you come to visit me my lord earl once i am settled if the queen will allow it mother he answered and she smiled and kissed him tenderly as i am proud of your brother so i am also proud of you robin you arc the youngest page at court and the queen says you are the best of her pages despite your youth continue to add lustre to the southwood family name my son she took the boys by the hands and walked with them to the door of her antechamber then quickly kissing each of them again she bade them farewell and thrust them from the room as the door closed behind them skye put her back to it and stuffed her fist into her mouth to prevent her cries from being heard by her sons they had both been so brave and she must not destroy their confidence in themselves or in her inwardly she cursed elizabeth tudor for her cruelty in sending her so far away the woman had no heart the tears poured down her face in a steady salty stream and when robbie knocked she did not hear him at first skye lass his voice cut into her sorrow turning she fumbled to open the door and when he pushed into the room she fell against his chest weeping its too much robbie she cried i dont think i can do it i dont think i can he held her and made soothing noises for that was all she really wanted she would go to beaumont de jaspre because she had promised the queen skye omalley had never been known to go back on her word and she wouldnt now for all her sorrow at parting from her children when he had decided that she had wept enough he said sharply are you forgetting willow skye lass will you go to her your eyes all puffy with evidence of weeping shes not a babe to gull you know skye drew in a deep breath and then she shuddered against him and pulled away im sorry robbie she said quietly but dammit i love my sons i know lass he said and taking her by the hand he led her back into her bedchamber pouring some cool water from a silver pitcher into the matching basin he pointed to it wash your face lass willow and cecily are waiting to bid us goodbye in the library gods foot shes like khalid shes always asking about cargo and the bills of lading for them shes more your heir than any of the boys and thats for certain shes your pet skye accused him and she bent to wash the evidence of tears from her face that she is robbie chuckled indulgently and skye was forced to laugh which made her feel better she took the linen towel that he handed her and dried both her face and her hands i am ready she said i dont feel so badly about willow for she is safe with your sister but when i thought of my two little boys at court with no one to protect them she sighed adam will protect them he told me before he left that he will spend his time going between devon the court and ireland checking on your children while you are away hes a good man and why you didnt marry him is beyond me why was it that everyone always assumed adam included that she wouldnt have him he wouldnt have me dammit she swore at robbie its twice hes turned me down because of some misguided notion now hes decided that he does love me that he does want me and its too bloody late he looked at her astounded the devil you say skye lass lets go robbie she said it isnt polite to keep a duc waiting and she stamped from the room gazing quickly about it for one last time who knew when she would see her london house again right now all she wanted was to go before the leaving killed her with sorrow in the library dame cecily and willow awaited skye willow ran to her mother as she entered the room hugging her hard and saying i shall miss you mama when will i see you again once i am settled i shall ask the duc if you and your brothers can come will you like that my darling i will be able to come back to england to be a maid of honor to the queen wont i mama willow looked very anxious and skye realized how glamorous and exciting the court must seem to a young girl if you continue to do all the things you should willow then i see no reason why you cannot go to court in a few years time i must have good reports from dame cecily though and you must make me proud when you come to beaumont de jaspre oh i will mama i promise you i shall be very good and i shall study my lessons hard when i go to court someday i shall outshine the queen herself it is not very wise to outshine elizabeth tudor willow that lesson your mama has learned skye gave robbie and dame cecily a wry smile and then said come now willow and bid me farewell it grows late and we cannot miss the tide she bent down and enfolded her daughter in her arms khalids daughter except this winter and the winter she had been in the tower she had never been separated from khalids daughter suddenly it was like losing him all over again and she began to feel teary once more she quickly regained control over her errant emotions and kissed her daughter twice once on each cheek adieu my dearest daughter she said softly farewell mama go in safety with gods blessing willow kissed her mother upon the lips and then quickly turned away before her mother might see her tears she knew full well how skye felt about leaving her children and she understood why she did it i will never be that vulnerable when i am grown up willow thought with the easy confidence of youth dame cecily and skye hugged each other and the older woman did not bother to hide her feelings big tears ran down her plump apple cheeks and she fumbled irritably for her handkerchief i shall miss you my dear she sniffled but i will take good care of willow for you skye that i can promise you i know you will look after willow with love skye replied what would she or i ever do without you dame cecily you have been like a mother to me and a grandmother to willow from the first i shall miss you also she hugged the old lady comforting her with the promise you must come with willow when robbie brings her to beaumont de jaspre edmond tells me it is a lovely country all flowers and sunshine well dame cecily said with a small sniffle ive never been one to travel and ive never been outside of england lord bless me ive only been to plymouth and london in my time but i might very well come with willow im not so old yet that im to be frightened by something new skye gave her old friend another hug then come with willow when she comes she said skye lass its growing late now robbie admonished the two women hugged a final time and then skye caught her daughter to her once more be good my little love she said and then releasing willow she almost ran out the door they hurried through the gardens of greenwood house down to the private landing where skyes barge awaited them the glory of the day had not abated one bit even now in the late afternoon the flowering trees scented the air and already blossoms were beginning to fall drifting like bits of pink and white silk along the rivers green edge she looked back only once and then the tears filled her eyes so quickly she couldnt really see turning she climbed into her barge it was better that way there were so many memories memories of her first trip to london of geoffrey of their falling in love of lynmouth house right next to greenwood of niall and of robins birth upon this very river in this very barge she had not felt this way since she had fled algiers it was as if one door was closing firmly upon her and although another door loomed open and inviting through it was the unknown the unknown had always frightened her the river traffic was light at the moment business was done for the day and it was yet too early for the pleasures of the evening to begin independent watermen looking for fares to take from one landing of the city to another poled about the river calling out to likelylooking customers along the river banks they entered the london pool and skyes bargeman steered them skillfully through the many merchantmen and galleons moored or awaiting departure her heart quickened as she saw the seagull and the mermaid next to each other the queen did provide us with a strong escort didnt she robbie skye queried him aye lass well be traveling with a total of ten ships the escort is led and commanded by a young gentleman from devon named francis drake hes a competent seaman but god help the moors if they attack us hes the fiercest fighter ive ever known if he doesnt manage to get himself killed hell one day amount to something ive not a doubt the river barge bobbed and bumped itself against the seagull and skye stood up calling out ahoy seagull where are you macguire kelly im coming aboard she grasped at the rope ladder hanging from the side of the ship and climbed up to the main deck of the vessel clambering over the ships rail she looked back down into the barge go on to your ship robbie weve no time to visit now the tides about to turn aye lass ill see you later he said and then the barge moved off across the space of water separating the two ships so there you are at last skye omalley sean macguire stood before her on his sturdy sea legs good afternoon to you macguire skye said thank you for bringing seagull safely to me yere so grateful that youve put another captain aboard he complained to her bran kelly is merely an extra man macguire if youre annoyed hes just as annoyed i took him from his own command to sail with me on seagull im going into an unknown situation in beaumont de jaspre macguire i want my own people about me you understand that aye he grudgingly gave in to her i dont know why you have to run off and marry some foreigner anyways mistress skye i made a bargain with the queen macguire shes not our queen skye snorted her impatience ireland has no queen macguire it has no king what it has is a thousand lordlings a thousand cocks each on its own dung heap crowing its own song do you know the song those cocks sing macguire they sing of freedom from england and the english but not one of those cocks would give up his rights to another man so that ireland could be united under one irish king so we might drive the english from our homeland and be ruled by an irish king no my old friend they sing they get drunk they weep of the grand great days of yore but in the end they do nothing except make widows and orphans is it a wonder the english abuse us well if thats the way its to be then i must think of my own first england rules ireland and ill not lose the burke lands over a dream the price of the queens protection is that i marry this duc and i will marry him i will marry him lest niall and the old macwilliam rise from their graves to haunt me for losing what the burkes have fought and died over for a thousand years now you nosy old man thats the last ill speak on it he grinned wickedly at her and drawing his pipe from his pocket he lit it you neednt get huffy skye omalley i remember you when you were wearing nappies and crawling about the decks of yer fathers ship may god assoil his noble soul are we sailing on this tide or not she demanded attempting to regain her dignity it was damned well time macguire retired but she knew hed die aboard his ship one day as her father had done if ye werent so busy talking lass youd see that weve already weighed anchor and are underway he chuckled at her chagrin youll find that pretty piece that serves you as well as the little foreign lord waiting you in your dayroom wheres kelly sleeping its agreed between us that ill captain the ship during the day and he at night she nodded a wise decision considering weve got to avoid the french the spanish and the barbary pirates well get there safe and sound mistress skye he said puffing comfortably on his pipe by evening they had rounded margate head and were out into the strait of dover the next morning they were in the english channel where a light but steady breeze and a spring rain and fog protected them and their escort from detection by any foreign vessels several days later the gray weather left them and they sailed briskly across the bay of biscay under bright blue skies they were far enough out to sea to avoid coastal vessels rounding cape finisterre brought them into the atlantic ocean the weather had been magnificent and skye was reminded of her first voyage to the mediterranean ten years ago had it really been ten years ago she gazed out over the dark blue sea to the cliffs of cape st vincent rising steep and redbrown above the water khalid geoffrey niall she shook her head all gone she seemed fated to be alone perhaps the duc would change her luck seagull mermaid and their escort sailed through the straits of gibraltar and into the mediterranean sea swinging north once more as they set a course for beaumont de jaspre several times now they sighted other vessels but the size of their escort discouraged any unfriendly encounters as they drew nearer to beaumont de jaspre skye thought that she would even welcome an encounter with barbary pirates anything to stave off the inevitable her arrivaland her marriage to a total stranger we should be docking in villerose in less than a half an hour mistress skye bran kelly told her coming into the dayroom where she was writing a letter to willow describing the voyage thank you bran she replied quietly and then turned to address the man across the room well edmond i have brought you safely home havent i her tone was affectionate and amused i admit i do not like sea travel he said but this voyage has been magnificent skye it would have been quicker if we had crossed the english channel and driven across france however quicker if the french allowed elizabeth tudors emissary free access to their roads and inns do you think they would have edmond he chuckled and hopped down from the window seat in the stern window where he had been sitting stand up skye and let me have a good look at you finished with the letter she pushed it aside and stood up she wore an exquisite gown of delicate lilaccolored silk styled in the italian manner the skirt was full over several starched petticoats the underskirt embroidered in silver thread and pink glass beads showing a design of windflowers and dainty fluttering moths the sleeves of the gown were full to the midam and slashed to show a lilac and silverstriped fabric beneath the neckline was low and draped with a soft lilac silkkerchief added for modestys sake about her neck skye had chosen to wear a dainty necklace of small pearls and amethysts set in gold and from her ears bobbed pearls falling from amethyst studs her hair was parted in the center and drawn back over her small ears into a full chignon that had been dressed with purple silk parma violets and white silk rosebuds you are incredibly beautiful edmond de beaumont said quietly how can my uncle fail to love you skye you are love incarnate you are extravagant in your praise edmond remember you have told me that your uncle is a reserved man perhaps i shall shock him rather than please him i have never liked arranged marriages for just this reason my first marriage was arranged when i was in the cradle and it was a disaster from the outset it is better that people get to know one another still i am older than when i was first married and your uncle has known sorrow also perhaps we can console each other and be happy in the bargain i know it can be so he said fervently be patient with him skye if anyone can reach him you can what a strange remark she thought but before she could ask him exactly what he meant captain macguire was entering the cabin to announce well were here and theres a pretty fancy carriage on the dock which i suspect is your betrotheds hell probably come aboard as soon as were moored securely she panicked where is robbie i must speak to robbie before i leave the ship easy lass macguire soothed her ill have mermaid signaled immediately youre as fretful as a virgin going to the marriage bed for the first time macguire she shouted at him outraged the old seaman chuckled and turning about left the day room you mustnt be fearful skye edmond de beaumont said my uncle is the kindest man alive you have nothing to fear from him she drew a deep breath dispelling some of her panic i dont know what came over me she said i am behaving like a green girl i shall go ashore edmond de beaumont said and greet my uncle then i shall bring him back to introduce him to you it will be far more private if you meet here for the first time than if you meet on the dock or at the palace he gave her a quick smile and then hurried out his short legs pumping eagerly she was alone for how long she wondered in a few minutes he would walk through the cabin door and she would no longer be free she did not delude herself that this would be like any of her other marriages lord burghley had sworn that the duc would sign the marriage contracts that left her her own mistress but then lord burghley had also sworn that the duc was old and ill which his nephew had most certainly attested he was not edmond had signed the contracts for his uncle in england but fabron de beaumont must ratify them she would insist he do so before she wed him it was the only way she could not after all these years find herself at anyone elses mercy it was bad enough to be wedding a stranger the door to her dayroom opened and robbie came in it looks a fair place skye lass he said she nodded macguire signaled you wanted to see me youll not leave me robbie her voice was anxious ill not leave you skye youre my lass ill be here whenever you want me he reached out and took her hands in his they were cold despite the warmth of the day hell love you and perhaps youll love him i dont know why im so nervous im a grown woman with four marriages behind me ive six children she whirled and her gown whirled with her gods nightshirt she swore using the queens favorite oath what is the matter with me nothing he said nothing that wont be solved by your meeting the duc and getting to know him theres no time we are to be married immediately edmond told me that that was the agreement but robbie you must stand behind me i wont marry the man until he ratifies the marriage contracts agreeing that what is mine remains mine i wont even get off seagull until that is settled youll help me i will handle it for you my dear he said let me do it these mediterranean types are not your englishman oh yes robbie please take care of it for me a knock sounded at the cabin door skye froze but robbie said in a loud voice enter the door opened and edmond de beaumont entered followed by another gentleman fabron de beaumonts almondshaped eyes widened just slightly but other than that he showed no emotion his expression remained unsmiling he was exactly as edmond had painted him a serious aristocratic man of medium height with fierce dark eyes and severely cropped curly black hair it worried skye that she could see no emotion in those eyes but then perhaps he was as nervous of her as she was of him if edmond had been flattering at all to his uncle it was only in the fact that he had softened the ducs sharp features the long narrow nose the large thin mouth the very square jaw for a long moment there was silence in the room and then edmond spoke lady burke may i present to you my uncle the duc de beaumont de jaspre skye curtseyed gracefully uncle fabron may i present to you lady burke your betrothed welcome to beaumont de jaspre madame the duc said his voice was deep but musical in tone thank you monseigneur was her reply uncle this is sir robert small lady burkes business partner fabron de beaumont raised an elegant eyebrow my nephew tells me that you are a woman of commerce madame is it true yes monseigneur skye looked to robbie clearing his throat he said there is the matter of the ratification of the marriage contracts msieur le duc i must read them first was the reply then i will get them robbie said quietly the queen has forbidden lady burke to leave her vessel until the contracts have your signature until then she must remain on what is technically english soil but the marriage ceremony is set for this evening the duc protested there is nothing unusual about the contracts msieur le duc lady burke brings you a very generous dowry but the contracts permit her to keep her own wealth and to continue to administer her lands and those of her children but that is outrageous nonetheless msieur le duc that is what the contracts say englishwomen are perhaps more independent than other women but certainly that is why you wanted a wife from bess tudors court robbie smiled in a mantoman fashion at the duc your nephew saw nothing unusual in lady burkes request when lord burghley explained it to him he signed believing you would agree with him lady burkes dowry is very generous do you believe yourself capable of administering such wealth madame the duc looked closely at skye i have been my own mistress in such things monseigneur since my fathers death it was he who put me in charge of his fleets and his wealth until my brothers were old enough to manage at their request i still manage both my familys ships and their monies and what else do you manage madame the estates of my young son the earl of lynmouth and of my eldest son ewan oflaherty although ewan will be old enough in another two years to manage on his own then there are the estates of my youngest son padraic in ireland and my daughter willows wealth from her father my second husband then too there is my own wealth monseigneur from commercial enterprises in which i am engaged with sir robert you take a great deal upon such beautiful shoulders madame he noted nonetheless i am capable of it monseigneur she countered a womans first duty is to give her husband heirs and to raise those children you will not find me lacking there monseigneur i have given children to all of my husbandsfive sons of whom four are living and two daughters he nodded and would you indeed refuse to marry me if i refuse to sign and ratify this marriage contract yes monseigneur i would skye answered and she lifted her chin slightly as she said the words you are a woman of strong character i can see the duc replied but that can be a good trait in a woman if you pass it on to our sons i trust you will do so madame there was just the faintest hint of amusement in his voice i will try she answered him in as serious a tone then there is nothing for it but i must sign the contracts he answered taking them from robbie edmond de beaumont quickly handed his uncle an inked quill from skyes desk and the duc as quickly wrote his signature at the assigned place skye then came forward to place her own signature upon the documents she had refused to sign them in england protesting that until the duc himself agreed to her demands her signature was not necessary you sign yourself skye omalley madame the duc noted it is simpler monseigneur that i use my maiden name i have had four husbands and all their names added to my own would make another document she looked up at him with her marvelous kerryblue eyes and the duc allowed himself a small smile now that the formalities are over madame will you allow me to escort you to your new home he held out his hand to her and after a small hesitation she placed her hand in his his grasp was firm i have planned that we be married immediately he told her as he led her from the ship and up to his carriage nervously she looked about to see that robbie was coming too noting it he asked are you afraid of me madame your eyes constantly seek out msieur robert i have never married a stranger before she said quietly he nodded a difficult position for you i can see but i have never married a woman that i knew it didnt really matter madame they like you came to me for but one purpose to give me heirs pastor lichault says the bible claims that whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor of the lord king david wrote in his psalms lo children are a heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are the children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed i however am ashamed madam i have but one living child a babbling drooling idiot who can barely hold his own head up at the age of five the rest of my children either died in their mothers wombs or shortly after birth i want children i need heirs you have a fine heir in your nephew monseigneur she said yes edmond is a good man but he will not marry for fear of bearing children like himself and what normal maiden would allow herself to be possessed by the monster my nephew is if i die without heirs the french will take my duchy and beaumont de jaspre will cease to exist there have been ducs de beaumont de jaspre since the days of the great charlemagne that is why i have agreed to remarry i asked the queen of england for a noble wife because i felt i needed new blood for my line procreation is after all the prime motive for marriage so we are taught by holy mother church skye replied are you of the old church he demanded i would have thought that you were of the new faith coming from the tudor court i am not english monseigneur i am irish i am of the one true church the queen however is tolerant of all faiths i am sure that i was sent to you because the queen assumed you also would be of the true faith i was born to the old faith he said your nephew said nothing to me of your religion skye replied when he left beaumont de jaspre madame i still practiced that ancient faith although i had become interested in the teachings of pastor andre lichault while edmond was away however i became convinced that pastor lichault was correct in his teachings and i converted to his faith you too will convert when you have been taught and have your people converted to the teachings of your pastor lichault monseigneur he frowned they persist in clinging to their old faith it is wrong though i have driven their priests out and i have torn down the painted and gilded idols that they persist in worshiping still they resist me but i will overcome them for i am their lord and their master the ducs carriage had moved away from the docks and through the window of the coach skye could see edmond and robbie following them on horses she breathed a sigh of relief she was appalled to find that the duc was not only a huguenot but a bit of a fanatic as well is it not better monseigneur that a people have a faith than not have a faith as long as your people are godfearing and hardworking souls does it make any difference how they worship god she said yes he looked earnestly at her you are very beautiful madame but you are only a woman how can you possibly understand my other husbands have always said that i was an understanding woman monseigneur perhaps i will not comprehend but how will you know unless you confide in me she gave him a small smile to encourage him she must keep the lines of communication open between them else this marriage be doomed before it even began he leaned forward and began to speak the catholic church has become corrupt madame they no longer administer to the needs of their flock they sell indulgences and absolutions they own vast tracts of land they engage in commerce and act as patrons to worthless artists they are as venal and as lustful as the worst of men they have lost sight of god pastor lichault was once one of them but in a vision he saw the light now he strives to bring that light to others my people do not listen now but in the end they will the only way we will escape the fires of hell and damnation is to live simply to pray to scourge ourselves free of the opulent trappings with which we have surrounded ourselves skye was astounded by the ducs outburst and his next words sent a chill through her you must join me in my endeavors madame as your husband i command it only when we are both free of sin will god reward us with the children that i so desperately want this was hardly what she had expected and she suspected that even the very protestant lord burghley had known nothing about the ducs sudden conversion either the man was unstable and would not make a reliable ally for england she had been sacrificed to a madman you say nothing madame she chose her words carefully i am a daughter of the one true church monseigneur my uncle is a bishop i have read and studied the teachings of martin luther but i prefer to remain as i have always been although i am more liberal than many of my faith i have friends who have chosen to follow the new faith and if they are happy then i am happy for them but i cannot convert your gown is much too immodest he said ignoring her words are all your gowns so low in the neckline it is the fashion monseigneur after today you will not wear such garments they were made to entice and to lure a man into lust i will send the castle seamstress to you tomorrow and when she has taken your measurements she will make you more suitable garments i choose my own clothes monseigneur skye said sharply whatever the fashion i am and always have been a faithful wife i do not flaunt my charms before other men you would disobey me madame his look was black no monseigneur i would simply overrule you in an area in which you are not competent to judge but the sight of so much beauty is distracting madame i do not flaunt my beauty if you are distracted then the fault is within you monseigneur it is not with me you are right he whispered and obviously shaken by the truth of her words he withdrew into himself skye turned to look out the window of the coach at the beautiful little town of villerose her conversation with the duc had disturbed her greatly he was obviously not a man of strong character if in his nephews absence he had been led astray by this pastor lichault at least his people resisted this attempt to force them from the true church he may think he has driven the priests out skye thought but i will wager that they are still here i will have to find one she focused her eyes upon the town it was a lovely place and to her immense delight each building was painted pink and roofed in red tile the streets were cobbled but not overly narrow and flowers grew everywhere in gardens in windowboxes hanging from pots and balconies why are the buildings all pink she asked the duc it was the favorite color of one of my ancestors villerose has been pink for over three hundred years now he fell silent again and skye turned back to the window the town seemed filled with small squares each with its own fountain sending forth a spray of crystalclear water into the hot afternoon there were children everywhere healthy wellfed boys and girls running and playing about the houses and fountains the duchy of beaumont de jaspre was obviously a happy and prosperous place skye decided as they passed wellfilled busy shops and small openair markets it was everything that edmond had promised her with one exception the duc how could she marry this intense fanatical man but she knew she must the coach wound its way upward through the cobbled streets until it reached the castle perched upon the crest of a hill above the town overlooking the blue sea like the town the castle was of pink stone its tower roofs tiled in red a wide moat filled with pink and white waterlilies surrounded the building the carriage drove across the lowered drawbridge into the courtyard and skye was further enchanted in the courtyards center was a square tiled pool that was edged with a flowerbed filled with brightly colored blooms at one end of the fountain a mischievous bronze cupid rode a bronze dolphin from whose open mouth poured a clear stream of water how lovely she exclaimed clapping her hands together i am pleased that you like it the duc answered the intensity was gone and she felt more comfortable with him the vehicle stopped and a footman hurried to help them out edmond and robbie were dismounting their horses they both hurried over to the carriage as skye exited it well edmond demanded what do you think of beaumont de jaspre chérie its beautiful edmond she said but robbie noticed her lack of enthusiasm and drew her away from the duc what is the matter hes a huguenot robbie newly converted by a pastor lichault and quite the fanatic about it he claims to have driven the priests from his duchy and he wants to change my wardrobe to something more modest speaking about it skye didnt know whether to laugh or to cry gods foot swore robbie who although a member of the church of england was a tolerant man come madame the duc was at her side again you will want to refresh yourself before we are married will a half an hour suit you so soon could we not wait a few days monseigneur so that we might get to know one another are you able to receive a man now madame he demanded quite bluntly skye blushed at his indelicacy and whispered yes then there is no need for us to wait you know my feelings on the matter as we have already discussed them in the coach he took her arm come now you will see msieur robert small and edmond at the ceremony there was nothing for it but to follow him though behind her she heard robbie growl a low protest she dared not turn but kept walking allowing the duc to lead her into the castle your maid should already be here madame he said moving through the main hall of the castle the walls were hung with many beautiful crimson azure and gold silk banners some of which skye could sec were very old she followed him as he hurried two flights up a wide staircase with magnificently carved bannisters and then down a corridor lit by windows that faced onto the courtyard now bright with the lateafternoon sunlight he stopped before a pair of doors shaped like upside down lps and knocked the door opened to reveal daisy welcome my lady mlord daisy said does your maid not speak french the duc demanded she is a simple english country girl monseigneur but she is a fine tiring woman and has been with me for many years skye turned to daisy saying daisy this is the duc she then said to the duc speaking french this time monseigneur this is my maid daisy whom you would call marguérite in your tongue daisy bobbed a pretty curtsey and smiled her gaptoothed smile the duc barely nodded i will come back for you in a few minutes he said you will be a beautiful bride madame and because you are so beautiful and i believe that there is no real malice in you i will be patient with your rather hoydenish and independent ways he bowed curdy and left her standing there surprised daisy pulled her mistress into the room come in mlady lord bless me its lovely here it is i aint never seen such flowers isnt the town simply adorable all pinklike daisy was full of enthusiasm maybe it wont be so bad living here after all is there some water daisy i must refresh myself before the duc comes back we are to be married immediately ohh daisys eyes widened hes that anxious is he she giggled with delight hes a finelooking man mlady he might even be called handsome if hed just smile but youll have him smiling soon enough she hurried off to fetch the water skye looked about her she was in a square room with palegray stone walls there were fireplaces on either side of the room their enormous narrow mantels held up by seated golden marble lions with green jasper eyes the walls were hung with exquisite silk tapestries all depicting tales of knights and maidens and dragons in colorful and bright threads each tapestry was beautifully done and skye wondered if some past duchess of beaumont had lovingly stitched them she also wondered if that longdead duchess had loved her husband the room had no windows in its center was a long oak refectory table with a silver bowl filled with peachcolored roses upon it their fragrance perfumed the room the rest of the furnishings consisted of several straightback carved chairs with velvet cushions strategically placed there was a door opposite her and another beside one of the fireplaces through which daisy had disappeared she now reappeared carrying a golden basin oh mlady come just through the other door please into your bedchamber skye walked across the room and opened the door im sorry daisy im daydreaming it seems daisy hurried into the room behind her mistress and why not she demanded youre about to be married and this is a beautiful place skye looked around the bedchamber it was a tower room and round in shape there were windows directly before her that extended to the floor opening onto a small balcony she could see the sea through them to her left was a huge carved bed with a linenfold paneled headboard draped in plain dark green velvet opposite the bed was a small fireplace there was but one candlestand beside the bed holding a golden candlestick with a fine beeswax taper there was a lowbacked stool with a tapestry cushion at one side of the fireplace its not very large for the duchesss chambers she noted the ducs is next door mlady see the little door on the other side of the bed that goes into his chambers theres also a dressing room off the antechamber daisy put the basin down on the candlestand and skye rinsed her hands and her face quickly daisy had scented the water with her mistresss rose fragrance skye was very quiet and daisy could not help noticing i wouldnt think youd have bridal nerves after all these years she remarked skye laughed weakly its all very different this time daisy i dont know the duc and our conversation in the coach as we came from the port was not reassuring he is a huguenot and a fanatic at that he wants children desperately but i do not know if i can give them to him he frightens me a little daisy looked shrewdly at her mistress yere taking the potion that yer sister eibhlin gave you arent you skye nodded i intend to go on taking it until the duc and i can come to some sort of arrangement i dont plan to be his brood mare locked up in this fairytale castle forever she took the creamy linen towel that daisy handed her and dried her face and hands then as an afterthought she pulled the kerchief from her neckline in a gesture of defiance they heard the knock on the antechamber door at the same time and daisy hurried to open it edmond de beaumont hurried in his handsome face distressed i did not know he said as the good god is my judge skye i did not know he had become a huguenot i didnt even know he was contemplating it that damned lichault he waited until i was gone and then like the snake in the garden of eden he wormed his way deep into my uncles confidence god he is an evil creature your uncle says he has driven the priests from beaumont de jaspre is it true he thinks he has but père henri has already come to see me he was the family chaplain he says he understands the difficult position you the niece of a bishop must find yourself in but you are not to fear for your immortal soul he gives you a dispensation to wed my uncle in this new faith knowing that eventually you will overcome that man lichault and bring my uncle back to the true church skye nodded but inwardly she was amused her religion was a private thing although she had been baptized a catholic her second husband had wed her in the moslem faith her third in the church of england that she had loved them both made the difference but she did not like the duc telling her what she was going to do and what she was going to be if this religion of his was really that way she would cling like a barnacle to her own faith and let the good local priests think she was devout it couldnt hurt her reputation and if she could wean the duc from his obviously unpleasant faith she might be able to learn to care for him in time beneath the stern façade she had detected small flashes of humor she wondered again what he looked like when he smiled another knock sounded upon the door and this time it was the duc who entered he carried with him a nosegay of fragrant orange blossoms white freesias and tiny white rosebuds tied with lilaccolored silk ribbons with an elegant bow he handed the flowers to her for you madame pastor lichault says such things are the devils enticements but i believe that women appreciate such small vanities especially on their wedding day he held out his arm to her and with a return curtsey she took it will you allow daisy to see the ceremony monseigneur it would mean a great deal to us both of course he was pleased to note that she had deferred to him in this matter the duc led the way to the family chapel where robbie sean macguire and bran kelly already awaited them edmond de beaumont drew in his breath sharply as they entered what has happened here he demanded furiously where are the tapestries uncle where are the beautiful altar cloths the candles the crucifix the paintings where is the tabernacle the chapel was indeed bare and plain with its simple wooden altar there was no vigil light the only light was from its windows magnificent arches of red blue gold and green stained glass those fripperies were but trappings of the devil edmond it was my decision to remove them to where there were pieces in this chapel that go back almost a thousand years they belong to this family and to the church pastor lichault would have destroyed them edmond but i had them packed away i do not want them any longer now be silent nephew else you spoil my wedding day the duc nodded to a man who stood by the altar and immediately the servant ran out through the sacristy to return a moment later with another man he has the look of a cadaver skye thought he was very tall and very thin and his face was long with narrow lips a strangely large nose and eyes that burned with the fervor of a martyr he was garbed totally in black and his rather spare gray hair stuck out from beneath his square black hat at funny angles as they approached him skye could see that his fingernails were dirty and as they came still closer she noted that he smelled terrible and that there was a ring of dirt around his neck behold the bride the stranger said in a voice that was surprisingly masterful and compelling for such an unattractive man then he smiled showing yellowed teeth some of which were broken the duc returned the smile pastor i would present to you my new duchesse skye it was the first time he had said her name and she was surprised that he remembered it since he had kept calling her madame pastor lichault chortled ah fabron my son she is not yet your duchesse not until i have made her so he smiled again this time his eyes fastened upon skye and she fought back the urge to shiver as she saw the man mentally undress her licking his lips as he obviously liked what his imagination showed him well let us get on with it then he said briskly will you take this woman to wife fabron i will the duc said will you take this man to husband skye will you accept him as your master i take him as my husband skye said and the pastor glared at her you are then man and wife the pastor finally said grudgingly if skye was horrified with this brief display then so were those who witnessed it bran kelly turned to robbie and said softly if thats a marriage ceremony then im a muslim do you think its legal or is our lady being gulled robbie shook his head i dont know i suppose if its all right with the duc then its legal here it would not be legal in the eyes of the true church edmond de beaumont said in a low angry voice and sean macguire nodded his agreement i do not know what has come over my uncle edmond finished come madame the duc had taken her hand and was turning her about i have had a light supper set up in the hall to celebrate our nuptials uncle you have not given skye a ring where is her wedding ring there is no need for one edmond we have been united according to gods law in the presence of witnesses pastor lichault believes that wedding rings are a worldly and ostentatious show i have donated the gold i would have spent on such a ring to him for use among the poor and will you share your happiness with our people as is customary uncle will there be feasting and dancing for our people this night in beaumont such extravagances are wasteful and unnecessary edmond a marriage is a part of gods law and there is no cause for undue celebration because one keeps gods law as is expected of him another of pastor lichaults gems edmond de beaumont remarked sarcastically you will apologize at once nephew never the man is a charlatan edmond skye pleaded for my sake please she didnt want this appalling day marred any more than it already had been very well chérie for you but only for you edmond replied smiling sweetly at her i regret my hasty words pastor already the pastor oozed our new duchesse exerts a salubrious influence upon this family it is a good sign and he smiled his yellowtoothed smile at them all the duc led them into the main hall of the castle with its marvelous silk banners and tall windows now red with the sunset there were two enormous fireplaces in the hall but neither was lit this night rather they had been banked with flowering branches daisy had already disappeared it not being seemly that she eat with her mistress and so only skye the duc edmond robbie sean macguire bran kelly and the pastor sat at the high board the duc sat to skyes right robbie to her left the pastor was on the ducs right and next to him sat edmond de beaumont bran kelly was on the other side of robbie and on brans left was captain macguire immediately the servants in the ducs azure and silver livery began to pour the lovely rosecolored wine that edmond had told her was a favorite in beaumont de jaspre an enormous mullet complete with its eyes set upon a bed of greenery and surrounded with whole carved lemons was presented as the first course skye declined the fish her stomach was churning nervously at the thought of what awaited her she had never been to bed with a stranger a man she had only just met no she amended the thought and a small smile turned up the corners of her mouth there was adam she remembered back to the first time she had gone to bed with adam de marisco she had come to lundy to enlist his help offering him two percent of her profit if he would aid her he had asked instead for one percent of the profitand a night with her she had been horrified but had agreed for she needed his help without it she could not triumph over elizabeth tudor who had insulted her unforgivably but with adam it had been different he had been teasing and amusing from the beginning and although she had been hesitant she had not been afraid she glanced almost fearfully at the stern man by her side he had not kissed her at the conclusion of their brief marriage ceremony and although he apparently knew her name he had only called her by it once the servants were now offering capon in gingered lemon sauce baby lamb artichokes in olive oil and tarragon vinegar new peas and fresh bread skye nibbled absently are you ill the duc put his hand on hers she started and looked up at him his eyes were void of any emotion although his voice was kindly i am probably tired she answered it has been a long trip go prepare yourself for bed then madame he said quietly i will come to you shortly she nodded and then leaning over said to robbie i am going to retire now i wont leave you lass remember that i promised you tomorrow i shall spend the day looking for a house send to me when you want me he leaned over and kissed her cheek with a sad little sigh she returned the kiss and then rose and left the hall as discreetly as possible how bleak this marriage already was she thought thinking of the gaiety of her previous nuptials she easily found her way back to her apartment where daisy had prepared a bath for her youve not had a freshwater bath in several weeks mlady daisy said and i know how you like yer bath i cant tarry tonight she replied nay daisy said in agreement ive laid out the duskyrose silk gown for you to wear no skye said the duc is a conservative man perhaps it would be better if my nightclothes were more modest until we get to know one another better put the rose away and get the paleblue silk skye allowed daisy to strip her of her garments and then while her faithful tiring woman put her gown away and sought the simpler nightrail she quickly bathed enjoying the soft warm water scented with damask rose oil and her damask rose soap that lathered so richly the feel of the satin suds on her skin was almost sensual she had thanks to a surprise rainstorm the previous afternoon been able to wash her long dark hair on the ship before they arrived at beaumont de jaspre clean hair always made her feel better rinsing herself off she climbed from the tub then she took the large bath sheet that daisy had laid out for her and dried herself off daisy quickly powdered her lady and then slipped the blue gown over her head it slid down skyes lithe body with a hiss it was a simple gown with long full sleeves banded at the wrists with silk ribbon its neckline was low and scooped but it was far more modest than the sheer rosecolored silk gown daisy had originally chosen that creation would have clung to her lush form as if it had been painted on not at all like this full gown which discreetly hid her shape at daisys sharp command two serving men entered the room and carried the little wooden tub from the bedchamber how on earth did you get them to do that asked skye knowing full well that her devonborn servant didnt speak a word of french well mlady its not so much the knowing of the words as it is the tone of voice you use and your hand signals dont worry about me ill get on just fine the words aint so hard to learn ill be gabbing away in their own language in no time at all oh daisy skye hugged the girl i probably shouldnt have let you come along with me you and bran should be married now and starting your own family plenty of time for that daisy replied tardy youre going to need me mlady i can see that the little door on the other side of the bed opened and the duc in a white nightshirt entered the room daisy bobbed her mistress a quick curtsey and then one to the duc and hurried from the room you are not in bed he said in beaumont de jaspre it is customary for a bride to await her husband in their nuptial bed i wanted a bath she said i have not had a freshwater bath in weeks pastor lichault says bathing is a vanity then surely he must be the most humble of men skye replied sharply one cannot be in the same room with him without smelling his body odor it is distasteful i have never particularly equated dirt with godliness i would be inclined to agree with you madame he said there it was again she thought that faint touch of humor in his voice he walked around to where she was standing and very gently began removing the pins from her hair which daisy had not gotten around to doing carefully he placed the pins on the mantel of the small fireplace which like those in the great hall was banked in flowers her long hair tumbled down and he ran his hands through it admiringly skye stood very still he worried her yet for although he was obviously attracted to her she could see or feel no passion in him or his actions you have beautiful hair he said quietly a womans hair is her glory he then turned her so that her back was to him and to her surprise he pushed her gown from her shoulders baring her to the waist gently he cupped her small full breasts briefly caressing them and so is her bosom you have a lovely bosom madame i will enjoy seeing our children suckle upon those beautiful breasts for that is why god gave them to you calmly he drew her gown back up again and taking her by the hand led her to the bed now madame i want you to lie face down upon the bed he said she gasped and turned large frightened eyes to him her heart began to pound with certain terrible memories surely monseigneur you are not going to make love to me in the greek fashion how do you know of such things he thundered angrily grasping her upper arms so hard that she knew she would be bruised come morning what kind of a woman has england sent me no respectable woman should know of such abomination answer me madame his black eyes blazed his outraged fury my first husband she cried trying to loosen his grasp on her tender flesh he loved to humiliate me by doing doing that you did not like it his gaze searched her face anxiously it disgusted me she replied honestly he loosed his grip on her so it should have madame for god forbids such wickedness you need not fear that i practice such depravity however you must trust me when i ask you to lie face down upon the bed and you must obey me madame for i am your lord and master in both gods eyes and mans skye was distressed he had assured her that he did not practice doms particular perversion yet why did he want her to lie face down upon the bed the silence hung heavy between them she wasnt going to find out standing here and surely he wasnt going to harm her after he had said he wouldnt with a sigh she lay down upon the bed move into the center madame came the command and she obeyed him he took her left wrist and she felt him sliding something about it something soft and yet strong as she moved her head to look he moved around the bed to grasp her right arm and bind it as well to the carved posts of the bed with a woven silken cord she gasped again this time with shock monseigneur she cried what are you doing her fear was beginning to rise again she struggled to control it trying to draw a calming breath his actions however were not reassuring he was now spreading her legs and binding them also to the lower posts of the bed i am binding you to the bed madame i would have thought that that was obvious to you he had finished and moving up by her head he pulled the pillows from beneath it then lifting her with a surprisingly strong hand he stuffed the pillows beneath her belly so that her hips were well elevated why are you doing this her voice bordered on the hysterical dear heaven what terrible perversion was he going to practice upon her helpless form if he killed her what would happen to her children because he said as he carefully raised her silk nightgown up fully exposing her buttocks and legs i am going to beat you what her voice was a shriek he was a madman i am going to beat you he repeated calmly but why what have i done we do not even know each other how can i have displeased you so in the short time since i arrived that you would do something so awful as to beat me fabron de beaumont sat by her side and in a calm voice began to explain my beautiful bride he said in a voice laced with patience you are a woman and women are weak vessels who must be constantly corrected in order to give them true strength pastor lichault advocates the daily beating of a wife until she conforms perfectly instantly and without questions to her husbands will he and i spoke at great length tonight before i came to you he feels that you are much too independent a woman at present to make me a dutiful wife nonetheless we are now wed and so he felt that i must begin on this our wedding night a program of correction so that i may mold you into the kind of woman that my wife should be if you are to bear my children you must raise them as i desire without question and with instant obedience women are inferior to men and yet you have dared to raise yourself above your humble station to put yourself on a level with men you are overproud skye but i am going to save you from yourself this i promise you she was horrified how can you judge me so quickly my lord fabron she asked him pleadingly if women are so inferior then why has god chosen a queen for england a queen who reigns without the aid of a husband and what of frances catherine de medici a queen mother who has reigned for her minor children with gods blessing you ask too many questions skye he said that is one way i am able to judge you women should not ask questions for pastor lichault says they were born to obey without question as to those two queens you have mentioned who is to say that it is god who keeps them in power more likely it is the devil monseigneur i beg of you do not beat me skye was becoming extremely frightened was her husband a madman did he really believe the foolish nonsense that he had been spouting pastor lichault was obviously one of those awful calvinists who believed that any joy in living was sinful they were such fools the calvinists she had known some in england and they were as dangerous as the fanatics among the catholics she shuddered with her fright madame i do this for your own good in time when you have been properly schooled and seen the errors of your past attitude you will be grateful to me for my perseverance hhow long will you continue to do this her voice was shaking dear god she prayed silently dont let him kill me in his zeal let me live to win him over for both our sakes and the sake of my children when the day comes my dear that you admit to your faults admit that a woman is incapable of running a businessand i suspect that your business partner does it all for you despite your claim when the day comes that you admit that you are not suited to running the vast estates that you claim to run and entrust such things to me then i will know that you have become the kind of wife i seek and want until that time i will beat you each night before we retire he stood up and moved where she could not see him only to return a moment later in his hand he now had a birch switch the thickness of her finger he placed it before her lips and commanded her you will kiss the rod of correction madame when i am through you will kiss it again and remember to thank me for your punishment skye turned her head aside in this she would defy him it mattered not what she did he was going to hurt her anyway at least she would not grovel his voice grew cold with anger i had meant to go easily with you tonight he said but i can see that the pastor is right you are arrogant beyond reason you will be given the full measure of your punishment she tried a last time monseigneur i beg you do not do this if you do i shall complain to my queen who sent me here she will not be pleased to learn that you are abusing me you will complain to no one madame it is my right as your husband to chastise you even your corrupt church will not deny me that right you wished to get to know me better and i am granting you that privilege for the next month you will not leave these rooms and i shall leave them only when necessary i intend mating with you as often as possible in that time so that you will bear me a child as quickly as possible i need an heir we will spend the next month mating and struggling through prayer and punishment to change your behavior he raised the switch and brought it down sharply upon her bare buttocks skye screamed with surprise she had not been expecting the blow so soon and he gave her no time to recover his arm rose and fell rose and fell rose and fell again in ceaseless motion as he began to beat her in earnest she cried out again and again with pain as the switch cut sharply and cruelly into her tender bottom this was a nightmare it could not be happening please she wept please monseigneur i beg you stop stop skye felt very ashamed of herself to beg but she could not stand the awful pain his answer was to lash her harder this time cutting into her legs she felt the warm trickle of blood as he broke the skin skye struggled against her silken bonds but she could not escape him and the pillows he had placed beneath her had only served to raise her hips up higher so he might get at them easier his arm did not seem to tire easily of the punishment rather he seemed to be gaining strength from her struggles bitch he hissed at her and he cut viciously at her writhing bottom admit to your faults admit that you are nothing that man is the master admit that you are mindless softness made only for mans pleasure the cracked vessel for the spilling of his seed a beast to bear his sons it is gods law and you defy that law no no she sobbed as the switch laid whitehot pain upon whitehot pain women are not beasts they have minds too you are stubborn he again hissed at her his arm never flagging in its punishment of her helpless flesh but in the end i will prevail and i will save you from the snares of the devil who has so obviously gained possession of your soul she could not stand much more of this torture and her mind began to drift away into a blessed and quiet darkness she no longer felt the switchs heat or heard the ducs voice adam she cried out within her mind and then she felt him loving her as he had so often loved her she struggled to open her eyes feeling her desire for him rising wanting to see his dear face to feel his caress her black lashes fluttered against her pale cheeks and she finally managed to raise them to unveil her eyes to her horror it was the duc who was upon her preparing to insert his long swollen male organ within her helpless body no she shrieked seeking to force him off her but though she was now lying upon her back her buttocks burning like fire beneath her to her dismay her arms were still bound to the bedposts he seemed not to notice her resistance instead he moaned with open desire pushing her nightgown up to her neck and fumbling with her breasts again beautiful beautiful he murmured such beautiful little tits he lowered his head and sucked each one in turn then rolled the tight nipples between his thumb and his forefinger pinching them gently again and again until she thought she would scream his hand roamed over her belly fondling it murmuring of the babes she would give him and then despite her protests he was pushing himself into her he thrust deeply moving rhythmically as he muttered fuck you were made to be fucked skye ah god you were born to be fucked she stared at him with horror she could have been a dead body for all he cared it made no difference to him whether she was conscious or unconscious as long as he could feel and touch and fuck her what was worse for her was the terrible realization that she felt nothing herself she the most passionate and sensuous of women felt nothing except an awful invasion of her mind and her soul and her body the man atop her shuddered with his own release and then fell over to one side within minutes he was snoring and she lay next to him numb with shock and with shame even with dom god assoil his black soul it had never been so dreadful dom for all of his crudity had loved her in his own fashion had been proud of her and jealous of her this man wanted nothing but to break her to possess her very soul to make her a mindless creature fit for nothing more than bearing babies until she finally died of too many children in too few years she had seen it happen to other women it might even have happened to her with dom had she not had her sister eibhlin to help her he had not taken the time to unbind her arms before he had fallen asleep and so she lay uncomfortable and chilled as the night slowly progressed her bottom and the tender backs of her thighs ached with the beating that he had given her she could feel the welts that had been raised on her skin burning like hot embers never before had she been subjected to such treatment her mind rebeled at the words that he had thrown at her this night so he believed his warped pastor he believed that women were nothing but mindless softness her bridegroom was in for a shock when he learned that this woman was rockhard she wondered if he would eventually untie her or if he intended to keep her bound to the bed for the entire month was fabron de beaumont truly mad or was he simply a crazed fanatic had he been like this with his other wives no it was not possible she did not think that edmond had lied to her and he had always spoken of his uncle with genuine affection no the duc was obviously not a strong man and had somehow come under the influence of this terrible creature pastor lichault perhaps he felt guilt for the deaths of his two previous wives or perhaps he had secretly wanted to be a priest as edmond had suggested and he could not because of his family obligations the huguenot had seen the ducs weaknesses and wielded his evil influence upon fabron when he was bereft of all his family but it could not must not continue skye knew she could not stand many more beatings like the one the duc had administered to her this night gods foot but he was a cold man her genuine piteous cries should have wrung his heart but instead they had only driven him to apply his switch harder she shuddered remembering how terribly it had hurt then afterward when she lay barely conscious to have taken her body uncaring of how she felt of whether he gave her pleasure as well as took it suddenly a picture of women in war came to her mind and she realized for all that the duc was her husband she had been raped she shuddered again the man was a monster are you cold his voice calm now asked her you have not untied me monseigneur forgive me madame he was solicitous and reaching up he loosened her bonds then he drew her into his arms and began stroking her breasts through her nightgown i find that i cannot get enough of you he pushed up her nightgown again and mounted her skye stiffened and he noticed you do not like it when i fuck you he asked no she answered honestly not caring if she hurt him men were vain about such things good he said it is not meant that a woman gain pleasure from a mans labor it is the mans pleasure that is paramount he thrust into her again and again until he once more spilled his seed then the duc slept again thank god thought skye that i have taken eibhlins potion ill not give this beast children i am not certain that this family should be perpetuated they produce dwarfs idiots and madmen better the french come and take the duchy i will write to the queen she vowed no i will write to lord burghley i will explain to him how it is this marriage is not valid in the eyes of my own church and i suspect it is also invalid in the eyes of the church of england i must lull the duc into thinking that i am becoming more biddable so that i can speak with robbie bess tudor has asked many hard things of me but even she will be shocked to learn of my plight i know she will not make me stay here she cannot skye turned onto her side away from her new husband who was snoring once again and gingerly felt the weals he had raised on her skin she would be revenged for each welt that he had marked on her flesh that she promised herself she had no intention of allowing him to further abuse her even if she had to slit his throat she could do it too right now he lay helpless next to her convinced of his own superiority unbelieving that a woman could wield the power of life and death over any man she smiled softly in the darkness fabron de beaumont would very shortly learn much to his distress what it was like to have skye omalley for an enemy she didnt think that he was going to like it smiling skye fell asleep part beaumont de jaspre chapter fabron de beaumont awoke with a start and stared into the bluegreen eyes of his bride of less than a day she was nude and sat comfortably upon his chest pressing a small but lethal fruit knife against the hollow of his throat his heart began to pump frantically do not move monseigneur skye said pleasantly else my hand slip and do not make the mistake of thinking i will not kill you for if you move i will he swallowed hard and she saw with a certain grim satisfaction the pulse leaping erratically in his throat why he said you asked the queen of england for a wife monseigneur and she graciously supplied you with one i must assume that you knew the women of my region are proud and independent ladies even the women of france are enlightened in this day and age i am not a creature to be beaten into obedience i am a woman monseigneur i am a woman of intelligence and wealth and family if you should ever raise your hand to me again without just cause i will kill you without hesitation i will be a good wife to you and if god wills it i will bear you children i will not however convert to your huguenot faith i am not the best of catholics but i prefer my faith over others and i have always granted that others have a right to their own beliefs she looked piercingly at him do you understand me monseigneur there will be no more beatings and if i refuse to agree you arrogant bitch what then he demanded his own dark eyes blazing with outrage and anger i will kill you now where you lie monseigneur she said coldly my body is scarred with your marks i have but to show them to your nephew and to père henri i will claim that as a good daughter of the church i knew your pastor had no real authority to wed us and that although i begged and pleaded with you to call back père henri to marry us in the only true faith you would not have it she smiled sweetly down at him then i will claim that i could not live in sin with you having always been a respectable married womanand monseigneur my reputation has always been spotless but you forced yourself upon me and when i tried to protect my virtue you beat me mercilessly having been subjected to a night of your carnal lust and unnatural desires i did the only thing a good daughter of the church could have done when you came at me again threatening my very soul with your wicked perversions i killed you she looked down on him dispassionately do you really think that the church or your good nephew will hold me responsible for an act committed in a moment of terror skye had the upper hand now and she knew it she had quickly ascertained the duc was no fool he would therefore not want a scandal the choice as to whether you live or die is up to you monseigneur make it now she said her gaze icy how do you know that you can trust me madame he asked her unable to keep his eyes from her beautiful breasts i could agree and then when you are off my chest your knife put away renege on our agreement an agreement made under such duress can scarcely be legal you are so your nephew claims an honorable man i must assume that honor extends to a mere woman as well as to your fellow man he nodded rather surprised by her logic very well madame i agree i will not beat you again but understand that any children you give me will be brought up in my faith and not yours i will not allow you to taint my sons with the great harlot rome i agree she said without hesitation knowing that if she decided to bear his children she would be able to teach them love despite pastor lichault she swung lightly off him and lay the fruit knife upon the candlestand then sitting back against the pillows she drew the finely embroidered linen sheets up to cover her bosom the simple show of modesty rather intrigued him he sat up and looked at her you are a formidable woman madame my name is skye she said quietly you have said it but once since we first met yesterday can you not call me by my name in the privacy of our chambers at least you have only used my name once also skye it is an unusual name fabron she answered him it is peculiar to this region he said it is a family name from the beginning of time there have always been fabrons in the de beaumont family there was a long silence between them and then she asked why do you dislike women so much he thought a moment then said i didnt realize that i did until just now he sighed i suppose i resent the fact that i could not become a priest in my youth as i wanted to i was my fathers eldest legitimate son edmonds father was my only full brother although my father populated the region with his bastards one of those bastards was even the son of a young noblewoman he had few scruples my father he was a very carnal man he was also a very strongwilled one eldest sons inherited and only death was an accepted excuse for shirking ones responsibilities my first wife suffered many years trying to give me a child poor marie with each miscarriage or stillbirth she became more determined to give me a live son such a sweet woman she died trying and i believed that god was punishing me for not having followed my conscience when my second wife blanche finally gave birth to that drooling idiot who is called my son and then died also i was certain that god was punishing me when i met pastor lichault and confided in him he assured me that the loss of these two women had satisfied gods anger he says that you are a healthy vigorous woman who will easily give me children if i can but curb your wicked spirit which is an affront to god i cannot agree with the pastor skye said quietly a woman is best handled with love and kindness like a flower she will grow and flourish with a mans love unkindness will only make her vengeful and bitter besides if you expect the kind of son who can rule this duchy it is a strong woman who must bear him for you did you love the other men you were married to skye he asked her curiously did they not object to your strong will i loved three of them she said each was a different man and yet each possessed a great capacity to love yes i loved them and they loved me none ever objected to my ways her face was alight with her memories and he caught his breath in wonder at how incredibly beautiful she was leaning over and taking her hand he turned it and kissed the palm her eyes regarded him seriously she felt nothing for him although she knew he was trying and so she felt that she must try also there was no other choice she withdrew her hand from his and reaching out touched his cheek he looked back at her his glance equally serious and unsmiling i know that the bible says it is wrong for a man and a woman to show themselves as god created them but at this moment i wish for nothing more than to see you naked will you grant me that wish skye drawing the covers off she rose from the bed i am sure she said that it is pastor lichault who has told you this fabron but i believe he is wrong the bible says that we were created in gods image and if that be so how can it be wrong to admire what god hath wrought what god is she turned slowly so he might have a full and complete view of her body he almost wept at her beauty the small perfect breasts the graceful line of her buttocks and legs the slender grace of her waist the long line of her back her shapely arms everything was perfection but for the marks of his rod on her skin they would fade but seeing them he felt guilty you cannot be real he said the pastor is right women are an invention of the devil cover yourself madame in answer she flung herself upon the bed next to him no fabron she said firmly she had made up her mind to fight the ignorance and superstition of the huguenot she was the ducs wife now and she was not going to allow pastor lichault either to rule or destroy her marriage the bible tells us that woman was created by god from the rib of adam the first man how do you know this who told it to you no one told me fabron the bible has been translated into english and i have seen it and read it with my own eyes your wicked church forbids that you know what is in the bible was his answer the church forbids many things fabron and i do not always agree with them she smiled a small smile at him i told you that i was not the best of catholics the bible was translated and i wanted to read what it said i did do you always do what you want madame his black eyes were stern but the little hint of humor was there in his voice again the choice is not always mine fabron but when it is i usually choose to please myself yes what a strange man he was skye thought he was tortured and guiltridden and he had been cruel to her yet she felt sorry for him their eyes met and then he reached out his hand and smoothed it down the curve of her hip it is wrong surely to make love in the daylight he said low and she saw he wanted her has pastor lichault said it she gently teased watching him from beneath hooded lids the subject has never come up skye i have never read it was so in the bible have you no monseigneur i have not his hand moved to fondle her buttock have you ever before made love in the daylight he asked yes she answered him she could see how very roused he was by her body by their conversation by the picture in his mind that their talk had aroused with a sob he was pushing her back against the pillows to fumble with her breasts all the while murmuring surely such pleasure must be wrong we should not do this thing we should not yet he was possessing her quickly before she was even ready for him moistening his fingers in his mouth and rubbing them against her cleft pushing eagerly into her to satisfy his own desires skye closed her eyes and let him have his way as he sobbed and thrust atop her at least she thought relieved he is capable of functioning without cruelty in time i will teach him to give me pleasure too if i can but free him from his fears how odd she thought for the first time in my life it is i and not the man who is in charge of the lovemaking then with a wild cry the duc collapsed sated with his lust although she was not yet ready to forgive him his brutality she felt strangely sympathetic toward him he was really quite a sad man a weak man filled with fears and prejudices he was susceptible however to strength in others and she was strong until now there had only been pastor lichault to influence him but she would overcome that unpleasant creature for if she did not she would find life with her new husband a living hell and she could certainly not bring her children into such an atmosphere for many days skye and fabron remained alone together within her chambers they spoke at length and as she listened she learned much about her new husband there had never she decided been any real love in his life and he was suffering greatly from its lack the only person who had ever given him honest affection it seemed was edmond his nephew his mother a distant cousin of frances queen mother catherine de medici had been a cold and correct woman who having borne her two children left them to the casual care of others his father had been a stern man of high principles and lusty appetites who had never once made an affectionate gesture toward either of his sons being far too busy running the duchyand pursuing the ladies which he did equally well the only person who had ever offered fabron warmth and affection was the castle priest père henri and perhaps from this had come his desire to join the church to emulate the man whom he most admired his father of course would not hear of it and fabron de beaumont had grown bitter père henri had understood both parties and had tried to mediate between father and son if it was gods will that fabron de beaumont be a priest he would have been born the younger son père henri insisted hoping to satisfy both men but this argument wore thin and grew more suspect with each miscarriage of fabron de beaumonts wives and their deaths then his father died and there was no escape from his responsibilities his younger brother was dead injured in a tournament and his only legitimate male relation was his dwarf nephew he was forced to take another wife while fabron awaited his bride pastor lichault had begun to work his evil upon the easily susceptible duc yes the cleric had agreed with the guiltridden man the past was indeed gods judgment upon him for not having followed his conscience but now god was sending him a new wife it was time for a fresh start a new wife a new faith the pastor spoke with authority and quoted the bible with apparent knowledge desperate to succeed with this new wife where he had failed with his others the duc was swayed from the faith of his fathers and with the zeal of all converts he embraced his new faith with passion now his beautiful new wife had introduced a strong element of doubt into his mind she was all the things that the pastor had said a woman shouldnt be she was totally different from any woman he had ever known and yet after almost three weeks of marriage to skye he believed that for the first time in his life he might be falling in love skye it was an outrageous name but he was already used to it and liked it she had been named after the island from which her mother had come skye had told him strange it suited her she was not a marie or a jeanne or a renée she was beautiful and willful and gentle and independent and tender and intelligent she was in fact all the things he had never before even considered in a wife except perhaps beautiful she had yet to refuse him her body although his two previous wives had always been seeking excuses to avoid their wifely duties and then when he had finished with them they had moved quickly away from him skye always snuggled next to him or held him within her own arms he found he liked that in particular pillowing his head upon her soft breasts breathing the marvelous rose fragrance of her she was cleaner and sweeter than any woman he had ever known one night she said to him as he lay sated with pleasure do you know fabron that you have never kissed me he was startled for he had never been one for that kind of closeness nonetheless he suddenly wanted to please her to give back some of the kindness she was bestowing upon him despite their wretched beginning a beginning he winced at when he remembered it would it please you if i kissed you skye he asked her anxiously yes she said softly it would please me greatly mm mari raising himself upon one elbow he bent his head down and touched his lips gently to hers drawing away as quickly as though he had been burned with a soft laugh skye drew his head back down with her hands and pressed her mouth to his ardently fabron de beaumont felt a delicious weakness race through his veins felt his flaccid manhood tingle and stir to life again that monseigneur she said as she released her hold on him and drew her mouth from his that is a kiss not altogether an unpleasant thing is it are you mocking me madame he demanded but his dark eyes belied the sternness of his tone perhaps a little she replied laughter goes with love mon mari you lack respect for me madame he said and i must claim a forfeit for this absence of decorum then he was kissing her sweeping her into his arms his lips seeking her sweetness with a gentle strength that quite surprised her for the first time since their marriage a tiny tingle of desire stirred within skye perhaps she thought there is hope for us after all he held her lightly against him and she knew that he gained tremendous pleasure from the proximity of her body the warmth and the silkiness of her smooth perfumed flesh do you like it when i caress you he asked her hesitantly yes she whispered to him do you like it when i kiss and caress your lovely breasts yes mon mari i like it very much was her soft answer i want you to like it he said in what skye thought was a shy voice i want you to like it when i make love to you oh fabron skye said touched and pleased that she was beginning to get through to him when you are gentle and tender with me i too find pleasure should we both not find pleasure in each other pastor lichault says her hand stopped his mouth what does a priest a priest of any faith know of passion between a man and his wife fabron i believe that god gave a man his wife not only for companionship and the procreation of his children but for pleasure as well i believe that god gave woman her husband for the same reasons love me and i will love you in return where is the wrong in that mon mari kissing her hand he removed it from his lips and said you make it all seem so simple skye it is simple fabron love me and i will love you back he made love to her then made love to her as he had not made love to her before he was tender and considerate he sought to please her for the first time and was surprised to find that her pleasure excited him greatly when she attained the top of the mountain he realized that all the other times she had only pretended in order to please him it was then he knew that he loved this beautiful woman who despite his bestial treatment of her that first night had sought to make their marriage work je taime skye he murmured in her ear and she held him close knowing now that they had a chance to succeed in their marriage their idyll was soon over however the next morning they sat at a small table that daisy set up each day in the window of the bedchamber eating their simple meal of sweet ripe peaches fresh bread warm from the oven salt brie and watered wine the long windows stood open and along the stone balustrade bloodred roses grew over the pink stone above them the sky was a cloudless blue below the sea was a sunlit bluegreen a small black and yellow songbird that had taken to visiting them perched himself amid the roses and sang a song before fluttering to their table to eat crumbs from skyes hand husband and wife smiled at each other how can you do that he asked her intrigued as he always was by her ability to charm the bird the bird knows that it has nothing to fear from me she said softly if you love a wild creature it senses your love more than likely it is witchcraft thundered a voice from the center of the room startled the bird fled mlady monseigneur i tried to keep him out but he pushed me aside daisy said indignantly it was said in french but daisy quickly switched to english beware mlady the old devils been fuming for days over the ducs neglect of him you presume upon my friendship for you pastor that you would intrude upon the privacy of myself and my duchesse fabron de beaumont said sternly pastor lichault strode to the table skye wrinkled her nose did the man never bathe he smelled as if he slept with the goats i come for the good of your immortal soul fabron my son since the night i joined you under gods holy law with this woman you have not come to me you have neglected your spiritual duties and god is displeased he will take his vengence and this woman will abort your seed as did your other wives down upon your knees both of you beg gods forgiveness before it is too late the duc looked suddenly uncertain and frightened skye was furious and she leapt to her feet you wicked man she shouted at the pastor it is you who should fall upon your knees and beg gods forgiveness for your distorted terrible teachings whore the pastor pointed a bony finger at skye look at her fabron my son look how she flaunts her body like a common harlot of babylon his eyes fastened upon her breasts and he unconsciously licked his lips skye was wearing the sheer rosecolored silk gown she had refused to wear the night of her wedding to the duc you are looking hard enough she accused the pastor and the thoughts i see lurking behind your evil eyes are hardly those of a holy man she was very angry now you have neglected your duties by this woman the pastor cried her skin is unmarked you have not beaten her each day as i told you you must and she is more unbridled than when she came to you if you will not follow gods will then i must do it for you for the sake of your immortal soul reaching out the pastor grasped at skye with surprisingly strong fingers and tearing her gown from her he began to beat her with his hands about the face and head skye screamed and struggled to escape his hold with a roar of outrage fabron de beaumont leapt at the huguenot pastor and dragged him off of skye furiously he began to pummel the man with knotted fists as daisy ran to aid her shaking mistress you devils spawn the duc snarled at the pastor who had suddenly become a sniveling cringing creature you lured me from my faith and almost destroyed my marriage before it even began were my new duchesse not a woman of strength and character i should have destroyed her that first night god forgive me for the weakling i have been but am no more then with one sweeping motion fabron de beaumont lifted pastor lichault bodily into the air and flung him over the balcony with horror they heard his death scream as he hurtled through the air then all was silent skye and daisy ran to the balcony and looking over saw that he was quite dead upon the rocks below his neck twisted at a grotesque angle blood streaming from his nose and mouth turning back to calm her angry husband skye saw that fabron stood his knees buckling his eyes bulging from his head his hands moving frantically from his throat to his head as he struggled to breathe to speak then with a gasping frantic cry he collapsed onto the floor get the physician skye commanded daisy as she knelt by the ducs side get edmond alsoand hurry daisy daisy sped from the room her legs moving automatically for she was partially in shock from the events of the last few minutes behind her skye checked to see if fabron de beaumont was still alive he was his barely noticeable breathing and a faint pulse throbbing in his neck were the only real evidence of his survival oh fabron she said i am so sorry please dont die monseigneur get well for me and i shall make you so happy skye took his head in her lap stroking it as she sat quietly waiting there was nothing else she could do to aid him he was so still and so white now and her heart went out to him she did not know if she would ever love this strange man but he obviously loved her loved her enough to come to her defense against the pastor she felt no loss over that ones death he was an evil man who brought only fear and unhappiness to those whose lives he had touched with his withering hand chérie edmond de beaumont was suddenly there by her side what has happened madame la duchesse it was the physician i will take over now he looked at daisy help me girl we will move him to the bed where i may examine him more closely together the two lifted the limp man over to the bed still tumbled from the night before what has happened edmond repeated seating skye back down in a chair his eyes lit admiringly on her breasts the nakedness of which she was totally unaware then walking to the bed he picked up a gossamer knit shawl and draped it over her shoulders fabron had a terrible argument with the pastor and became so angry that he threw pastor lichault over the balcony dont bother to look hes dead then your uncle had some kind of attack she shivered get père henri daisy im sure edmond knows where he has been hiding the room at the top of the old north tower edmond said within a few minutes the priest joined them it was the first time skye had seen him and she liked what she saw père henri was a small man in early old age still he possessed a full head of wavy white hair and kindly warm brown eyes although his features were very aristocratic his speech was that of a less educated and privileged man he was she suspected some lords byblow on a peasant girl with the devotion to duty that had made him loved among the castle folk he hurried to the ducs side and blessed him then looking to the doctor he asked well mathieu will he live possibly mon père he has suffered an apoplectic fit its severity i cannot tell until he returns to consciousness the priest nodded and then moved across the room to skye and edmond how did this terrible thing happen edmond he asked quickly edmond de beaumont told père henri what he knew and when he had finished the priest put a gentle hand upon skyes head and blessed her finishing with the words and the church welcomes you to beaumont de jaspre too madame la duchesse now my daughter you will tell me the rest of it from the beginning from the night when you were joined with fabron in matrimony you must marry us mon père skye whispered that creature who called himself a man of god was not fit to do so for the time being my daughter you must not worry the signatures on the betrothal agreement between you and the duc make your marriage legal in the eyes of the laws of this duchy when the duc is able we will however bestow the churchs approval on your actions he patted her hand and repeated as he sat down opposite her now tell me everything she told them of the horrors of her wedding night of how she had been trying these last three weeks to make a better thing of their marriage then she went on to tell them of how the pastor had burst in on them this morning of the terrible things he had said of how he had begun beating herand of how the duc had gone to her defense the duc had repented his lapse from the true church skye assured père henri you are to be commended my daughter père henri said when she had finished fabron was a disturbed and confused man you showed true christian patience in your efforts to win him over and to bring him back to holy mother church in the end despite this tragedy those efforts were rewarded praise god will you keep a vigil with me tonight in the chapel for your husbands recovery my daughter she nodded and he patted her hand again with approval she looked at edmond de beaumont whose violet eyes were filled with admiration for her and asked him will you see that the chapel is restored before tonight edmond she turned again to the priest will you purify and rebless the sanctity of the chapel mon père before we begin our prayers both men looked upon skye with great approval and she felt a twinge of guilt she had not been this religious in years she thought uncomfortably she certainly did not want to mislead the two and yet this was how she felt right now the duc needed her prayers surely god would hear the prayers of even a lessthanperfect catholic i am no saint gentlemen she said to salve her guilt please do not attribute to me virtues which i do not possess lest you later be very disappointed across the room the duc moaned and skye hurried to her husbands side but although he was restless he was still in an unconscious state i am here fabron she said softly and he quieted for the next few days the duc hovered between consciousness and unconsciousness skye found herself suddenly in control of the duchy and the responsibility helped to assuage her worry with the death of pastor lichault the people were able to return freely to their own catholic faith the inhabitants of beaumont de jaspre believed that their ancestors had come to christianity through the efforts of the early disciples who wandered the mediterranean converting the people the beaumontese were devout and simple people who had delighted in their beautiful churches and the many religious festivals they celebrated pastor lichaults stern calvinistic coldness his lack of joy his constant harping upon sin and damnation had angered them as well as frightened them they welcomed back their priests and the mass joyfully and did not mourn the pastor despite their clerics admonitions to forgive then the duc regained consciousness but he could not move below the waist and he was unable to speak in time perhaps his physician said but a month passed and there was no improvement a second month went by and a representative from the french court arrived the duc he said would obviously not recover his only child was not fit to rule was the duchesse enceinte skye was forced to admit that she was not msieur edmond could not possibly inherit because of his disability there was nothing for it but france take over the duchy the french kings envoy suddenly found himself imprisoned within his apartments there has to be another way skye said as she met with robbie edmond and père henri we cannot allow the french to take beaumont de jaspre is there no other relative who might rule she looked to edmond surely there is someone there is nicolas st adrian edmond said slowly the duc would not hear of it père henri protested he has no choice it is either nicolas or the french mon père who is nicolas st adrian skye demanded he is the ducs very noble bastard brother père henri replied a baron if i remember correctly st adrian is not a beaumontese name skye noted it is not madame the priest answered many years ago your husbands father fell in love with the only child of an elderly and impoverished noble family in poitou emilie st adrian was the love of giles de beaumonts life and the fact that he already had a wife did not prevent him from seducing the innocent girl when she told him she was with child expecting him to do the right thing and marry her he was forced to confess to his deception she refused ever to see him again an art that her elderly father fully approved when she delivered a healthy son giles de beaumont attempted to contribute to the boys support but neither of the st adrians would hear of it everything he sent to the boy was returned unopened emilies old father legally adopted the child giving him the st adrian name making him his heir although he was heir to little god knew nicolas st adrian is some six years younger than your husband his mother and grandfather somehow arranged to have him educated the lord only knows how and were it not for his lack of money he might have had a brilliant career at court as it is he lives alone in his tumbledown castle helping his peasants to scratch a bare living from his small estate both his grandfather and mother are long dead he has no wife as he cannot afford one and he has not the means to go to court and catch himself a wealthy widow who would marry him for his handsome face he must be sent for skye said quietly there is no other choice under the circumstances i do not understand why fabron did not make him his heir long ago madame the priest said the duc is a rigid man to his way of thinking his halfbrother was a bastard a creature of no account the fact that nicolas st adrian lives in poitou made it easier to enforce that idea within his own mind i suspect he resented his halfbrother duc giles was frequently heard to bemoan nicolass loss for he had frequent reports through a friend of the boys progress and nicolas was everything he really wanted in a son gods justice is often fitting but how hard it must have been on fabron to hear that duc giless attitude did not bother edmonds father gabriel but it did bother fabron he was a sensitive boy although he hid it well i will speak to my husband skye said you do see that we have no choice in this mon père it is either nicolas st adrian or france the priest nodded nonetheless the final decision must rest with the duc very well skye said and together she and père henri made their way to the ducs bedchamber fabron de beaumont lay pale his dark eyes closed tucked carefully into his own darkredvelvetdraped bed the white linen sheets with their embroidered lace borders were folded neatly back over the light wool coverlet he was clean and fresh for skye had insisted that he be kept that way hearing them enter the room he opened his eyes and at the sight of skye they filled with undisguised love since his return to consciousness he had shown puppylike devotion to her and she had been unable to deny him her affection an affection for which he was obviously and childishly grateful she bent and kissed him good afternoon mon mari père henri and i have come to discuss something with you that is of great importance to your family he nodded and gestured with a weak arm that she sit by his side which skye did père henri stood by her in the ducs view fabron the french want the duchy skye said quietly his dark eyes flashed and he made frustrated noises in the back of his throat she put a gentling hand on his arm i know she said it must not happen and if it is at all possible we will prevent it but we need your permission he nodded and she continued i am not with child and it is very likely now that you will never be able to give me a child i need not discuss garnier with you his problem is obvious and poor edmond is unsuitable you have only one choiceyour halfbrother nicolas st adrian fabron de beaumonts eyes flashed angrily and he shook his head vehemently in the negative but skye was not deterred you have no alternative fabron she said patiently you either turn the duchy over to your halfbrother or you turn it over to the french in these last days while you have been ill i have spent much time reading the history of your family it is a proud history a noble and a very long history beaumont de jaspre has been in existence and ruled by your family since nicolas st adrian is for all the circumstances of his birth a de beaumont he cannot be blamed for the plain fact that your father a married man seduced his young and inexperienced mother emilie st adrian was of good family as good as your own i cannot fight the french fabron despite the fact that queen elizabeth sent me to you as a bride there will be no help from england you and i both know that i was sent in exchange for your opening your ports to english vessels it was a marriage of convenience had i your child or the hope of your child i should fight the french with my last breath but if you do not name your halfbrother your heir and ask him to come to you immediately the french will have your lands before the year is out that is the plain truth and père henri will tell you i do not exaggerate he was with me and edmond when we were forced to listen to the arrogant demands of the french envoy we have detained that envoy until nicolas st adrian can reach us he is our only hope fabron you must agree if you do not you will put us all at the mercy of france myself your unfortunate son and edmond what will happen to me fabron if a french overlord arrives who will care for poor little garnier will edmond be forced to make his own way as what perhaps both he and garnier can find employment with a traveling fair my beauty will of course guarantee me a protector and perhaps i can take care of them unless of course my protector is jealous or not generous enough to support the others ma fille chided a shocked père henri you are too harsh no mon père i am truthful you look at me and see a beautiful woman but you do not know that fate has often dealt harshly with me and i have survived because i look at life honestly i have never fooled myself and i will not fool my husband we are lost if he cannot overcome his stubborn pride and agree to make his halfbrother his heir she reached out and gently smoothed the ducs brow i am sorry fabron she said but you must agree and despite the weakness in your hand you must sign the document making baron st adrian your heir he sighed deeply and she could swear that she saw tears lurking deep within his dark eyes but then he nodded resignedly you agree the priest leaned forward and said you will agree to allow your halfbrother nicolas st adrian to come to beaumont de jaspre as your heir fabron de beaumont nodded his head decisively in the affirmative very well my son he said i will send for nicolas st adrian as soon as i can have the scribe draw up the papers it will be immediately fabron de beaumont sighed again and his sad dark eyes closed wearily skye arose and kissing him gently once more she stole from the room with père henri you must send one of your priests she said thoughtfully i do not think the french will suspect that we send to the bastard line of the family for aid but it is wise never to underestimate ones enemy if edmond should go his absence would be noted we must send to the pope also catherine de medici is a devout woman for all she is an ambitious one and her son will listen to her the french have too much trouble in the west now to argue with the pope if the holy father will confirm nicolas st adrians rights to the duchy of beaumont de jaspre then france dare not dispute the claim and beaumont de jaspre is safe be sure our messenger to rome carries rich gifts i will send him in my own ship with captain kelly madame père henri said his tone suddenly a very respectful one i am astounded at your foresight skye laughed i play the game well mon père do i not she said you cannot live at a tudor court and survive without learning to be the perfect courtier no one ever expects a woman to be responsible but i have had the responsibility for not only myself and my children but for vast estates and several great fortunes beginning when i was sixteen it is simply a matter of organization no the priest said quietly not all women could do what you do madame skye laughed again i am not like all women she said before nightfall the messenger had been dispatched to the pope in rome sailing aboard seagull in captain kellys care he carried with him a letter from madame la duchesse de beaumont de jaspre and one from père henri he would also bring to the prelate in rome a pair of magnificent golden candlesticks adorned with silver gilt vines and leaves and enameled pink and white flowers the base of each candlestick was studded with rubies and diamonds skye smiled to herself as she personally packed these treasures in red velvet cloth bags and then into a carved ivory box the dowager queen of france was in her heart a merchants daughter and known for her parsimony if catherine de medici thought to present her own case to the holy father she would not send anything to compare with skyes gift to the papacy the following morning the other messenger this one a young priest from a wealthy beaumont family who knew how to ride a horse well and handle a sword if necessary left for the castle of nicolas st adrian in poitou they had but to wait to skyes enormous surprise both her messengers returned within less than a months time the one who had gone to rome had had an incredible piece of luck as he and bran kelly had waited at the popes court with hundreds of other supplicants who sought to catch the holy fathers attention the pope had passed through the room and heard brans voice he had stopped and looking at bran said my son you have the sound of ireland in your voice i once had a secretary from that land am i correct stunned at being addressed by the pope himself bran could only nod the pope smiled in a court filled with the worldweary he was touched by the big irishmans awe have this young man brought to me immediately the pope said i would speak with him bran and his fellow messenger père claude were hurried into the popes private chambers where the prelate graciously held out his hand so they might kiss his ring of office the formalities over he sat and asked now what may i do for you my irish friend in his slow and careful french bran kelly explained his mission his mistress irish like himself had been but recently wed with fabron duc de beaumont de jaspre regretfully the duc had suffered an apoplectic fit shortly after the marriage now france was demanding that the duchy be turned over to them the duc however chose to bestow his lands and his title upon his noble bastard halfbrother baron nicolas st adrian a good and righteous man he had sent père claude and bran kelly to ask that the pope confirm that claim here père claude proffered the carved ivory box which was eagerly taken up by one of the popes secretaries there was a deep and very significant silence when the contents of the box were disclosed a sensual smile upon his lips the pope fingered the workmanship on the candlesticks he was thinking that catherine de medici was far too sure of herself she believed the pope to be in her pocket by virtue of their shared nationality he turned to his chief secretary and asked in a low voice where is this beaumont de jaspre it is a very small holding on the mediterranean sea between the languedoc and provence the secretary said the beaumonts have ruled there since the days of charlemagne although they recognize france as their overlord they have always been an independent holding the pope nodded so catherine de medici wanted this tiny duchy and the duc was certainly in a difficult position without the popes approval of the validity of nicolas st adrians claim france would he knew take the lands by force perhaps it was better for now that france not have the duchy perhaps it was better that frances dowager queen be reminded that the papacy was not her personal toy to be used at her convenience the pope smiled at the two kneeling men from beaumont de jaspre i will confirm the rights of nicolas st adrians claim to beaumont de jaspre as this is what your duc desires he said cavelli he looked to his chief secretary you will draw up the papers three copies one for the duc de beaumont de jaspre one for queen catherine of france and one for us you will see it is done today these men must get back to their master time is obviously most important here holy father how can we thank you père claude said my master and his people will ever be in your debt the pope smiled again fingering the candlesticks lovingly it was little enough to do for such munificence we will be happy to take the papal messenger with us as far as beaumont de jaspre holy father bran kelly said and we will supply him with a fine horse and a purse to continue his journey to france the pope was pleased this would save him the expense of the mans trip and the french would have to send him back at their own expense thank you my son he said now let me bless you bran kelly lowered his head hiding a smile as he did so these italians were so predictably greedy by making his offer to pay for the papal messenger he had assured that the man would be dispatched today and as the pope had said time was important they arrived back in beaumont de jaspre just three weeks after they had left and the papal messenger was on his way to catherine de medici the following day several days later skyes second messenger returned from poitou bringing with him to everyones surprise nicolas st adrian they had expected their messenger to bring an answer from the gentleman but certainly not the man himself skye was caught unawares as edmond hurried into her chambers his short little legs pumping in their haste he is here chérie the bastard himself by god he did not waste much time did he hes come with the messengerno escort no retinue it would appear that the heir is most eager gods foot edmond could that silly priest have not at least sent a messenger ahead to warn us daisy the seagreen silk gown damn my hair is a disgrace in this heat she smiled at edmond well my friend what is he like is he a de beaumont in face and form chérie i am not sure uncle fabron is going to approve the bastard is a tall man and his limbs are well formed and pleasing to the eye his skin is fair his eyes his eyes chérie are green the green of a forest pond sometimes dark sometimes light depending upon the sunlight his hair is the rich redbrown of my horses hide as to his features they are strong the shape of his face is an oval his forehead is high and his nose is definitely the de beaumont nose but his eyes are not ours and neither are his high cheekbones or narrow chin it is a very sculpted face of angles and planes all in all i would say he is a very handsome man and he looks like a strong one too i do not think that this new blood is going to hurt our family have you spoken with him daisy was helping her into the bodice of the seagreen gown edmond de beaumont let his eyes roll suggestively as he leered teasingly at her dishabille and skye swatted at him with affection i have not spoken with him chériehe replied to her question i felt it was your place to welcome him to beaumont first he cannot expect instant greeting as he has come upon us unannounced as daisy finished fastening the bodice he handed skye the skirt to her gown she pulled it over her head and it fell over the several petticoats that she was wearing hurry daisy skye instructed her tiring woman we should not keep baron st adrian waiting he will think it well worth the wait chérie when he sees you edmond murmured softly his eyes sweeping her with admiration the gown was lovely with its softly flowing full skirts and sleeves that came to just below her elbows full and fashioned as if they were pushed up slightly leaving her soft forearms bare the dresss neckline was very low and scooped and her breasts swelled provocatively with each breath she took the fitted bodice was embroidered in a swirling pattern of small sparkling diamantes and pearls around her neck skye fastened several matched strands of creamy pearls to correspond with the pearls in her ears daisy then pinned palepink camellias to the base of her mistresss chignon and skye was ready she walked to the door between her room and the ducs and entered her husbands room your halfbrother has arrived fabron she said i am going to greet him now with edmond will you see him tonight the duc shook his head vigorously in the negative you will see him she pressed fabron de beaumont lay very still feigning sudden sleep skye was not fooled you must eventually see him monseigneur she said quietly then she bent and kissed him on the forehead good night fabron she said and then she was gone fabron de beaumont felt the tears slide down his face quite unchecked his body had betrayed him but his mind was still clear and quite active skye and edmond hurried to the great hall of the castle where they knew nicolas st adrian was awaiting them he was a magnificently handsome man with a broad chest that narrowed vlike into his slim waist his dress was simple worn high leather boots the short dark trunk hose showing a shapely thigh above them a doeskin jerkin over an opennecked white silk shirt watching them as they entered the hall his green eyes never betrayed a thought although his mind was full of them the dwarf was the nephew what a pity for he was certainly well favored despite his height nicolas wondered if edmond de beaumont resented him but that he would soon know they had reached him now and the duchessewas she realcurtseyed gracefully welcome to beaumont de jaspre msieur le baron skye said in her musical voice we are most grateful that you have come reaching out his hand he raised her up and their eyes met for the first time her bluegreen ones widened just slightly and he knew that she was feeling the same thing that he was never in his life had he seen a more beautiful woman than this ravishing creature who now stood before him in an instant he knew that he wanted her and knew that she wanted him too madame he said it is i who am grateful to you for i understand from père michel that it is you who suggested i be made my halfbrothers heir despite my unfortunate lack of the beaumont name that oversight was hardly your fault msieur le baron she answered him now may i present to you your nephew edmond who is known as the petit sieur de beaumont edmond bowed smartly if skye is glad you are here uncle then i am twice as glad you do not wish to be duc de beaumont de jaspre edmond nicolas st adrian looked closely at the tiny man no i most certainly do not edmond was most emphatic look at me uncle i am a dwarf an accident of nature even if there were a girl who would wed with me what guarantee do i have of producing normal children never in the history of this family has there been a dwarf but i have learned that in my castilian mothers family there were several over the years i cannot marry and therefore cannot produce another generation for beaumont de jaspre you however can and from what i see uncle you will have no lack of applicants for your hand nicolas st adrian laughed he had never found a woman whom he wanted to marry but perhaps it was his lack of wealth that had prevented him even thinking of such a thing now it occurred to him that he was a very eligible partie you must be tired after your long journey msieur le baron skye said we were not expecting you so soon and i fear you will think our hospitality poor but i must ask you to rest here with some of our good beaumont wine while i see to your apartments stay and serve my new uncle edmond said i will see to the servants i know the rooms to prepare yes madame nicolas st adrian said i would learn of my halfbrother and this situation with the french i am after all a frenchman and i have sworn an oath to serve the king i can do nothing that would compromise my honor edmond de beaumont hid a smile as he left skye and his new uncle he was some ten years younger than nicolas st adrian but in many ways he felt older how innocent msieur le baron was edmond did not believe for one moment that nicolas was going to give up this magnificence this title and the wealth involved simply because it might offend the french charles back in the great hall skye poured nicolas a silver goblet of beaumonts fine rosecolored wine and handing it to him gestured him to a seat taking her own goblet she sat opposite him and raised the silvery vessel to you nicolas st adrian may you be a good duc for beaumont de jaspre i should far rather drink to your marvelous seablue eyes madame was the disconcerting reply his own green eyes raked her boldly you wished to know of your halfbrother she answered him coolly but her pulses were racing and her stomach was fluttering wildly she had not had this sort of a reaction to a man since she was a maid of fifteen and had met niall burke for the first time she must regain control of herself for she was a respectable married woman and her poor husband lay ill to death within this very castle he could see the turmoil within her although she sought very hard to conceal it he caught her gaze with his daring her without words to play the coward and look away yes he answered her tell me of my brothers illness madame she blushed charmingly but to her credit she was brave and did not glance away i am your brothers third wife skye said we were married three months ago but he suffered an apoplectic fit several weeks afterward and i was not with child the dowager queen catherine de medici would like to absorb beaumont de jaspre into france without a male heir we could lose our independence your halfbrother prefers that you inherit if you agree you will be invested as duc de beaumont de jaspre in st pauls cathedral next week understand that my husbands wealth will remain his while he lives although you will be given a most generous allowance you must also agree to care for his son garnier and your nephew edmond after fabrons death and you madame what will happen to you after my brothers death his intense gaze caressed her face boldly causing her to blush again should i not also take care of you the words said one thing his eyes said another skye drew in a deep breath to clear her head which was whirling she didnt know how much longer she could sit quietly speaking with this man he was having the most devastating effect upon her she could see the steady beat of a pulse at the base of his throat she wanted to kiss that pulse to fondle him to touch his chestnutcolored hair to see if it was actually as silky as it looked gods bones she thought furious with herself what in hell is the matter with me i am behaving like a bitch in heat there is no need to fret for me msieur le baron she finally managed to say how calm her voice sounded she thought pleased i am a wealthy woman in my own right when the sad day comes that i am widowed once more i will return to my own land my marriage to your brother was a political one i have left behind small children to whom i long to return for i miss them greatly sacre bleu he thought silently she is exquisite that skin is totally flawless is it as soft as it appears mon dieu but i want to kiss that adorable mouth perhaps madame your queen will contract another political match for you he said provocatively gods foot i hope not skye said with feeling he laughed he couldnt help it for she was so positive in her feelings his green eyes had lightened with his amusement and he asked this marriage was not to your liking madame for my queen and your brother it was convenient msieur le baron for me it was a necessity for i am irish and i needed a favor from bess tudor this marriage was her price and i willingly paid it what favor did you need madame was it for a lover perhaps no msieur le baron it was not for a lover it was for my infant son who with the murder of his father became lord burke and the possessor of great land holdings without the queens protection his holdings would have been gobbled up by others how dare he presume i would plead for a lover skye fumed silently did you love your late husband yes msieur le baron i did her voice was sharp he leaned over and taking her hand in his kissed it his eyes all the while never leaving hers i apologize madame he said for my rudeness he did not let go of her hand dear god skye thought as pure desire coursed through her veins i want this man and i dont even know him she rose to her feet hoping that her shaking legs would not betray her i cannot imagine what is keeping edmond she said i had best go and see to your quarters myself msieur le baron he rose too thinking to himself i must possess her not just for tonight but for always i have found the one woman that i can marry at last and i shall not let her escape me thank you madame he answered her gravely he was still holding her hand and it did not appear as if he intended to let it go msieur le baron she whispered tugging to free herself i think madame that you will have to call me nicolas after all we are related by marriage he raised her hand to his mouth once more his lips lingering slightly longer than was respectable before he finally released her skye thought she was going to faint she could have sworn he nibbled at her knuckles with his teeth the sexual tension between her and this man was simply incredible and she was frankly embarrassed she hurried from the hall feeling his eyes on her back as she went skye remembered the love that she had felt for niall burke when she had first met him all those years ago she remembered the passion she had first felt for geoffrey and when he had won her over the great love that bloomed between them what she now felt was akin to both those old feelings yet it was not like either of them with supreme selfcontrol she put it firmly from her and went directly to her husbands chambers he had just been fed and daisy who had volunteered to help the ducs serving man when she could was gently wiping fabrons hands and lips with a soft cloth that she dipped in rosewater as she worked she chatted away at the duc and skye could see that he was interested and amused in what she had to say daisys french had improved incredibly in the few months that they had been here she had it seemed an ear for languages now she was telling the duc of devon her home but the ducs eyes strayed from daisy as skye entered the room good evening monmariskye greeted him i have come back to tell you of your halfbrother fabron de beaumont frowned and shook his head in the negative skye laughed gently nonnonshe scolded him you must listen to me fabron nicolas st adrian is a handsome young man and even i can see that beaumont de jaspre is fortunate to have him to rely on in our hour of need you will like him fabron she smiled at him encouragingly tomorrow morning i intend to bring him to meet you again he shook his head in the negative but skye overruled him sympathetically fabron if you do not see him people will say you do not approve of him that you do not want this at all and then the french will overrun us you have signed all the documents she did not tell him of the popes support despite the fart that he was born on the far side of the blanket he is your brother and he is of gentle birth i see great intelligence in his face fabron de beaumont sighed deeply and grimaced at her but then with a slow gesture he reached out and sought her hand his grip was weak but she knew it was his only way of saying that he accepted her advice in this matter thank you monseigneur she said i understand how difficult this is for you but it is best for your duchy then she smiled i must hurry now for our guest has yet to be fed he came upon us so unexpectedly we must not however have him think that our hospitality is lacking this time i really bid you goodnight fabron de beaumont watched his wife glide gracefully from the room trapped in a body that could no longer function he had never felt more frustrated in his entire life to be struck down just when he had begun to find happiness with her was unbearable nothing had ever prepared him for such misery and he did not understand it daisy hurried after her mistress i only hope those two silly girls i am trying to train to help me have prepared your bath as i instructed them mlady marie and violette seem willing maids daisy i am sure they will learn under your tutelage flighty is what they are mlady but then i have no choice i thought no one could be as foolish as agnes and jane back in england but these two daisy rolled her eyes heavenward and skye had to laugh although several years younger than her mistress daisy had been in service with skye for over seven years now and was protective and jealous of her position what shall you wear this evening mlady she asked this dress will be quite suitable daisy i have hardly worn it today i must bathe however the day has been hot i fear a storm soon there has been thunder in the hills all afternoon as they entered skyes bedchamber marie and violette curtseyed prettily then hurried to help their duchesse disrobe daisy critically checked the bathwater to see that its temperature was just right for her lady and the bath oil mixed properly finding everything in order daisy removed the pink camellias from skyes hair pulled out the tortoiseshell pins that held the heavy chignon and brushed the mane free of tangles daisy would allow no one to touch skyes hair but herself satisfied that the hair was silky smooth the tiring woman carefully pinned it atop skyes head and helped her mistress remove her chemise skye climbed into the oaken tub that she had brought from england and settled herself in the warm water it was just the perfect temperature skye wrinkled her nose with pleasure at the damask rose scent permeating the room how she loved that smell let me soak for a bit she told daisy who knowing her mistresss moods left the bedchamber shooing the two giggling undermaids ahead of her the long windows that opened onto her balcony were open and she could see the vivid sunset coloring the sea and sky the colors had the deep intensity of early autumn and streaked the sea with molten gold clinging to the vine outside her windows a wild canary sang an impassioned song and skyes mind free this last halfhour from thought of her husbands halfbrother was suddenly and inexplicably filled with him again she was very much disturbed by the way that she had felt toward this man for he was a stranger worse she sensed that he knew how she felt and it made her position difficult what must nicolas st adrian think of her at least she had done nothing said nothing that could be misunderstood skye could satisfy herself that she had acted the perfect chatelaine before her husbands halfbrother whatever her confused mind and turbulent feelings it was the heat and her wild celtic imagination she decided relieved it had been a wretchedly hot and still day and she had not slept well since fabrons fit she worried about him as she might worry about one of her children keeping one car alert even when she was sleeping she felt so terribly sorry for her husband their marriage had hardly begun under auspicious circumstances thanks to the evil influence of the now dead pastor lichault had her life been more sheltered she might not have been as tolerant and forgiving of him as she was but she had quickly seen how tortured a man he was and skye omalley had a generous heart the physician had told her that he would not live very long for his fit had been a severe one and his bodily signs certainly were not good she could afford to be generous she would be a good wife to fabron de beaumont for as long as he lived as to nicolas st adrian her strange reaction to him had been a case of nerves she had been without a man for longer periods of time before and she had certainly not played the wanton then she was not going to do so now daisy she called loudly daisy come scrub my back chapter nicolas st adrian had come unexpectedly to the castle of beaumont de jaspre therefore his hostess warned him he could not expect an elegant supper thinking with amusement that a haunch of venison and a loaf of brown bread was a feast at his castle he watched with pleasure as the simple supper was served robbie having gone east on a short trading voyage there were but three of them at the high board this evening nicolas edmond and the exquisite duchesse the baron had thought that she might avoid him at the evening meal but no to his great elation she had come cool and elegant not quite meeting his eyes he was certain now that she felt as he did the heavy silver wine goblets studded with the duchys native green jasperstone were filled with fragrant dark red wine there were three dishes offered as a first course plump steamed mussels in their black shells served with a dijon mustard sauce pieces of baby octopus in olive oil seasoned with garlic parsley and fennel and a silver platter of hardcooked eggs sprinkled with the young leaves of summer savory and pungent black peppercorns the second course consisted of the whole leg of a baby lamb stuck with tiny sprigs of rosemary and roasted with small onions and carrots a large rabbit pie tiny larks wrapped in pastry and baked to a delicate golden brown each lark had been stuffed with a mixture of chopped oranges and green grapes there was also a fat capon that had been prepared with a rich brown sauce flavored with tarragon and salad of young lettuce radishes black olives and artichoke hearts dressed in olive oil and red wine vinegar and a large bowl of saffroned rice for desert clary leaves were dipped in cream fried and eaten with orange sauce there was also a large bowl of fresh fruits throughout the meal the wine goblets were never empty they all ate heartily edmond remarking that despite his monster appetite he remained tiny and teasing skye by saying that no matter how madame la duchesse stuffed her pretty self she remained slender he then noted that his new uncle was no mean trencherman nicolas smiled admitting it was the truth i am the last of the st adrians he said honestly my castle is tumbling down and not only has my larder been bare but my purse as well your simple meal madame is a feast to me beaumont de jaspre is another feast of sorts then that is why you came to us so quickly skye said we expected you later and with a great retinue nicolas chuckled a rich warm sound that sent chills up and down her spine alas madame i have no retinue for one must pay retainers and there was no money even my peasants thought me a poor lord they were forever scolding me about regaining the lost honor of the st adrians i must go to court they insisted but how could i explain to them that at court one needs gold that being baron st adrian is not quite enough they are such simple good people i hope that i will be allowed to siphon some of the bounty of beaumont de jaspre back to poitou to rebuild st adrian it will make a fine inheritance for a second son then she said you have decided to accept your halfbrothers offer yes but under certain conditions of my own madame firstly i will not war with france to whom i am a sworn vassal you need not skye said before we sent to st adrian for you msieur le baron we also sent to the pope that he might uphold your claim several days before you arrived my messengers returned bringing the popes approval of my husbands wishes another messenger was sent from the pope to paris on the day of your investiture you will swear an allegiance to france as have all ducs de beaumont de jaspre before you you will swear it before queen catherines messenger whom we have been detaining here since he arrived her eyes twinkled at this last indeed have you madame his voice was amused she was quite a woman to so daringly brave the wrath and might of france indeed nicolas we have it was the first time she had used his name and it sent a shiver through him that he well concealed he has been housed most pleasantly edmond remarked he will have no cause for complaint with his mistress we have even seen him supplied with the most attractive of maidservants edmond you havent skye was shocked my god what would elizabeth tudor think when she learned that beaumont pimped for a french envoy chérie can you think of a better way to keep an imprisoned man content and goodnatured i certainly cant queen catherines messenger will have no reason to protest our treatment of him when he returns to paris i suspect that the hospitality of beaumont de jaspre will be most lauded nicolas laughed and his green eyes were damp with his mirth you are both impossible skye scolded but her blue eyes were dancing with merriment and they both knew that she was not seriously angry have you any treaties that i should know about madame skye looked to edmond questioningly and asked other than the treaty made with england edmond he shook his head what treaty with england madame my husband has a treaty with england allowing english ships to stop here to provision and water on their way to and from the levant and istanbul he raised an eyebrow and she continued france and england are not at war with each other msieur le baron i believe that even now they court each other so that was why you were sent to my halfbrother your queen uses beautiful women in the same way that queen catherine does like chess pieces upon the great board of power and my pious brother was more than willing to accept englands beautiful pawn his voice was faintly scornful skyes bluegreen eyes grew stormy with outrage and when she spoke her voice was cutting do you dare to judge me msieur le baron what can you possibly know of the games of power sitting in your tumbledown castle in the midst of the poitou marshes how easy it is to be righteous when you have nothing to lose i however have learned that in order to survive one must play the game of life as those in power dictate i have six living children msieur le baron i have buried four husbands i am wealthy in my own right beyond your wildest imaginings i most certainly did not need your uncle but wealth msieur le baron cannot protect you from royalty i needed an ally and elizabeth tudor is the strongest ally available in my part of the world should i have put my faith in french or spanish aid bah the french and the spanish aid the irish and the scots only for their nuisance value against the english then they depart leaving us to face tudor wrathwhich usually involves the taking of our lands and our gold iwill not beggar my children for an ideal ideals cannot feed them or clothe them or protect them from wicked men but i can and i will now msieur le baron i will bid you goodnight it has been a long day for me standing she swept regally from the room leaving both men somewhat shaken by the passion of her outburst finally nicolas st adrian spoke she is magnificent he said softly and his green eyes still full of her gleamed thoughtfully she is like no other woman i have ever known edmond de beaumont responded honestly she did not want to come to beaumont de jaspre she had to leave her children behind but her sense of duty i sometimes think is greater than a mans she would not endanger the inheritance of her burke son and her queens price for protection of the boys rights was this marriage and so skye came she had children by her other husbands by all of them edmond answered that is one reason why my uncle was so pleased to have her she has borne seven children but lost only one and him to an epidemic when he was an infant what happened to her husbands the first died from injuries incurred in a fall edmond said the second and the last were murdered by women and the third husband died in the same epidemic that killed their younger son she did not wish to remarry she said she felt she was ill luck to the men who loved her and now she will lose my uncle too does she love your uncle edmond shook his head there was no time for love to grow between them but she is fond of him and will do her duty by him skye has been good for this family even in the short while she has been with us for a while longer the two men sat in companionable silence nicolas absorbing the information edmond had so freely given him finally he spoke you need not be afraid that i will not take care of you and little garnier after your uncle is gone he said i will uphold all the duties of a good duc de beaumont de jaspre i never doubted it edmond replied but your first duty is to marry nicolas what nicolass voice was mock stem will you instruct your older uncle little nephew we need another heir for safetys sake uncle the dwarf replied i can hardly satisfy that need why not dwarfs are born of normal parents why cannot normal children be born of a dwarf parent no edmond said seriously i will not pass on that weakness in my seed to another generation i have watched with fear each time one of my sisters has borne a child no the ducs de beaumont de jaspres line of descent must remain pure and untainted uncle do you not enjoy the women nicolas inquired curiously edmond grinned indeed i do uncle in fact and he hopped down from his seat i intend to go into the town tonight to celebrate your arrival i am much prized by the ladies for they seem to enjoy sitting me upon their laps and petting me as they would a favored child then when they find out that i am as capable a rider as any tall man their delight usually knows no bounds i am simply careful about spilling my seed where i should not he winked broadly at nicolas will you come with me uncle the hospitality of villeroses taverns is legendary not tonight little nephew nicolas said with a smile i am weary from my long trip besides i should not want to inhibit you he teased with me along you would feel bound to set a good example for your elder and then you should not have a great deal of fun edmond chuckled not to fear uncle as the good père henri will tell you i am myself no mattermuch to his distress i might add very well then i shall bid you a good evening do not wait up for me perhaps if it is a very good night i shall not come home at all then he was gone from the hall and nicolas sat alone he sat sipping at the dregs of his wine for what seemed a long time but her beautiful face kept appearing in the bottom of his cup never in his life had he felt such an intense reaction to any woman they had just met he didnt know her she was his brothers wife and yet nicolas st adrian knew that he loved skye loved her and wanted her out of the corner of his eye he saw a servant yawn and instantly he felt guilty rising from the table he left the hall so the poor man his duties finally over might seek his bed back in his own apartments he was delighted to find that the servant assigned to him had arranged a bath a large oak tub had been placed before the fireplace in his antechamber a small hot fire now burned for it had begun to rain and the air was damp and chilly the serving man a thin fussy fellow named paul worked silently and efficiently eager to please this new master who was of such importance quickly he stripped nicolas down and after helping him into the tub began to gather up his clothes clucking at their dusty and somewhat threadbare condition with msieur le barons permission he said i shall have the tailor here tomorrow alas nicolas said amused i have no money paul how will i pay the tailor madame la duchesse will sec to it came the simple reply you msieur le baron are to be our new duc your clothing must not disgrace beaumont de jaspre if you will permit me to observe msieur le baron you have an elegant figure dressed properly you will do us proud nicolas hid his vast amusement as he accepted this compliment of sorts with a gracious nod having disposed of his new masters sad garments paul returned to begin the task of washing him with skilled quick hands he soaped and scrubbed nicolas from his chestnutred hair to his feet observing all the while that it was a sad shame that madame la duchesse had not been married to such a fine figure of a young man as msieur le baron such a good and beautiful lady deserved better than the duc fabron god pity the poor soul the duchy was vastly relieved that msieur le baron had come into his inheritance early now he must find a wife as lovely as madame la duchesse that will not be easy paul replied nicolas indeed i believe it will be impossible msieur le baron is right of course paul replied primly there has never been anyone like madame la duchesse in beaumont de jaspre she is an angel in her devotion to the duc fabron and it was her sweet and good example that led the duc back to the church how sad that she could not have borne the duc a healthy son before the onset of his illness paul helped his master from the tub and began to towel him vigorously nicolas sniffed himself delightedly what is that soap you used he demanded madame la duchesse had it made up msieur le baron it is scented with essence of clove madame says a man should not smell like a flower in bloom nicolas chuckled richly and paul allowed himself a small smile as he began to dry his masters hair first using a linen towel then a boars bristle brush and lastly a piece of fine silk nicolass hair was soon soft and dry and shining causing paul to remark that msieur le baron had a fine head of hair nicolas liked this chatty stuffy servant who had been assigned to him paul now brought forth a fine silk nightshirt but nicolas refused it saying i sleep in my skin unless of course it is very cold he could see that his servant was shocked though he strove to hide it nicolas strode into his bedchamber and paul hurried to draw back the coverlet he then wished msieur le baron a good sleep as he covered his now comfortably bedded master the room was quiet as nicolas stretched himself out enjoying the sensuous feel of the soft linen sheets scented with lavender closing his eyes he sought sleep but sleep would not come this night with a smothered curse he finally climbed from the bed and walked to the long windows that overlooked the sea quietly he stepped a small way onto the balcony then in a flash of lightning he saw her standing with her back toward him on the next balcony she had her face held up toward the mistlike rain that permeated the air her long dark hair hung free and he could see the graceful line of her smooth throat with a rashness he had never recognized in himself he knew that he had to have her now stepping back into the room he saw a small door by his bed and realized that it must lead to her room of course the door would be locked but he put his hand on the knob nonetheless feeling his heart accelerate as the handle turned looking through he saw a narrow passageway that curved around the spiral of the tower next door he left his own door open and walked through the passage and around the arc of the wall before him was another door which he was certain would be barred to him it was not it swung open with a creak skye heard the squeaky noise and came in from her balcony to see a barely noticed door in the wall by the small fireplace swing open before she could scream nicolas st adrian stepped into her bedchamber her very startled blue eyes swept his tall nude form and as her heart began to pound with excitement she felt an ache of desire begin to swell within and knew why he had come suddenly reason returned buffeting her weakening ethics and she backed away from him whispering no yes he said low reaching out he pulled her hard against him yes he said again and he tipped her face up his hand tangling into the mass of her soft black hair as he lowered his head to tenderly brush her cool lips with his burning ones yes he murmured against her mouth kissing her deeply now ignoring her palms frantically pushing against his bare chest as his other arm wrapped itself about her waist pressing her tightly against him skye felt an almost primitive joy taking hold of her as he kissed her gentle at first his lips now coaxed a sweet response from hers forcing her mouth open to plunge his tongue in to meet her own they fenced with one another and as they did the tongues became two spears of pure flame scorching and blazing with the fires of untamed desire she shuddered fiercely and with a supreme effort of will tore her face from his gasping this is wrong msieur le baron this is wrong i beg you to stop you must nicolas he said harshly his green eyes blazing with gold lights my name is nicolas i want to hear you say it i want to hear my name on your lips say it nicolas the word as she spoke it was a plea nicolas i beg you to stop every fiber of her being was tingling crying out to this stranger weakened she fell back against his arm her breasts rising and falling rapidly with the passion she sought so desperately to conceal from him she could not do this thing she must not he cradled her tenderly in the curve of a strong arm looking down at her with his ardent green eyes he deliberately held her captive with his intense glance i want you he said simply and then his hand hooked into the neckline of her gossamer nightgown tearing it easily the two halves opening to reveal her small and perfect breasts their little rose pink nipples thrusting up with a desire she could not hide ah si belle he murmured reverently his gaze softening si si belle his free hand reached out to cup a breast to rub the nipple gently with his thumb skye sobbed helplessly as her conscience warred with her desperate craving to be loved by this stranger nicolas nicolas i am a married woman dear god he must stop caressing her breasts every touch of his hand eroded her will only made her yearn for more and more and more never had she betrayed a husband nicolas her voice was ragged and the voice inside her head shrieked a different plea dont stop dont stop dont stop it said he didnt seem to hear her his head dipped kissing each dainty nipple sending a tremendous shudder through her and then he made the decision for them sweeping her up he carried her to the bed pulled the shredded peachcolored night rail from her laid her down and then lying next to her drew her into his arms i adore you skye he said in a low and tender voice and i believe that you feel the same way though you strive bravely to deny it out of loyalty to my brother somehow it was easier to speak now that he was not assaulting her senses so wonderfully with his hands and his lips i do not know you she said until this afternoon i never laid eyes upon you how dare you enter my bedroom and treat me as you might some common trull you will leave at once again i remind you that i am your brothers wife her words were brave but nicolas knew better than to believe her precious liar he said his tone warm and amused the moment our eyes met you felt the same passion i did why do you fight me skye you do not love my brother he is my husband nicolas if i cannot keep faith with him then i am worth nothing i have been called many things in my lifetime but a faithless wife is not one of them do you love him no she said honestly ours was a political alliance will he recover from this illness skye or will he soon die he will die she whispered nicolas oh nicolas why do you do this to me because i would bind you to me skye bind you so tightly that when fabron is dead you will not run away back to your england or ireland you have been mine from the moment that our eyes first met i know itand you know it then before she might reply might protest his possession he was kissing her again kissing lips that could not refuse him murmuring tender endearments against her mouth je taime je tadore tu es ma belle amour ma vie he covered her face with a hundred quick little kisses nuzzling in the tiny hollow below her ear placing slow hot kisses along the tense muscle of her neck leaving a trail of long hungry kisses from the little valley between neck and shoulder down along her arm she was paralyzed by the intensity of the passion that he aroused in her he had attracted her as niall had first attracted her instantly he kindled in her the same fiery hunger that geoffrey had once kindled in her in the next room fabron de beaumont her dying husband lay helpless skyes ethics battled with her emotions as nicolass lips began to tease the aching nipples of her taut breasts his warm moist mouth opened and closed again over one of those little nipples nursing as strongly upon it as a hungry infant she arced against him as the desire plunged down her body to center in her womans core ethics lost the battle as she threaded her fingers through his thick chestnut hair moaning softly pressing his head closer to her nicolas nicolas she whispered breathlessly pleading now for passion rather than against it he swung over her seating himself lightly on her long shapely legs his hands began a delicate caressing of her body sweeping up to gently knead her belly to cup both of her breasts to smooth over her shoulders and then down again along the curve of her waist and hips it was like throwing wood on a fire and her desire flamed for him yet he did not stop his hands were warm and loving his fingers unbelievably sensitive as they sought out her pleasure points finally he took her two hands in his and drew them down to his fully aroused manhood she shyly explored and stroked it finding him quite long and thick her passionheavy eyes forced themselves halfway open to see him and she caught her breath at his size i want you to put me within you skye he commanded her softly you do it mon amour put my hardness within the honeyed sweetness of your luscious body her body languid with his loving her will mesmerized by his insistent voice she obeyed his command a marvelous feeling of relief overcoming her as she slipped his pulsing weapon easily within her with a groan of pleasure nicolas pushed himself as deep inside her as he might go stopping a moment to allow her right sheath to accept him in comfort ah ma doucette he murmured in her ear and then he began a slow rhythmic thrusting going deep drawing his length almost fully out driving back into her again and then again and again until she swooned he revived her with kisses and soft words and she cried ah god you are still within me and shuddered with the hot passion you are mine he said fiercely whatever has been before is gone and only we two now and in this time exist his lean hips ground down upon her again and skye found herself lost in a world where only desire existed desire without end he pulled her arms above her head controlling her totally while he dominated their pleasure beneath him she writhed panting frantically her head thrashing from side to side desperately seeking her rapture but he sensed every nuance of her mood and held her in firm check until it pleased him to give her release a disciple of sensuality nicolas st adrian meant to be master of this beautiful woman finally seeing that she could take no more of his teasing he bent to kiss her lips thrusting his tongue into her mouth in perfect rhythm with his lower body which thrust into her frantic form her body arched sharply against him and she sobbed a low cry that she could not contain she felt as if she could soar like a gull higher and higher catching each new spiral of the wind until there was no beginning and no end the feeling was like nothing she had ever experienced but then with another cry she would tumble downward as quickly as she had soared up her beautiful body shook with each spasm every tremor more violent than the one before until she felt as if she might be torn apart she never felt him gain his own heaven falling into a deep swoon as she found her own he too came as close to fainting as he had ever come rolling off her he lay upon his back his body wet with perspiration his breath coming in short gasps that finally slowed to normal when his head had finally cleared he raised himself up on an elbow and looked down at her she was still unconscious gently he began to stroke her face with the back of his hand murmuring softly doucette doucette je taime je taime she heard his impassioned voice and knew that he hovered over her how could she face him skye wondered how could she excuse such wanton behavior on her part never had she behaved so with any man allowing her body to control her mind open your eyes doucette he said gently but she heard the command in his tone ordinarily she would have rebelled at such a tone from anyone but she felt weakened drained and helpless before this man she opened her eyes and they slowly filled with tears that she was unable to control nicolas drew her back into his arms cry he ordered her in a firm voice and in his arms skye wept out all the sadness that she had been bottling up since elizabeth tudor had sent her from england her piteous sobs were like a knife to his heart and he tightened his arms about her rubbing his face against her silken hair murmuring soft unintelligible sounds of comfort to her skye cried so much she thought she could cry no more and then she cried further until her eyes were swollen with the salt of her tears she was so very aware of him his heart beneath her ear beating quietly and steadily the smooth firm skin of his chest and the warm male scent of him finally her weeping eased then ceased altogether she nesded very still against him not wanting to raise her eyes to him not wanting to face him and he understood you must not be ashamed doucette he said in a quiet voice when i first set eyes upon you i knew that this was to be the way of it between us his certainty irritated her but before she might reply daisy was knocking frantically at her door and calling to her mlady mlady nicolas st adrian was quickly off the bed and gone pulling the small door opposite her closed as he went not a moment too soon skye thought guiltily as she yanked the bedclothes smooth the door between her bedchamber and her antechamber opened and daisy stuck her head in calling mlady are you awake hmmm what skye murmured sleepily keeping herself well hidden beneath the bedclothes and praying daisy wouldnt come far enough into the room to discover her mistresss torn night rail on the floor and her mistress quite naked beneath the coverlet tis the duc mlady hes taken a turn for the worse go and waken msieur le baron skye commanded and then find edmond as well yes mlady daisys head disappeared around the door which was then pulled shut skye leapt from the bed and ran to the trunk at its foot to draw forth another night garment kicking the shredded ruins beneath her bed as she did so she then found her light quilted velvet dressing gown amid the rumple of the bedclothes and put it on too hurrying to her dressing table she ran the brush through her tangled hair so that it had some measure of order to it barefoot she opened the door next to the head of her bed and hurried through into her husbands bedchamber père henri was already there as was the physician mathieu dupont she saw the priest administering the last rites to fabron and with huge eyes she looked at the doctor docteur dupont what has happened to my husband alas madame i feared this it is another fit this one fatal i was amazed that the first one did not kill him and he has been having small ones ever since this however is his death blow there is no doubt skye moved to the side of her husbands bed i am here mon mari she said so he might hear fabron de beaumonts dark eyes opened and his mouth twitched in a soft smile with great effort he reached out to take her hand and his shrunken and featherlight was chill with impending death skye fought back the urge to pull away suddenly to everyones great surprise the duc spoke haltingly nicolas where is msieur le baron skye demanded fetch msieur le baron i am here nicolas came forward from the shadows a dark green velvet dressing gown wrapped about him for a long moment fabron de beaumont looked at his halfbrother and then he said it is good quick tears sprang to skyes eyes and her husband glancing at her spoke a final time fixing nicolas with a pleading glance he said take care the boy my wife edmond i will care for them as tenderly as you would yourself my brother nicolas vowed this i swear to you on the blessed virgins love of her own family fabron de beaumont smiled weakly a final time and then his eyes closed as he slipped once more into unconsciousness as the early sun crept over the duchy of beaumont de jaspre fabron its fortyfifth duc died peacefully in his bed surrounded by his wife his halfbrother and heir his nephew who had been found in the arms of a plump barmaid his priest and his physician mathieu dupont pronounced the duc fabron dead and père henri fell to his knees in prayer the rest joined him and when he was through skye spoke with quiet authority you must anoint msieur le baron immediately mon père there is no time to lose beaumont de jaspre must not be without a duc for even a day though there can be no celebration while we mourn my husband the priest rose from his knees madame la duchesse is correct he said it is not as if msieur le baron were la duc fabrons son or nephew or legitimate brother nicolas finished quietly or legitimate brother the priest echoed that is a fact msieur le baron but you have his holinesss blessing in this no one will gainsay you your rights nonetheless i agree with madame le duchesse i will anoint you as soon as you can dress he smiled warmly at nicolas there is no need to tempt the french needlessly my son nicolas turned to skye his eyes suddenly soft you will come he said of course msieur le baron she answered edmond and i will both come as your witnesses in fact i think mon père that we should send for representatives of beaumonts best families even under these sad circumstances it is not that i would make a festive occasion but yes the priest nodded the more witnesses the better i will see to it immediately edmond said they will be in the castle chapel within the hour he hurried from the room we must have a mass skye said will you come to my apartments mon père i would make my confession of course père henri agreed and then he turned to nicolas shall i also hear your confession my son again nicolas looked at skye this time his glance unreadable yes mon père i will also make my confession he said after a long moment it was the hardest thing she had ever done for the memory of the previous night burned into her consciousness like a brand she felt terribly guilty and yet she did not feel one whit guilty she could not deny that she had wanted nicolas but had he not sought her out she certainly could have controlled her turbulent emotions all this she honestly told the priest slow tears trickling down her face this is what comes of marrying for expediencys sake instead of true love mon père but what could i do i had to protect my children the priest was silent for a few minutes while he thought over her confession he had lived many years and as a priest he had heard far worse than what she had just told him he sighed and then said quietly you have indeed sinned my daughter there is no way around it i can easily understand your weakness of the flesh in this particular incident but you have broken one of gods laws and so although i will give you absolution i will also impose a penance upon you for the next three nights you will keep a prayerful vigil with me in the chapel for the repose of your late husbands tortured soul skye raised her head and gazed into the priests face merci mon père merci vraiment she was relieved if not repentant her marvelous bluegreen eyes shone like rainwashed jewels as he blessed her père henri could not help thinking that if beaumont de jaspres handsome young duc was anything like his late father and judging from his quick seduction of skye he wasthere could be a serious problem with these two living under the same roof blessed virgin there could even be a scandal she was the most beautiful woman père henri had ever seen what normal man could resist wanting herindeed taking her he sighed dreading the days ahead leaving skye to dress for the hasty ceremony he moved on to the chambers of nicolas st adrian nicolas was already dressed in black velvet paul fussing about him the serving man was shooed out and nicolas knelt to make his confession he readily admitted his seduction of skye and in a voice that led the priest to believe he was not one bit sorry do you not feel guilty my son père henri demanded for leading this virtuous woman into sin i do not consider loving a woman to be a sin mon père came the disconcerting reply she was your brothers wife you have committed adultery was the stern answer she was meant to belong to me nicolas returned stubbornly we will mourn the brother i did not know for one years time as is proper and then mon père i intend to wed skye you cannot the priest was thunderstruck she was your brothers wife the church forbids such things fabron de beaumont was my halfbrother mon père we never knew each other a common father was our sole link a link only acknowledged as a last resort the pope has upheld my tenuous claim to this duchy i will ask him for a dispensation to wed my brothers widow it is not an unusual request and you know it the priest sighed what could he say at least the new duc intended to make an honest woman of skye if god counted good intentions then perhaps it would be all right my son he said i will grant you absolution but i will also impose a penance upon you in three days time the duc fabron will be interred with his ancestors for three nights following his burial you will keep a vigil with me in the chapel agreed was the quick answer père henri blessed nicolas and left to prepare for the mass and the anointing of the new duc he smiled to himself as he went thinking it was a fine penance he had imposed upon the lovers particularly nicolas he knew human nature well enough to know that he was not going to keep them apart but and here he chuckled he would give a new cathedral to see the look on nicolass face when he discovered that he could not bed skye for the next six days madame la duchesse de beaumont de jaspre shone like the sun at the simple anointing of the new duc she wore a creamcolored satin dress in the manner of the english court the underskirt of the gown was embroidered in gold thread with bumblebees and the slashed sleeves of the dress shone with cloth of gold upon her head she wore for the first time the beaumont ducal crown a dainty gold headpiece set with diamonds and green jasperstone about her neck was a simple gold cross despite her husbands death she could not wear mourning mourning worn for the old duc would be considered ill fortune for the new duc as each quickly invited guest arrived skye explained the duc fabrons death early this morning she then went on to say that baron st adrian duc fabrons halfbrother had both her late husbands and the holy fathers blessing to inherit beaumont de jaspre we must anoint him immediately lest our more powerful neighbors seek to annex us she explained the halfdozen important families of beaumont de jaspre agreed with madame la duchesse nicolas st adrian must be installed officially and quickly before word of fabron de beaumonts death was bruited about nicolas st adrian standing by skyes side was introduced to each family group and the beaumontese liked what they saw he was young and healthy and new stock new blood for the duchy they could go on another five hundred years with his descendants which meant that theirs would also be safe the sun poured through the long narrow stainedglass windows of the chapel while upon the altar the beeswax candles flickered a delicate golden light the reflections from the windows splashed blue and red rose azure and green over the worshipers in the chapel nicolas st adrian was declared the rightful heir to the duchy by père henri the popes approval to his claim being read to the assembled then the priest anointed with holy oil nicolass head lips and hands the kneeling man was then crowned by his nephew who firmly placed the golden ducal coronet upon his uncles head mischievously whispering as he did so better you than me mon brave skye placed the ducal scepter with its ball of polished green jasperstone in nicolass hands and the new duc arose and turned to face his subjects vive le duc nicolas edmond and skye said in unison vive le duc nicolas replied the others in the chapel vive le duc vive le duc a short solemn mass was then offered for the repose of fabron de beaumonts soul afterward skye invited all the guests into the great hall where a toast was drunk to the new ducs health and long reign then the invited dispersed and returned to their own homes and the mounted criers dressed in the azure and silver livery of the de beaumont family made their way down into the town and to the four corners of the small duchy to announce the death of fabron de beaumont and the anointing of his halfbrother baron st adrian as the new duc an official beaumont de jaspre messenger was sent in the company of frances newly released messenger to the queen mother catherine de medici and her son king charles the royal messenger had been witness to nicolass investiture and afterward to his swearing fealty to france as beaumont de jaspres duc the duchys messenger carried the written account of fabron de beaumonts death and his halfbrothers constant loyalty to his overlord charles ixth nicolas st adrians day was busy by the time all the messengers had been dispatched and he had arranged for his halfbrothers body to lie in state in the tiny cathedral of st pauls beginning the following day the afternoon had gone where is skye he asked edmond as they sat eating the evening meal in the great hall i saw her just a while ago edmond said she wants to keep to her chambers for the moment she said she would have daisy bring her something to eat she looks tired and she told me that she must keep vigil for the next three nights in the chapel nicolas cursed softly under his breath as he realized the real punishment in père henris penance then he chuckled to himself it had been a long time since anyone had gainsayed him what he wanted his gentle mother and his crusty old grandfather had spoiled him terribly in an effort to make up for his lack of a father and the social stigma attached to his birth well she was worth the wait but he would at least see her before she imprisoned herself in the chapel for the night anticipating such a move however skye had already left for the family chapel when nicolas arrived in her chambers how could she concentrate on serious prayer and true meditation if all she could think of was his kisses what had happened between them last night was wrong was immoral had indeed been a sin against gods laws she was too much of a realist to say it would never happen again that she would never lay in his arms weak with his loving but for the next three nights she intended to put all her energy into relieving her guilt for having betrayed her dying husband it mattered not that he had never known would never know if she could not keep faith with herself then how could she keep faith with anyone else nicolas instinctively understood her mood and kept from her but when she emerged exhausted after the third long night of her vigil he was waiting outside the chapel wordlessly they looked at each other and then he picked her up just as her trembling legs were about to give out and carried her to her own rooms she was already asleep when they got there her head nestling on his shoulder her breath coming as softly as a childs with a little cry daisy hurried forward as he entered the room marie and violette gaped openmouthed but were quickly brought back to their senses by daisys sharp command hurry and open the mistresss bed you useless things the two quickly obeyed only to be shooed out when they had completed their task daisy looked at the new duc and sighed she had been with skye long enough to know the look of a man in love with her mistress and duc nicolas was clearly a man in love ill care for her now daisy said but nicolas said in a firm nottobearguedwith voice no daisy i will take care of her shell sleep for a while so send away those two silly creatures who help you however i would like you to busy yourself about the apartment until i need you shell rest more comfortably my lord with her gown off daisy said helpfully ill do it he answered and daisy retreated skye had worn very simple clothes to keep her vigil now nicolas undid her black silk skirt and drew it off her turning her over he undid the bodice and turning her over pulled it away also two white silk petticoats followed along with her underblouse gently he removed the dainty jeweled garters that she wore to hold up her silk stockings and then rolled the stockings down off her legs and feet daisy had already removed the shoes quickly he removed his own clothes and getting into bed with her drew the covers over them to fall asleep holding her in his arms he awoke several hours later to find her already awake and staring at him with huge distressed eyes how do you feel he asked her still tired she answered honestly go back to sleep then he said drawing her down into the curve of his arm so that her head might rest on his shoulder she lay her dark head upon him but she did not sleep and he knew it what is the matter doucette skye sighed i thought i had prayed it all away but alas i have not she was obviously very distressed what he asked my desire for you nicolas you will never stop wanting me doucette as i will never stop wanting you go back to sleep now my angel this afternoon we bury my halfbrother and tonight i must begin my three nights of penance père henri has ordered you to pray three nights also he heard the laughter in her voice as she realized what the priest had done he was glad for it meant she still had a sense of humor to be able to laugh was a good thing when skye awoke he was gone and daisy was bringing her a goblet of freshly squeezed fruit juice youll have to hurry mlady daisy said for the old ducs funeral procession is to begin soon skye arose and was dressed in the appropriate black descending to the courtyard she found herself amid a small uproar little garnier de beaumont had been brought forth by his nurse to take his place in the procession skye had never seen her unfortunate stepson in the few months she had lived in beaumont de jaspre but now she understood fabrons desperate need and desire for an heir the child was fat and not totally in control of his limbs his head was enlarged and his eyes were slanted in an odd fashion the head lolled as if it were too heavy for his neck he did not talk but rather made little animal noises that his old nurse pretended to understand completely now the old woman stood adamant defending her babys rights while both nicolas and edmond argued furiously with her skye listened a minute and then brushing the two men aside said gently you cannot send the boy to his fathers funeral old nurse poor child he does not understand and all this anger is frightening him she stroked the boys cheek smiling and speaking softly to him there mon petit everything is all right she turned again to the nurse you know that he is not a normal child nurse he cannot therefore be expected to behave in a normal manner in this situation duc nicolas has promised that he will care for this child as tenderly as if he were one of his own now take garnier back to his own rooms nurse skye then bent and kissed the child in a loving gesture the old nurse nodded satisfied madame la duchesse is kind and she understands then the old woman took her charge by the hand and led him away now gentlemen may we go skye walked to her white palfrey and was helped up into the saddle by a groom the funeral procession wound its way down the hill from the castle to the little cathedral of st paul skye leading the way as fabron de beaumonts widow when the service had concluded and fabron had been interred in his tomb beneath the marble main altar in the familys crypt the packed cathedral emptied out and nicolas st adrian the new duc led the procession back up the hill one era had ended and another was beginning the people of beaumont de jaspre were getting their first good look at their new duc and they liked what they saw as they made their way through the narrow winding streets of the town languid ripemouthed beauties with melting invitations in their dark sloe eyes leaned from their balconies to pelt their new lord with flowers but he saw none of them he was far too engrossed in the woman who rode at his side he could not take his eyes from her at one point she whispered over the roar of the crowds do not look at me so nicolas you will shame me seeing them together edmond de beaumont wondered why he had not noticed it before his new uncle was obviously hopelessly and completely in love now he understood all those questions about the english treaty and knew why he himself was being sent back to england almost immediately with captain kelly nicolas st adrian wanted his brothers widow to be his wife for the briefest moment edmond was overcome by a feeling of terrible hopelessness if he had only been born normal then perhaps skye would have been his then he shrugged what was was besides if she had that kind of love for him his height wouldnt matter he looked at her now and saw the soft rose blush staining her cheeks as she gently scolded nicolas they were two of a kind edmond thought proud passionate people who would do very well together he considered himself fortunate to have her friendship for never had he known anyone like skye omalley she was unique there would be no festivities honoring nicolass possession of the duchy the celebrations would come later when he married and now the speculation began as to when and whom nicolas would marry several important families had marriageable daughters and in neighboring provence and the languedoc there were several noble families whose nubile offspring might make nicolas st adrian an eligible partie the new duc however appeared in no hurry to choose a wife edmond de beaumont departed for england aboard skyes own ship seagull several days after the funeral when she had asked him why he returned to the tudor court he replied that she must ask nicolas she had wanted to leave with him but knew that she must stay at least until the spring to officially mourn poor fabron it was the least she owed him as seagull sailed from beaumont de jaspres main harbor skye watched from her bedchamber balcony for the first time since she had left england she was actually alone except for the faithful daisy robbie certain that she was settled unaware of fabrons death wandered the eastern mediterranean in his leisurely voyage to istanbul now bran was gone back to england taking edmond once more to elizabeth tudors court nicolas came up behind her slipping an arm about her waist and drawing her back against him do you wish you were with edmond he asked yes she answered honestly do you have a lover you miss back in england skye she could hear the jealous note in his voice my children are there and in ireland she said sidestepping his query and realizing that she hadnt thought about adam de marisco in weeks when i was forced to leave him my youngest son was just over two months old his little sister isnt even two years old nicolas i have four other children as well i miss them yes i wish i were aboard seagull on my way home i will never let you go he said quietly nicolas you must there was a note of quiet desperation in her tone do you know why i have sent edmond to england skye no he would not tell me he said that i must ask you i sent him to your queen to ask that you be given to me as my wife i offer england the same terms my brother did the ports of beaumont de jaspre skye shook her head and laughed ruefully i sent a letter to william cecil asking to be allowed to come home now that fabron is dead which request do you think that your queen will favor doucette do not be cruel nicolas we both know that your ports are of value to england you are of value to me his arm tightened and he put his face in her hair near her ear skye sweet skye i love you from the moment of our first meeting i have loved you i want you for my wife i want you for the mother of my sons and daughters you feel much more for me than you did for my brother i will teach you to love me doucette i need you so much do not seek to marry me nicolas she begged when my beloved niall was murdered i realized that i was ill luck to the men who have loved me and wed me everyone dies in time nicolas but these were young men none were safe even your halfbrother fabron whom i did not love it is as if i am not meant to have a husband i would not want my ill luck to endanger you seek some young girl of good family to make your wife no i want you he turned her about taking her face in his two hands looking down into her bluegreen eyes doucette i warn you i will not be denied i could take you for my mistress and marry some other but i do not want you for my mistress i want you for my wife i have made the decision and you must abide by it he kissed her upturned nose you will be my wife skye was outraged i have made the decision he had said she took a deep breath nicolas she said calmly it is i who must make the decision as to whether or not to marry you you will not control me no man ever has i am my own mistress i have always been and i will always be if you can understand that then perhaps you will have come a little way toward understanding me if you learn to understand me then perhaps we shall be friends i am not so foolish as to deny that we are attracted to one another but lovers should be friends nicolas chuckled indulgently and sweeping her up into his strong arms he walked across the room to dump her on the bed then he stood legs spread above her doucette he said how can one so wise be so innocent no woman is her own mistress even your own queen there is always someone to answer to else elizabeth of england would have married her horsemaster you must answer to englands queen and she will give you to me without a second thought therefore you must answer to me his green eyes twinkled i will expect a proper and obedient wife skye she sat up a look of outrage on her beautiful face a proper and obedient wife she scrambled off the bed on its other side why you pompous arrogant ass of a frenchman answer to you id sooner answer to the devil himself elizabeth tudor may give me to you as a wife but you may live to regret it nicolas st adrian he grinned engagingly at her across the bed and then flopped down upon the mattress come to bed doucette he said in a deceptively bland voice ohhhhhh she shrieked with frustration i do not believe that you have heard a word that i have said nicolas you are totally and utterly impossible i will not marry you skye stamped her foot angrily to punctuate the point reaching up he grasped her arm in an iron grip and yanked her down onto the bed atop him you you stubborn jade have not heard a word that i have said i mean to make you my wife my god woman you behave as if i had made you an indecent proposal i have had enough of husbands she shouted at him it matters not if i fall in love or not i always lose them too quickly to death and its worse when i love them then you love me he shouted back at her his face alight with pleasure i hate you you are arrogant stubborn impossible and totally devoid of understanding you love me his face was just inches from hers no she squirmed to escape his grip you love me he rolled her over and she was pinned quite helplessly beneath him never damn the man skye thought you love me he said softly and then his mouth was covering hers in a deep and passionate kiss she struggled a moment beneath him and then realizing the futility of her position she lay still she would give him nothing she had to convince him of her disinterest she had to convince herself she liked him gods foot it was more than like but she couldnt nay she must not give in to her own desires she was bad luck for husbands and then there were her children to get back to in england and ireland doucette doucette he whispered against her lips and she shivered aimesmoi doucette aimesmoi skye turned her head away from him feeling quick tears starting to prick her eyelids oh you are a bad man a wicked man she said low how can you do this to me nicolas you claim to love me yet you subject me to this terrible torture i only seek to make you listen to your own heart skye he answered her and his hands began to move on her breasts stroking softly subtly she felt her breasts beginning to swell and grow taut with the sweet desire that he was able to rouse in her her nipples were tingling and sensitive so sensitive that the silk of her night rail felt irritable against them i do not deny you arouse lust in me she said in a desperate voice but that is not love it is a beginning doucette his fingers were carefully undoing the tiny pearl buttons and when he had bared her to the navel he pushed the fabric of her gown aside and bent to kiss her breasts dont her voice was ragged dear god she would explode with the wanting hush my love he said patiently hush then he was kissing her again warm and demanding kisses that left her weak and helpless to deny him any longer she kissed him back with sweet slow kisses feeling his firm lips parting the soft rush of breath from his mouth to hers the velvet tip of his tongue exploring delicately within that delicious amorous cavern his head moved back to her breasts nuzzling at them rubbing his rough cheek against their silken skin he ran his tongue in the valley between the twin perfections and then moved on to teasingly encircle and softly lick at each nipple a flutter of pleasure rippled through skye and she murmured low her arm extended to allow her to gently caress the back of his neck now it was his turn to murmur as her skillful fingers sent delighted shivers through his big frame skye moved both her hands to his chest and pulled his white silk shirt open sliding her palms over his smooth skin up to his broad shoulders and down his long arms pushing the shirt ahead of her then she wrapped her arms about his neck and pulled him down to her as his chest descended upon her breasts and he felt the marvelous soft fullness of her he groaned ah doucette this is what you were made to do to love a man and in turn be loved by one you talk much about making love nicolas she teased him and he chuckled i will make you pay for that insult he threatened will you she goaded him what will you do to avenge yourself love you until you beg for mercy he threatened i never beg for mercy nicolas she said softly i am used to winning all my battles he laughed at what he believed was her audacity doucette you are a woman and women have no battles women are tender creatures to be delicately nurtured women should be protected loved and adored it is the way of the world skye pushed him away and unprepared he rolled onto his back she sat up and looking at him said i think nicolas that you have been too long in your poitou marsh where on earth did you ever get such foolish ideas about women your ideas are a hundred nay two hundred years out of date in england a queen reigns in her own right in france a queen mother is the power behind the throne in fact the real power in france women are not mindless ninnies if i were one you would not be half as interested in me as you are you know nothing about me nicolas st adrian and i know that unless you can accept the kind of woman that i am we shall be very unhappy together you should not have been so quick to send to england for elizabeth tudors permission to wed me you may find that you do not like the woman i am and i shall not change he suddenly looked very confused and skye felt her heart go out to him listen to me nicolas and i shall tell you the sort of woman you have been lusting after then skye proceeded to tell him of her marriages her children her personal wealth her lands her childrens lands and wealth she finished by telling him if my queen commands me to wed with you you are right i must do so but understand that though i give you a dowry and elizabeth will surely beggar me wedding me twice in a year i retain and control my own wealth can you live with that nicolas i will not marry you simply to play the docile mare to your randy stallion my ideas of women come from my mother he said slowly she was a gentle and trusting creature who needed looking after my father broke her heart and she never married i think that my grandfather lived as long as he did simply because she needed caring for and without a husband who would do it had she not had a strong man in her life she would have been prey to others as she was to my father i was seventeen when she died my grandfather died shortly afterward i was a man and could care for myself and he believed his duty done did you never go to court she asked him there was no money for such things manners my letters how to read riding how to fight these things my mother my grandfather and my grandfathers old squire taught me what about young women surely even though you were poor you met the daughters of the neighboring nobility when i was a child i played with the peasant children when i grew old enough for social occasions i was not invited to the homes of our neighbors first there was the stigma of my birth and then there was the stigma of my poverty my birth might have been overlooked but my poverty never many a noble bastard has gone on to great things but none without wealth or the hope of it she nodded understanding his predicament tour grandfather taught you that women were sweet and mindless creatures meant for cherishing and giving a man pleasure but nothing more your gentle mother certainly did not give lie to his interpretation i will wager she always had a very protective serving woman about her to fend off anything that your grandfather couldnt berthe was with her until she died he answered nicolas you know nothing about women skye said i know how to love them he answered her is that not enough perhaps i do not know women of my own class but there are just as many kinds of women among peasants as among the nobility and i have met and dealt with them all are noblewomen really so different doucette noblewomen are taught to be freer than peasant women mon brave now i will admit that not all of them take advantage of their opportunities as i have done but many do if you desire a docile and obedient wife who will never question you or your commands then i must beg that you wed with a young and innocent girl and certainly not with me i am too set in my ways to change but i am not doucette for you see that i have far more to lose by not changing than you do he reached up and wove his big hand into her long black hair i love you chérie he said softly drawing her halfway down to him oh nicolas she whispered totally disarmed had he really listened to her or was he simply blinded by his desire help me to learn about you skye he begged i cannot be happy without you and i will not lose you pulling her all the way down for a moment he gently kissed her lips aimesmoi doucette i keep my own wealth and i want my children here at least those of them that can come to me especially my babies in ireland for my uncle and my brothers can hold the burke lands now but i cannot let my babies grow up not knowing their own mother my eldest and his brothers can visit us but their lives are in england and in ireland willow must come how she will love beaumont nicolas her face was radiant with the thought of her children and he thought she must be a good mother to care as much as she did i will love your children he promised her and we will also have our own and my wealth she would not let him escape it remains yours doucette i want you happy and besides i have never had much wealth what would i do with it you will learn these things nicolas skye told him the beaumont coffers are full edmond will teach you for he has a clever head with figures and oversaw fabrons wealth as well as the public funds you must learn lest others less honest take advantage of you i will learn it all if it will please you he said no no she fussed at him you must learn because you want to because you want to be a good duc it is important to beaumont de jaspre she sighed his own small holding in poitou had been a poor one and there had been no need for him to learn the many and varied things that overseeing a vast estate entailed wealth is a great responsibility nicolas the truly great lords understand that and so must you do not be one of the foolish ones who think that wealth is only for personal gratification first comes your family but there will be times when the duchy must come before it for the good of everyone including your family doucette you have convinced me that i have a great deal to learn and i promise you that i shall learn it but i do not wish to begin those lessons now now i wish to make love to you his heavylidded green eyes were laughing down at her you would then give me lessons she said teasingly surprising him if you would do so nicolas then you had best rise from my bed and take off your clothes i have always found it damnably hard to make love in ones clothes so saying skye swung herself off the bed and slipped off the demure pink night rail that he had already unbuttoned when she turned back to face him he caught his breath with wonder and delight as her lush body was illumined by the moonlight streaming through the long windows and the firelight from the small hearth no peasant girl of his acquaintance had had as magnificent a form as skye her small breasts were set high on her chest and thrust impudently forward her slender waist curved enticingly tempting a man to encircle it with his hands below it her hips flared in womanly fashion and flowed into long shapely legs and feet he knew the feel of her incredibly soft skin and long thick hair she was a most sensuous feast for a man and he groaned low his desire beginning to swell and pulse beneath his garments rising he tore off his clothes and then looking across the bed at her he held out his hand skye let her blue eyes sweep over him as his had so boldly swept over her tall and fairskinned he was really quite handsome with his sleepy green eyes and his wavy redbrown hair a recalcitrant lock falling boyishly over his forehead without his clothes she could see how long his legs were and how surprisingly shapely for a man she could also see how aroused he was and she smiled mischievously as she stared directly at his open desire then she reached out touched his hand and climbed back into the bed stretching out her fingers she teasingly caressed and fondled him as he stood by the side of the bed he throbbed beneath her touch and she laughed low a provocative sound that sent a fierce stab of desire through him he wanted nothing more than to bury himself within her to make her beg to make her cry aloud with her passion but for the life of him he couldnt move her touch was mesmerizing him sending waves of pure pleasure racing through him forcing him to stand very still lest she stop skye trailed her long fingers up over his belly and then down between his thighs and around his hips to squeeze his hard buttocks in her small skillful hands bitch he whispered come to me nicolas she said low it is you who began this fever in me do you now regret it or do bold women frighten you it was an audacious challenge and one that released him from her power he flung himself atop her pinioning her firmly beneath him his hard thighs pressed down against her soft ones his belly and chest flattened themselves on her as his mouth took hers in a ruthless kiss skye gasped but quickly recovered and returned the kiss her little tongue daring his to do battle to her surprise and intense delight he responded by giving her a sensuous tongue bath his flicking spear moving like wildfire down her throat across her breasts down her navel thighs calves turning her over he licked slowly up her legs across her buttocks up her backbone and over her shoulders gently he nipped at the back of her neck pushing her long black hair aside to nuzzle it by the time he turned her again onto her back she was gasping with hot desire it felt wonderful and she wanted to give him some of the same pleasure she felt in return let me love you nicolas she begged him attempting to sit up no doucette he whispered back you may be very good at the facts of business my love but i am even better at the facts of love tonight you will be loved and loved and loved again by me another time i will let you love me in return but not tonight his hands moved up to fondle her breasts to tease at the little pink nipples to kiss them and nip gently at them to lick them into hard little knobs of pleasurepain she let him have his way her will to fight or argue totally lost beneath his skillful hands she cared not what he did to her as long as he didnt stop the pure bliss that was invading her veins replacing her blood she felt him spread her legs and then his kisses were sending gentle tremors through her as they touched the soft flesh on the inside of her thighs then he raised his head slightly and kissed the smooth womans mont of her skye stuffed her fist in her mouth but it still did not entirely prevent the sound of her cries from coming to his ears as his tongue sought out and found the hidden sweetness of her with wicked skill he ran his tongue down the moist rosepink flesh thrusting within the very entry to her his tongue moved back upward and flicked teasingly at the tiny sensitive jewel of her womanhood a starburst of delight exploded in skyes brain and body reaching up he pulled her fist from her mouth and heard her moans of rapture lowering his head again he once more began the delicious torture not stopping until her frantic little mewling sounds told him that he had driven her far enough swinging over her he thrust himself deep inside her pushing her once again to passions brink loving the feel of her nails as they dug sharply into his muscled shoulders he was a master at lovemaking and he knew it but this time it was impossible for him to be patient he wanted his release and he knew that she did too with a shout of exultation he poured himself into her quivering vibrating warmth it was too much for her and skye to his astonishment began to weep nicolas gathered her into his arms loving her all the more for the passion that could set her to weeping in the midst of their fulfillment doucette doucette he murmured pressing small kisses on her wet face doucette mon amour je tame je taime dont cry my love ah doucette you will break my heart he held her hard and close rocking her back and forth like a child i am so afraid she sobbed i am so afraid nicolas i dont want anything to happen to you but if we wed it will i just know it will it does every time i love and i cannot bear any more i cannot you do love me he breathed happily yesnoi dont know all i know is that i dont want anything to happen to you they had to deal with her fear and he was wise enough to know it we cannot marry for at least a year doucette he said to mourn my brother any less time would be disrespectful we cannot even announce our intentions before then if nothing happens to me in that time skye will you believe that nothing will surely there must have been some man in your life whom you cared for and who was not hurt by this phenomenon you believe in skye stopped crying there was adam adam had never been really harmed for loving her but then adam had never been married to her some instinct warned her not to mention adam for she had seen that nicolas could be jealous there is no one she said softly then i shall have the honor of being the man to destroy your dragon doucette he said gaily do not fear ma chérie i am a lucky man i always have been i was conceived a bastard and my father might have disowned me but my mother and my grandfather did not they loved me and nurtured me my grandfather even legitimatized me allowing me to inherit his title such as it was my halfbrother made me his heir the pope confirmed it and now i am a duc a wealthy duc i shall be lucky in love too in a years time i shall marry you and we shall make beautiful children together and we shall live happily ever after as they do in all the childrens tales he tipped her face up and looked down into her bluegreen eyes do you believe me my beautiful doucette will you trust me to make everything all right she looked into his eyes eyes that were filled with love for her eyes that honestly believed the words he spoke he was so sure of himself he was so sure of his ability to make everything all right she wanted to believe that he could and why not she thought i will trust you nicolas she answered him oh my darling i will trust you perhaps this time it will be all right in the days that followed it seemed that she had made the right decision nicolas st adrian was a perfect lover and he was also a man of his word he worked very hard to understand the sort of woman that skye was and as he came to understand her he found he liked an independent woman he began to admit to himself that as sweet as his mother had been he had sometimes found her helplessness irritating and cloying it had been an effort for her to choose between venison and rabbit pastry for her supper and he wondered why his father had been attracted to her in the first place he could only suppose that it was his pretty mothers innocence that had been so enticing skye however had no such difficulty reaching decisions she was a woman who seemed to know exactly what she wanted and how to get it she was a woman who knew power and had dealt with it and she quite fascinated him to her immense delight skye found that as well as being a magnificent lover nicolas had an excellent mind that he had never had the opportunity to learn the things she knew had not been his fault and under her tutelage he began to acquire an excellent knowledge of finance and trading politics and government courtly behavior and maneuvering that would stand him in good stead in the years to come skye enjoyed teaching so apt a pupil and the days slipped by turning into weeks and gradually into months in beaumont de jaspre skye found herself living a life far different from any she had ever lived away from the mainstream of a powerful court and a powerful country their fives were quiet and calm the de beaumonts had never had an important court like some of the larger citystates but now with an elegant and gay young duc the livelier members of the little duchys nobility began to congregate about the castle it was quickly apparent to the young women among this group that nicolas st adrian had chosen his duchesse they accepted this with as good a grace as they could under the circumstances but it did not prevent some of the bolder among them from flirting outrageously with the duc nicolas was flattered by their attention but he had made his decision within the first hour of his arrival in beaumont and his heart remained true to skye as christmas approached she began to grow sad once more a year ago she had been pregnant with padraic and niall had been alive with their baby daughter deirdre and the macwilliam they had celebrated in the great hall at burke castle huge oak yule logs were dragged into the hall to be burned in the enormous fireplaces the hall itself was decked in garlands of pine and holly there were great haunches of venison to eat and casks of frozen cider into which redhot pokers were plunged the sweet liquor being drawn off a little at a time into the silver goblets there was a minstrel who could sing all the stories of old of the time when ireland was free from england and the land was peopled with giants and fairies and great heroes and brave beautiful women of a time when grand and noble deeds were done and love was always undying nicolas could see the sudden drastic change in her mood and intuitively sensed that she was thinking of another and happier time in her life he half hoped that she was pregnant so he might have an excuse to marry her now but skye had told him quite gravely when he had once mentioned it that they would not have children until after they were married the positive way in which she spoke led him to believe that she practiced some forbidden sort of contraception but he would not press her on it she was not yet his wife and he realized that she needed time a time to grieve that had been denied her before and that he would not deny her now nicolas had a wonderful surprise for skye something that he knew would make her gay and happy once more each day he scanned the mouth of villeroses harbor for the return of bran kellys ship which he hoped would bring edmond the queen of englands blessing on his union with skye and the surprise three days before christmas the seagull sailed back to beaumont de jaspres main harbor nicolas and skye rode down the hill from the castle and through the town a small coterie of guards escorting them it was a perfect mediterranean day and she looked so very beautiful in the deepblue silk riding dress its sleeves lavishly trimmed in creamcolored lace which dripped gracefully from just below her elbows her lower arms being bare upon her hands she wore cream doeskin gloves embroidered in tiny freshwater pearls and gold thread although the sun was quite bright and it was a warm day skye had chosen not to wear any headdress instead her long black hair was bound back only by an embroidered ribbon she rode a white palfrey with a red leather saddle and a bridle that was hung with tinkling silver bells the road wound down from the castle through the pink town with its balconies filled with their profusion of brightly colored blossoms the millefloral scent perfuming the air around them upon some of the balconies hung cages of songbirds trilling happy tunes it was all so beautiful that skye wanted to cry it would be so wonderful to have her children with her how they would enjoy the days of golden sunshine and warm weather she sighed determined not to be sad and spoil nicolass mood he was trying so hard to make her happy and it was not his fault that he was unable to supply her with the one thing that she needed to complete her happiness as they passed through the main square of the town the marketday crowds took up the delighted cry vive le duc vive madame la duchesse it was impossible not to smile and wave a hand at these friendly people who were obviously so eager to love them ahead the street opened into the harbor area the docks of beaumont de jaspre were alive with ships unloading their goods from all over the mediterranean and northern europe she could smell the fragrance of spices the strong scent of uncured hides and fish all mingling into a smell particular to docks the world over the vessels were flying flags from virtually every nation england norway france spain the ottoman empire sweden algiers morocco portugal scotland there were so many languages being spoken that when she tried to concentrate on one her head began to spin they were able to ride directly to skyes ship which had been given a preferred dockage near the openair harbor market she could see the omalley flag fluttering in the soft afternoon breeze around the ships mast on the open main deck she could see some of the crew moving about they came to a stop before the gangway and dismounting nicolas helped her from her saddle bran kelly appeared from the main cabin and calling out to him skye waved he flashed her a delighted grin and waved back skye hurried aboard have you brought edmond back she demanded indeed mlady i have and a surprise from your duc that i hope will please you bran turned to nicolas now sir nicholas smiled now he said if you will come into the main cabin with me mlady bran said politely and skye puzzled followed as he opened the door and stepped back to allow her through first walking over the threshold skye suddenly stopped and stared hard then without warning she burst into tears instantly she was surrounded by her children all laughing shouting and crying themselves a small darkhaired little tot peered wideeyed around edmond de beaumonts legs at her and another a fat blueeyed baby boy gazed seriously at her from his nurses arms are you not glad to see us mama the practical willow demanded skye omalley stared at five of her six children quite overcome with pure and total joy she had everything speechless for a brief moment she held out her arms to the children and the three older ones rushed to her all talking at once she hugged murrough gods nightshirt he was taller than she was now how had that happened in only seven months she kissed willow her beautiful and treasured little daughter willows checks were damp but she smiled a blindingly radiant smile at her mother and words were not necessary between the two robin she finally found her voice and gathering geoffrey southwoods son into her arms she hugged him hard robin usually very conscious of his position in life did not complain but kissed his mothers cheek enthusiastically skye stepped back and viewed her offspring delightedly then turning she looked at nicolas thank you she said quietly he smiled back at her but said nothing words were unnecessary chérie edmond de beaumont said here is a little child who would greet you gently he drew deirdre from her hiding place behind him kneeling skye held out her arms to the small girl a soft smile touching the edges of her lips nialls daughter looked so very much like her deirdre burke was indeed her mother in miniature with her camelliafair skin a tumble of dark curls and her bluegreen eyes thumb in her rosebud mouth she eyed skye suspiciously silly one willow scolded her baby sister this is our mama deirdre looked at skye then at willow who nodded her head vigorously then at skye again she took a hesitant step forward then another and reaching out skye pulled her youngest daughter into her arms to kiss her on her fat cheeks the little girl snuggled into her mothers embrace happily and skye almost wept deirdre was just two and in the several months in which she had been separated from her mother she had forgotten her entirely she would never remember niall her father and this fact did cause skye to shed a few sad tears especially when she looked up and saw her youngest child padraic who was as much his fathers image as deirdre was her own you arc happy now doucette he was standing by her side skye stood up holding deirdre in her arms i am very happy nicolas how can i thank you deirdre looked at nicolas papa she said in a definite voice a huge grin spread over nicolass face indeed i shall be he said happily if the queen of england has granted my request nephew edmond am i to be a happy bridegroom indecd my enthusiastic uncle you are you have englands blessing upon your union i thought you were already married mother murrough stepped protectively to his mothers side deirdre squirmed in her mothers arms holding out her fat baby hands to nicolas who delightedly took her deirdre snuggled down into his arms and coyly repeated papa her look was one of supreme selfsatisfaction and if her older siblings were slightly embarrassed by her behavior she was not one bit concerned skye hid a smile at the older ones discomfort the duc whom i wed seven months ago murrough died shortly afterward this gentleman is nicolas st adrian his heir and beaumonts new duc he will be your stepfather come the spring when my year of mourning is over murrough nodded and then turning to meet nicolass gaze bowed politely how do you do my lord he said i do very wellmurrough is it yes my lord i am murrough oflaherty skye reached out to draw her other two older children forward nicolas this is my son robin the young earl of lynmouth and my oldest daughter willow small welcome to beaumont de jaspre children nicolas said willow curtseyed prettily and robin bowed gravely are these all of your children doucette nicolas asked admiringly no my eldest is not here why did ewan not come she asked murrough he did not feel it wise to leave ballyhennessey at this time mother has there been difficulty skye looked worried wondering about her oldest child who would in three months time be celebrating his fourteenth birthday not really the english are most respectful of the earl of lynmouths older brother murrough chuckled and added although it does infuriate ewan to have to hide behind robins title still uncle michael insists he do it the problem has been with ewans neighbors old black hugh kenneally of gillydown to be specific he thought that because ewan was barely weaned from his mothers teats as he put it he might take some of the lands of ballyhennessey for himself what did ewan do skyes voice was tense burned black hughs fine house down about his ears put his fields to the torch and drove off his sheep they were arguing about the sheep when i last heard ewan felt black hugh owed him some sort of fine for the inconvenience to which hed been put black hugh wanted his sheep back feeling that having his house and fields burned was fair enough ill wager that ewan keeps at least half of the sheep so he should skye said am glad that your brother did not hesitate to exact revenge upon black hugh he must be strong else his other neighbors think him easy prey as for hiding behind robins name tis only his pride that makes him angry what is important is that he retain his lands and his power there is no shame in ewan having the right family ties even if they be english murrough teased his mother if more irish had learned to put the english to use skye said wryly we would not have half the troubles we have between us nicolas stood amazed at the conversation between skye and murrough he had been even more amazed to hear skyes approval of her oldest son ewans actions this tough and fierce side of her was not something that he had seen before he had not even suspected she had such a side then he laughed at himself for a romantic fool she had been telling him of her lands of her wealth of the lands and wealth she administered for others she had to be strong to hold such power are you still sure you would wed such an independent woman as myself nicolas she gently teased him and then put a soft hand on his arm the first moment i laid eyes on you doucette i knew that there was but one woman for me he said quietly and you are she skye looked about the cabin of the ship at her children let us go home nicolas she said i seem to have everything that i need to be a happy woman now reaching out she took her infant son from his redcheeked irish nurse and turning she walked through the door onto the deck and into the bright sunshine of the december afternoon her children edmond and nicolas trailing in her wake chapter the winter was a mild sunny one the rainy season coming only in february and then giving way to a beautiful warm march when the hillsides filled with softly blowing red and blue windflowers it had been a wonderful winter and for the first time in many months skye omalley and her children felt loved and safe beaumont de jaspre was a happy place the menace of france had subsided with the popes message to queen catherine and nicolass unquestioned loyalty there was no elizabeth tudor and her court to overshadow their happiness it was the first time since geoffreys death and the early days of her reunion with niall that they had all been together she saw her two older sons gradually become boys again dropping away the sophisticated courtiers veneer that they had worn on their arrival as easily as a snake sheds his skin nicolas took them hunting in the small range of mountains that served as one of beaumonts borders he took all the children swimming on a deserted beach below the castle the boys were like young dolphins splashing and diving willow however was content to paddle around the shore with her baby sister deirdre and tiny padraic crowed with delight when nicolas took him by his little hands and floated him in the gentle sea the baby wriggled with pleasure in the warm waters his plump little arms and legs moving busily her children quite obviously approved of nicolas st adrian elizabeth tudor certainly approved of him and skye began to believe that she might even dare to love him he assuredly adored her and he seemed to genuinely care for her offspring she could see that he was a man who loved children easily and would do well with them if only she were not plagued by that tiny nagging doubt that would not leave her in peace she yet worried that if she married nicolas he would be touched by the bad luck that seemed to strike at all of her husbands still she had no choice the wedding was set for the day after her oneyear period of mourning was over when he had told her that she had blushingly protested his lack of decency but nicolas had laughed saying that no one who had seen her would lack for understanding of his unseemly haste robin and murrough intended to stay with their mother until midsummer then return to court the other three children would remain with skye and nicolas bran had sailed in early spring for bideford to fetch dame cecily back for the wedding bran and daisy were planning to marry shortly after skye and nicolas robbie had returned in midwinter from his voyage to istanbul he was very surprised by the turn of events that had made skye a widow and was now making her a bride again nonetheless he fully approved of nicolas and the two had become very good friends he had never really warmed to fabron de beaumont but liked his halfbrother it was too perfect and she had known it the messenger came a month before the scheduled wedding they tried to protect her from him nicolas and robbie both nicolas did not like the look of the dark man to the young duc he was an infidel to be wary of but robbie knew better the dark man came from algiers give me the message the devon sea captain demanded of the messenger in flawless arabic i will see that she gets it i cannot do that sir was the polite reply who has sent you was robbies next question i will only speak to skye muna el khalid was the answer and then the thin man in the long white robes stood silent ill have him thrown in the dungeons beneath the castle nicolas said impatiently as robbie translated the conversation it will do you no good robbie remarked you could pull his fingernails off with burning pincers and he would not say another word the only way we will learn anything further is to get skye so she may hear his message nicolas sighed some instinct warned him that this strange man was about to destroy his happiness nonetheless he had no choice he sent a servant for skye coming into the great hall her eye instantly found the man in white and she stopped growing pale she too had recognized the garments of algiers garments she had never again thought to see who is this man she begged of robbie we dont know lass he arrived here asking for you he will say nothing of who he is or who has sent him he seems to speak only arabic do you remember the language she nodded and then drawing a deep breath walked over to the man you wish to see me you are skye muna el khalid i am she the man in white bowed low and respectfully i am haroun the servant of osman the astrologer he said i bring you a message from my master have you been offered refreshment haroun skye asked you have traveled far if you come from osman skye turned to one of the castle servants bring cakes and fresh fruit juice she commanded you are kind lady haroun said let me do my duty and then i will gladly partake of your hospitality speak then haroun the servant of osman the message my master sends to you is this your husband is not dead he whom osman once told you was your true mate lives you must come to algiers immediately so that my master may tell you the truth of this matter he who is your true mate the words rang frighteningly in her head as she collapsed in a dead faint nicolass hand went to his dagger but robbie who had understood harouns words cried out no lad i dont think the messengers news is bad here and he bent to cradle skye help me to revive her he looked to a stunned servant you get wine i did not mean to harm the lady haroun said worriedly to robbie youve just shocked her man was the reply did your master say to tell it that way yes sir i have but repeated the words given me by my master osman osman is growing dotty robbie muttered as nicolas took skye from him and lifting her into his arms carried her to a nearby settle carefully he propped her up rubbing her wrists calling her name softly almost frantically a serving man ran up with a small goblet of wine and gently nicolas began to force some of the potent liquid down her throat skye coughed and then her eyes flew open he is alive she cried who ma doucette let me send the infidel away no she turned her face to the messenger haroun is there any more message she almost begged him i have said it all lady he answered her sorry to see the wonderful light go from her beautiful blue eyes how can i be sure you are who you say skye demanded thats the first intelligent thing youve said snapped robbie relieved what the hell is he talking about osman sends word that niall is alive what are ye daft lass niall burke was murdered by a crazy nun and dumped in the sea how the hell can he be alive and how do you know thats what he means anyway he who is your true mate what kind of gobbledygook is that when khalid was murdered by yasmin and jamil and i grieved for him osman told me that my future was with the man i had first loved the man of my own homeland niall burke she turned to haroun again where is the proof you are who you say she demanded my master said if you asked for such proof i was to tell you what he once told you follow your instincts they will never fail you haroun replied play out your part as allah has foretold skye grew pale again he is from osman she said with finality what kind of proof is that robbie yelled they are osmans words to me before i left algiers since he spoke them to me when i was alone i must accept them as proof of harouns honesty he could only have learned them from his master robbie snorted irritably you haroun how did you know where to find skye muna el khalid a vessel belonging to this lady stopped in algiers several weeks ago i brought its captain to see my master and my master asked this captain an old man with a strange and unpronounceable name macguire aye lady harouns dark face cracked in a small smile my master asked this man to take a message to you but the old man said that you were not in your homeland but rather in this place i was therefore dispatched to fetch you to my master he says that you must waste no time in coming to him for the man who is your true mate is in danger can we sail tonight skye demanded of robbie aye but i think youre crazy lass let me go to osman and see what it is he has to say if indeed it is really him have you forgotten jamil god what jamil would not give to wreak his revenge upon you skye algiers is too dangerous for you lass no i will go robbie i must go robbie looked at haroun is captain jamil still alive man he lives sir but at this time he is gone from the city to istanbul to seek a cure for his illness it will be safe for the lady my master would not call her were it not safe we sail tonight skye said in a voice that brooked no argument nicolas st adrian had stood by looking from one to the other while they had spoken back and forth and to the dark haroun the quick language that they had used was not familiar to him and he had not understood a word that they had said he had known instinctively however that he was somehow about to lose skye and all his emotions gathered themselves to fight this he could not would not let her go from him tell me doucettem he begged her tell me what this man has said and why i feel you are about to go from me she had forgotten him she had forgotten this gentle and tender man who loved her so deeply who intended to make her his bride in a months time for the last few minutes it had been as if he had not existed for the truth was that only niall burke existed for her her hands flew to her face in distress and her beautiful sapphire eyes dark in their sorrow looked into his face i cannot marry you she said softly my husband is alive haroun has brought me word from an old friend in algiers that niall is alive osman would not lie to me i must go to algiers nicolas i must find niall do not leave me he begged her i have no choice nicolas she said low niall is alive i cannot wed another while my lawful husband lives let robert go he said let robert go to find out if what this man says is true stay with me until he returns aye robbie chimed in thats what i told her too nicolas but she will not listen as always she is stubborn niall is alive osman says he is in danger she shouted at them i must go to him i must and i will to send robbie is to waste precious time wasted time could cost my niall his life if that happens i shall never forgive either of you never go then he shouted back at her go but if this turns out to be a fantasy promise me that you will return to me doucette at least give me that hope osman would not lie to me she said softly promise me she looked into his face and saw that there were tears in his green eyes oh nicolas what have i done to you you see did i not warn you my darling i destroy in one way or another the men who love me it has ever been thus and i do not know why it should be she leaned over and kissed his cheek i promise that if this is a wild and futile chase i will return to you my dear nicolas for surely no woman has ever been so fortunate in love as she is unlucky let the children stay with me he said you will return to me i know it if i am not back by midsummer or you have no word of me you must send them all home nicolas padraic must be on his lands and murrough and robin have their places at court then too you must choose another wife no his handsome face was anguished no he repeated softly yes came the voice of edmond de beaumont and the dwarf hopped down from the large chair where he had been sitting quite hidden he had heard all and now he spoke urgently to his uncle have you forgotten why you were made fabron de beaumonts heir nicolas of all the eligible men in this family only you are whole normal able to father the next generation for that my uncle you will need a wife i have skye came the stubborn reply no longer i think edmond de beaumont said sadly it pains me also nicolas never in my lifetime has this castle been as happy as it has been since she came into it bringing her laughter and joy for life and love we should however do skyes memory a great disservice if we allow ourselves to fall back into the old and gloomy ways his violet eyes brimmed with sympathy for his uncle of them all he understood her loss best for edmond de beaumont loved skye too looking at her now he said must you go chérie yes edmond i must go if osman says that niall is alive then niall is alive how or where or why i do not know and i will not know until i see osman he nodded then you must go and you will go with our prayers the children skye said i must tell the children without a further glance at either of them she turned and hurried from the hall they stood watching her go each man lost in his own thoughts robbie wondered if what she was about to do was foolhardy how could niall be alive and if he was how in hell did osman know about it still and here he grimaced he remembered osman he was an honorable man and had been a true friend to khalid el bey seeing skye go from the hall nicolas thought his heart would surely break how could he lose her now just before their wedding surely this was not happening it was a bad dream from which he would shortly awaken a sound something like a sob escaped his lips it was no dream it was a real and waking nightmare he was about to lose to a dead man the only woman he had ever loved in his agile mind edmond de beaumont cursed the twist of fate that had wrought this terrible situation his uncle was shattered griefstricken at the loss of skye it was going to be difficult if not impossible to find a bride who would suit nicolas st adrian now but a bride would have to be found quickly else the menace of france arise again the knowledge of skyes affair with nicolas prior to their marriage had kept the french at bay for skye might have been with child a child who would have been the next heir to beaumont de jaspre now however skye would be gone and without a wife nicolas would be prime target for a french assassination if he were to die then beaumont de jaspre would fall like a ripe fruit into the lap of queen catherine while the men behind her thought their thoughts skye practically ran from the hall to find her children by chance they were all gathered in the garden and the older three instantly seeing her distraught look hurried toward her skye collapsed upon a marble bench her white skin unusually pale reaching his mother first murrough sat next to her putting an arm about her what is it mother he begged her and then robin and willow were squeezing in on the other side of her do you remember my speaking of my old friend osman the astrologer in algiers they all nodded and skye continued i have had a message from osman a strange and frightening yet wonderful message osman begs me to come to algiers for he says that niall is alive it is possible murrough said thoughtfully although the odds are quite incredible mother she was stunned by his words how is it possible murrough he was the first person who had not said she was mad to go and she wondered why remember the mad nuns words mother she left nialls body upon the beach for the sea to claim later when the others went back to the beach the tide had already come in and they assumed the sea had taken nialls lifeless body we know that she stabbed him but was he really dead did his lifeless body indeed wash out to sea mannanan maclir usually returns the dead shells of those whose souls he has taken nialls body was never found mother therefore it is possible that he was not dead but badly injured and it is equally possible that he is alive today and your friend osman knows his whereabouts murrough concluded triumphantly gods bones skye said totally surprised by her sons reasoning you are a scholar murrough you have a mind that reasons for a moment she forgot her own problems is that what you want my son to be a scholar i do for now he said with a smile thinking that he was only applying common sense to the situation and that this was a strange time for them to be having this little talk but then if his mother was rushing off to algiers to find niall burke heaven only knew when he would see her again where would you study she demanded of him merton college at oxford he answered her prompdy your father studied in paris she said in one of her few references to dom oflaherty for all the good it did him then she smiled at him when i return from algiers i will see to it that you go to oxford murrough of course it will mean that you and joan must wait to wed will you mind that arrange it now he said quietly you do not know how long it will take you to find niall and i cannot bear another year playing the popinjay of a page in the earl of lincolns household for robin the court is a joy as he is for all his age one of englands premier noblemen i however am a different matter mother both of my parents are irish and there are some english who cannot abide anyone irish who has dared to mistreat you she demanded angrily but murrough soothed his mother quickly no one would dare to mistreat me mother i am the son of the countess of lynmouth and brother to lynmouths earl i am generous with my allowance which always assures friends and the countess of lincoln is irish herself no one short of a fool would mistreat elizabeth fitzgeralds personal page still there are tiny insults and sly innuendos that i must constantly face with good cheer for if i lost my temper and fought i should be called a brawling irishman i do not like the court mother i know that you have told me that i must make my way there in order to win my own lands for joan but joan is like me mother she is shy and gentle she wishes no more than to be my wife someday and to raise our children in a peaceful place i wish to study at merton college thenand i think you will be amazed at my decisioni want to go to sea someday i hope to captain one of your ships mother you have said that i will never lack for money and that money will allow me to buy a fine house with a pretty garden where i can live with my family between voyages joan is almost three years younger than i am and she is really yet a little girl there is no hurry for us to wed and we had hoped to wait until she was sixteen that will give me six years in which to make my way in this world quiet murrough she thought she had never seen this side of him before he was really still a boy and yet he seemed this minute like a young man skye was not sure she was ready to have a young man for a son why have you not spoken to me before she asked him there was never any time he said honestly and she knew that to be true i will write to lord burghley tonight before i leave for algiers she said to him i will also write to the countess of lincoln and to my secretary jean morlaix if it can be arranged you will be at oxford in time for the michaelmas term thank you mother murrough said hugging her hard what about the rest of us willow demanded if you go rushing off to algiers what is to become of the rest of us you will all remain here until midsummer skye said by that time i hope to know the many answers in the niall puzzle if he is alive as osman claims then you will all leave for england and ireland at that time if however it turns out that osman was mistaken and i have been chasing after naught but a ghost then only murrough and robin will return to england you deirdre and padraic will remain here and i shall return to marry with nicolas as we had planned willow nodded poor dame cecily is certainly going to be mightily surprised when she finally arrives mother she hates to travel but she hates to travel upon the sea most of all you may go back through france skye promised you shall see paris and then you will have nought but a quick trip across the channel paris willow breathed oh mama you must give me my entire allowance for next year if i am to go to paris what teased skye so you may spend it all every pennypiece willow said almost reverently i shall buy laces and embroidered laced gloves and a silk dress and where will you wear them robin mocked a little unkindly will you display your finery before the pigs and peasants of devon skye was about to scold her little son quite severely but willow was quite able to take care of herself the queen has asked me to be one of her maids of honor my noble brat of a brother she said smugly she hasnt she has willow said a small satisfied smile spreading over her face after all robin if i am to find a noble husband i must go to court you have no great name robin protested to win a great man you must have a great name i have something better willow replied what he looked at her disbelievingly i have gold willow said wisely i am a great heiress and i possess a great deal of gold i will have no lack of suitors for my hand once i am at court shocked skye could only gape at her daughter but she quickly recovered and said i hope that you will marry for love as well as a great name willow love willow replied with the certainty that only a tenyearold could possess can be extremely hurtful i should prefer a far more businesslike arrangement you had best seek love my daughter skye remarked once you marry your great wealth will belong to your husband and if he does not love you but another you will find you have made a very bad bargain you could easily end up with nothing i shall retain my own wealth as you have mother was the cool reply that is not usually the way of things in marriage willow had the men i married not loved me they would have never agreed to my demands best you seek love among the great names my daughter then she laughed lightly at ten you are much too young to be discussing marriage at least wait until i return to wed willow she must not come to court this year mother robin said worriedly the queens maids of honor are always fair game for the lechers she is much too young look who speaks of youth willow scoffed her majestys youngest page he who is three years younger than i am he whom they call the cherub he who has been at court two years and knows more than you do mistress ignorance came back the quick reply enough skye ordered her quarreling offspring robin is right murrough put in and willow sent her older brother a furious look i know he is skye said willow is not going to court until she is at least thirteen mother willow protested if iallow her to go at all skye continued with a warning look at her daughter willow fell silent you will leave tonight murrough asked yes skye answered him osman says that time is most important and to linger here would only hurt poor nicolas more he is as you may imagine quite heartbroken you do not believe you will be returning to beaumont de jaspre do you mother no murrough i do not i keep saying if osman is correct if he is right but i know that he would not have sent for me if he were not certain a sad little smile flitted across her beautiful face for just a brief moment i shall of course be staying in his house in algiers she looked at willow it was your fathers house once my dearest and i never thought to see it again dear god the memories it will bring back to me i do not know if i can bear it algiers never did i expect to be in algiers again what of the wicked turk who sought to make you his wife willow asked a bit fearfully she had heard the story of skyes flight many times and until now it had been a romantic fairy tale in which her beautiful mother was the enchanted princess this however was reality and willow was afraid for skye he is in istanbul my love skye reassured her he cannot hurt me poor jamil was never my match skye stood up from the bench come my loves it is already late and i must make other arrangements before i leave she looked at her two burke children who lay sleeping in the grass with their nurse be sure the bairns are well cared for she implored her elder children and they nodded their promise when she arrived at her apartments daisy was already packing for her youll not be needing all these fancy clothes youve got said the everpractical daisy ive the thought you wont want to stick out like a red silk banner mlady and so i am packing only those outlandish garments you brought with you from algiers years back i hope that theres enough for most of them are in england at lynmouth if my stay is lengthy skye said i can have more made but i expect that these few will do is it really true that lord burke is alive mlady daisys eyes were wide so osmans messenger has said can you really trust this osman daisy was suspicious skye laughed yes he is trustworthy daisy what does a tiring woman wear in algiers mlady i have to know what to take for myself you cannot come daisy skye said not come daisy was scandalized who will take care of you i should like to know if i dont come with you it is far too dangerous daisy if i have to leave algiers in a hurry the way i did last time i should prefer not to have to worry about anyone else it is easier if i am alone besides i want you to remain and wait for dame cecily she will be returning with bran kelly any day now when they arrive you are to marry captain kelly as you have planned père henri tells me that you have completed your instruction and are ready to become a good catholic wife i will not have you and bran wait any longer on my account if i am not back by midsummer you and dame cecily will have to return with the children to england you will go overland and i am going to ask bran kelly to accompany you the burke children are to go on to ireland robin will go back to court murrough to oxford and willow home to devon you are also to go with the smalls i shall station bran kelly with you in bideford until i return gods bones ive much to do before we sail while daisy finished the packing skye went to the small writing table in her anteroom and quickly began to write several letters one went to lord burghley explaining the entire situation she could not she wrote remain in beaumont de jaspre under such dubious circumstances she was leaving immediately for algiers to seek the truth of the matter their original bargain she reminded cecil involved her marriage to fabron de beaumont she had kept her part of the bargain and she expected elizabeth tudor to keep her part if lord burke was indeed alive they would be returning to england before they went on to ireland and they would come to court to tell the queen their adventures if on the other hand lord burke was indeed dead and this but a flight of fancy she would return to beaumont de jaspre to wed with nicolas st adrian and thus continue to serve the crown in view of her continued loyalty skye wrote would lord burghley kindly arrange for her second son murrough oflaherty to enter merton college at oxford in the michaelmas term it was his desire to study at this time and not return as a page with the countess of lincolns household she closed assuring the crown of her constant devotion and tendering her good wishes for the queens upcoming birthday in september skyes second letter was sent to her uncle the old bishop of connaught in it she outlined all that had happened her own plans and her plans for the children she begged him to watch over all of her offspring in the event she did not return she then outlined what she wanted done with the omalley shipping interests and how she wanted her childrens wealth disbursed and the children raised she knew how much this letter was going to pain seamus omalley but she also knew the dangers involved in her trip to algiers and she wanted those she loved cared for in the event she should not return this letter she closed by asking for her uncles prayers a letter was also sent to her stepmother anne and one to her brother michael the guardian of her eldest son ewan a final missive went to the countess of lincoln thanking her for her care of murrough these last few years and explaining his desire to go on to oxford rather than remain with the court at last she was finished and as she arose from the writing table she felt as if a chapter in her life were closing she wondered what the next chapter would bring her back in her bedchamber skye saw through the windows that the day was almost gone upon the bed were laid out her seagoing clothes the doublelegged skirt the silk shirt the hose and the undergarments by the bed stood her high boots daisy however was nowhere in sight with a sad sigh skye began to pull off her own garments not even bothering to pick them up as they fell to the floor she stood only in her chemise when the door between her room and nicolass opened and he entered her chamber she wanted to weep at the pain she saw etched in his handsome face why was it that she was always giving such agony to those good men who did naught but love her why should her love bring such pain instinctively she held out her arms to him wanting to comfort him somehow oh nicolas she murmured against his reddish hair dear dear nicolas i am so sorry my love i am so sorry her arms closed about him and she held him as she would hold a hurt child he shuddered against her i dont want you to go he said softly you know i have no choice if niall burke is alive how can i stay with you nicolas we could not marry our children would have no right to inherit beaumont de jaspre do you love niall burke his voice was ragged i have loved him since i was fifteen she cried do you love me you are asking me to choose nicolas and the choice is not mine to make do you love me he repeated i had begun to nicolas yes i had begun to love you this is madness he said to her how can your husband be alive after all this time you go but to chase a dream doucette perhaps she allowed but if osman has said he is alive then he is alive i do not know how but if i did not go to find out the answer to this puzzle nicolas i should always wonder if niall is indeed alive i cannot in good conscience marry you for i should be committing a mortal sin you will come back to me he said firmly and he pulled back from her looking with love into her face now it was skye who wanted to cry seek elsewhere for a bride my love she said softly it is unlikely that i will ever come back nicolas i cannot ask you to wait for me every day that you remain unmarried you endanger your duchy and you are the last hope of beaumont de jaspre how your people love you since you came from your home in poitou there has never been such gladness here find some sweet young girl to make your wife the mother of the next generation no he was suddenly angry frustrated that what he wanted so desperately was being torn from him i will only marry you skye if i cannot have you then i want no woman i shall go back to my holding in poitou and to hell with beaumont de jaspre skye became equally angry and her hand flashed out to make very hard contact with his cheek stunned he fell back for she had put all her strength into the blow coward she said furiously is this how you keep your promise to fabron de beaumont who so generously bestowed his realm and his wealth upon you you gave your halfbrother a deathbed promise that you would rule this duchy and keep it safe from the french you gave him your promise to care for edmond and garnier do you think a french overlord will care for them they will be thrown into the streets to fend for themselves if they are not driven from beaumont entirely her hand had left a bright red mark on his cheek and rubbing that mark nicolas tried to explain i have never loved anyone before you he said in a low voice how can i live without you you think only of yourself nicolas she said scornfully i told you once that wealth and power are a great responsibility to be wielded carefully i have been wielding both since i was scarcely more than a girl there have been times when it has been hard for me not to yield to my own desires but i have not and you cannot if you love me you will let me go nicolas because you cannot keep me now all the devils in hell could not keep me here by your side now that i know my niall is alive for a moment he closed his eyes and she knew that he was fighting back the tears as she struggled to contain her own sorrow she must be strong and she must instill in him some of that same strength but she had not lied to him when she had said that she was beginning to love him how could she not when he adored her so and was so good both to her and the children she had felt so safe with him i will never forget you doucette he said nor i you nicolas she answered him you are sure for the briefest moment his green eyes held a flicker of hope i must go was her simple reply and for an equally brief moment skye wondered if she was totally mad then regaining control of herself she said brightly you will have a wonderful time nicolas you are now a most eligible man of considerable wealth think of all the lovely girls available to you but choose quickly lest the french be tempted to a rash art he sighed deeply and she almost screamed with the sadness in the sound what kind of a girl should i choose doucette after you mon amour how will i be content with anyone i think perhaps a very young girl nicolas but choose one with spirit intelligence and a sense of humor do not look for one who reminds you of me trust edmonds judgment for he is a very wise man and he loves you dearly he will want you to be happy nicolas reached out for her but skye quickly sidestepped him will you not kiss me goodbye doucette he said softly she glanced down at the gossamer of her chemise and then shook her head not as i am now nicolas a small smile lit her eyes you are very wicked mon brave even to suggest it go now and let me dress for i shall be late if i do not hurry with another deep sigh he turned and left her to dress she knew how difficult the interview had been when her hands began to shake as she buttoned her shirt and fastened her skirt he was such a good man and she knew how deeply he was hurting for in a strange way she was hurting too its almost time mlady when had daisy entered the room where are the children waiting in the anteroom to say goodbye mlady daisys honest eyes grew misty are you sure i cant go with you mlady skye hugged her tiring woman affectionately i am going to miss you terribly daisy she said but it is much too dangerous for you to come with me besides i shall need you to watch over the children until dame cecily arrives and you begin your return journey home ill worry about you the whole time youre away mlady you concentrate on marrying bran and making him a happy man skye counseled and then before daisy could become overly emotional skye gave her a quick kiss on the cheek and hurried from the bedchamber into the anteroom where her children awaited her i wish i could go with you murrough said enthusiastically algiers sounds so exciting mother algiers is dangerous skye replied i should like to fight the infidel robin said bravely the infidel would be enchanted by your blond hair and your fight eyes my darling he would geld you like a horse and if you survived the operation you would become the plaything of some wealthy man with a taste for boys not exactly the fate for an earl of lynmouth stay home my sons so that i do not have to fret over you i far prefer to go home to england willow said primly skye smiled faintly amused i am relieved willow that you do not choose to seek adventure as your brothers do you will be safer back in your own homes my darlings murrough i have written to both lord burghley and the countess of lincoln regarding merton college i am sure they will comply with my wishes thank you mother his blue eyes shone with delight and gratitude and skye felt great satisfaction to have pleased this second son of hers by such a small act murrough stepped forward and bent to kiss her take care mother he said this time i feel no sadness because i know that you but go to return to us she hugged him hard dearest murrough she murmured i do love you my son murrough stepped back rosy with a mixture of pleasure caused by her words and embarrassment at her public affection god speed he said as he pulled away from her murrough is right robin said i dont feel sad either mother find niall and then both of you come safely home to us robin put his arms about her neck and kissed her lovingly are you sure i cant go to court while youre away mama willow wheedled skye laughed no court she said you will return to devon with dame cecily and continue with your lessons you are not accomplished enough to go to court yet willow sighed dramatically i dont know why you persist in treating me like a child mama she complained i would think the answer to that is obvious every time you look in the mirror murrough teased she spends all day before the mirror robin said wickedly boys willow huffed and then she hugged her mother in farewell dont be long mama i miss you so when youre away from me i will return as fast as i can my darling skye promised her daughter then kissed her the little burke children slept with their nurse in the next room and skye slipped into their nursery to say a silent goodbye they were far too young to understand her going or what it was she sought but someday she vowed they would comprehend and she hoped bless her for what she was about to do her own eyes misted as she looked at them in sleep deirdre so much like her and padraic who grew more like his father with each passing day she wanted him to know his father it was for them as well as herself that she went off on what many would call a mad mission they are both beautiful and peaceful as they sleep so sweetly in their innocence edmond said quietly in the dimness of the room i would to god that you had been able to give the de beaumonts such fine children the fates have willed it otherwise dear friend she answered him he took her hand and with a final glance at her babies they walked from the room you will let us know your position before another bride is chosen if you can come back to us he trailed off i will get a message to you immediately she said rather than argue with him you wont be back will you he said i keep examining the messengers words over and over again edmond she replied but they are true osman would not lie satisfy my curiosity chérie just who is this osman in whom you have so much faith can you really trust him was he that good a friend skye paused a moment wondering whether to tell him the truth why not she thought perhaps it would help convince him she drew a deep breath edmond she said niall burke and i were to be married after the death and mourning of my first husband before our nuptials could be celebrated however it was necessary for me to make a trip to algiers my trading company wished to do business with the dey and when he heard that the head of the omalleys was a woman he insisted upon seeing me he had given us a pendant to put atop our mast that would guarantee us safe conduct through barbary waters but the pendant was lost in a storm and we found ourselves in a fight with pirates we won but i was taken from my flagship and niall was shot as he attempted to rescue me i believed him dead and lost my memory as a consequence khalid el bey known as the great whoremaster of algiers bought me as a slave he intended to train me for his finest brothel the house of felicity instead he fell in love with me and married me when khalid was murdered in a plot concocted by his evil friend capitan jamil of the casbah fortress i was forced to flee algiers jamil coveted me and had decided to have both me and my lord khalids wealth i was pregnant with willow at the time but it didnt slow me down edmond with the help of osman who had been my husbands dearest friend i converted khalids holdings into gold and fled algiers with my personal servants via robbies ship several days before my period of mourning was to end now do you understand why i trust osman if he calls me then i must go edmond if he says that niall is alive then he is and i will find him i must do this not only for myself but for deirdre and padraic as well they have a right to their father and i have a right to my husband my god edmond ejaculated you are amazing you arc more than amazing you are formidable he stopped and moving in front of her took her two hands in his tiny ones what you have told me chérie will remain between us i see now why you trust this osman and he sighed sadly i understand now that you will not be back find nicolas someone quickly edmond do not let him mourn me until i become so idealized in his memory that no other woman could possibly satisfy him find him someone who will understand and be patient with his pain someone who will see what a fine man he is and be willing to wait for him to heal my instinct tells me it should be a young girl not necessarily an heiress or even an eldest daughter but a girl who would be pleased for such a plum as the duc de beaumont de jaspre to fall into her lap find him someone who will love him edmond yes was the resigned reply i will find someone who will love him and eventually with gods good luck he will love her too poor girl i do not envy her her lot for it will be a difficult one nicolas will not be easy to placate they continued down into the lovely courtyard of the castle skye had decided to leave at twilight when villeroses streets would be fairly empty no announcement had been made of skyes departure and would not be until she was long gone it would be most difficult to explain to the people but explain they would have to eventually skye suggested to edmond as they entered the courtyard that they wait as long as possible in order to protect beaumont de jaspre from the french and give him an opportunity to look over the possible candidates for nicolass hand with my children here it is unlikely that anyone will notice me gone for a good week the servants of course must be told to keep silent daisy was waiting with her mistresss cloak and she wrapped it around skye pulling the hood up to disguise her lady from prying eyes with trembling fingers daisy fastened the heavy gold frog fasteners and then stepped back her eyes were teary and skye gave her a quick hug chiding none of that daisy ill be back before you know it god sspeed mlady came the quavering reply and then daisy turned and fled back into the castle skye watched her go and then said poor daisy we have never been parted since she came into my service she even went into the tower with me watch over her edmond and see that she and the children get safely off at the proper time he nodded and then skye saw robbie and nicolas coming toward her the young duc had dressed himself in his finest clothes and the dark green velvet was very flattering to his rich chestnut hair and his forest green eyes about his neck was the heavy gold chain of beaumont its lion pendant lying on his chest how handsome you are she said sincerely as he stopped in front of her how beautiful you are he answered looking down into her face and skyes heart contracted painfully his hand gently pushed back her hood so he might have a last look at her and then he bent his head and briefly and tenderly brushed her halfparted lips with his own for a long heartstopping moment their eyes met and then he gently drew the hood back up over her head aw revoir mon coeur he said and then turned and walked from the courtyard into the castle never once looking back at her go with him skye begged edmond aye edmond said and catching her hand up kissed it fervently god speed chérie he murmured and then he too was gone after his young uncle a silent servant helped skye to mount her white palfrey while another aided robbie then together they trotted their horses from the flowered courtyard and across the drawbridge as they went skye said in a sad resigned voice i have been here just over one year robbie how macabre where will i be a year from now do you think will niall and i be safely home in ireland lord bless me lass who knows he wasnt going to let her feel sorry for herself and he could see the terrible emotional toll her farewell from nicolas had taken one thing i can promise you skye wherever you are a year from now it will not have been a dull year for youve never been a dull woman by god i do enjoy trying to keep up with you my lass twill be one of two things for me either ill never grow old following after you skye omalley or ill be old before my time he chuckled i can just see cecilys face when she gets here and finds us gone shes always said i make a fuss over nothing when it comes to your constant adventures skye lass now shell see he chortled wickedly now shell see part north africa chapter algiers shimmered in the midday heat the sun glared off the deepblue waters of the harbor and reflected back onto the white white buildings of the city skyes ship seagull was anchored a short distance out in the harbor robbie had no intention of allowing skye ashore until he had made absolutely certain that jamil was not in the city youre an old woman she teased him as he climbed down the side of the ship into the small dinghy that would take him into the docks yere damned right i am he shot back not one bit intimidated do you want to spend the rest of your days in slavery to jamil lass id sooner be dead then ill just be on my way to find osman robbie said with a chuckle besides yere getting too old to be running around in diaphanous trousers and beaded tops too old she looked outraged im not yet yes you are he laughed not that you look it skye lass be patient and ill not be long she watched the small boat skitter across the waves and into the docks robbie would have no hard time finding osman for the famous astrologer had bought khalid el beys house from skye when she had fled algiers over ten years ago robbie who had been khalids business partner was most familiar with the house she could see it from here slowly she raised her eyes up to gaze on the house in which she had been so supremely happy it stood elegant and proud atop a high hill overlooking the entire city she wondered if the gardens were still as lovely she would soon know when bran kelly had returned to devon for dame cecily robbie had allowed the young captain to take his own ship the mermaid for he wanted the cargo he had traded for in ottoman turkey brought back to england consequently it was seagull that had brought them to algiers and old sean macguire who had captained her now the senior captain of the omalley fleet kept his mistress company as she paced anxiously up and down the deck of her ship if hes to be found yell find him macguire said comfortingly she nodded but said nothing after a while macguire taking out his old pipe and putting it between his teeth spoke again niall burkes a tough one and thats for sure i remember the cosh we gave him on the head to make him more manageable the morning after yer first marriage if he had a headache he never said so if hes here skye said slowly i keep wondering how he got from a deserted beach on irelands west coast to north africa yer friend osman is sure to know mlady skye yes osman she stared off again across the harbor to the white building upon the hill time time moved so slowly here in algiers she recalled she hoped that robbie would remember to hurry the voyage from beaumont de jaspre had not been a long one only a few days but with each hour that had passed the last year had faded and her memories of niall burke become stronger the how and why began to haunt her and she grew more and more anxious to reach algiers to speak with osman was it a hoax perpetrated by jamil or had osman really sent for her youd better change out of those clothes if you intend to be ready when he gets back macguire said after what seemed a very long while theres time she said not even stopping her pacing nay mlady theres no time look he pointed out toward the docks theres sir roberts boat now making its return trip holy mother skye ran to her cabin and once inside began with suddenly clumsy fingers to get out of her sea garb if she really wanted to cause a stir all she needed to do was appear in the streets of algiers unveiled and dressed as a sea captain opening the tiny trunk of clothes that daisy had so carefully packed for her she drew out an exquisite caftan of palemauve silk the neckline was modestly high and embroidered in tiny purple glass beads that extended down from the round of the neck in a band two inches wide and six inches long such a band also ringed each of the wide sleeves sliding the caftan on she then undid her long hair from the confining single braid in which she always dressed it when at sea she brushed the dark mass free and fixed a band of mauve silk with the identical purple beading on her head to contain the hair and keep it from falling into her eyes makeup skye scrambled through the trunk and there it was a small ebony box containing little ivory pots of color each set carefully in its own niche and several sable brushes the inside lid of the box was mirrored so she might see what she was doing no matter where she was skillfully she outlined her eyes with blue kohl and darkened her lashes neither her lips nor her cheeks needed the addition of color for skye had always been a healthy woman finished she gazed into the mirror and her eyes widened in surprise for staring back at her was a woman she thought she had left behind some ten years ago when she had escaped algiers and the unwelcome advances of capitan jamil it was uncanny and not a little frightening for the woman in the mirror did not look a day older than the nineteenyearold girl she had been true her eyes were wiser and her cheekbones etched more finely now but other than that there was no change skye shivered and then shaking off the feeling of déjà vu she closed the makeup case with a snap stood replaced the ebony box in her trunk and walked from the cabin robbies small boat had already reached the seagull and he had just climbed to the deck when she exited her cabin stunned he stood looking at her for a long minute then he shook his head in wonder how is it possible he said the rest of his thought unspoken i had the same reaction she answered him and then youve seen osman aye and his palanquin is awaiting you weve permission to bring seagull into the docks shes been given a preferred berth it seems that old osmans reputation has grown mightily in these past years half of algiers doesnt make a move without him and the rumor is that the dey doesnt get off his couch without osmans advice what did he tell you she begged anxiously nothing skye lass its you he wants to see it took a very short time to bring seagull into her berth on the busy waterfront of algiers here there were ships and goods from every part of the known world the air was fragrant and the noise was incredible with many voices speaking many languages in an unending cacophony by the time skyes vessel had been made secure she had added a black silk yashmak to her costume this long black cloak covered her from her head to toe and her identity was further hidden by the mauve silk veil that was attached to the hood of the yashmak and drawn across her face she was the proper muslim woman garbed for the street and for travel they were docked next to an ottoman galley and as the light wind blew skyes veil aside to reveal her face for a moment there were whistles and ribald shouts from the men chained to the top tier of oars some of the words she understood others she did not but their meaning was clear her eyes clouded with distress and she said with strong aversion in her voice gods nightshirt i hate those damned galleys to chain men to an oar rather than use the wind and the water by your own skill is disgusting find out if there are any english or irishmen among them macguire they can sail home with us what about scots or welsh buy them she said tersely i dont care from what part of our islands they come ill not stand by and see them die in some sea battle unable to escape because of their chains sean macguire nodded how long will you be gone he demanded i dont know but robbie will be back to the ship as soon as we know anything give the men liberty in shifts and tell them i want no trouble nor do i want it known that i am in algiers theres not a man aboard whod betray you mlady sean macguire said feelingly nonetheless you will remind them once again macguire skye said sternly aye omalley he said quietly and she knew he had gotten her point she nodded at him her expression unreadable beneath her veil then she turned to debark at the foot of the gangway a palanquin awaited and as skye stepped into it she felt as if she were stepping back in time into a life that had ceased to exist for her with the death of her second husband the fascinating khalid el bey the vehicle was carved and gilded and hung with silk curtains of azure blue while inside it was upholstered in silken stripes of red and green and purple and gold with pillows done in cloth of gold she settled herself comfortably and the draperies were drawn to hide the palanquins occupant robbie was given a finely caparisoned horse to ride the palanquin was carried by eight slaves all coalblack and dressed in baggy scarlet pantaloons their feet the soles of which were toughened by their work were bare as were their chests they were not however oiled as was fashionable for blacks nor did they wear jeweled collars about their necks to advertise their owners wealth as the procession left the docks and began to wend its way through the city skye was assailed by a thousand memories triggered by the sights she could just see through the gauzy draperies by the sounds of the busy city by the smells of the vendors stalls for a moment she lay back and of all her experiences of this city the one she suddenly remembered was her return to algiers from her wedding trip with khalid they had both been dressed all in white and their sleek black hunting panthers leashed but still impressive had loped elegantly along by their sides he had ridden his great white stallion she a dainty golden mare with a long whiteblond mane and tail that he had given her she sighed how simple her life as his wife had been but still she could not regret all the times since osman would have said that it was her fate osman she visualized in her mind this man who had turned her world so topsyturvy with a simple message he had not as she remembered been a tall man rather he had been of medium height and build really quite unimpressive a person until you looked into his eyes for osmans eyes saw what other people did not see they saw beyond the everyday and into the heart and soul they saw beyond today and even she had always suspected past tomorrow they were strange and yet wonderful goldenbrown eyes that had always shone kindly upon her looking at osmans bald head and bland moonround face few realized the power bebind those eyes khalid had seen it and had always been the astrologers friend when she and khalid had been married he had given each of the six men he had invited as wedding guests a slave girl she remembered how she and khalid had chosen each of the six girls to suit the personality of a guest she had chosen for osman a lovely darkblond girl of french extraction named alima the astrologer had shortly afterward made alima his wife and she knew that they now had several children it pleased her to think that osman and alima were happy and they must be for he had taken no other wives and had no harem of concubines suddenly the palanquin was set down the draperies drawn aside and a hand extended to aid her in getting out and as the hand drew her up she looked into the smiling face of osman the astrologer welcome my daughter he said and looking into his eyes at that moment she knew that her quest was not a vain one osman she began but he put his hand up to stop her i know you are anxious skye my daughter but first i would settle you a few more minutes will not matter now that you are here he turned to robbie who had dismounted his horse welcome again captain it does my heart good to see you here then osman led them both into his house the house in which she had lived with khalid skye let her eyes dart about the square entry hall and it all looked the same as the night she had left it for a brief second she expected to see khalid come through from the gardens his white robes swirling about his tall figure she walked through the entry into the beautiful gardens beyond and stood looking feeling the tears fill her blue eyes dimming her vision momentarily before spilling down her cheeks the orange and lemon trees were larger fuller the pines taller the tshaped pool with its spraying fountains and border of roses was as lovely as ever on one of the white marble benches near the house a woman sat surrounded by several children seeing skye she rose and came toward her my lady skye is it truly you alima the wife of osman stood before her seeing skyes tears alima put her arms about her mentor it has been as happy a house for osman and me as it was for you and the lord khalid it is a good place and i gladly welcome you back to it the sudden sadness passed and skye drew away from alima saying when i learned i must return to algiers i knew the first moments would be hard it is over now alima and i thank you for your gracious welcome let me show you to the rooms i have set aside for you they overlook this garden for i know how much you loved it with quiet assurance alima led skye back into the house and upstairs to two lovely airy rooms in a different wing of the house than she had lived in with khalid already two silent slave girls were unpacking her small trunk a third hurried forward bearing a silver basin filled with rosewater for the lady to wash away the dust of her travel when skye had done so alima led her back downstairs into osmans library where the astrologer and robbie waited for her having brought skye to her husband alima quietly departed skye knew that osman expected her to remain calm and so she seated herself upon the floor cushions and patiently accepted a tiny cup of boiling turkish coffee before looking expectantly toward him the astrologer looked back calmly his powerful gaze instilling in her a strange sense of peace then he began to speak in the city of fez i have two nephews the sons of my late sister lilitu who was the wife of a vastly wealthy merchant the elder of my nephews is named kedar and he inherited his fathers wealth and business when my brotherinlaw omar died kedar was a man grown when my sister bore her younger son his name is hamal and my sister died giving birth to the boy omar had recently been killed when a spirited new horse had thrown him and broken his neck he had not however changed his will he was awaiting the birth of his second child to do that for had hamal been a female arrangements would have been different than if he were a male kedar has always taken care of his little brother but he has never offered to share their fathers wealth my elder nephew is a man of strong will and strong opinions three years ago when hamal was fifteen princess turkhan a daughter of sultan selim ii saw my young nephew the royal princess is a most unusual woman she came to fez twelve years ago as wife to its wealthiest man when he died she inherited everything and because she is an ottoman princess she is a law unto herself her father is obviously delighted to have her off his hands and no one has control of her in fez she is respected for her good words and her generosity to the poor she is powerful by virtue of her family and by virtue of her wealth as you know my daughter this is an unusual thing in the muslim world but no one dares criticize her way of living though it is most shocking princess turkhan keeps a harem of men for her pleasure as a man might keep a harem of women fez is a holy city and the mullahs are appalled but they can do nothing for she is too important and too powerful when she saw hamal she wanted him and after finding out who he was she went to my elder nephew kedar was within his rights of course but to this day i am shocked at what he did he sold his younger brother to the princessfor a very fancy price i might add when he told me i was very angry but as he explained it to me the boy is handsome and charming though not particularly bright kedar did not believe that hamal could ever take his place in the family business and so he did what he believed was the best thing for him as much as i disapproved of the act i am forced to admit it was the wisest course for the boy princess turkhan has adored him cossetted him and spoiled him from the beginning then several months ago the princess acquired a new male slave a man who has resisted her from the moment she laid eyes upon him and can only be kept under control by means of opiates the princess is fascinated and intrigued by this man who will not have her she will do anything to possess his body and soul but to date she has been unsuccessful oh she can force him but it is not the same as his surrender to her love would be my nephew hamal says that she is making herself quite sick over the new slave i was interested by his story and so out of curiosity i asked him to find out more about the man at first the slave was loath to speak frankly with hamal who is turkhans favorite pet gradually however my nephews honest sweetness won him over and he confided that his name is niall burke skye gasped and grew white but osman held up a warning hand he was not yet finished with his tale with a shudder skye fought to regain control of her turbulent emotions while the words he is alive sang in her veins niall burke told hamal that he was a nobleman in his own country a place called ireland he told hamal that he had a beautiful wife called skye and children when i heard that my daughter i knew it was you it could only be you for who else would have so outrageous a name as skye i was going to send to ireland for word of you but then haroun learned that you were but across the sea in beaumont de jaspre that you had married its duc why did you marry another man when your husband was still alive my husband was believed dead skye replied grateful now to be allowed to speak he was thought murdered by a mad religious woman and his body thrown into the sea i was sent by queen elizabeth to beaumont as part of a political alliance osman nodded his bald head niall burke could only remember bits and pieces of what happened to him my daughter he remembered being attacked but then his next memory is of being aboard a ship where he was nursed back to health before being put in the galleys to row he manned an oar aboard a barbary pirate ship for several months before he was seen here in algiers by an enterprising slave merchant from fez who thought the princess might be interested in him he bought niall burke from the pirate ship and transported him back to fez the slave merchants judgment was correct for when princess turkhan saw your husband she bought him and at the price the slaver wanted niall burke has not proved the most tractable man however princess turkhan has tried everything to win him over but he has resisted her now hamal tells me his mistress has decided that she must have a child by niall burke she has not ever allowed herself to become pregnant before her unwilling slave is resisting her more than ever though and the more he resists the more determined turkhan becomes did he not tell the princess who he was skye asked did he not tell her that he could pay a fabulous ransom to her my daughter you know that this is the east when khalid bought you do you think that he would have accepted ransom for you even had you known who you were the princess bought your husband because she wanted him not because she sought to make money she is already incredibly wealthy even if you communicated with her telling her the truth and offering to pay well for niall burkes return she would refuse you and she is legally within her rights no you will have to go to fez yourself but my nephew hamal will aid you hamal wants your husband out of the princesss life before this obsession she has drives her mad but we have a complication as i have said my daughter lord burke has persisted in defying princess turkhan he simply will not yield which only intrigues her further now however hamal tells me he has begun to grow despondent because of my deep fondness for you skye i have sent for you for if lord burke is to escape princess turkhan he needs his hope renewed there is only one way that that can be achieved i believe all of skyes old instincts had begun to resurface as she listened to osman speak she was no longer skye omalley but rather she was skye mum el khalid one of the most famous women in algiers if hamal loves his princess so osman why does he not simply rid himself of niall there is poison a sharp knife in a dark garden a pillow held over the face there are any number of ways to rid oneself of a rival in the harem why has he not used one of them she was frankly suspicious hamal is a gentle boy osman replied and he knows that nialls death could destroy the princess especially if it were proved he had a part in it turkhan would then lose both the men for whom she truly cares besides my nephew honestly loves his princess if however niall were to escape the princess would be enraged and her love would turn to hate for niall a woman scorned is a terrible thing my daughter skye nodded she certainly knew the truth of that statement can you arrange for me to get to fez she said i will of course take my own people with me i do not need many but if a rescue plan is to succeed i must have my own people about me there is only one way you can get to fez my daughter osman said fez is a holy city and foreigners women in particular are allowed nowhere near the city only you alone can travel there skye looked puzzled you say foreigners especially women are not allowed into fez how then in heavens name can i enter it you can only enter fez if you are a member of a household whose master is a native of the city you will enter fez with my other nephew kedar he will do this for you how generous a man he must be you misunderstand me skye my daughter kedar is a religious man he will not break the taboo of fez his native city even for a family tie then how she demanded you must be very brave skye my daughter what i am about to propose to you will not be to your liking but it is the only way i swear to you osmans wise face was troubled and skye felt an awful foreboding how she repeated osman sighed in two days time my nephew kedar arrives here in algiers he comes once a year to visit me and to seek my advice on organizing his life for the following year i must tell you skye that he is a very sensual man a connoisseur of beautiful women a devotee of all that is voluptuous and erotic when he arrives i would present him with a beautiful slave girl who i shall tell him is called muna which as you know means desire in our tongue robbie who had been quietly listening now burst out how in the name of the seven djinns is that supposed to help skye get into fez he looked first at osman and then to skye skye was very pale and for a moment robbie wasnt sure she was even breathing finally she said do you know what it is you are asking me to do surely osman there is a better way you cannot ask this of me i have told you the facts of the situation my daughter if there is another way then enlighten me i beg you i am appalled at what i must ask of you but it is the only way the knowledge that you are near can rally lord burkes flagging spirits and give him new courage it is almost too late now what is it you two are talking about robbie asked i cant understand a word of it fez is a holy city closed to foreigners robbie osman says the only way i can get into it to rescue niall is to pretend i am a slave girl he would present me to his nephew as such what skye almost laughed at the honest outrage on robbies very weathered english face i must pretend to be a slave she repeated i heard you the first time robbie roared its out of the question do you know what youll have to do if youre this kedars slave woman yere not the type of woman a man buys to scrub his floors or cook his food are ye daft skye lass besides so far all we have is someones word that this man is niall burke what if he isnt what if this is someone who knows that niall is dead and is using his name to what end robbie why would someone use nialls name to gain the opportunity of ransom lass it is rare a captive can be ransomed captain small osman said quietly perhaps he didnt know that robbie said grasping for any reasonable explanation i considered the possibility that you might need proof of some sort osman said and so i asked hamal to obtain it for me the man who calls himself niall burke stands several inches over six feet in height he has dark hair and silver eyes he is lean and hard of body according to hamal obviously a man who has kept himself in shape and he bears the scars of a severe wound in the region of his belly it is niall skye cried and her face was suffused with pure joy he is alive robbie he is alive all right robbie muttered defeated i would have said it could be anyone until osman mentioned the wound its niall all right but hell not be overly happy to find out that youve put yourself into the harem of some lusty arab in order to reach fez and what happens when you do reach fez how in hell are you going to rescue a man penned in a harem when youre penned in a harem too answer me that skye lass skye looked to osman does your plan go beyond getting me to fez my old friend the key is hamal osman said although he is the property of princess turkhan she is so fond of him that he is allowed his freedom as if he were not a slave as her favorite he is not without influence he comes and he goes as he pleases he has the run of her homeand the run of his brothers home this will allow him to help you my daughter what is the quickest escape route osman skye asked the river that runs through fez empties into the atlantic ocean my daughter but it is not a navigable river you will have to return the way you came back here to algiers hamal believes he knows a way but it all depends on you making yourself indispensable to kedar how do you and hamal communicate osman skye was curious for she knew it was close to six hundred miles between fez and algiers the pigeons my daughter was the smiling reply the birds are our messengers and we use a code that i taught hamal when he was a little boy it amused him then and it now amuses us that we may communicate without anyone knowing what we speak of skye i was in fez several months ago to teach briefly at the university hamal and i discussed much of this then but i could not seek you until i had returned to algiers had jamil not departed for istanbul i should have come to you myself in beaumont de jaspre did you arrange for jamils departure skye looked closely at her old friend osman chuckled and his dark eyes twinkled with glee it is strange he said admitting nothing that word of a cure for jamils impotence should come at this time skye grew serious once more did you ever see niall osman she asked no he answered sorry to disappoint her the princess does not know me and it would not have been possible under the circumstances for me to enter her house hamal visited me at his brothers home or at my quarters at the university youre determined to do this robbie said and skye could hear the worried concern in his voice tis total madness yknow niall is alive skye answered him my husband the father of my babies is alive oh robbie you of all people know what we have both been through over the years i love him i have always loved him and he has always loved me when i learned that darragh had killed him i was sick with anger and outrage that after all we had endured he should be taken from me again i must free him from this bondage he is enmeshed in just as he would free me i will not be beaten robbie not in this robert small bowed his head in a private agony he had no argument to offer and as difficult as the situation was he knew that she was right if they attempted to go through official channels it could take forever more than likely the spoiled and determined princess turkhan would hide niall and they would be forced to accept defeat in the end the moroccan sultan was not about to offend the wealthy and powerful daughter of his overlord the ottoman sultan in istanbul they would not jeopardize themselves over an infidel nobleman ill support you in any way that i can skye lass robbie said quietly and he hugged her where she sat tears running down his face skyes own beautiful blue eyes were wet with tears as she said huskily thank you robbie thank you it is decided then osman asked yes came the reply when your nephew arrives you will present him with a new slave girl named muna i wonder though osman am i not too old for this i am not the girl i was ten years ago you look it osman said does she not yet look a girl captain small your face is youthful and i suspect that despite all your children your body remains youthful also skye chuckled i have had four children since we last met my old friend osman although i am in better condition than many women my age i am still not a girl of nineteen fear not my daughter we will tell kedar that you have had children it will only serve to increase your value in his eyes a fasi is very much a family man what in the name of all that is holy is a fasi robbie demanded a fasi is a nativeborn citizen of fez my friend i am a fasi although i have lived here in algiers for more years than i ever lived in fez how old do you intend to tell your nephew i am skye asked how old are you now my daughter i am twentynine she answered yere thirty robbie contradicted her bluntly robbie her face wore an outraged look a woman is always permitted to lie about her age not when shes dealing with osman and taking her life in her hands he snapped if i know my old friend hell be wanting to plot your own chart now that you remember your past life osmans face broadened in a smile you are correct captain when skye was with us those ten years ago and without her memory i could only plot her chart to a certain degree and by using my other powers it was never totally accurate now i can do a complete horoscope and i shall if she will but give me her birthdate i was born december th skye said and i shall not be thirty officially until december robbie she smiled smugly at him osman frowned i believed you born under the sign of the ram he said and then his face relaxed of course now i see it you were conceived beneath the sign of the ram you are born under the sign of the archer both are fire signs my daughter you are powerfully protected do you know the hour of your birth i was born at nine minutes after nine oclock in the evening skye answered i will work on your chart tonight osman said i must have all the knowledge i need before i send you forth to fez he turned to robbie i will ask you to say your goodbyes now captain if skye is to prepare for her role she will need time and there is little time before kedar arrives how will i know when to expert skye and niall robbie asked hamal will get a message to you remember that it will be almost two months before skye reaches fez then she will need time to make contact with hamal which will not be easy it will be between three and four months possibly more before they can art and return to algiers you will need to cultivate great patience my friend go back to beaumont de jaspre skye said tell nicolas that i will not be returning then see that the children are sent home immediately there is no need to torture my poor nicolas any further and if all evidence of my residence in villerose is wiped away then perhaps he will seriously consider choosing a new bride the children will go overland to the channel coast for i have promised them a visit to paris bran is to take them from france to england i had intended that my burke children be sent directly to ireland but i think that it is better that bran meet with you when he has gotten them all safely to england in case anything should happen to one of you better i have the both of you as guardians the burke infants can stay with your sister at wren court robbie they will be no trouble as they have their own staff and i will wager that dame cecily adores having them let me stay at least until you leave for fez robbie begged no she answered if i am to convince kedar that i am nothing more than a captive slave girl i must be totally cut off from my real life it is going to be hard enough to be subservient robbie her bluegreen eyes were laughing at him now and he guffawed loudly aye he said i suppose it is best i leave you alone to prepare for your role it wouldnt do to have you telling this great merchant of fez how to run his business i dont think that that is quite what hes going to expect of you then he grew serious youll take care of yourself lass youll not take chances i am taking a chance when i travel to fez as kedars slave she said softly there is no escaping the danger robbie but i am mindful of it i am not afraid she leaned over and kissed him no she wasnt afraid he could see it her belief that she could find niall and escape back to safety shone like a silvery aura about her robert small prayed silently that that faith be justified she had so very much to lose he rose slowly to his feet and drew her up all right then he said ill be on my way walk me to the door and well say our farewells there he turned osman my friend will you come also no captain i will bid you farewell here we will meet again i know and believe me that all will go well my friend may allah watch over you robbie nodded ive never known you to be wrong osman he said i know that i can trust you together skye and robbie walked to the main entry of osmans house there was really nothing left for them to discuss so she simply hugged him and said take care my dearest friend it is you who should take care he muttered and then he held her close against him in a fatherly embrace i wish to heaven you wouldnt do this thing he said but i know that you must gods bones lass come home safely then he quickly released her and was gone out the door she was certain she had seen tears in his kindly eyes with a sigh skye turned from the door and walked back to osmans study where the astrologer awaited her wordlessly he handed her a tiny porcelain cup of newly made coffee slowly she sipped the burning bitter liquid until at last she felt calm again sensing her recovery osman spoke there is no one among my slaves who knows who you are we will therefore begin the charade now you are muna a slave girl whom i have bought to give my nephew the lord kedar of fez you are a captive but for beautiful captives like yourself there is no ransom you were widowed a year ago and were being sent by your family to marry a wealthy florentine merchant you have two babies but your husbandtobe did not want you to bring your children to this new marriage just as it entered the mediterranean your ship was captured by pirates who brought you to algiers where you were placed in a private bagnos i bought you you arrived today at the same time my old friend captain small arrived i have returned your trunk by the way to your ship i will see that you are clothed properly to entice my nephew he thought a moment have i forgotten anything muna no my lord osman she answered meekly he smiled very good my daughter now for the next two days you must immerse yourself in the character of muna does my history of your past satisfy you it is fine my lord but i would ask one question you have still not told me how old i am to be aiii osman clapped his plump hand to his smooth forehead then he nodded at her with a small smile you can easily pass for twenty my daughter your skin is so marvelously translucent it makes you seem much younger than your years one other thing you must have a potion that will prevent your conceiving a child by my nephew such a thing is unthinkable i have my own potion osman but you have sent it back to the ship along with my trunk she laughed it works i have never conceived a child while i took it she answered him i will have it fetched immediately then he said there is no use switching potions if yours works return to your quarters now my daughter and i will send the seamstress to you she will outfit you completely within the next two days when kedar arrives you will be ready for him skye rose from the silken cushions bowed low to osman and left him the next two days proved busy ones as the seamstress and her assistants sewed a lavish wardrobe for the beautiful slave girl muna in osmans household only his wife alima knew the truth about muna the two women spent most of their waking hours together in the garden surrounded by alima and osmans children altogether there were seven of them five mischievous little boys ranging in age from nine to two and two little girls one seven and one an infant who had been born around the same time as skyes son padraic alima refreshed skyes memory on eastern customs any other gaps of knowledge would be put down to her status as a slave what is kedar like she asked alima i know little about him came the reply osman is a very jealous man and does not allow even his male relatives into the womens part of the house i have seen him of course kedar is an attractive man muna he stands a few inches taller than you and is very powerfully built although he is not fat he is as fair of skin as you are for when he lifted his arms once and his robe fell open i could see where the sun had not reached the whiteness of his skin the first time i met him i was quite curious and boldly lifted my eyes to his for just a second he has eyes as powerful as his uncle my husband they are hazel in color and his hair is a dark brown his features are pleasant the eyes well spaced his face narrow his nose very aquiline his lips quite sensuous as they are a bit wide skye nodded satisfied at least the man wasnt ugly is he intelligent she said wondering if alima would know what she really meant with her shrewd peasant soul however alima understood yes he is intelligent and very clever i also suspect he has some of his uncles powers although osman has said nothing about it he is very possessive of what is his muna so if he decides you please himand you must please him if you are to get to fezhe will want to own you totally beware of him for i believe he is a dangerous man again skye nodded and then she asked a final question what if he decides to sell me alima do not fear muna osman intends to ask him to resell you to him for my sake if kedar should grow tired of you kedar cannot refuse that request alimas words reassured skye considerably particularly when late that very afternoon kedar arrived the two women watched from behind the latticed windows of an upper story as osman greeted his nephew in the gardens of the house kedar moved with a sleek grace that reminded skye of the panthers she and khalid el bey had kept for hunting kedar held his head high and his step was at once light and very assured the two men embraced and then osman knowing that the two women watched pushed back the hood of his nephews white traveling robes let me look at you son of my beloved dead sister he said and skye could see that the face in profile was arrogant hawklike and arab it is good to see you again my uncle kedar replied and skye was struck by the very deep timbre of the mans voice it was a voice used to giving orders used to being obeyed have you seen enough muna alima whispered yes let us go then for osman will shortly send for you and i would be certain your garb is perfection below them osman led kedar into the cool interior of the house to a small salon the two men settled themselves comfortably upon low cushioned red velvet divans and immediately a slave appeared with a silver basin filled with warmed rosewater and a soft linen towel kedar washed the dust of his travels from his face and his hands and dried them carefully his were the hands of an aristocrat long and slender with welltapered nails when he had finished and the slave had hurried off with the used towel and the basin two other slaves entered the room one carried a plate of gazelle horns curved pastries made of flour ground nuts and honey the other was the coffeemaker who immediately set to work grinding beans and then brewing a dark and rich coffee when he and his nephew had been served osman waved them from the room and sat chatting companionably with his nephew at last the courtesies all observed and the traveler made comfortable osman said you know that each year when you visit me i have a gift for you this year it is something very very special knowing how proud you are of your harem my nephew i have purchased an exquisite slave girl for you it was not at all what i had in mind kedar but i saw the woman by chance and knew that she was perfect for your collection of rare and unusual beauties i know that your good manners will force you to take my gift but should allah forfend the girl displease you then allow me to buy her from you when you return to fez if you like her so well my uncle then why give her to me you misunderstand kedar i do not want her for myself but she and my wife have become good companions in the short time she has been in my house i would do it for alima i do not think however that you will want to sell her to me she is one of the most beautiful women i have ever seen is she european yes english a blonde kedar sounded interested no a brunette but what a brunette her skin is like a gardenia petal would you like to see her why not and i thank you for such a delightful surprise uncle as you know i do not travel with any of my women and i have been a month in coming from fez osman clapped his hands and instantly a slave appeared fetch the slave girl muna he ordered and the slave nodding bowed himself out of the room muna kedar smiled you have named her muna she is that beautiful i do not believe that a man can see her and not desire her was osmans reply kedar smiled faintly amused he had never known his uncle to be a particular connoisseur of female flesh he could only assume that his aunt by marriage was a pretty woman for he had never been allowed to see her unveiled but he had seen her children and they were certainly attractive kedar believed that alima was a frenchwoman but he had never asked for it would have been considered too personal a question and extremely bad manners he sipped at the dregs of his coffee and nodded at his uncle the woman must be memorable if she has impressed you he remarked drily osman smiled an almost mischievous smile and said you have but a moment to wait nephew the sound of his words had barely died when the door to the salon opened and skye entered her head was lowered and she had barely entered the room when she was on her knees her head touching the floor in perfect obeisance in that position kedar could see little more of her than a rather charmingly rounded section of hip osman noted the easy frustration of his nephew and said rise muna she stood quickly silently her head still lowered raise your head up osman commanded and skye slowly almost shyly lifted her head kedar caught his breath audibly as he gazed into a pair of magnificent bluegreen eyes and osman smiled softly to himself his nephew was hooked as easily as any foolish fish offered a delectable bit of bait truly his weakness was women this is your new master muna the lord kedar my lord she whispered and he was forced to lean closer to hear her in doing so smelled the delicious fragrance of her rose perfume which he instinctively knew suited her admirably she was indeed a perfect rose remove your garments osman commanded sharply and skye turned startled eyes to him a slow blush suffusing her cheeks no uncle it will not be necessary kedar said his hand reached out to touch skyes arm his fingers caressing the satiny round of her shoulder the woman is shy and i would not force her later she will display to me her obviously bounteous charms is that not right my beautiful muna his fingers continued their caressing yes my lord skye said low and then she trembled unable to control the tiny ripple of fear that rolled over her this was no fat and lazy merchant prince who could be easily led through his own lust by a beautiful woman his hazel eyes were too much like osmans eyes knowing and seeking why had she ever agreed to this insane plan in the first place it wasnt going to work she was going to be caught like a bird in a net if she went to fez as this mans slave then in her minds eye skye saw niall her beloved niall and taking a deep breath she calmed this flight of nerves that had possessed her send her to my quarters uncle kedar said then added in a lower more intimate voice to skye i will not keep you waiting long my beautiful muna very soon you will be cured of your charming shyness toward me go muna came osmans voice she turned and with a low bow toward each of them left the room she is exquisite kedar said quietly as the door closed behind skye i suspect my uncle that words alone will not adequately express my gratitude tell me though how it is she speaks our language if she is a recent captive the owner of the bagnos in which i saw her brought her from the ship that had taken her captive because she was so filthy and disreputablelooking she escaped being chosen by the deys chief eunuch the fool could not see her beauty beneath all the dirt and rebellion but the bagnos owner could she remained full of fight however and it took several months to calm her and train her in the simple rudiments of being a slave i am afraid she is not greatly accomplished but she was so beautiful i could not resist the bagnos owner told me that she appears to be intelligent he was only forced to discipline her twice and he did go lightly with her she has not been marked in any way at all and she was quick to learn that unruly behavior would only bring on severe chastisement it was while she was in the bagnos that she learned our language i have discovered that she speaks several other european languages she was obviously educated by her family though why they bothered i do not know she is only a woman true kedar replied but an intelligent woman i have found is usually far more intriguing than the women who can only spread their legs and prattle on about nothing her active mind will make her far more interesting uncle i bought her for her beautiful face and body osman said sounding somewhat aggrieved those i intend enjoying as soon as possible my uncle but first i would bathe the dust of that long road between fez and algiers from my body will you eat with me afterward my nephew not tonight uncle tonight i intend to put to use the magnificent gift you have given me i have been a full month without a woman the whores in the roadside caravanserais are not even fit for camel drivers and besides they are all diseased i never touch them you know your way to the baths nephew alima has seen that the slaves are ready and awaiting your arrival enjoy i shall speak with you tomorrow as always uncle your hospitality is munificent kedar said and then withdrew hurrying down the hallway from the salon to the spacious baths that osman had added on to the house soon after he had bought it as his uncle had said the slave girls who attended the bath were awaiting him and they quickly had his clothes off they were pretty black girls and he knew them all merrily they joked back and forth with him as they soaped and scrubbed him down their hands were everywhere on his body caressing and rubbing with practiced and seemingly detached skill after all it was their job to wash the master and his family and anyone else they might be asked to wash still knowing he was a passionate man and that his forced abstinence had rendered him as randy as a stallion in a herd of mares in season they teased him gently as his male organ responded to their tender touches the lord kedar had been known in the past to ease his hunger upon the humble bath girls and they were hopeful today however they were doomed to disappointment he grinned regretfully at them and shook his head ah said the eldest of them a fullfigured girl named nigera the lord kedar would save his strength for the new slave girl muna it is she who will feel the sting of his mighty lance this night the others giggled behind their hands at kedars enthusiastic nod what do you know of the woman he asked curious she arrived a little time ago nigera said she and the lady alima became friends muna is a sweet woman and a courteous one from what i have observed here in the bath she comes with the mistress and her children she is very good with the children observed another of the bath attendants they say she had children in her old life sometimes i would catch her sighing over the lady alimas youngest daughter and there would be a sad look upon her face the bath attendants had finished washing kedar and now they rinsed him off next they shaved several days growth of beard from his face for he preferred to be smoothshaven and then they scrubbed his wavy dark brown head clean finally they led him to the hot tub where he would soak for a while relaxing his travelweary muscles he pondered their chatter muna was not a virgin praise allah for he was in no mood to deflower a maiden tonight he wanted a woman who knew what passion was all about she might be reluctant but coaxed firmly and gently she would quickly succumb his smile was rather predatory as he contemplated this delightful gift of his uncles choosing she had been dressed exquisitely but simply when she had come to the salon her full pantaloons had been a gossamersheer blushcolored silk shot through with silver threads the ankle bands and the sewnin hip band had been embroidered in pink glass beads and silver thread the pantaloons had ridden just over the bottom of her hip bones and she had been nude above save a sleeveless open bolero of blushcolored silk edged in silver trim which just barely clung to the soft swelling of her lovely bosom he had very much wanted to see that bosom but her charmingly modest blush when his uncle had ordered her to disrobe had frankly disarmed him she had worn no jewelry of course having had no previous master to deck her with delicate baubles she would he suspected cost him a fortune in jewelry and he smiled to himself anticipating her delight and pleasure at the wonderful gifts he would give her her dark hair had been caught back with a pearlembroidered pink ribbon and he was looking forward to loosening it and running his fingers through it an ache in his groin told him that he was becoming aroused again cursing softly he forced his mind away from his beautiful new slave and silently began to recite verses from the koran it was an excellent discipline no man should allow a woman to insinuate herself so deeply into his soul that he couldnt do without her several minutes later nigera tapped him saying it is time my lord and he rose from the pleasantly heated marble tub he walked across the tiled floor of the bath and entered another bright and airy room where he seated himself silently two slave girls pared the nails on both his hands and his feet then they trimmed his now dry hair he walked to a massage bench and lay down to give himself up to the ministrations of nigeras supple fingers for the next hour when she had finished massaging him thoroughly she helped him sit up and handed him a cup of boiling sweet turkish coffee gingerly he sipped the hot drink from the tiny eggshell cup he felt refreshed and revived and quite ready for a long evening of pleasurable sport with muna standing kedar held out his arms as a comfortable loose caftan was wrapped about him he slid his feet into the soft slippers that were offered him and with a smile of thanks to the bath attendants he left the room and walked toward his own apartments as he reached them the eunuch guarding the door flung it open at precisely the right moment and kedar walked through into a large room it was a simple but elegant room with walls that were covered in black red and white tiles in a geometric pattern a quarter of the way up and whitewashed above to the left of the door were three casement windows the wall above the windows decorated in a fanshaped pattern of designed plaster the floor was cool red tile but over a good portion of it was a fine thick red blue and gold rug on either side of the room were low armless divans of red brocade with plump white pillows embroidered in gold thread in the center was a footed brass brazier and from the dark beamed ceiling hung a brass lamp with amber glass near the divans there were polished low round ebony tables upon which rested smaller decorated brass lamps with their amusingly curved mouths spouting wicks opposite the salon door was a large double couch curtained in red velvet and cloth of gold over the couch was a brocaded cloth of gold awning with wide red velvet stripes and the walls around the high couch were hung in embroidered red velvet the couch was covered in a matching brocaded velvet fabric with a busy geometric design upon it enormous feather and down cushions in multicolored silks and velvets were piled upon it in the corners and along the back a long red velvet cushion with silk tassels at each corner had been set upon the tiled step to the couch she should have been awaiting him there but she was not instead she was sleeping upon the couch within the curtained alcove tonight kedar thought he would be indulgent but he would teach her her proper place in his life he was not an ottoman to be ruled by his women for a long moment he stood looking down at her and then kneeling upon the cushions he studied her at close range his uncle had been right she was indeed a beauty he didnt need to touch her hair to know that it was soft and her skin allah had there ever been such skin reaching out he lifted back one side of her ridiculous little bolero exposing her breast for a long time he studied the flawless contours of that breast without even touching it it had the most pleasing roundness to it and yet the impudent way in which the small pink nipple tilted upward enchanted him here again there was no hurry to touch for he could see with his sharp knowledgeable eye that the skin was soft smooth and firm it was then that skye opened her eyes and caught him in her cool bluegreen gaze for a brief moment before lowering her long black lashes in feigned modesty a tiny smile played at the corners of kedars mouth for a small second she had made him feel like a little boy discovered just as he was about to be naughty the fact that she could do that on such short acquaintance delighted him you cannot blame me for contemplating your beauty my fair muna he said in his deep voice you have already ravished me with your face and form it is not for me to say my lord kedar she answered i am but your humble slave you recite the words perfectly was his answer yet i do not think for one moment that you believe them i was not raised to be a slave my lord kedar nonetheless you are an exquisite one and i give thanks to the beneficent allah who has given you to me my fair muna he was pleased to see that captivity had not broken her spirit skye smiled inwardly to herself at his words she had decided not to be overly meek with this man it would quickly bore him his next words caused her to start disrobe for me now muna i would see your beauty entirely rather than through the taunting diaphanous silk of your charming costume skye could not help the shiver that raced through her this was the moment she had dreaded for now there was no going back once again she wondered if she were mad in what she was attempting to do despite what osman said there were no guarantees that she would find niall what if he was dead by the time she arrived in fez nothing was more fierce than a woman rejected by a man she desires and princess turkhan was a powerful woman a slave had no rights he could be killed by his master simply because it amused his master to kill him for a single second she contemplated racing from the room and begging osman to stop this charade immediately before it was too late then came the horrifying realization it was already too late silently she slipped from the soft couch turning to keep her back to him with a motion so fluidly graceful that he wasnt even certain how she had accomplished it skye slipped the little bolero off and dropped it to the floor seated upon the couch now kedar admired the long line of her back there was not a mark on her skin it was as pristine as an unwritten parchment skye carefully loosened her pantaloons and they puddled around her ankles before she stepped out of them as she turned he had just a quick glimpse of her breasts and belly before she was kneeling before him her dark head pressing into the wool carpet as my lord commands she murmured at him ravish the word entwined itself about his brain he wanted to ravish her to leap from his position upon the couch press her back into the rug and ravish her instead he took several deep breaths to calm himself he did not believe in hurrying a woman along passions pathway but he had to admit to himself that he had never before desired a woman as greatly as he did this one perhaps it was his abstinence on his journey but kedar knew it was not he was not a man to neglect his harem often sending for two or three women in a single night but neither was he one of those weak fools who could not survive a day without shoving himself into a warm and willing woman no this one was different and he was fascinated stand up he commanded her and watched with pleasure as she gracefully rose from her obeisance she in turn watched him from beneath lowered lashes as he stood and came down from the couch on the dais toward her he stopped and then studied her in a slow and leisurely fashion giving an occasional command which she obeyed silently turn muna and she could feel his eyes moving from her shoulders down to her buttocks down her legs to her feet turn again his hazel eyes moved from her feet up her legs to her beautifully plump pearlsmooth venus mont he could see that her cleft was fine long and deep an indication according to harem tradition of a passionate woman his eyes continued their inspection to her pleasingly rounded belly to her lean flat and long torso to her breasts raise your arms he commanded her put them behind your head this had the effect of raising her breasts upward so he might have a complete view of them skye had never felt more debased in her entire life as his glance fastened hungrily upon her round breasts she wondered almost bitterly if he would ask her to open her mouth so he might inspect and count her teeth she had never until now understood the awful and terrifying degradation of being a slave oh she had legally been the slave of khalid el bey until he freed her before their marriage but khalid had never treated her like one he had from the beginning been a man in love kedar was not a man in love he was a man in lust a man delighted with his new possession as his careful inspection of her person indicated kedar however was not entirely insensitive to his slave he saw the flush of embarrassment that stained her cheeks as she was silently forced to comply with his wishes he saw the quickening of her heartbeat in the visible fluttering in her chest a pounding pulse at the base of her slender throat he noted that she was trembling ever so slightly although she forced herself to stand grimly still yes her spirit was still there and he was glad he would not break it only tame it but then a truly wild thing was never really completely tame the pleasure at that particular thought washed over him like a soothing balm reaching out he touched her for the first time he touched her as he would touch one of his thoroughbred arab mares to gentle it his hand smoothed down from her shoulder to her buttock in a slow and easy motion dont be afraid my fair muna he said in his deep velvet voice but skye couldnt restrain the fierce shudder that rolled over her for the purr in his voice was that of a wellfed and powerful cat one arm came strongly about her waist and drawing her close to him he touched her lips gently with his then to her surprise he loosened her and holding her lightly cupped a breast firmly in his other hand she raised her arm instinctively to fend him off but he chided her in a mockstern voice no muna it is my right you belong to me now i will be patient fair one but you are no virgin to fear me he pulled the silk band from her head and her long black hair swirled loose i do not know you she whispered to her surprise skye found that she really was afraid of this man and what was worse she did not know why it is no matter he answered you are mine you are beautiful and i desire you his thumb rubbed insistently against her hardened nipple and skye had to bite her lower lip to keep from screaming aloud you have marvelous breasts he continued see how perfectly you fit my hand just to overflowing muna i believe that you have the most perfect breasts i have ever seen he smiled down at her the bath girls say you are no maid and they believe that you had children were you married my fair one yes my lord i am a widow i have two children little boys who will now be orphaned and left to the mercy of my late husbands family her head drooped sadly did you nurse your sons muna only a little while my lord then came the wet nurse for women of my class are expected to attend court with their husbands i could not do that and nurse my babies so she was of that high a rank kedar was impressed and very pleased he quickly decided to have children by this exquisite slave woman but already his passion for her was so great that he did not want her to waste her time nursing children when she might nurse him his mother had nursed him until he was six and he had developed a taste for breast milk that even today was not lost the idea of being within munas fair body while he drank of her milk excited him tremendously and without meaning to he crushed her tender breast in his hand skye cried out with pain and kedar instantly remorseful caressed her tenderly forgive me my fair muna i was quite lost in contemplation of your charms he soothed her breasts clucking worriedly wondering aloud if he had bruised her soft skin my god skye thought i am naught to him except a possession he feels nothing for me but the need to own me to sate his bodily lusts kedar returned to a closer exploration of her body moving his hand downward to rub across her fluttering belly his touch was like fire against her skin stroking seductively sending tiny darts of fear through her she wondered if osman had known the kind of man his nephew really was when he had turned her over to kedar this was not a man to be satisfied with the mere taking of her body he wanted far more than that he wanted her he wanted her soul and her mind as well as her body could she resist him already her treacherous body was beginning to stir under his touch his fingers moved downward again this time coming to rest atop her cleft gently he moved his hand back and forth touching her ever so lightly but insistently she couldnt let him do this to her she thought frantically but her legs seemed made of jelly and then he demanded tell me about the first time muna was he gentle did you like it my lord she stuttered her shyness at such an intimate question and then she almost wept to remember niall to remember how it had been with him that first time tell me he murmured against her ear his tongue licking it softly his fingers slipping deeper into her cleft to coax the honey down from the hidden recesses of her fevered body hhe was gentle she whispered and yes i liked it was he a good lover my fair muna my lord i was a maid when i went to my husband i have known but one man in my lifetime how can i know the answer to such a question her answer was certainly in keeping with the story osman had concocted about her and she must remember that story else niall be lost kedar smiled satisfied it was what he had wanted to hear as it meant that she had not played the wanton as so many of these married european women did he was glad that her husband had been a kind and gentle lover her only lover it meant that she was not afraid of the act and that was good no matter if her husband had been a proficient lover he kedar was a better one by dawn the beautiful muna would have a strong comparison and he knew that her late lord would suffer by that comparison she was almost fainting against his strong arm and so he lifted her up into his embrace walking to the velvetdraped couch in the alcove he carefully placed her upon it her bluegreen eyes heavy she watched as he swiftly removed his white robe through thick lashes she peeped at him quickly assessing his assets as he had assessed hers he stood probably no more than three inches taller than she did but he was powerfully built with a barrel chest narrow waist and sturdy legs his body was pale and totally devoid of hair his manhood however was totally out of proportion for a man under six feet in its already halfroused state it was quite long and she noted with trepidation that it was thick the circumcised ruby knob of it reminded her of the head of a battering ram he caught her look of fear and coming down beside her upon the couch he murmured again in her ear do not fear muna your sweet sheath will accept all of me and weep for more i promise you then he was kissing her his lips raining a hundred little kisses on her face scorching at her temples her closed eyelids her sculpted cheekbones her stubborn chin and the corners of her trembling mouth his two hands pinioned her lightly against the soft velvetcovered mattress he was strong and she knew he could break her should he decide that was what he wanted he was kissing her now upon her lips testing the texture of her mouth the kisses demanded an answer that she knew she would have to give and the only way she could do that was to abandon herself to total passion niall her tortured heart cried out forgive me my darling but i must do this if i am to save you and bring you back to me to our babes then she kissed kedar hesitantly at first the kiss deepening with the increasing pressure of his lips muna muna he spoke low against her mouth and she shivered with the dark intensity of his voice gasping she opened her lips to him as he ran his tongue quickly across them her breath came in little pants as his tongue licked the side of her face then along her slender neck finding the palpitating hollow of her throat he buried his lips there growling and she was again reminded of a sleek and savage cat he terrified her he was like an animal possessive and totally sure of himself and his prowess he reeked of his own masculinity then suddenly his tongue was entering her mouth seeking delicately probing gently skye moaned trying to escape the building fury of his fierce passion but he held her firmly now refusing to accept any rejection on her part it would be an endless battle between them and the knowledge of that was an incredible aphrodisiac to kedar her tongue struggled to escape his but he caught at it and sucked upon that delectable morsel his fingers now sought her cleft once more and pushing two of them gently within her he moved his hand slowly back and forth until with a soft cry she had her first tiny orgasm with a smile he drew his fingers out and pressing one of them against her lips said taste my fair muna taste your own sweet honey she obeyed him sucking the salty sweetness from his finger and then watching almost mesmerized as he sucked the second finger once she had finished he then drew the two wet fingers between the valley of her breasts in a slow and seductive motion his hazel eyes holding her bluegreen ones with a forceful magnetism tell me what pleases you he demanded skye pretended confusion my lord she said low i have been taught by the women in the bagnos that it is not what pleases me that matters but rather what pleases you i have been told that it is the womans duty to please her master to ride him to pleasure is it not so for some perhaps he answered smiling but i believe a man is better served when he may conquer the woman beneath him there will be times when it pleases me to let you ride me fair muna but that is my decision i will lead you in our lovemaking you need not fear my beautiful one that you will displease me his fingers then trailed back up between her breasts tonight he said i want to learn about you i want to know what gives you pleasure what excites you how your luscious body responds to sensuousness tell me what your last lord did when you made love together we we made love she replied helplessly deciding that lack of sophistication in this area was what would make him happiest he touched your body yes your breasts he rode you yyes what else kedar demanded what else is there my lord skyes bluegreen eyes were guileless but inside she was trembling again as she wondered where this line of questioning was leading was he a gentle man or was he one of those who gained pleasure through pain a slow satisfied smile lit kedars features there is much much more my fair slave than the little that you have described to me i can open a whole new world to you and i intend to in a corner of the divan rested a woven gold basket square in shape and without a handle within the basket were several bottles carved from differentcolored marbles and alabaster without even looking closely kedar reached out and drew forth a narrownecked vessel with a silver and cork stopper he opened it and a strong fragrance vaguely familiar wafted out musk rose he said seeing her curiosity it is a special lotion for the body turn onto your back and let me rub some on you skye rolled over and lay waiting tensely for his touch when it came it was gentle yet strong he had warmed the lotion in his hands so as not to shock her delicate skin and his sure long strokes swept up her back from her buttocks kneading the muscles with a firm motion his touch was strangely soothing and she began to relax what an odd man he was she thought seeing his open lust she had thought he would be quick to mount her and sate that desire instead here he was massaging her with tender hands and making no effort to hurry her perhaps it would not be so dreadful to pretend to be his slave for the next few weeks until she found niall and with young hamal formulated a plan for their escape from fez do you like this muna he whispered into her ear then he very gently nipped at the back of her neck pushing her long hair aside first yes my lord it is most pleasurable she answered him he laughed softly and resumed his massage working now on each of her long legs the firm thighs and calves her slim feet i once had a slave girl from cathay he said who taught me that there is a particularly sensitive spot on the foot his fingers dug into her foot and suddenly skye felt a stab of desire race through her she gasped surprised and kedar laughed again yes my fair muna right there he moved on to her other leg and worked it as he had the first turn over now beautiful one he ordered and she obeyed what happened to your slave girl from cathay skye asked she died under my lash he said casually why skye was horrified i caught her betraying me with one of my guard he was forced to watch while i beat her just before she lost consciousness for good my head eunuch decapitated him i then finished her punishment no one takes what is mine you killed her skye whispered dear god he tipped the alabaster flask of palepink lotion into his hands and then put aside the bottle to massage her breasts and her belly it should not concern you beautiful muna i am normally a kind master but you must understand that i could not allow one of my women to escape severe punishment for such unconscionable behavior could you not have sold her off to whom who would want a faithless woman besides i would not be shamed by the public knowledge that one to whom i had given the title of favorite had openly cuckolded me he sat astride her hips his supple hands smoothing the silky pink liquid over her soft belly across her quivering breasts his eyes hazel green with small flickering gold pinpoints of light bore into her bluegreen ones tell me what you are feeling now muna skye forced her thoughts from the unfortunate woman whom kedar had so easily killed she realized that without warning her body was beginning to feel restless and strangely hot beneath his hands she shifted nervously i feel strange she whispered hot a little she hesitated to give him any advantage a little frightened she finished unable to think of another word i dont want you to feel frightened he said soothingly i want you only to feel pleasure he leaned forward across her and reached into the gold basket drawing out a small crystal flask from the container he uncorked it open your mouth he commanded and when she did he poured a small amount of clear apricotflavored liquid into it skye swallowed and then asked softly what is it my lord nothing to be afraid of muna it will calm your fears and relax your body he soothed and then he dipped a long finger into the flask rubbed the liquid upon one of her nipples and lowering his dark head began to suck upon it the shudder that ripped through her almost tore her apart her whole body was suddenly aflame burning with the need to love and be loved she moaned arcing her body against his mouth her hands sliding across his shoulders and back her nails raking ever so lightly his growl of laughter sent another shudder through her and then he was releasing her nipple and drizzling some of the clear apricot fluid over her navel bending his dark head again he lapped at the liquid with his tongue following the wet line down her belly and pearly venus mont into her cleft which had opened like a pretty pink shell to his questing tongue like cupids arrow his tongue darted quickly here and there touching and teasing everything sensitive until skye was writhing with the need to be possessed by him there was another growl of laughter as he lifted his head once more now he said you must do the same to me my beautiful slave lying back he poured some of the liquid onto his own belly come muna and pleasure your master was his command skye rolled slowly over onto her belly her entire body felt relaxed yet incredibly desperate for total sexual fulfillment she shifted herself until her head was over his belly and then she began to lick at him moving lower and lower until she encountered his faststiffening manhood she stopped for a brief moment but his hand pushed her head forward and he said in a tense voice take me in your mouth fair muna she obeyed part of her mind amazed at her easy compliance with his order while the other part of her brain craved with a strange intensity to do the act in the few seconds of clarity she had before tumbling into the sensual abyss skye realized that both the lotion he had massaged her with and the apricotflavored liquid were aphrodisiacs then without another thought for what she was doing her only desire being for pleasure she began to run her tongue around the ruby head of his great lance to lick the length of him with slow and sweet strokes to take him into the warm cavity of her mouth to nurse upon until she tasted the first salty drops of his juices then he wrapped his hand into her dark hair and pulling her away groaned enough houri you will surely unman me if i allow you to continue skye whimpered a protest but kedar was now ready to couple with her and he had no intention of being denied what he instinctively knew was going to be an incredible pleasure later he would teach her refinements to increase his pleasure later he would allow her to suck him dry but not this time rolling her onto her back he mounted her and with one swift motion drove himself into her wet and waiting sheath her small cry of pleasurepain only increased his desire she was very tight and he knew that his first assault had hurt her a little but that would shortly change with an easy and rhythmic motion he moved himself back and forth watching through blazing halfclosed eyes her every reaction and listening with a finetuned ear to her little mewing cries skilled he knew just how far he might drive her dear god how full he fills me she thought at first kedars great weapon had hurt her and for a small moment she had wanted to escape him then the initial tension flowed from her and she opened herself to him she could feel him touching the very walls of her passage and her womb and the fire he was fanning within her helpless body was threatening to consume her yesss yesss she urged him on in a husky voice oh dont stop my lord please dont stop she was going to die but she didnt care she wanted to die then she felt herself shattering into a million tiny starbursts and all was black kedar leaned back to watch the woman beneath him she had reached her first peak and had fainted away he however was not yet ready to succumb to passion he could wait he was an unusual man and he knew it having the ability to sustain an erection for long periods of time he took several deep long breaths to clear his head while he enjoyed the soft throbbing of her body which enveloped his huge manhood his hands reached out to fondle her round breasts taking delight in the silkiness of her skin cruelly he pinched her pink nipples and she moaned but remained lost to him he knew the pleasure that pain could occasionally bring and wondered if she did but he doubted it she was delightfully innocent for a nonvirgin and it was a marvelous combination that stimulated him pleasure through pain was another little refinement that they would eventually explore together he thought with a small smile then her breathing told him that she was once again with him open your beautiful eyes muna skye still under the influence of the drugs he had given her docilely obeyed his voice her will was sapped but her awareness was intensely acute you are still within me my lord she whispered we have only begun fair one he said as he began again the very voluptuous movement that had driven her mad before her eyes began to slide shut but his sharp voice snapped them open no he said this time you will look into my eyes while i take you muna i cant she whispered you will came the unrelenting answer then he moved swiftly until she knew that she didnt want him to stop but when her eyes began to close he ceased the pleasure no she whimpered dont stop my lord open your eyes muna i wont stop if you keep your lovely seablue eyes open it was a terrible effort but skye managed to force her eyes to open disclosing to him the desire within herself and kedar gave a soft triumphant laugh please she begged as the sexual stimulants that he had fed her rendered her helpless to him and to her own lust slowly he initiated the erotic motion she craved and obedient to him her eyes never left his she felt as if she were drowning in his fiery gaze knew that her soul was not even her own at this minute suddenly he ceased his movements and she pleaded once more no dont stop my lord kedar dont in a moment in a moment he soothed her but first if i am to continue to give you this pleasure you must do something for me fair muna anything she sobbed rashly and he smiled cruelly down at her you will repeat after me he said softly i am my lord kedars slave i am my lord kedars slave she said quickly looking eagerly to him for approval he smiled again i exist solely for his pleasure no she whimpered the part of her that was still herself rebelling at his words say it say i exist solely for his pleasure or i shall withdraw from you he thrust softly into her several times to entice her and she moaned say it i i exist solely for his pleasure very good my beautiful slave he approved in his deep purring voice and then he gave her the pleasure she so desperately desired from him his lean hips driving deeply against her until her senses exploded once more into fiery fragments of helpless passion then to his surprise his own love juices burst forth to flood the raging fire within her womb with a gasp that was half from irritation he rolled from her amazed to have lost his perfect control she had beaten him without even realizing it and he chuckled to himself it had been a long time since he had enjoyed a woman so very much by allah his uncle had chosen well with a sigh of total contentment kedar used the last of his strength to roll her inert body from the divan onto the cushion below where a proper houri belonged he then stretched himself out thoroughly satisfied and quickly fell asleep chapter muna through the haziness of her barely conscious mind skye heard the sharp command in kedars voice she struggled to wake herself but she was totally exhausted by the previous nights mental and physical battle with him still she tried for she dare not anger him or displease him before she had gotten to fez shaking herself she managed to keep her eyes open until they finally began to focus only then did she raise her head to him my lord he lay on the couch above her stretched out on his side his hazel eyes glittered though but half open and again skye was reminded of a sleek feline i desire you he said pleasure me he rolled onto his back and his manhood thrust straight into the cool earlymorning air gods bones thought skye irritably is the man never sated she knew however what was expected of her hiding her annoyance she pulled herself onto the couch by his feet her slender hands caressed his length as she moved herself up his hard body his legs fell apart as her touch ignited his already inflamed passions and skye rose to swing herself over him her fingers teasing at his nipples with a groan his hands caught at her hips and forced her down upon him his quick penetration was almost painful and she couldnt help the soft cry that escaped her lips he didnt notice or if he did it didnt matter to him what mattered was his own gratification ride me beautiful muna he murmured huskily at her his eyes closed with enjoyment i know that you european women ride upon horses my exquisite one have you ever ridden astride yes my lord she answered him ahhh he almost purred then think of me as your horse my beautiful slave i am the stallion that you ride to the hunt ride me well lest i throw you skye knew that her performance with him now would be the difference between going and staying she had to please him and please him so greatly that she became like a drug to him a drug that he could not do without in my own land my lord i was a horsewoman without peer she whispered back at him provocatively and then she gripped him tightly between her silken thighs balancing herself with her hands on either side of his head she leaned forward brushing her breasts across his lips while her hips began the love rhythm she moved on him slowly teasingly with tantalizing motion and kedar suddenly felt he was not totally in control of the situation lean back muna he commanded her tensely as my lord wills she answered softly but there was a mocking tone to her voice that he did not fail to catch the little bitch he thought angrily she dares to seek to best me in this battle reaching up he grasped her two beautiful breasts in his hands and gently crushed her soft flesh over and over again until she began to squirm and moan losing the rhythm skye was furious at him she sought to intrigue him to rouse his passions and he took it as an affront to his masculinity she attempted to regain control of the situation by running her hands over his chest but kedar growled at her no muna domination is my right not yours he lifted her off him and set her next to him i but sought to please you my lord she protested i forgive you he said smoothly and skye seethed as he continued you are as my uncle has said unschooled i will enjoy teaching you how to be an obedient slave my fair muna lay on your belly now i would relieve my lust for you he pushed her gently over and mounting her effected a quick rear entry before she could even protest he filled her sheath totally moving smoothly to sate his own desires he held her down with his hands on her hips but other than that did not touch her when his desire had burst within her he withdrew leaving her aching with her lack of satisfaction skye shuddered with actual physical pain her own desire was high and she did not know how to satisfy it she knew that kedar had done this to her deliberately to teach her that he was the master and she the slave with a frustrated sob she began to weep softly unable to contain herself her cries brought her mercy for his ego was instantly gratified by her tears he rolled her onto her back again and gently caressed her belly but rather than ease her sexual tension the seductive motion only increased it with a wicked smile he leaned across her to the gold basket and drew forth an object here he said this will ease your suffering my beautiful muna and he pressed it into her hands skye opened her eyes and then gasped with shock what is it she demanded of him thrusting the thing from her kedar picked it up and looked upon it with a critical eye it has been made to exact specification he said it is very prized by the women in my harem i cannot you will understand pleasure them all at the same time he let his eye move over the object again and then said it is quite accurate in both size and shape muna it is called a dildo take it in your hands my beautiful slave and use it it will ease your distress skye looked upon the dildo as if it were a viper as kedar had said it was shaped and sized as he was it was carved of ivory and complete in every detail from the circumcised head of the penis to the veins all the way down its length at the base of the dildo had been inserted a polished wooden stick by which the user could grip it take the ivory he commanded her softly no she was horrified take the ivory muna he repeated and she heard the menace in his voice please she pleaded hoping that he would relent but she realized that if he didnt she was going to have to obey him she could not displease him she had to get to fez she had to free niall he saw the weakening in her defiance take the ivory he said i want to watch you while you use it his hand moved over her belly again fanning the fires within her skye shuddered and then she picked up the dildo with shaking fingers she was terribly embarrassed i have never seen such a thing let alone used one she said i dont know where to begin my lord kedar sat up facing her his back to the velvetcovered wall his legs crossed tailorfashion leaning forward he pushed a pillow beneath her hips open your legs he commanded her and when she had complied he began to stroke and rub at the very core of her femininity youre very beautiful there he murmured softly his hazel eyes watching the movement of his hand on her moist sensitivity i possess many beautiful women in my harem but i have never seen any woman as fair as you in so many ways i would have all of you my fair muna skye shuddered again as his clever fingers stoked her fires her instinct was to flee from this man this terrible man who indeed wanted all of her even that which she had never given to any man it was a dangerous game she had elected to play and now there was no going back his fingers were having the desired effect and she moaned low in her passion please my lord please take me she begged him knowing that he would refuse would impress his iron will on her use the ivory came the excited command use the ivory please my lord not that you take me there was a frantic sound to her voice and kedar smiled to himself use the ivory muna i am the ivory and i command it allah he thought the sight of her sweet sex aroused and honied and eager inflamed him more than he had anticipated still he would force her to his will lest she believe she could control and wheedle him at her desire drawing a deep breath skye thrust the ivory into her body gasping as the smooth cold length of it slid into her through her halfclosed eyes she could see kedar watching her with obvious enjoyment his hazel eyes darting from her face to her hands as they worked the dildo the ivory did nothing to ease her discomfort but still she moaned and thrashed her head about knowing he expected a good show kedar however was not entirely fooled he could see that the dildo was not having the effect that he had hoped for and so he leaned forward once again to tease the pink pearl of her womanhood it was as if he had touched her with fire her hands fell from the ivory as she moaned in earnest this time and kedar took up where she had left off one hand playing with her tiny jewel the other working the ivory dildo she quickly cried out her release and he immediately withdrew the dildo from her there beautiful muna that was not so terrible he purred at her fondling her quivering breasts now i shall reward you my exquisite blueeyed slave you have been very good beautiful muna very very good kedar slid his hard body over skye and drove into her there my pet is that not better i should not spoil you but i cannot resist you at this moment she had barely descended from the mountain only to have him once more force her back up it she whimpered a small protest that made him laugh softly and then his mouth was closing over hers in a searing kiss again the panic gripped her as she felt herself out of control but kedar was not aware of her fear he parted her lips and sucked upon her tongue while his lean hips thrust again and again until they both reached perfection he had swept her along with his own passion and now she lay panting and drained the fear had left her when he had released her he lay next to her now equally spent his breathing ragged finally he said hoarsely dear allah how you have destroyed me muna go now and leave me exquisite slave i would rest skye could barely drag herself from the couch but she knew that she had to get out of the room she needed to be by herself in order to recover her own strength on shaking legs she slowly exited having first gathered up her pantaloons and bolero and quickly dressed stumblingly she made her way back to the womens quarters in another wing of the house and finding her own rooms she fell across her bed instantly asleep from the strain and shock sleep was the best medicine for her thought osman who had been visiting his wife and had seen skye as she passed by alimas rooms the famous astrologer went to his library and seating himself comfortably began to contemplate the entire situation he knew the kind of man that his nephew was but he also knew that skye was strong enough to survive kedars carnality in the two days since skye had arrived back in algiers he had completely done her natal chart as well as that of niall burke lord burkes had been quite straightforward but skyes chart was amazing according to his calculations she had barely begun to live it would not however be all to her liking but then she had a strong and old soul skye omalley would survive whatever the odds osman had also studied his nephews natal chart quite carefully for kedar figured so importantly in this matter kedar was strong and his stars were equally strong but the influences controlling skyes chart were far more powerful and osman knew that she would be able to control her own destiny even in his nephews hands a small smile played about the astrologers mouth and crinkled the corners of his eyes he imagined that right now the exhausted skye was yet in shock after a night with kedar osman had to admit that his nephew was the most sexual man he had ever known and his capacity for women was legendary even in fez still once skye recovered from her initial trauma and her survival instincts surfaced she would be formidable osman felt almost sorry for kedar he knew that his nephew had never been in love and he hoped that skye would not arouse that emotion in him he did not want to hurt him it was difficult being torn between such a good friend as skye and his family osman emptied his mind now of all thought and relaxing his body he began to meditate alima found him that way some time later in the morning gently she shook her husband understanding what it was he did the life came slowly back into the astrologers eyes and smiling up at his lovely wife he said kedar is awake and wishes to know if i will eat the midday meal with him alima laughed and shook her head at him i dont know why i even bothered to come and get you she said couldnt you at least humor me by pretending that you dont know what i have to say before i even speak you are too easy he teased her back your mind is like crystal to me i know all where you are concerned my love all alima smiled provocatively at her husband woman your thoughts are much too immodest osman pretended displeasure but alima was not one bit fooled it will be a long hot afternoon my husband and i will wager that your nephew will not waste it idly osman chuckled and then he asked how is muna at this moment her thoughts of you are not entirely kindly my lord she is in the baths she would speak with you she says before kedar calls her to him again osman nodded i can enter the womens quarters without any question since this is my house when she is safely back in her own chamber alima then send for me we three will speak together it is better you be with us as there is no true privacy for us and your presence my wife will divert suspicion alima nodded i will arrange everything my lord she said and then left him osman rose from the cushions and went to find kedar he was curious as to what his nephew had to say about the new slave girl muna kedar had bathed earlier and now lay stretched out upon his couch while his personal body slave a giant black named dagan massaged him seeing his uncle he waved the slave away and pulled a length of cloth about his loins osman noted kedars powerful chest and muscled arms he was in excellent physical condition which considering his appetites osman thought was amazing youth he decided was obviously the key uncle kedars greeting was enthusiastic how do i thank you for muna she is incredible magnificent i have not enjoyed a woman so in years i am pleased to have given you such pleasure with so small a trifle as a slave girl my nephew kedar grinned you were right of course she is quite unschooled but she is intelligent i can see and will be easily trained despite the streak of stubbornness i find in her firmness is the key to managing a woman firmness and discipline one should never be afraid to punish even a beautiful creature like muna you did not punish her osman tried to keep the nervousness from his voice the girl cost me a pretty penny kedar allah no kedar laughed im afraid i grow weak with age uncle i could not destroy that gorgeous skin she possesses if muna should ever become recalcitrant i shall have to think of a way to punish her without using the lash no but she sought to defy me a little last night and i was forced to be quite firm she responded well and became quite pliant afterward yes osman answered i suspect that reason will always overcome any outbursts on munas part tell me nephew how long will you be with me this trip we had so little time to speak last night so eager were you to have the slave girl i understood of course your trip from fez was a long and lonely one i am no longer lonely kedar smiled i shall probably stay with you a good month or more uncle i have a great deal of business to conduct while i am here in algiers and now that you have made me so comfortable i am in no hurry to depart the two men chuckled companionably and after a few more minutes of idle conversation ate a light repast then osman excused himself and hurried to the womens quarters he found both his wife and skye awaiting him in skyes bedchamber good day my daughter he said calmly skye glowered at osman and then a small smile touched her lips i cannot say that you did not warn me that he was a lustful man osman she said but you did not tell me that he was built like a bull and totally insatiable i am exhausted having been at his tender mercy this past night still i know that it is the only way for me to reach fez to free my husband now however we must speak seriously osman nodded you have doubts i know you are certain that your younger nephew hamal will aid me in rescuing niall if the boy truly loves his princess perhaps he will have had second thoughts by now i am in constant touch with hamal muna he looked closely at her but if hamal should change his mind my daughter what would you do you would not i know leave your husband to languish in the princesss harem no osman i would not i should find a way i know came the answer it is your fate to travel to fez is it my fate to return osman skyes glance was a candid one you will see your green land again my daughter was his reply now tell me what else it is that troubles you it is your nephew osman he is a frighteningly possessive man will he allow me any measure of freedom or will i find myself walled up in his harem i will speak to him muna he has told me that he intends to stay a month here in algiers i will convince him of the need to allow you to move about the city properly attired of course he plans to stay a month osman can you not convince him to spend less time here you yourself said that every minute counts he is just arrived yesterday my daughter i can hardly send him back today i do not know what his business is but i shall soon learn it perhaps then i may speed his affairs along and you will return to fez at an earlier date be patient my daughter you have yet to learn that everything will take place in its own time and not a moment before a knock sounded upon the door and a slave girl put her head into the room the lord kedar has sent his slave dagan to bring muna to him skye nodded i will come she said and the girl departed the room skye rose it is barely two hours after noon she said making a small moue with her mouth i did manage to get six hours sleep heaven only knows how long it will have to last me he will probably leave you this evening to have dinner with friends and conduct some business osman said reassuringly he will return though old friend and he will expect me to be eagerly awaiting him and you will osman said quietly yes skye replied i will then she was gone from the room and alima looked to her husband with troubled eyes will she be all right my husband we should ill repay the kindness of the late khalid el bey should we put her in any danger you are a gentle flower my alima osman said but for all her delicate looks skye is tempered of as fine a steel as the toledo blade she cannot be broken or bent she will survive never fear while osman reassured his wife skye was following the huge dagan through the house back to kedars chambers the few hours sleep and the steam of the bath had combined to give her a radiant glow her cheeks were flushed rose and her eyes sparkled like a fine ceylon sapphire she wore a simple gauze caftan of turquoise blue and her black hair had been braided into one thick plait and dressed with tiny freshwater pearls and silver lame ribbons kedars eyes lit up at the sight of her he reminded her of a panther contemplating its meal and skye suppressed a small shiver as she slipped to her knees bent forward and touched her forehead to his slipper rise muna he said pulling her eagerly up to him dear allah how is it possible that you are so radiant his mouth descended quickly upon hers and skye slid her arms about him pressing her lush form against him kedar shuddered and pulled away in surprise no woman has ever done that to me he said looking at her curiously i did not mean to displease you my lord she said meekly i know that beautiful one i am simply surprised at myself i thought having sated myself upon your beautiful body just several hours ago i would be replete no woman has ever touched me as you have and i find however that i am not you have but to command me my lord kedar a slow smile lit his features and he turned to the black slave who stood awaiting his masters commands well dagan did my uncle not present me with a perfect jewel yes master the lord osman was most generous kedar turned to skye and you my fair muna what do you think of dagan he has been with me for ten years now and i trust him with my life i did not speak to the man my lord not knowing if it was permitted kedar laughed dagan is not a man my beautiful slave he is a eunuch i should not allow him near you were he not gelded he turned to the slave stay dagan i want to give muna the lesson i give all the women i take into my harem the black man smiled broadly yes master kedar gently began to unbutton the little pearl buttons that held together the halves of skyes caftan when they were all undone he pushed the gown off her shoulders and it silently slid to the floor she stood very still while his hands wandered casually over her breasts each woman my fair muna should have something to fear most of the women in my harem fear the lash should they displease me but your skin is so incredibly lovely that i would never mark it it was therefore necessary to devise a punishment that you would fear and i have decided on the bastinado have you ever suffered this form of chastisement no my lord she knew of the bastinado of course but never had khalid used such cruelty then you cannot be fearful of that which you do not know i intend to give you a lesson in the bastinado now my fair muna you will then understand and be afraid you will also comprehend that if you should at any time displease me you will be put to this discipline kedar turned to dagan i will hold her he said and then he instructed skye in a quiet voice i want you to lay upon your back on the floor and elevate your legs upon these pillows skye was terrified my lord she pleaded with him please do not do this for a moment he was tender gathering her into his arms and crooning to her there my jewel of course you are frightened but i will not excuse you this lesson only when you have felt the pain can you be truly afraid only then will i have a deterrent to unruly behavior come muna it will only be five strokes were i really punishing you it would be twenty or more depending upon your offense he drew her down to the rug kneeling with her positioning her with great care then he sat across her hips and leaning forward held her slender legs in a firm grasp begin dagan he commanded the black the sharpness of the first blow caused her to cry out over kedars bowed head dagan grinned cruelly down at her as he administered the second fierce blow this time skye shrieked in earnest please my lord kedar please no more no more kedar was however a man of his word and the third fourth and fifth blows fell upon the tender now burning soles of her feet the pain so intense that skye fainted taking the only escape open to her she was unconscious but a few moments awakening to kedars purring voice there my jewel now you know the price of offending me do you not yes my lord she managed to whisper repeat the words i taught you last night fair muna skye shivered she knew exactly what he wanted her to say and every fiber of her being rebelled against saying those words still she was now quite terrified of the bastinado and realized that should she really displease him he would not hesitate for a moment to use it again she rolled onto her stomach and from there into a kneeling position her dark head touching the rug i am my lord kedars slave she said low i exist solely for his pleasure above her kedar smiled satisfied and raised her up to face him you learn quickly my jewel he said approvingly i believe you will eventually become my favorite tenderly he brushed a tear from her cheek there now fair muna there is naught to cry about you please me mightily he smiled down on her and then drew her over to the awninged couch she was shivering with shock and he pulled her gently down upon the couch with him wrapping his arms around her dagan fetch refreshments he commanded his slave skye was suddenly very aware of her nudity please my lord may i have my garment do not be embarrassed before dagan my jewel it means nothing to him and i prefer you like this for now he kissed her lightly absently caressing her breasts you are so beautiful he murmured your skin is so flawless so perfect they were words she was to hear over and over again during the next few weeks she fascinated and consumed him with her beauty he cared for nothing else he rarely spoke to her on any subject of importance his words being those of her master her lover her days took on a pattern of sameness she slept the morning away went to him in early afternoon after visiting the baths left in late afternoon slept again bathed ate supper alone or with alima and sometimes osman then awaited kedars return from his business and social rounds late in the evening she then spent the entire night with him departing in early morning for her own rooms as a lover he was insatiable and totally unlike any man she had ever known he cared only for his own pleasure and took her with great gusto at least three times each night and very often as many as six he never seemed to tire of exploring caressing and kissing her skye was frankly frightened of kedar he was a man of mercurial temperament and she feared offending him the threat of the bastinado was a real and terrifying one to her still she sought ways in which to intrigue him for she did not want him to grow bored with her she found that quick changes of mood on her part interested him greatly and so she was shy one moment daring the next she knew he particularly enjoyed her reactions to his lovemaking and so even when he moved too quickly to arouse her she pretended great passion it stroked his ego and he rumbled his contentment like the great cat she pictured him you are perfection he would murmur against her ear sweet honeyed perfection more often than not she would shiver at his words the day before they left algiers for fez osman came to skyes chambers in the womens quarters he felt some guilt for the faint purple circles under her eyes but there was a new air of determination about her that he had never seen before i have had word from hamal my daughter he says you are to come ahead your niall still lives thank god skye breathed fervently skye it was the first time he had called her by her own name in weeks i am quite frankly worried about your effect upon kedar if you had set out to enchant himand i know you have notyou could not have done a better job of it he can speak of nothing but you and your beauty when he is with me if i did not know better i should say he is falling in love with you and that my daughter must not happen i knew his reputation of course but frankly until now i was not fully aware of his appetites i wonder if i have not set you too hard a task you have said it yourself osman there is no other choice niall is alive and i will not rest until i have freed him how could i knowing what i know return to my former life there is only one way to fez for me and i am already on that road why do you fret so have my stars changed suddenly osman no they have not changed you will always attain your hearts desire skye though the road to it be roughly paved though you yourself may not even know what it is you want in the end you will gain your goals in this have you been singularly blessed then tomorrow i leave for fez skye said quietly does he abuse you osman flushed at the boldness of his own words to her but he was truly distressed at the situation in which he had placed her he had never seen his nephew so consumed by anything let alone a woman then too alima had mentioned that skye had an occasional bruise and marks on her body that might possibly indicate that kedar was mistreating her your nephew is enthusiastic in his wooing of me skye said wryly no he has not actually hurt me although he has threatened me with the bastinado should i misbehave he illustrated that threat with a sample of that particular punishment he does not you see want to mark my skin with a lash his small lesson was a warning that my behavior should always be decorous i will admit osman that he frightens me allah curse him i shall speak to him this day my daughter osman was angry and his eyes blazed as skye had never seen them blaze for he had always been a gentle man toward her osman her voice was tight with warning you cannot tell him how to treat his possession and you know it you presented me to him as a gift and you know that the only justice for a slave is that which the master gives right now kedar for all his fierceness adores me but he is not stupid interfere and he will wonder why he might even grow jealous and i dare not have that osman sighed resigned you are correct my daughter i have allowed my paternal feelings for you to cloud my own judgment do not fear skye whatever happens i will get you out of fez when you choose to leave i will not permit you to languish in my nephews harem that is most certainly not your fate skye gave him a mischievous smile that touched his heart he had not seen her smile in some days now i should hope not my old friend although quite frankly i will welcome reaching kedars harem perhaps when he has all his women available to him again he will not use me so ffequently i never thought to grow tired of lovemaking osman but dear heaven i have your nephews prowess is surely unequaled for he can make love the entire night without ceasing and seems not to suffer from the lack of sleep as i certainly do osman shook his head sympathetically it is said that he had his first woman at the age of ten my late sister was shocked but her husband thought it a marvelous thing to have sired so randy an heir especially since kedar was his only child at the time does kedar have any children skye asked he never speaks of his women but then he rarely speaks with me at all except to command me to his will although he has no wives he does have several offspring but unlike most fasi men he seems to care little for them i dont even think that he could tell you their names ages or sex he does not care for children i believe osman decided it would be wise to say nothing of the fact that kedar had confided in his uncle that he wished to have children by muna skye had enough to worry about and as long as she had her special potion she would not conceive you do have your special potion he asked her worriedly do you have enough to last you several months my daughter i have just made a fresh batch kedar allowed me to go with alima to the marketplace and i was able to obtain the ingredients that i need it looks and smells like a fragrance and will be thought to be such osman it amused kedar to let me visit the market he loved the idea that i might wander at will and no one would know what a delicious morsel i am to quote him no one can tell who i am when i am dressed in my yashmak and veiled kedar tells me the marketplaces in fez are legendary you will enjoy them my daughter the merchant in you will delight at the variety of goods available remember to buy with an open hand you are the favorite of the lord kedar and he will be generous with you buy gifts for the other women and children in the harem often and you will quickly make friends i am not going to fez to make friends osman nonetheless you do not want to make enemies of any of kedars other women women can be vicious when jealous my daughter have you so quickly forgotten yasmin be charming and friendly and above all be generous you do not know when you will need a friend even in kedars harem none of his women would dare to betray him osman he is a man quick to punish an offense real or imagined and no one will risk his lash for me be i generous or not he beat one of his favorites to death you know still i will take your advice and be friendly i will rest easier knowing that skye was osmans reply he rose up from the divan as she did and taking her hands in his said go with allahs blessing my daughter he will not fail to hear your prayers for your mission is a just one one bit of advice and one only i give to you consider carefully before you act do not allow fear or enthusiasm to drive you to any rashness you will survive she looked into his wonderful and mysterious eyes and for a brief moment she felt swept away she knew as she gazed into their depths that she would indeed survive and something akin to exultation poured over her she would succeed in her rescue of niall they would return home to ireland and happily raise their children as they grew old together skye found her voice thank you osman my old friend thank you putting her arms about his neck she kissed him on the cheek the astrologer actually blushed but nonetheless he hugged her back then without another word he left her farewell my friend she called after him and osman turned the look in his eyes was a tender one farewell my daughter he answered softly as she watched him go skye wondered if she should ever see him again after she departed algiers tomorrow despite the fact that they were to leave for fez in the very early morning kedar did not change his habits at all that night if anything his excitement over leaving algiers increased his appetite for skye he loved to lie nude propped up by the multicolored pillows his legs spread while she knelt between his limbs her buttocks on her heels her arms out for balance her long dark hair loose about her his hands would hold his penis up while she would administer to him with her mouth her tongue her little teeth soon he would have no need to brace his manhood and she would obediently roll onto her back to receive him when he had taken her three times that night she dared to beg him no more my lord else i cannot rise to leave for fez a growl of laughter was his answer but he left her alone to sleep on the pillow below his couch until just before the dawn when his foot prodded her awake in a surprisingly thoughtful gesture he said if you wish to bathe muna go now and do so there will be little chance for a civilized bath for the next month occasionally we may camp by a spring but unless i can guarantee you total privacy you will not be able to avail yourself of it skye scrambled to her feet thank you my lord she said catching up her caftan and putting it about her as she hurried from the room lest he change his mind and his lust get the better of him wait she turned thinking dear god not again i have a small gift for you he said when you have bathed be sure to put it on he held out an object thank you my lord she said softly as she took it a bracelet how lovely no an anklet i had it specially made for you once you put it on it cannot be removed except it be cut off go now skye left the room fingering the anklet as she went it was a slender circle of pure gold engraved with several arabic letters and a delicate geometric pattern here and there amid the pattern was a tiny sapphire imbedded in the gold it was really quite beautiful hurrying to her room she awoke her own slave woman zada and sent her off to instruct the bath woman nigera and her helpers zada had been her first gift from kedar he had escorted her properly garbed so that only the merest slit of her eyes showed to the slave market to purchase a servant for her he had thought to buy her a european woman so she would not be lonely it had been a very kind gesture on his part but skye had insisted she preferred a young arab girl had he insisted upon the european she would have felt guilty leaving the woman in in fez when she and niall escaped the arab girl however would be reassigned a new mistress and no harm would be done they await you in the baths mistress zada had returned skye nodded and went off to bathe when she returned zada had laid out the garments in which she would travel silently she put on the long creamcolored silk chemise a palebeige djellabah embroidered in brown silk thread and tiny topaz and soft brown kidskin slippers the djellabah was hooded and had long sleeves before zada raised the hood and fastened the gold gauze veil across skyes face she brushed her mistresss long dark hair and dressed it with narrow gold ribbons in the single braid that skye favored go to my lord kedar skye said and say that i beg his permission because of the heat of the day to put aside my yashmak zada obediently followed her mistresss instructions and returned several minutes later to say the master says you must wear the yashmak as far as the cart you may remove it before you enter the vehicle but not until then very well skye answered fetch the lady alima to me now zada i would say my goodbyes zada once more hurried out returning several minutes later with alima skye then dismissed the slave girl telling her to see to her own lastminute preparations i think she spies for dagan who reports everything i do to kedar skye said amused he is so frighteningly possessive of you alima returned must you go my lady skye alima spoke french so that anyone listening would not understand her words there is no other way for me alima if osman were in the same position as my husband is would you not try to aid him how can i return to my home knowing that niall is alive how can i face our children with such knowledge on my conscience better they lose both of us than i return to them leaving their father behind in bondage you love him very much dont you yes alima i love niall with every fiber of my being i will not rest until we are safely together again be careful my lady skye alima begged her make no move unless you are absolutely certain that kedar will not catch you he is a very cruel man as you already have learned yes skye said shuddering as she remembered the bastinado he is very cruel yet alima he can also be kind see the anklet that he had made for me it is quite lovely skye handed the narrow golden circle to alima you read arabic what has he written on it alima took the anklet and studied it carefully as her eyes moved across the arabic script her face darkened he is a beast she muttered he makes a charming gesture and then ruins it with his ego what does it say skye demanded alima looked up at skye and said quietly it says muna property of kedar i will not wear it skye stormed you have no choice my lady alima said sadly it is the bracelet of a privileged slave once you fasten the clasp about your ankle the only way you will be able to remove it is if a goldsmith saws it off she handed skye back the anklet skyes eyes were dark with anger and she longed to throw the offending gold circle onto the nearest trash heap she knew however that she dare not bending down she fastened the bracelet about her right ankle she knew the punishment for offending kedar and she had no wish to ever taste the bastinado again as she rose up again her eyes met the sympathetic ones of alima you are far braver than i could ever be osmans wife said skye shrugged as you have said i have no choice mistress it is time to go zada had materialized from wherever she had been get the yashmak then zada hurry we must not keep the master waiting she looked at alima and there was mischief in her bluegreen eyes again you dont think she speaks french do you alima laughed never shes just a little berber girl one of too many daughters in her family they sold her off thats what she told nigera then alimas face grew serious and stepping forward she hugged skye hard be careful my lady and allah go with you skye hugged osmans wife back i shall endeavor to be careful alima thank you for all your hospitality and dont stop your prayers i beg you i shall need them then zada was busding about her importantly pulling up the hood of the djellabah fastening the veil about her face helping her into a black silk yashmak whose hood fell to just below her eyebrows and adding a second black silk veil you will smother me skye protested dagan says the master insists you be properly veiled was the prim reply skye gritted her teeth and grew silent there was no arguing for although she was kedars favorite concubine she was as much a slave as zada and dagan there was no appeal of the masters word she stood quietly while the slave girl went about the job of thoroughly muffling her and when zada had finished skye looked to alima merriment suddenly filling her eyes at the silliness of the situation i dont know who he thinks will see me between here and your courtyard that i must be so encased skye said in french it is simply another instance of his impressing his will upon you my lady skye was the answer we must not keep the master waiting zada said skye and alima embraced a final time and then skye followed her slave girl from the bedchamber through the house that had once been hers and into the main courtyard where kedars vast caravan was nearly assembled the fasi merchant had brought a rich cargo to algiers from the interior and now he was returning with an equally lavish one there were numerous pack animals donkeys and camels all laden down with the goods the train was to be escorted by a large group of armed and mounted mercenaries who had come from fez with kedar and would now return with him the caravan would travel at a brisk pace during the day but at night they would stop and set up their tents in order to eat and rest the animals they would travel approximately twenty miles each day following the caravan track that led through a narrow piece of land that was bordered by the adas mountains it was dangerous by virtue of the bandits who preyed upon poorly guarded caravans kedar had never lost so much as a camel in all his years of traveling the route for he was willing to spend the monies necessary to hire enough guards to protect him and his goods it was a poor economy kedar believed to stint on protection only to lose a valuable cargo skye traveled in a covered cart drawn by two sturdy donkeys the inside of the vehicle had been quilted in red silk and fitted with two dark blue pallets dagan drove while skye was forced to remain within the cart with zada her only escape from total boredom was the opportunity to look out through the gauze drapery veiling over the back of the cart when she became tired of sightseeing she could sleep she had little in common with zada whose only concern in life seemed to be beautifying her mistress in order to retain kedars devotion so they both might get ahead in the harem zada often sat up front with dagan chatting for hours with him about kedars house in fez dagan believed he saw the handwriting on the wall never in his ten years with his master had he seen kedar so obsessed with anything let alone a woman this one dagan decided could end up being kedars first and only wife consequently he took the time to make friends with the ambitious zada best to have a friend in the future mistresss camp even kedar might be softened and influenced by a wife the trip gave skye some respite from kedars possessive passion for she only saw him for a short time each night during the day he rode at the head of his caravan his sharp hazelcolored eyes watching the hills around them and the trail ahead never missing anything he ate the midday meal with his men although sometimes he would come by her cart afterward to see that all was well with his beautiful slave he ate his evening meal alone or with one of the senior men among his mercenaries when the camp was quiet for the night the fires burning in lonely splendor and the pickets alert and watchful then would kedar take his own pleasure in a curtainedoff portion of kedars tent they slept upon soft down and feather mattresses covered in scarlet velvet having eaten alone herself and then washed in a small wooden tub as best she might skye was expected to await her master within the alcove when he came he would take her twice and then fall immediately into a deep sleep for skye it was a relief for kedars only interest was in satisfying his natural and normal lust with these brief encounters she might have been anyone and his attitude gave her hope that his desire for her was now waning as they grew nearer fez and his large harem when they were a week from their destination they met with another party of heavily guarded merchants coming from fez and going to the coast most of the men were known to kedar and it was decided that they would eat together that night already several young kids had been butchered and were roasting over the cookfires they had met up with the other group in late afternoon and so had stopped early setting up their tents in an open place by a cold mountain stream skye was allowed to bathe in the stream and she delightedly washed her long hair which despite zadas care and brushing was filled with trail dust even the prissy zada was pleased and afterward brushed attar of roses into skyes damp tresses they returned the few feet to the tent to find kedar awaiting them his eyes swept over her lighting with pleasure at the cloudsoft billow of her fragrant hair i want you to dance for my guests tonight he said do you know the dance of the veils yes my lord skye was extremely surprised he was always so strict about shielding her from other mens eyes and yet he was now asking her to dance before his friends you will dance it then my jewel and wear your hair loose like it is now my lord do you think it wise to display me before others are you questioning me muna his voice was suddenly menacing my lord i only thought she began you thought slaves do not think muna they obey and although i have given you an order you are attempting to defy me no no my lord i would not disobey you i swear it skye was becoming frightened now and she desperately attempted to placate him he was in one of those moods where the least thing set him off i think my jewel that you need a lesson in deportment reaching out he trailed his fingers in leisurely fashion down her cheek but his eyes were cold with anger you have displeased me muna skye shuddered at his touch and beside her she heard zada suck in her breath please my lord she whispered tears filling her eyes dagan get the rods his voice was toneless skyes heart began to hammer wildly and she slid to her knees reaching out to wrap herself about his legs please my lord not the bastinado i am my lord kedars slave i exist solely for his pleasure please my lord her voice was frantic with pleading but in her heart skye hated kedar with every fiber of her being she wanted to take a knife and plunge it into his heart that he could torture her so cruelly both mentally and physically was appalling to her niall she silently cried out to him niall kedar shook himself loose of her clinging arms she was pulled roughly to her feet and her caftan ripped off exposing her nudity beneath then she was once more slammed down on her back upon the floor of the tent two slaves were called to hold her shoulders and arms down and a round ottoman piled with pillows was shoved against her to force her long legs upward two additional slaves were called to hold her legs steady and zada was ordered to sit across her mistresss hips to hold her down skye was already sobbing with terror and being so successfully immobilized frightened her even more plplease mmy lord she begged him once more dagan begin the punishment came kedars cold voice twenty strokes my lord dagan asked kedar debated for a moment with himself and then he said fifteen i am of a mind to be merciful and it is her first offense please no my lord skye was growing frantic now kedar nodded to dagan and the rod descended a piteous shriek sounded throughout the camp followed by several others in fairly quick succession when she fainted to elude the pain she was almost brutally revived the bastinadoing stopped until she was fully conscious once more then it began again and skye felt the pain sweep from the burning soles of her tortured feet up her legs almost to her hips pinioned down she still fought them begging and pleading with kedar for the mercy she knew he was not going to give her yet she continued to cry out to him in the vain hope that she could touch some cord within him she struggled to stay conscious lest she offend him further and prolong her punishment sitting astride her hips zada whispered to her the number of strokes eleven twelve courage mistress fourteen fifteen it was over the hold on her arms shoulders and legs was re leased and zada arose with a sob skye curled herself into a tight ball upon the rug and wept desperately suddenly with frightening awareness she realized that all about her was quiet slowly she raised her head dagan zada and the other slaves were gone only kedar remained and the light in his eyes was unmistakable dear god she thought horrified he couldnt do you know how much i want you muna he whispered hoarsely dear allah how i want you now he knelt by her side fumbling eagerly for her lush breasts and she knew that she dare not refuse him kedar pushed skye onto her back again and pulling his robes up thrust quickly into her he pounded against her all the while telling her how she excited him how watching her being beaten had made his passion rise to the point where he could not deny himself her body then without warning he poured himself into her and fell upon her breasts panting they lay that way together for several long minutes and then kedar recovered himself standing up he looked down at her and said you will dance for my guests tonight muna see that you are ready when i call you to me she nodded at him her beautiful blue eyes still wet with her pain and her shame as he strode from the tent skye pulled herself up crying out softly at the pain she felt in her feet and then zada was there to help her i have something that will take the pain away mistress dagan brought it to me he begs your forgiveness he enjoyed it the brute skye accused no no mistress dagan would be your friend zada assured her as she helped skye into the privacy of the sleeping alcove skye glowered at the girl naturally dagan would be her friend if he thought that skye had kedars ear well at least his eagerness to be friendly proved to skye that her position with kedar was a strong one how lord kedar loves you zada enthused in my country we do not beat the women we love skye muttered irritably here we do zada grinned broadly at her and then to mate with you afterward what a man he is how i wish a man like that had carried me off before my family sold me but then i am not beautiful like you mistress lie back now and let me put the salve dagan gave me on your poor feet will it ease the pain the lord kedar commands that i dance this evening you will dance never fear mistress the master has given orders that you rest and be fed the choicest part of the kid and other delicacies the veils zada you will have to seek among my things for them the colors mistress black all black the better to show off my skin the black ones with the bits of gold thread shot through them zada zada nodded and then knelt to gently smooth the ointment that dagan had told her to use over skyes poor red feet when she had finished she covered skye with a light wool coverlet and hurried off to find the veils suddenly exhausted skye quickly slipped into sleep she rested for just over an hour and then zada was gently shaking her awake the slave girl had brought her a plate filled with succulent pieces of roasted kid small grilled onions and pieces of green pepper freshly baked flat bread and a goblet of icy mountain water flavored with orange syrup sitting up skye found she felt better she was hungry and the burning pain in her feet was greatly eased she finished everything on the plate and then zada brought her a small dish of sweetmeats dagan prepared these especially for you mistress she said skye looked at the plump moist apricots filled with a mixture of chopped and honied nuts and the colorful jellies that smelled of vanilla cinnamon and almond they were beautiful and looked absolutely delicious skye reached out and took a red jelly which she popped into her mouth this is marvelous she said quite pleased tell dagan i thank him for such delicacies she ate a second jelly and then one of the apricots i will go and prepare your bath zada said skye lay back munching contentedly upon another apricot and several more jellies how kind of dagan to go to such trouble for her for how out here along this ancient camel track he had managed to prepare such delights she couldnt imagine perhaps he was not the villain she had branded him she was beginning to feel quite relaxed and filled with goodwill by the time that zada returned i have prepared your bath mistress zada said and afterward the master has ordered that dagan massage your body if i get any more relaxed skye remarked i shall fall asleep it is the jellies mistress what is in them suddenly skye wondered if this was some other nasty plot of kedars they are made with hashish mistress it comes from a plant at least the tops of a plant it wont hurt you our people have used it for many years and its only to make you feel good eat one skye commanded oh may i zadas brown eyes were round with delight and she quickly popped a green jelly into her mouth before skye might change her mind thank you mistress skye rose to her feet feeling somewhat dizzy but her mind though fuzzy said if zada eats them they arent poison no more now my lady zada chided her save them until just before you must dance they will inspire you zada helped skye into the small wooden tub and skye noted that tonight the water smelled of roses and musk she sat quietly as the slave girl pinned up her long hair and gently washed her zada worked quickly and then as quickly dried her mistress leading her back to the velvet mattress she instructed skye lie upon your belly so dagan may begin the massage i dont want dagan to massage me skye thought in the fuzzy recesses of her benumbed brain but she couldnt seem to say it aloud then she felt the blacks supple fingers upon her body and she didnt care any longer dagan dug his long fingers into her soft flesh with a practiced skill his clever hands smoothed over her skin with a firm but gentle touch up and down her back her legs and buttocks her shoulders and arms her feet together he and zada rolled skye onto her back and then dagan massaged her belly and her breasts the fronts of her legs and her feet and shoulders and arms through her foggy consciousness skye protested but the black seemed to consider touching her a job perhaps even a boring job and nothing more when he had finished they let her rest a few minutes and she floated deliciously through them she had never felt more relaxed more sensual her head finally cleared just as zada said it is time to dress you mistress and helped skye to her feet the slave woman clasped a delicate gold chain made of tiny flat filigreed links just below skyes hips to it she attached three sheer silk veils on each side of skye a larger veil in back over her buttocks and one the same size that hung to her ankles in front then while skye stood silently zada outlined her eyes in blue kohl and painted her nipples in carmine her whole body was tingling and reeked of roses and musk as zada brushed her hair with a brush dipped in musk she said would you like another of the jellies mistress best to have them now for you will soon dance skye popped several more of the sweetmeats into her mouth licking her fingers to remove the sticky residuc the euphoria began to return and skye suddenly realized that whatever it was that they had put into the confectionshashish zada had called it was most definitely responsible every movement she made now seemed exaggerated and sweeping zada fastened a small chain about skyes neck and to it she attached a veil that fell over her breasts and down past her waist another veil covered her shoulders and back and an even longer one was placed across her face zadas lithe hands moved suggestively over skyes body fluffing and positioning the veils so they would float correctly you are so beautiful mistress she murmured you are like a goddess belonging to the old ones every man who sees you dance will want you that is what the master desires to be the envy of his friends you must dance your best so that they all lust for you zada caressed skyes breasts and belly and buttocks her hands moving swiftly and her words and her movements began to communicate themselves to skyes blurred and confused mind she felt a tingling between her legs and her beautiful breasts began to almost ache with their tightness outside in the main portion of the tent she began to hear music and with a sly smile zada fitted her fingers with the four shiny brass tals go she whispered in skyes ear go and drive them wild with your beauty and sensuality our lord kedar will be pleased skye stepped out from behind the curtained alcove and walked across the tent to prostrate herself before kedar rise muna he commanded her his hazel eyes quickly taking in the black veils with their tiny golden stars it was a perfect costume for her her white limbs glowing mysteriously through the dark silk this my friends is the magnificent gift that my uncle the famous osman presented to me on my arrival in algiers she has easily become my favorite even though there is a tiny streak of willfulness in her that needs curbing a little spice never hurt a tasty dish kedar remarked a blackbearded man and the other guests chuckled in that case hamid it is fortunate i am fond of spicy food kedar replied and the chuckles became guffaws of laughter skye let her misty eyes wander about the group that sat eating about a low table there were seven or eight men but she could not seem to concentrate upon them or upon much of anything else for that matter she could still feel zadas hands lightly brushing her and rather than repel her the way a womans touch always had skye felt sexually aroused and her passion seemed to be growing instead of fading dance muna she heard the command in the murky recesses of her cloudy mind dance for us my jewel the three musicians began to play and almost instantly the throb of the drum and the whine of the reed pipes began to communicate themselves to her skye began to dance slowly her body weaving sensuously in time to the music for some minutes she wove and bobbed across the floor in front of them and then as the music began to increase in tempo she started to remove her veils kedar and his guests had been watching with mild interest but now they eagerly leaned forward fascinated the six side veils were quickly disposed of as was the long head veil and her long hair swung out and floated free with her erotic motions the music grew more intense as the back and breast veils were tossed aside only three veils remained the two covering her lower limbs and her face veil arms outstretched skye danced first thrusting her lush breasts forward and then pushing out her hips in an obvious and suggestive movement around and around she twirled as the tempo of the music grew faster and faster kedar chuckled softly to himself as skye removed the last three veils for he noted that several of his guests had slipped their hands beneath their robes to discreetly ease their longings now skye totally nude moved closer to kedar and his guests teasingly she clanged the brass tals beneath their noses as she dipped and swooped almost brushing several of them with her full rednippled breasts she was lost in a hazy world of her own and only the insistent beat of the drum the nasal shriek of the reeds and the erotic movement of her own hungry body held any meaning for her the men who sat watching were filled with fierce lust for her the ripe rose musk scent of her voluptuous body the dance itself but obedient to the tempo skye was aware of nothing but herself as the music reached a wild crescendo skye twirled in the final amorous and sexually impassioned movements of the dance before falling to the floor before kedar her beautiful body posed in a gesture of total submission to the master kedars guests roared their approval clapping and shouting tossing gold coins and small jewels at her with eyes wide skye looked up at kedar who was beaming with approval at her take the tributes my jewel you have earned them this night they are not half worthy of her kedar said the man named hamid i do not expect you want to sell her but should you ever grow tired of her i will pay you whatever you desire she is indeed exquisite skye did not stay to hear any more but quickly gathered up the tribute showered upon her by kedars friends for to leave it would have been terribly insulting then she fled back across the tent floor to the alcove suddenly she felt depressed as if she might cry dagan and zada were awaiting her the former grinning broadly the latter chattering delightedly she gave them each a gold coin but as she did so zada noted her sad face and looked quickly to dagan the master will come soon to pleasure himself and he will not be pleased to find her weeping she hissed at the black eunuch come mistress dagan murmured soothingly and drew her down upon the velvet mattress again let me rub away the tension you have built up during your dance he knelt and began to massage her feet which had begun to ache once more give her the sweetmeats little fool he snapped at zada we have not much time and she must be eager and ready for the lord kedar here dearest lady muna zada said sweetly eat and all will be well again i promise you oh how marvelous you were when you danced we could both see how pleased the master is with you zada gently forced several small jellies into skyes mouth and then began to caress her breasts as quickly as the depression had come upon her it began to slide away beneath the tender ministrations of the two slaves zadas hand brushed across skyes belly and skye felt her own desires beginning to stir again beyond the curtained alcove zada and dagan could hear kedar bidding his guests a jovial goodnight and they hurried to prepare skye for him zada leaned over and began to whisper softly and suggestively into skyes ear she knew that the hashish in the sugary confections dagan had prepared had already loosened skyes inhibitions once this evening now just a little bit of suggestion and she would eagerly welcome the master only a moment more my lady muna she murmured and the lord kedar will come to you zada fondled skyes breasts gently soon the master will fill you full with his fine big manhood the pleasure will be magnificent wont it allah how i wish i might lie beneath him while he pumped himself into me how fortunate you are my lady muna yes skye breathed oh yes quickly zada remove the stain from my nipples my lord kedar loves to nurse upon my breasts and i would not poison him skye was beginning to feel hot with her longing to be possessed by kedar god how she wanted his bigness inside her and she wanted it now he was like a mighty stallion his stamina being so great with a smug smile of satisfaction zada wiped skyes nipples free of red stain skye was already writhing with anticipation none of them heard kedar enter the alcove for a long moment he stood watching as his favorite black massaged and soothed skyes feet as zada erased the last traces of red from skyes lush breasts as skye herself moved upon the velvet mattress in loves rhythm he could see that they had drugged her and he smiled amused he liked it that his slaves were so eager to please him but now he wanted them gone he was already hard and aching beneath his robes disrobe me he snapped and both zada and dagan leapt to their feet to remove his few garments find your own beds he commanded them and without even waiting to see them gone he lay down next to skye my lord skye said softly turning to face him he pulled her into his arms to kiss her and she obediently opened her mouth to receive his tongue sucking upon it in a most ardent and suggestive fashion her hips glued themself against him and as he was unwilling to wait any longer to satisfy himself he rolled her over and thrust into her to his delight she gave a soft shriek and climaxed immediately what a hot and wanton bitch you are my jewel he purred at her did you enjoy displaying your bounteous charms tonight to my friends there was no one for me but you my lord kedar she panted beneath him no one ahh he rumbled if i thought that you were lying to me my fair muna i should kill you now but i know that you are not his big body moved hungrily and insistently upon her until she was moaning and pleading once more for release a release it did not yet suit him to give her for some time he used her turning her body this way and that in order to enter her from different angles offering pleasure one moment pain the next it was the pain that finally began to clear away the cobwebs of the drug and skye realized with shock and selfloathing that she had been encouraging kedar in a most salacious and lascivious manner she dared not cease at this point for she was frankly terrified of offending him she never again wanted to suffer the tortures of the bastinado as she had this afternoon and so she continued to behave in a lewd and eager manner until with a grunt he released his seed into her then he rolled over and began to snore skye gave a soft sigh of relief she was furious at herself for not having realized that she was being drugged now her mouth felt dry but at least her heart rate was beginning to slow down from its fevered pitch of a few minutes ago she rose from their bed and went across the alcove to pour herself some freshly squeezed fruit juice as she drank it thirstily she vowed she would never be given hashish again she would flatter kedar into believing that it was an insult to him to feed her the stuff she did not need such things to increase her ardor and natural passion for him with a small giggle skye drank another goblet of the fruit juice then suddenly beginning to feel very relaxed she returned to the mattress where she quickly fell asleep in the early morning as they sat eating sticky sweet figs and drinking boiling bitter coffee skye said slyly i am glad that you are not angry with dagan and zada my lord they only did it in their efforts to please you did what my jewel kedar was instantly alert fed me the hashish in an effort to stimulate my senses she laughed a tinkling light laugh as if i needed any other stimulation than your look or touch my lord but then they did not mean to be offensive to your manhood they only meant to please you she licked her fingers delicately i will go and dress my lord so i do not keep the caravan waiting with a sweet smile to him skye arose and began to pull on her clothing dagan kedars voice was sharp and skye hid a smile her barb had obviously found its mark my lord dagan appeared from the other side of the tent did you feed muna hashish last night yes my lord i made her the jellied confections so dearly loved by the ladies of your harem since she had earlier defied my master i hoped to make her more willing to dance i would not allow her to disgrace you my lord your motives were good kedar said but never feed muna any of your little potions again dagan giving her the drug implies that i am not man enough to inspire her you did not mean that now did you kedars voice had grown menacing no no my lord dagan had felt kedars lash too often to court his anger now he fell to his knees pardon my lord i only sought to please you only the fact that we cannot tarry in this place saves both you and that busybody zada from a beating be grateful for my mercy and do not rouse my displeasure again thank you master thank you dagan babbled backing from the alcove kedar turned to skye her expression was bland and totally disinterested demurely she raised up the paleblue hood of her djellabah walking over to her he tipped her face up to him there my jewel he said quietly dagan will not feed you any of his little tasties again but if you had simply asked me my fair muna i would have happily seen to it it was not necessary to suggest any lack of masculinity on my part you are beautiful and i am discovering you are clever but you cannot hope ever to deceive me he lightly slapped her cheek with his riding glove holding her sapphire eyes prisoner with his strange hazel ones you will remember that my jewel wont you yes my lord she said refusing to flinch or lower her eyes to him kedar smiled good he said now put on your yashmak and get to the cart yes my lord he watched her go a halfsmile on his face she was quite a puzzle his fair muna woman incarnate she could drive him to heights he had never before attained with any other and yet he knew that he had seen only a part of her she had been wonderfully uninhibited last night but that had only been the drug he had instantly sensed when she had become aware of herself again and withdrawn from him although she had worked very hard to conceal it there was far more to her than she had revealed to him and as much as he had enjoyed her lack of inhibitions last night he wanted her to have those same feelings for him within her heart and soul kedar had inherited a little of his uncles second sight though he had never sought to develop it such development would have taken too much selfdiscipline and he did not have the time to devote to it still now and then he could accurately sense certain things or feelings in people or events there was something special about muna his hidden senses told him and he longed to know her secret then he laughed at himself for a fool muna was a totally exquisite creature whose sole reason for being was to give him pleasure allah had created her to be a houri on earth and he kedar was the fortunate man gifted with her there was no more outside he could hear the activity of the camp almost ready to depart he strode from the tent so they might strike it immediately several men swarmed in to dismantle the shelter while both dagan and zada hurried out with the tents scant furnishings packed in small trunks walking over to the cart where muna had already settled herself kedar climbed into the vehicle her eyes widened in surprise my lord she questioned him settling himself next to her kedar reached up and loosened one side of her veil exposing her face his hand then reached up to cup her head and draw her toward him he saw the pulse in her slender throat leap and then his mouth descended upon hers his kiss was a searing one that demanded her surrender and her lips softened beneath his she was breathless when he released her see that your performance tonight outshines the one you offered me last night my jewel he said softly as he refastened her veil then he vaulted from the wagon the gauze draperies fluttering lightly with his passage chapter before them the city of fez nestled and clung to a cuplike valley descending from fez eldjid the newer town on the heights of the hills to the crowded rabbit warrens that made up the most ancient part of the city at the bottom of the valley along the river at first approach skye could see only a long line of tall towers and walls surrounding the city which was seemingly invisible behind the ramparts she shivered wondering if once she was behind that seemingly impenetrable barrier she would be able to escape as they passed through a huge horseshoe gate into fez skye saw that unlike the cities along the coast fez was a dour place its buildings were a dirty white with green tile roofs and from the street the plainness of their walls was broken only by doors there were no windows visible anywhere and the facelessness of the structures was rather frightening throughout the city stands of treescypress ilex date palms and various fruit treeswere welcome green islands dotting the hillsides that tumbled downward into the old city skye would quickly discover that though none of fezs homes had windows on the street side the beauty and luxury of their interiors were astounding she would also find that the wealthy now built their homes in fez eldjid escaping the overcrowding of the old city where the magnificent qarawiyin mosque the university where osman had taught and all the main bazaars and markets including the famous quaisarya the silk market were also located for now however all that mattered was the fact that she was in fez and somewhere in the city niall burke was held she wondered how long it would be before kedars young brother hamal would contact her kedars home was a marvel of several connecting structures built around flowering and fountained courtyards and lush gardens from the street it was as anonymous as all the other buildings around it but once inside she found herself in a paradise of incredible beauty the floors were all laid with small black and white tiles in a geometric pattern some of the floors were covered with thick lush rugs in reds blues and golds or blues golds and dark green the walls were partially tiled in yellow white and black and whitewashed above the tile except in the public rooms where the walls above the tiles had designs carved into their stone the ceilings in all the rooms were painted magnificently in various colors in incredible geometric patterns and designs dagan had escorted skye and zada to the womens quarters of the house a separate wing consisting of baths kitchens gardens and terraces salons dormitorylike bedchambers and private bedchambers how many women are there in the masters harem dagan skye asked as they had hurried along behind him i am not certain of the correct number my lady muna but it is over forty i know two coalblack eunuchs pulled open a gilded wroughtiron double gate allowing them entry into the harem area dagan brought them to the main salon where at this time of day most of the women were settled chattering sewing playing musical instruments or reading at their entrance there was immediate silence and hostile eyes swung toward skye assessing her beauty and her worth to kedar and instantly classing her an enemy dagan grinned delightedly to discomfit them the master sends you all his greetings upon his return ladies this lovely creature by my side is the lady muna a gift to our lord kedar from his uncle in algiers she is in his favor perhaps along the trail where the only other choices were diseased nomad wenches sheep and camels said a voluptuous blonde with almondshaped black eyes she looked insolently at skye and popped a small apricot into her mouth how do you keep your hair thatcolor my dear skye asked in flawless arabic in my own country i had a brace of hunting dogs with fur that same hue her look was bold and it dared the other woman to retaliate in a harem of this size skye knew that only the very strong survived the blonde gasped and scrambled to her feet how dare you she shrieked as she leapt the small distance between skye and herself her fists upraised skye didnt wait hooking her fingers into the blondes hair she grasped hard and flung her opponent across the room how dare you she replied in my own land i am a great lady here i have found favor with my lord kedar we need not be friends but you will treat me with the respect duc my station i am not like you some peasant wench thrust into a better situation you will remember that in the future the blonde sprawled among a pile of pillows arms and legs akimbo her mouth open in complete surprise the room was deathly still and then there was a throaty amused laugh as a tall very elegant woman stepped forward from among a group of women welcome to fez she said i am the lady talitha now only occasionally in our lord kedars favor praise be to allah talithas skin was the color of molten gold her black hair cut short so that it clung caplike to her skull in kinky curls her eyes were a wonderful shade of light green with a smile she turned to dagan is she to have a private chamber yes lady and you will see that none of the others mark her he is adoring of her flawless skin i shouldnt wonder talitha said dont worry dagan i will care for her as if she were my own child she then turned her gaze upon the other women in the room you heard she said in a suddenly hard voice anyone who touches muna will answer first to me and then to our lord kedar frankly i dont believe any of you soft overripe bitches are capable of taking on this one but be warned nonetheless you will be safe now dagan said and then he left skye and zada come with me talitha said and they followed her from the salon there is a lovely room available overlooking the mares meadow and the mountains beyond the city walls are you in charge of the harem skye asked i have the honor and the burden of being kedars harem mistress talitha replied drily i was the first woman he ever bought i have two daughters by him but as his appetite has grown his need for me is less do you love him no but i am grateful to him i was born in a brothel in rabat my mother was a whore of berber and negro origin my father was her french lover i know that for certain because my mother did not enter the brothel until after my father left her and she was already pregnant with me she was a beautiful woman and so she went to the finest brothel in rabat and offered to sell herself to them if they would wait until she had borne her child they gave her the gold on which to live comfortably until i was born and then she joined them i was raised there and kedar bought me from the brothel owner who felt that at twenty i was a bit too long in the tooth to satisfy his customers i am therefore grateful to the master i have a good home my children are safe and i am respected ah here we are she flung open a beautifully paneled wooden door and they entered into a lovely bright room what about you muna i am a captive she said the lord osman bought me to give to the lord kedar for a captive you speak our language quite well talitha remarked i was in the bagnos for several months and i fortunately have an ear for other tongues were you ill that you were kept in the bagnos or here she cocked her head were you as i suspect loath to accept your portion skye laughed i needed convincing she admitted you must understand talitha that i am an englishwoman a respectable widow with children the thought that i should never see my babies again never return to my own land was not only frightening but heartbreaking to me but now you accept your fate talitha looked a little disbelieving what choice do i have skye asked and our lord kedar he is different from any man i have ever known skye said slowly not quite sure what it was talitha wanted her to say talitha laughed he is a hard man muna but believe me there are worse masters all kedar demands is perfect obedience in his bed the rest will be easy if you are not a gossip for he hates those whose tongues wag incessantly youll probably be spared his company for a while however as you have had him all to yourself these last two months kedar needs variety and like a large honeybee he will now begin to go from flower to flower until he is sated once more she smiled mischievously at skye i imagine you can use the rest muna our lord and master can be quite exhausting and i dont believe i have ever known anyone who spent two solid months catering to him it is indeed possible you are the first woman to be that long with him i will do whatever my lord commands me skye said sweetly talitha laughed once more you must be in kedars favor she said amused well we shall see i will leave you and your servant now to rest she ended and turning left the room the door had no sooner closed behind her than zada began to chatter busily what a fine room look at the view my lady muna these carpets are very good arent they ohh the couch is large isnt it i imagine the lord kedar will visit you here for you are in his favor how fortunate we are to have such a rich master we can be very happy here but of course it would be wise for you to become pregnant as quickly as possible dagan says that the lord kedar will probably marry you and never before has he taken a wife what an honor for you be silent chatterbox skye said dont you realize that harem walls have ears the lord kedar is undoubtedly quite tired of me by now and as the lady talitha has said will seek solace among the variety of his other women you must expect nothing zada if he were bored mistress you would not have been given this fine chamber with its beautiful thick rugs silk hangings upon the wall and a couch large enough for two people skye ignored her servants babble and changing the subject said find out where the baths are and if i may bathe at any time i choose it has been over a month since we left algiers and in all that time i have not had a decent wash i want a bath as quickly as possible of course you must be perfection when our lord kedar comes to you tonight her mistress ignored her remark and zada hurried from the room full of importance and certainty skye frankly hoped that talithas assessment of the situation was the correct one and that she would not be troubled by kedar for several days at the very least she looked about the room the walls were tiled halfway up as was the rest of the house in lovely turquoise blue and pure white above them the wall was painted white and the wooden moldings were stained a dark brown the white ceiling had large dark beams and between each beam was painted a design of turquoise blue and black swirls and dots the darkstained wooden floor had a large thick carpet in shades of gold and white with a knotted white fringe there were several small square carpets in turquoise and white beneath the windows and two that were ovalshaped one on either side of the large couch the couch itself was a square set upon a gilded dais it had a large feather and down mattress and was covered in turquoiseandgoldstriped silk there were wonderful large pillows both plain and embroidered in several shades of rose upon the couch the room also had some nicely designed carved chairs and two brass tray tables one large one small as well as both hanging and portable lamps in ruby glass brass and copper as zada returned she was preceded by several eunuchs who brought in skyes beautifully fitted trunks and at zadas instructions set them about the room all the eunuchs but one departed and zada introduced the one this is minda your personal eunuch my lady muna you see i told you that you were important to our lord kedar she finished smugly skye lightly slapped zadas cheek you are overproud zada i am blessed by allah to have our lord kedars attention may i always be able to please him but if allah should will it otherwise then may i accept my portion as gracefully as i now accept what he has given me the eunuch a lightskinned negro half smiled you are indeed wise my lady muna dagan says that you will go far and it may be that he is correct skyes eyes met those of the eunuch he was his masters man of that she was certain and zada would also be loyal to kedar she was truly alone what if hamal had decided at the last minute not to help her what if niall had finally pushed the princess beyond her endurance and been killed during the month in which she had been traveling from algiers to fez how could she get word to osman and even if she did how could he help her now skye was tired dirty and under emotional strain helpless tears filled her eyes and threatened to spill down her cheeks you zada minda snapped help me to get your mistress to the baths she is exhausted and needs to be bathed and then allowed to rest he put a strong arm about skye come now my lady muna and let me help you skye sagged against the eunuch relieved for the moment to have an excuse to put her worries from her mind she did need a bath and she did need to rest from the first day she had met kedar over two months back there had not been a night she hadnt been forced to cater to his whims except for the few days when her link with the moon was broken and she was considered unclean she let herself be led off and within minutes was soaking and steaming all her worries and troubles away minda was obviously well respected among the bath women for they did not seem to resent either his presence or his quick orders regarding her comfort what is your fragrance he asked her quietly damask rose she said softly and he nodded his eyes approving it is the perfect fragrance for you few can wear its blend of sophistication and innocence well the bath women exclaimed with delight over skyes fair skin fairer than that of any of the other harem women they said the fasi aristocracy prized fair skin in both men and women alike they also were lavish in their praise of her hiplength black hair which they washed gently lathering a wonderful rosescented soap into thick suds that gently removed the trail dust from her beautiful tresses twice they washed her hair afterward rinsing it thoroughly the final rinse a mixture of herbal vinegar and water for shine the bath mistress said skye was beginning to feel relaxed she had been washed pumiced and denuded of the little body hair they could find on her now while two young slave girls dried and brushed her hair she lay on her stomach and enjoyed an expert massage a most soothing rose lotion was smoothed over her skin and rubbed into her body with long firm strokes she didnt even protest when they massaged her breasts and belly skye was but half awake when they stood her up slipping a white gauze chamber robe over her now clean body minda lifted her in his arms and carried her back from the baths to her room setting her gently upon her large couch that was wonderful she murmured at him and he smiled down at her are the tears gone now lady muna yes she said and closing her eyes appeared to sleep with a satisfied nod the eunuch left the room giving instructions to zada as he went let her sleep for exactly six hours i will be ready then with a meal for her and the master will join her at the eleventh hour tonight do you understand the lord kedar will visit her tonight really zadas eyes were round with satisfaction and her smile was a trifle smug i have said it woman the eunuch snapped i do not say what i do not know or mean remember that in future if we are to work together for lady munas eventual triumph over the rest of the women then you must obey my instructions and not question me zada i have been in lord kedars harem for seven years now and i know all there is to know and more if you are so important minda zada retorted then tell me why it is you have not succeeded with one of your charges before i almost did two years ago was the reply but the ungrateful wretch escaped my vigilance and was caught cuckolding my lord kedar with one of his guard the little fool almost destroyed me and had it not been for dagans intervention i too might have died dagan however convinced my lord kedar that i was not to blame and he spared me i have been used on general duty in the harem ever since but today dagan once more gave me my own charge the lady muna i will succeed with her and if you follow my lead zada you will also find yourself in a place of honor as personal maid to our lord kedars only wife you would like that wouldnt you zada nodded now more respectful but also still curious why is dagan so good to you she asked why should he care if you succeed or not dagan is my brother minda said and then he haughtily stalked from the room skye had heard it all and with mindas final words to zada she again felt depressed minda had obviously been the personal eunuch to the unfortunate girl from cathay whom kedar had beaten to death now given a second chance he would be virtually impossible to elude and if she could not evade his watchfulness how could she aid her beloved niall with a little sob skye turned her face into one of the pillows and wept softly niall she cried in her heart my darling husband where are you niall without even realizing it she fell into a troubled sleep a sleep made restless by faceless and frightening images that arose from the depths to haunt her and while she fought against her tortured dreams niall burke fought against a nightmare of another kind skye would have been shocked by his appearance had she seen her husband now eight inches taller than his wife his months in the galleys had hardened his elegant frame giving him strong muscles where once there had only been their suggestion still he was far too thin his big nude body was spread wide upon a large couch his long arms and legs manacled to prevent his escape his midnightcolored hair was longer and his silvery eyes were now the lackluster gray of dirty pewter the elderly crone who served as his female eunuch had already fed him with the spiced drink that was always ordered for him before these sessions with turkhan at first he had refused to drink it and spit it out when they forced it down his throat there had been no admonishments on his behavior but the next time a tube of sheep intestine was jammed down his throat into his stomach and the liquid poured through it the third time the cup was again handed to him but the female eunuchs stood by ready to use the tubing should he prove difficult niall burke had drunk down the potent liquid then having no doubt in his mind that they would use force again if they had to he was already beginning to feel the peculiar euphoria that began shortly after the liquid entered his body and to his disgust his anxieties were once more melting away as his breathing began to grow slower and more shallow he seemed to lose control of himself every time they pressed the goblet on him and induced him to drink and he didnt understand it but then as his inhibitions slid away he demanded petulantly of the eunuch rabi where are my sweets the old one cackled merrily so eager so eager she said you are always so eager for the comfits ashur open your mouth then and i shall pop them in you will like them tonight for they arc your favoritevanilla obediently niall opened his mouth and rabi fed him the candies the jellied squares with their bright jewel colors fascinated him they tasted so good sweet and strongly vanillaflavored they had never had anything like them at home in ireland ireland dear god would he ever survive to get back there again he had to survive that was why he so docilely accepted the spiced drink and the sweets they fed him each time princess turkhan wanted him in her bed in the beginning he had fought her like a madman and they had chained him like an animal in her garden until he had regained some measure of sanity he had welcomed his release from the turkish galley where he had been incarcerated since his recovery from darraghs attack he had almost lost track of the time for that was how it was when ones life was confined to a rowers bench when however he had learned that he had been purchased to serve as a stud animal to an eastern princess he had gone wild he had tried explaining to turkhan who spoke fluent french their one common language that he was an aristocrat in his own land that he was willing to pay whatever ransom she desired that he had a beautiful wife and two children he longed to return to in ireland that he was lord niall burke i shall call you ashur had been her answer do you know what ashur means my tall one it means warlikeoneand i can tell here she ran her tiny hand slowly over his bulging biceps that you are indeed a fierce warrior nothing he had said had penetrated her brain he decided and so he began to explain again turkhan had waved her hand impatiently saying i heard you the first time ashur now you will hear me i am not interested in purchasing captives for ransom i am a wealthy woman a connoisseur a collector of beautiful things and you are a beautiful thing never have i seen such blue eyes my tall one i suspect that you are a good lover and i shall teach you to be an even better one i promise you neverhe spat angrily at her turkhan had laughed a deep velvet sound the sound of a woman used to getting her own way do you know to whom you say never ashur i think you do not or you would not be so bold i will therefore forgive you your mistake and tell you who i am i am the daughter of sultan selim ii of the ottoman empire defender of the true faith and overlord of this city i dont give a damn who your father is niall had shouted at her i wont be your stud woman im an irishman not a prize stallion her eyes had narrowed with annoyance whoever you were my beautiful ashur you are no longer whatever was is no longer your only reality is what you are now and that is ashur a slave in the harem of princess turkhan your goal is to please me your mistress and ashur you will please me i can promise you you will please me it gave niall burke small satisfaction to know that so far he had not really pleased her she was beautiful he had to admit by any cultures standards she would have been considered beautiful she was not a tall woman standing barely over five feet in height but she appeared taller for she had a regal bearing along with long and slender arms and legs she held her beautiful head high her flamecolored hair cut straight across her forehead hanging turned under just below her shoulders she had an oval face with an aristocratic nose a lush red mouth and almondshaped eyes fringed in thick black lashes that were the amber gold of a lioness her body was slim and lithe like a boys except for large marvelous breasts that thrust proudly from her chest he had learned in the year he had been imprisoned in her palace that she was a welleducated and an intelligent woman but she was proud and stubborn too despite his constant refusals despite the fact that every time they made love she had to force him to do it in spite of his atrocious behavior she had made him her favorite along with the boy hamal who had been in her harem some three years and was genuinely in love with her that was an interesting situation niall thought as he lay awaiting turkhan hamal had told him that he had been born a free man also but that his older brother a wealthy merchant had sold him to the princess hamal didnt seem to mind at all as he cared for his mistress and she obviously cared for him niall smiled to himself whether turkhan realized it or not the boy manipulated her to suit himself but unfortunately he had not been able to help niall the princess had determined that niall was to father a child on her but he was equally determined that she would not have his child no son of his was going to be mothered and raised by her niall had rarely resorted to prayer in his entire lifetime but he prayed now that the flamehaired bitch who held him captive would not conceive his child so far his prayers had beeen heard only skye had ever given him children his darling little daughter deirdre and his only son padraic dear god the lad had barely been born when he had last ridden off from burke castle what did the boy look like now niall wondered and deirdre too had skye mourned him long was she still mourning him had she remarried she had never been a woman to be without a man for a long time he wondered whose wife his wife was now the thought of her with any other man maddened him beyond reason dear god claire oflaherty had had her revenge on them all if he ever got free of fez he was going to search the shewitch out himself and kill her once and for all he could yet remember awakening aboard a rocking ship to find her standing over him gloating he hadnt understood why she was there or even how she had gotten there but he knew he was not dreaming before he had even had a chance to question her he had slipped back into an unconscious state you look so fierce my beautiful ashur turkhan murmured as she slid onto the bed next to him her little white hands began to slide across his body caressing and seeking the sensitive places that would arouse him what is it you think of my beautiful one i think of deceit and of revenge my princess he answered her turkhan shivered at the dark depths in his eyes i command you to think of passion instead she said nialls harsh laughter rebounded off the walls it shall of course be as you command my princess he answered her mockingly oh ashur turkhan whispered allowing her vulnerability to show for just a brief moment is it really so difficult to love me she lay her sleek head on his chest and it occurred to niall that he had been going about this thing all wrong for months he had been fighting her and it had gained him nothing what a fool he had been if he had appeared to give in to her demands from the start he might have gained her trust and escaped months ago instead he had behaved like a violated virgin what an idiot he was skye had always accused him of not seeing the overall picture of being impulsive and heedless of the havoc his quick actions wrought his mind snapped back to the present turkhan having stimulated his manhood to erection was preparing to mount him as she always did unchain me my princess he said quietly i think it is time i showed you how an irishman makes love to his woman she looked suspiciously at him what game is this you play with me ashur are you afraid my princess was his slightly mocking reply her pale skin flushed with the open challenge and she licked her lips for months she had been forced to compel his participation and although he claimed to be the father of children she could not conceive she had filled him with opiates and hashish and other wellknown aphrodisiacs to insure his potency perhaps the secret lay in his being willing dont you want to feel my arms about you turkhan he murmured gently unchain me lass the tone of his voice made her shiver openly and niall knew that he had won slowly turkhan arose from the wide couch walked across the room and opened a small carved ebony box removing the key from the box she returned to the couch and unlocked the four manacles that had held him prisoner while she returned the key to its hiding place niall burke sat up rubbed his wrists and swung his long legs over the bed every movement he made felt exaggerated to him it was always so after they fed him with the jellies and the goblet still he realized that he suddenly felt very good his big body was burning with desire his erection was yet quite firm and now as his blue eyes swept over the beautiful and petite creature standing before him he had but one thought to couple with her it was what she wanted and right now it was what he wanted as well reaching out he pulled her against him and bent low to find her lush mouth what an incredibly beautiful little bitch you are he said against her lips as he pressed teasing kisses against them and turkhan shivered again her mind half fearful half thrilled that he was at last yielding himself to her niall lifted her tiny frame up in his arms and set her gently on the soft feather and down mattress then joined her oh love me my beautiful ashur she whispered frantically i will love you my princess but there is no great hurry i promised you that i would show you how the men of my land love their women he leaned over her his fingers brushing back her soft hair do you want me turkhan he asked her his gentle touch was destroying her turkhan thought but she could not help herself from gasping yes ashur allah yes i want you his satisfied growl of laughter frankly frightened her but she dared not move lest she break the spell and he revert to the sullen and angry man that he had been until just a few minutes earlier while she lay so still her golden eyes lowered modestly niall took the opportunity to examine her closely her skin had the same texture and color of the milkwhite roses that grew in her garden he slid his hand across her flat belly enjoying the softness and heard her catch her breath niall smiled to himself she was a hot little piece he moved a hand up to fondle one of her big coneshaped breasts rolling the large coral nipple between his thumb and his forefinger turkhan moaned and catching his head in her two tiny hands she drew it down to her breasts he laughed at her impatience but nonetheless took the offered nipple in his mouth to suck upon it worrying it faintly with his teeth and sending tiny darts of delight through her entire body turkhan couldnt believe the pleasure that niall was giving her she had never allowed any man to take the lead when making love with her and yet she suddenly realized that she didnt want him any other way let hamal her little lamb love her gently with tender touches and wailing persian love songs but ashur allowed his own way he was loving her with a fierceness she had never known and she adored it he had now transferred his attentions to her other breast and when he had finished with it he began kissing nipping and licking at her skin turkhan almost screamed with rapture especially when his head dipped to the v between her legs and he began nuzzling at the secret of her womanhood no man had ever kissed her there or loved with his mouth the tiny pearl of her femininity she wasnt even sure that it was right but she was now past caring and she didnt want him to stop something strange and frightening and yet wonderful was happening to her she felt a sudden tightness then a swelling and then an incredible burst of pleasure unlike anything she had ever felt beforeand it was only the beginning of the delight she was suddenly beneath him and he was filling her full with his great and pulsing manhood turkhan almost swooned with bliss for never had she lain beneath a man she had been told that a woman mounted the man as that was the only way he might obtain pleasure it was an incredible and magnificent experience he was driving deep and fast inside her and she began to moan her flamecolored tresses whipping around her thrashing head as she lost control and her world dissolved about her turkhan arced her body upward to meet his thrusts her long nails raked his back leaving bloody weals across it as a primitive scream exploded from her throat only to be stifled by his brutal kiss which was the last thing she remembered before plummeting down into the raging darkness regaining consciousness she began to laugh softly with the irony she had once told him pridefully that she should make a better lover of him than he was but now turkhan knew better he had taken her where no man had ever taken her and now she knew that all these years she had been only half a woman that before ashur they had all cheated her she rubbed her kissbruised lips gingerly and opening her eyes looked directly at him why didnt you tell me he demanded of her because until just a little while ago my beautiful ashur i did not know myself she answered him candidly he didnt believe her you grew up in a harem he snorted scornfully surrounded by women and you never knew the pleasure that can be between a man and a woman they never told you i was sent from my fathers house when i was ten years old she said quietly my mother was a circassian dancer in my fathers harem who just happened to catch his eye one time that one time was enough to get her pregnant but my mother was obviously not interesting enough to retain my fathers favor he never called her to his couch again and she died giving birth to me i was given to one of the other women to nurse but once it was no longer necessary that i have milk to survive i was left to myself i was nobodys child ashur my grandmother khurrem took an interest in me for a while but as i grew they tell me i began to resemble cyra hafise my fathers grandmother who had been my grandmothers mortal enemy when i was almost ten years old my father needed monies for his fleet and word was sent to all the great cities of his empire fez responded so generously that my fathers curiosity was aroused he was told that the largest contribution indeed three quarters of what had come from the city had been given by one ali ibn achmet further investigation revealed that ali ibn achmet was the citys wealthiest merchant an old man who had never married but was very devout and extremely loyal at my grandmothers urging my father decided to reward ali ibn achmets generosity and loyalty by presenting him with an ottoman princess for a wife the choice was left up to my grandmother and she chose me saying although you look like the cursed cyra hafise you are my granddaughter and more like me in your actions than any of the others this is your chance little turkhan and i shall give you the best piece of advice i can be softspoken appear meek but never let anyone own you this includes your husband my child let no man truly own you amass all the wealth you can and when the old man we send you to dies be sure he has named you his only heir do whatever you must to insure that inheritance but gain it for wealth is your guarantee of power little turkhan wealth and your inviolate position as an ottoman princess that my ashur is the only thing i learned in my fathers harem i learned nothing of love or of womens ways but i consider what my grandmother khurrem taught me the most valuable lesson i have ever learned in life i never knew until tonight the real pleasure that can be between a man and a woman this you have taught me and if it never happens again at least i shall be content having known it once my god niall thought what a complex and sad woman she is it can happen again turkhan and it will he promised shall i make it happen for you again my princess leaning over her he brushed her lips with his own but all the while he was thinking that he had at last found a sure way to control her a few nights of unending delights and she would be his slave reaching out he crushed one of her breasts in his hand while he murmured with hot breath in her small ear answer me turkhan do you want the pleasure again yes she whispered urgently yes my ashur i want it niall marveled afterward that he had not thought to cooperate with his captor before for all her position and wealth and power turkhan was like any other woman in love niall knew that he would have to move very carefully else he arouse suspicion already young hamal questioned his motives i do not understand this sudden turnabout hamal said for months you have battled with turkhan to regain your freedom while you our lovely mistress and everyone else here has told me that regaining my freedom is an impossibility i am a thickheaded irishman hamal but i now believe you all if my life is to be here then i am better off cooperating arent i besides turkhan is an exquisite woman and i am a healthy man i could resist her no longer what of your wife hamal demanded do you no longer think of her ashur he shrugged fatalistically skye undoubtedly believes me dead and has probably remarried it has been almost two years now and she would need a strong husband to protect burke lands and my small sons inheritance my father is an old man and could not aid her he lost heart once more for his spoken thoughts could very well be the truth she probably had remarried and he was never going to return to her or to ireland yet deep in his heart he still believed that skye belonged to him and to him alone you belong to me and me alone kedar murmured against her mouth as she lay half conscious beneath him he thrust his enormous lance hard into her quivering sheath and she shuddered with shamed pleasure skye had hoped for a respite from kedars lust once they had reached fez but his ardor had only seemed to increase she was the object of much speculation within his harem many were jealous of her and more were fearful of her influence over their master skye would have laughed if the situation were not so absurd and she would have been terribly lonely had it not been for talitha the beautiful harem mistress sensed that muna did not enjoy being the exclusive object of the masters affection skye was also nervous because hamal had yet to contact her though surely he must know that she had arrived open your eyes my jewel and ravish me with a look kedar commanded her his passion spent skye slid back into the here and now looking at him with her cool gaze you are a magnificent lover my lord she said honestly and that was something else that was beginning to bother her he was an incredible lover and of late she had been genuinely responding to his lovemaking she simply couldnt help it skye had experienced enough at thirty to know the difference between love and lust but still it distressed her to give this man anything of her real self she was prostituting herself in order to help niall but to enjoy it seemed wrong she sighed deeply and he mistook her motives as he usually did we will make love again this night my fair muna he said in an amused and indulgent tone it pleases me that you are losing some of your shyness and are becoming as insatiable for me as i am for you she laughed lightly it is impossible not to want you my lord and she boldly caressed his cheek with a teasing hand he caught her hand and turning it palm up placed a moist and burning kiss upon it you delight me my jewel and i would reward your behavior tell me what you would like skye paused a moment as if in thought and then said would you allow talitha and me to visit the bazaars in the old part of town my lord i have not spent my pin money since i arrived the vendors who come to the harem do not bring with them a great variety of goods and there has been nothing that i desired what a delight she was kedar thought tolerandy once more amused by the simplicity of her request he was also feeling somewhat pleased with himself for his firm handling of this beautiful slave of his she was responding perfectly these days and had been worth every moment he had spent on her he chuckled aloud how feminine she was wanting to shop the bazaars and how intelligent not to waste her precious dinars on the cheap baubles and bangles the vendors brought into the harem to sell more and more he considered the possibility of making her his wife if only she would conceive a child he turned his hazel eyes upon her so you would visit the bazaars muna very well my jewel but you and talitha must be well veiled and well guarded i will have no one making free with either of you you may go tomorrow oh thank you my lord skye wound herself around him her beautiful arms entwining themselves about his neck her breasts pressing suggestively against his smooth chest her pouting red lips invited his kiss and while he tasted her mouth she reached down and fondled his manhood with clever hands until he was hard and eager again never interrupting their embrace she moved herself over him guiding his length into her warmth kedar pulled his mouth from hers and groaned with pleasure as she moved on him with a fierce rhythm his big hands tangled themselves in her dark hair and he muttered almost incoherently against her mouth skye slipped her arms about his middle and lifted her legs to wrap them about him kedar gave a growl shifted his weight and pushed skye back onto the pillows taking control of their lovemaking once more as the pleasure began to build for them both she tried to fight it back but her body would not obey and instead she soared upward the feeling built and built until skye believed she was going to burst with the burning bliss that raced through her veins he was commanding her to tell him how much she wanted their passion and terrified that he might stop she said the words that she knew he wanted to hear then felt more shamed than ever like boiling wine the perfection poured over her and somewhere in the timelessness she could hear his howl of victory her last thought then was that she must find niall before it was too late she must escape from this terrible man before he destroyed her completely afterward as they lay together in the quiet he said never has any woman given of herself as you give to me my jewel and yet i cannot have enough of you you are as much an aphrodisiac to me as the hashish and the opiates i have never felt for another woman that which i feel for you you honor me my lord skye replied softly but her mind was wild with panic at the thought that he was falling in love with her that he might attempt to make her his wife he could do it even without her consent for in islam a wedding was held with just the consent of the brides father or guardian in the case of a slave a master need only arrange it with the local iman she tried to calm herself with the thought that osman would have foreseen such a thing and not put her in such a position what a disaster it would be if kedar married her especially with her husband still living no osman would have foreseen it skye reassured herself as kedar pulled her into his arms and fell asleep when she awoke the following morning she was alone the imprint of his head on the pillow the only evidence that he had been there at all she was no longer required to sleep on a cushion below him and that talitha had told her was quite an honor no other woman in the harem save muna and talitha was accorded that honor skye stretched lazily but her mind was already active with a hundred different thoughts today they would visit the old town with its bazaars and hopefully she would have an opportunity to find out where the residence of princess turkhan was located the door to her room swung open so talitha said with a merry chuckle you have wheedled a trip to the bazaars for us my clever muna you must have indeed pleased kedar last night he came early to my chamber smiling and purring like a wellfed panther to tell me that i would accompany you tell me muna what is your secret with him in all the years i have known kedar he has never been so expansive and so generous she hefted a wellfilled purse in her palm gold dinars muna a purse full of gold dinars from our lord and master to be used by us for our hearts delight what do you do to him skye sat up her cheeks pink with her blushes as talithas frank gaze took in her nude beauty reaching for a cobwebthin pink wool shawl skye said i am only his obedient slave talitha talithas mouth quirked with amusement as skye modestly pulled the shawl about her you are a strange one muna there is an air of mystery about you perhaps it is that which fascinates kedar so very much at any rate thank you for including me in your little adventure we shall be the envy of the entire harem hurry and dress i dont want to waste a minute of this day it has been a long time since i last left this house and i am eager to go as talitha hurried out zada came hurrying in with a tray of food allah only knows when youll eat again she fussed at her mistress i am ravenous skye admitted i am not surprised was the reply the women of the harem say that the lord kedar never stops his lovemaking during the entire night i wonder that you can lift your head from the pillow this morning ohh they are all so jealous of you my lady muna he is going to make you his wife they all say it is so i knew that you would be successful with him she placed the tray upon the little table by the couch skye didnt bother to answer zada for she knew that anything she said would be repeated and embellished upon until her words were totally unrecognizable instead she concentrated upon the meal that her slave woman had brought her there was a lovely polychrome ceramic fezware bowl in white blue and orange that was filled with peeled green figs a matching plate held flat bread hot and fresh from the oven and there was a second bowl with a honeycomb in it a silver goblet studded with lapis was filled with limewater skye ate hungrily and when she had finished she rose allowing zada to wrap her in a gauze robe so she might walk to the baths the slave woman followed carrying her mistresss special soaps and scents zadas black eyes darted back and forth as they moved through the harem fully aware of the envious gazes thrown at skye she puffed out her chest with pride as they moved quickly along feeling enormously pleased with herself for having such an important and beautiful mistress already the servants of the other favored ones were beginning to come to her with little gifts and gossip when the lady muna became the lord kedars wife his only wife zada would be the most influential serving woman in kedars harem she smiled smugly to herself as they entered the bath considering how fortunate she was the baths were empty this early in the morning except for the bath attendants who had been alerted that the lady muna would be bathing and tumbled over themselves in their efforts to serve her lest the masters favorite be displeased skye silently allowed them to do their job and when they had finished with her she thanked them each with a smile then returned to her quarters with zada to dress do not deck me out like an idol she snapped at zada who wanted to run bracelets up and down her arms bering each of her slender fingers and place a fillet dripping with small jewels on her head and forehead you are the chosen of the lord kedar zada protested i am only my lord kedars humble slave skye insisted if you deck me out in every jewel he has given me you will draw attention to me which would displease my master a show of wealth will also encourage the merchants to charge me double zada i would look like all the faceless women in a plain black yashmak zada sighed disappointedly but allowed that the lady muna was probably right and dressed her as she desired when she had finished skye was as anonymous as every other blackgarbed figure in the streets of fez would be the top of the yashmak fell just below her eyebrows and her outdoor veil was securely pinned to it only the barest slit for her eyes was allowed she could have been twenty or eighty the fairest woman alive or the ugliest but no one in the streets of the city would know it are you ready muna talithas voice emerged from an equally wellswathed figure kedar had arranged for them to travel in a curtained litter for it was unthinkable that his women walk to the bazaars skye couldnt resist peeping at the city from behind a corner of the curtains as they moved from kedars house at the top of the ravine down the twisting winding streets to the bottom where the markets of old fez were located she was enchanted by the onearched bridges that spanned the river a contribution of the moors who had settled in fez when driven from spain skye noticed how crowded together the houses were as they descended lower and lower into the most ancient part of the city it was also darker here for it seemed almost impossible for the sun to find a place to slip between so it might shine finally skye let the curtains fall back into place and following talithas lead loosened her face veil what made you want to visit the bazaars talitha asked i dont like being penned up skye said in my land women move about freely i even ride horses i cannot stay in that house all the time else i go mad when our lord kedar asked me last night what he might gift me with i begged him for a day at the bazaars it means more to me than jewels could no wonder you fascinate him muna you are so unusual for a woman there are other european women in our lords harem skye said yes talitha admitted we have girls from provence the languedoc castile naples and genoa but not one of them was from a noble family as you are two are merchants daughters but the rest are peasants and all are used to obedience to higher authority as are the women of the east you however belonged to the higher authority muna i answered to my queen skye said not your king england has no king our queen is a virgin without spouse who rules in her own right incredible talitha exclaimed such a thing would never be allowed here a woman needs a man to answer to else she be unnatural skye almost laughed at talithas outrage there were many who thought elizabeth tudor odd and unnatural before she might comment though the litter was set down with a tiny bump and the curtains drawn aside quickly they refastened their veils as minda carefully helped them out i will escort you and the litter will follow us he said together skye and talitha began walking through the busy and noisy bazaars starting first with the quaisarya the magnificent silk market it was an incredible place and skye was at a loss as to where to look next the stalls were filled to overflowing with a profusion of marvelous silks in a rainbow of jewelbright colors there were plain colors such as scarlet and emerald topaz and sapphire and amethyst and prints deep purple with gold dots crimson with silver black and cream and gauzes shot through with silver and gold and silks in all colors sewn with freshwater pearls and jewel chips it took a while for her to overcome the shock of so much beauty before she could intelligently choose and make her purchases finally she picked a rosecolored silk gauze shot through with silver and a lovely bluegreen that matched her eyes these she would have the harem seamstresses sew into garments for her leaving the quaisarya they moved on down a narrow street visiting the various shops inhabited by gold and silversmiths as they stood admiring bracelets in one of these a handsome young man entered he was as slender as a willow of medium height with fair skin dark curly hair and meltingly soft brown eyes my lord hamal the shopkeeper said hurrying forward i have the earrings that you ordered ready for you good day hamal talitha said skyes heart was hammering wildly there could hardly be two hamals of talithas acquaintance and therefore this had to be kedars younger brother she wanted to scream that she was nialls wife to ask if her husband were alive but she dared not my lady talitha what do you here i did not realize that my brother was in the habit of allowing his women to visit the bazaars or has his harem finally revolted and strangled him talitha laughed you grow more wicked each day hamal tell me that you are not truly happy with the princess hamal grinned boyishly i am happy talitha although i doubt that when kedar sold me to her he meant it to be so who is this shy creature hiding behind you this is muna your brothers new favorite and rumored to become his wife soon we would not be here but that she pleases him so he allows her to visit the bazaars hamals eyes flicked casually over skye so kedar finally thinks to take himself a wife i cannot imagine my brother caught by that most tender of passions yet if you say it then i must believe it what is your secret lady muna how did you capture my brothers cold heart pay no heed to talitha my lord skye said softly she but teases you with harem gossip i am naught but my lord kedars humble slave nothing more where do you come from my lady your speech is that of my friend ashur who is a favorite of my princess there are no men named ashur in my land my lord hamal smiled pleasantly ashur is the name that my princess has given him it means strong and warlike one the name he bore in his own land was niall burke then we are indeed from the same land my lord hamal the name i bore in our homeland was skye excuse me my lord the goldsmith interrupted but are the earrings satisfactory as always yusef hamal said graciously as he examined them your work borders on genius the earrings are perfect and princess turkhan will love them reaching into his robes he drew out his purse and paid for his purchase then he turned back to the two women we will meet again soon my ladies he said and bowing he went from the shop it was all skye could do not to run after him and beg for news of niall obviously he was still alive from what hamal had said at least she had that and hamals promise that he would see her soon he is quite different from our lord kedar skye remarked to talitha yes talitha said it is strange to think that they come from the same mother and yet they do if kedar is fierce and strong then hamal is gentle and tender still they are brothers is lord hamal married to a princess skye asked innocently talitha laughed no kedar sold his brother to the princess when the boy was fifteen it is an odd situation muna the princess is the daughter of the sultan in istanbul and as men keep a harem of women she keeps one of men skye pretended to be shocked why talitha that is as outrageous to me as my queen is to you she said talitha laughed again i suppose it is all in the eye of the beholder she said goodnaturedly do you see anything that you like here yes skye said and she bought a beautiful gold aigret holder with three perfect white feathers the gold studded in small sapphires for my lord kedar to thank him for this day she said sweetly they moved on to the street of the cobblers and spent a good deal of time trying on slippers of various styles finally settling on several pairs each when the voice of the muzzin sounded from the topmost pinnacle of the qarawiyin mosque they knew it was midday and like everyone else in fez they fell to their knees facing east for the prayer period upon rising both skye and talitha admitted to hunger and minda purchased small hot lamb kebobs from a street vendor for them they ate the kebobs greedily licking the last bit of tasty grease from their fingers while minda bought water from another vendor for them to drink and sweet dough balls deep fried and then dipped in honey and chopped almonds for a treat for another hour or so they wandered happily through the open markets and skye was fascinated by everything she saw beneath gaily striped awnings sat the street merchants their merchandise spread out before them for all to see farmers from the surrounding countryside came with their produce the various fruits and vegetables piled high others had cages and pens of live animals and poultry for sale there were rug merchants copper and brass smiths with trays and bowls and lamps leather goods from the tanners and cloth merchants with their silks cottons velvets wools and gauzes blowing in the afternoon breeze there were horse traders and slave merchants skye watched frightened and sad as a fairskinned girl with long blond hair was sold to a fat man with the tiny eyes of a boar who pinched and prodded her mercilessly before finally making his purchase tears rolling down her face the girl was led away let us go back skye said quietly her joy in this short day of freedom totally spoiled it is the way here talitha said let that scene remind you how fortunate you are we are among the privileged slaves that poor girl was just bought by a local brothelkeeper how can you know that skye was saddened even further for the blond girl i do not for sure of course but i recognize the breed from my younger days i can bear no more skye said and turning she climbed back into the litter so that is your weakness talitha remarked as she joined her and pulled the curtains shut do not let the others in the harem see that you are so softhearted muna they will use it against you nothing would please them more than to destroy you you do not want to destroy me talitha i do not seek to catch the lord kedars attention i have had enough of that in my youth i am content to rule his harem for him and enjoy my daughters as they returned to kedars home high above the old city skye took the opportunity to find out where the princess lived turkhan it seemed was no different from all the other wealthy people in fez having a large pink palace in the newer part of the city but some distance from kedar they arrived back safely and minda escorted them to the enclosure of the harem which was surprisingly quiet and empty but for serving women and the children ha talitha said with wisdom born of long experience i will wager he is in the mares meadow muna quickly let us go to your room and we shall see puzzled skye followed talitha to her chamber where they found zada peering eagerly through the latticework what is it what are you watching skye demanded of her servant zada turned her brown eyes large in the meadow below she said low the master and his women you could have gone talitha said amused it is not forbidden for pretty servants to join in the sport held in the mares meadow zada i would not go unless i had my mistresss permission lady talitha what a loyal child she is talitha remarked further amused come muna and see what games our lord kedar plays today they moved to the latticecovered windows and looked down skye caught her breath in shock below her the mares meadow a wellclipped green lawn dotted with trees was filled with the women of kedars harem all were naked and posed upon all fours their hair had been bound up and to each womans head was attached a curved polished brass headpiece from which flowed a horses mane a narrow gilt belt encircled each woman just below the belly and at the base of their spines thrust forth a polished brass holder from which sprang a matching and stiffly arched horses tail kedar was garbed in the same oudandish equipment but as the women stood still as if mares browsing he in his role of stallion moved among them mounting them from the rear and thrusting into them the women giggled as finishing with one he snorted and whinnied trumphantly as would a great stud stallion he then moved on to another of his mares his erection still plainly eager skye turned away embarrassed by the tableau below her talitha laughed softly you do not like his games muna the eunuchs bet among themselves as to which woman will cause him to spill his seed before skye might reply dagan entered her room saying i was given orders by my lord kedar that you and the lady talitha were to join him in the mares meadow if you returned in time i have brought your things he placed two sets of manes and tails on a table go and fetch a third for zada talitha commanded and with a grin dagan left the room i cant skye protested if you refuse him it will be the bastinado and afterward he will think up some particularly bestial delight to shame you with before the other women muna do not think because he considers making you his wife that he will be one bit more lenient with you kedar will not be disobeyed and you know it he will use me before them all skye said low and she began to tremble yes talitha said refusing to coddle her he will take you before them all and if you cry and shake you will give the other women a weapon that they will delight in using against you like all men skilled in the sensual kedar enjoys occasional perversions show distaste for his little game in the mares meadow and those few women he owns who keep his interest only by their skill at perversion will think up delights that will have you screaming in your dreams for months to come skye drew a deep breath in and said i will go and i will somehow manage not to show my revulsion at the situation good talitha encouraged her remember you have what all those bitches wish they had he cares for you i even believe that if kedar were capable of love he would love you make him proud and show them that you are his true mate his true mate the words reminded her of osman that he had once believed that niall was her true mate was niall forced to submit to such degradation as princess turkhans favorite as she was forced to here in kedars harem skye pushed the troubled thoughts from her mind she had at last met hamal and she was confident that he would shortly contact her and arrange theirher and niallsescape from fez in the meantime she must concentrate on getting through the rest of the afternoon quickly she removed her clothing skye stood silent and still as zada did up her hair and talithas and helped them with the headpieces she watched the other woman as she affixed the belt with the horses tail and then copied her by putting on her own the mane and tail were a silky ebony black and shone quite effectively against her gardeniawhite skin mischievously talitha tossed her golden mane which complimented her own golden beauty any eunuch who bets against you will lose his dinars she remarked yet i wonder if kedar can contain his lust until he is in you hush skye scolded her suddenly seeing the humorous side of the situation she began to giggle talitha chuckled back at her i know just what you are thinking muna you are aware that men can be fools are you not yes came the reply now be silent lest i disgrace myself with a fit of laughter down there which i can assure you will be far worse than if i trembled and wept dagan returned with a headpiece and tail for zada who had torn off her clothing in her eagerness they waited the few minutes it took the slave girl to prepare and then followed dagan downstairs and outside to the mares meadow go into the center of the meadow and i will tell the master that you have come dagan whispered the three women picked their way through the others and reaching the center of the green lawn they knelt down on all fours talitha had a rather bored look upon her face she had done this allah only knew how many times before and it all seemed rather silly to her kedar visited her couch often enough to keep her from being totally frustrated for she had been his first woman and he still found her rather attractive and exciting she had never fawned over him like the others and he found her elusiveness intriguing zada on the other hand was trembling with excitement at the thought that the master might honor her she was not a virgin but it had been some time since she had had a man although dagan liked to fondle her and push his supple fingers into her until she whimpered with pleasure it wasnt the same however as having a real mans weapon shoved up inside you zada thought and prayed that she would be fortunate skye simply knelt resigned to the fact that kedar meant to have her else they would not have been called to the meadow at least the grass felt cool beneath her hands and knees she heard a horse whinny near her and then zada gasped turning her head just slightly for a moment skye saw kedar mounted upon her servant pounding hard into her zadas face was a study in pure bliss and skye turned away ashamed that women could be driven to welcome such degradation with a moan that could only be described as rapturous zada collapsed into the lawn and kedar moved on to enjoy talitha a small boy eunuch hurried along with the master wiping the spendings from his encounter away with a soft cloth moistened in rosewater finishing just as they reached talitha kedar circled the kneeling woman snorting and pawing talitha responded by pretending to shy away with a nervous little nicker with a grin kedar pounced upon her thrusting quickly back and forth until she too collapsed with a little shriek the little eunuch swiftly refreshed his master and then kedars eyes swept to skye she braced herself discreetly for his assault as with talitha he first circled her and unable to help herself skye shifted nervously on the grass kedar snorted an equine warning and moved closer nuzzling at her bottom causing her to start warily his big hands now closed over her hips and she felt his hardness beginning to prod at her she tensed remembering her first husband who had punished her when it pleased him by forcing her in the greek fashion but kedar was not interested in loving her as he might a boy with unerring skill he found her womans passage and drove deeply into her slowly he began to move back and forth within her growing more excited as the moments passed she knew she could not remain passive and please him and so she began to tighten her vaginal muscles about him teasingly nipping at him with the devils bite with a growl he pushed her down upon the grass and bit at her neck vixen he murmured and then his passion burst within her they lay sandwiched together for some moments and then he whispered in her ear i waited all afternoon for you to return so i might have you my jewel you have spoiled me for the others you beautiful bitch i am only satisfied by you her heart was still hammering wildly but she knew that she was expected to respond to such ardor what a wonderful day you have given me my lord first the bazaars and now your loving i am the most fortunate of women you do not mind that i have taken you before the others i prefer that our love be between us alone my lord but i am not ashamed to show it before the others you will however make them even more envious of me than they already are he rolled off of her and standing up pulled her up with him his arm was wrapped tightly about her waist her breasts pushing against his side she looked up at him her sapphire eyes never wavering and kedar wanted to ravish her once more where they stood she excited him so the day is not yet ended my jewel he murmured and bent to kiss her slowly and tenderly i adore you my fair muna he said low and then releasing her called to the others the games are ended my pets return to the harem all of you but talitha and muna the women began trooping back into the house while the young eunuch sponged down his master with rosewater and dagan and minda removed the trappings of the games from talitha and muna they then loosed the womens hair and after brushing it out took a small portion of it from the center of their heads and braided it with a strand of small pearls kedar put an arm around both of his favorites and they began to walk slowly back to his quarters it seemed not to bother him that they were all nude you have both pleased me greatly of late he said expansively and so i have a special treat for you today while you shopped in the bazaars i had a visit from my brother hamal he brought with him an invitation to dinner at princess turkhans palace the princess it seems has become interested in expanding her own trading empire right now she sends her goods to the coast via the services of others but hamal has convinced her that she should save a great deal of money if she had her own caravans i would not have thought that my brother had a head for business but it seems that he may he has told her that if she would send her own people to the coast to buy and sell then i am the best man to speak with about it two days from now i am invited and of course if i go for the evening meal then i am also invited to remain the night for it would be too dangerous to travel the streets after dark the invitation allows that i may bring two of my favorites with me to make my night a pleasant and happy one i have chosen you two talitha and muna my lord kedar talitha quickly spoke up how generous you are skyes heart was pounding wildly but she controlled herself so she might speak her gratitude also my lord kedar we are unworthy of such pleasure how can we thank you he stopped and smiling down into her upturned face said by giving me a preview tonight of the pleasures you will give me two nights from now you and talitha are perfectly matched with your white and gold skins it would give me great pleasure to see you make love to each other before i take you both for a moment skye thought she had not heard him right and then realizing that she had the world began to crumble about her she was tumbling back through the years to a time when she had surprised her first husband in an incestuous act with his sister claire and they had seen her caught her and raped her she had had a horror of any intimacy with a woman since then it had been months in fact before she could even let her maid touch her now she was being faced with the thing in the world she feared most talitha saw her turn her white face and sensed instantly that something was very wrong my lord kedar she said you know that i would not spoil your pleasure for the world but i do not believe that muna has ever made love with another woman she is apt to be clumsy at first unless of course you will excuse us for the next two days so i may school her to please you it will be well worth the wait i promise you she tempted him and then bent and bit at his shoulder in a provocative manner looking up teasingly at him from beneath her thick lashes did the girl you took before you delighted me this afternoon please you she is munas maidservant and really quite mad for you my lord she would keep you amused this night i vow kedar licked his lips in anticipation he was disappointed but he knew that talitha was right it would be better if muna had some knowledge of what would be required of her and the little berber savage had been a hot piece she might prove an enjoyable onenight diversion very well he growled but see you teach her well talitha he gave them each an affectionate pat on their bare bottoms go to your own quarters and send the berber girl to me of course my lord immediately talitha murmured soothingly and grasping skyes hand firmly she hurried her off before kedar could change his mind i cant do it skye protested as they reentered the harem i simply cannot do it you do not have a choice muna i saw how horrified you were and so i rescued you before you did something foolish like refuse kedar i know it still chafes at you having once been a free woman but you are no longer free kedar has the power of life and death over you and you know that he is not an easy man if he desires that we make love together for his amusement then you have no choice but to obey him do not worry i will show you what to do and it will not be so terrible i promise you no skye said i would rather die they had reached skyes chamber and talitha pulled her into the room commanding zada as she did so the master desires your company fortunate one hurry lest you keep him waiting and displease him with a little cry of delight zada ran from the room and talitha turned back to skye have you gone mad she snapped at her if it pleased kedar to kill you he would do it so painfully that your last hours would seem like years are your childish scruples worth that muna once skye said in a small tight voice once long ago a woman forced me and i wanted to die for the shame talitha sighed so that was it muna had been raped by a woman at one time in her life it wont be rape between us muna it will be two friends seeking to give each other gentle pleasures and nothing more we are friends arent we i cannot do it skye whispered you have to was the equally adamant reply come talitha put an arm about skye who instantly stiffened with alarm you will have to overcome your fears at least to kedars eye what we do means nothing muna please try what will it be skye asked no more than a little kissing and caressing muna not really so awful let us sit down and i will show you what is expected of us she drew skye over to a low divan and together they sat down amid the brightly colored cushions gently talitha began to caress skye and it was all skye could do not to scream with her revulsion it was not that she disliked talitha but the memory of claire oflahertys bestial abuse of her kept leaping to mind she began to weep soundlessly and seeing her tears talitha kissed them tenderly away there my lovely friend dont weep it is not so awful is it women are far more considerate lovers than men muna she continued to speak gently to skye for some minutes all the while kissing and caressing her skye steeled herself against her embarrassment and distaste finally admitting to herself that there simply was no other way if she was to survive if she and niall were to escape safely from fez she must accept even this talitha now began to instruct her as to what she must do and without further protest skye obeyed her friend only when they lay stretched out together on the cushions and talitha lowered her head to kiss skyes venus mont did skye resist once more oh no talitha please not there talitha pushed skyes hands away and with a sigh skye ceased her outcry forcing her mind to think only of niall burke finally talitha said there now that was not so awful and you were fine muna tomorrow we will practice a little more and you must participate fully then talitha i can force myself to stay still when you kiss and touch me intimately but i will not be aggressive with you i cannot it is not my nature i think women loving women is an unnatural thing for some women it is the preferred way muna not for me skye replied not ever you prefer kedar i prefer a mans touch talitha laughed at the way skye had avoided her question but held her peace let us eat the evening meal together after we visit the baths she said from the look in kedars eye your zada will not be back until morning and i will wager he shortly sends for others too you would think that his little games in the mares meadow would exhaust him but such things seem to increase his appetite rather than diminish it it was a relief to skye that after their initial session of lovemaking talitha returned to her normal self uncomfortable as she was she believed that now she had met and identified herself to young hamal her stay in fez would soon be at an end then she and niall would be free and returning to ireland to their children and a normal life she wondered if she would see niall when she visited princess turkhans palace in two days more than likely he would remain incarcerated behind the harem walls and she would be kept locked with talitha in a guest apartment they would be so close and yet separated but not for long skye whispered to herself not for long my love what is it you say muna talitha inquired of her what skye was drawn sharply from her reverie you said something just now talitha repeated i did skye shook her head i cannot remember she said and so obviously it was not important not important at all chapter hamal led niall burke into the large gardens that were a part of princess turkhans estate in fez the gardens were the only place where the two men might speak without being overheard no one followed them to listen for hamal was the most trusted of the princesss slaves and of late his companion had been far easier to manage they strolled along a path of carefully raked marble chips lined by tall fragrant cedar trees ahead of them was a rose garden filled with brightly colored flowers the sight of it reminded niall of skye a thought he pushed from his mind he could not afford to weaken now did your wife ever speak of her friend in algiers osman the astrologer hamal asked him suddenly and niall stopped in midstride yes he said hesitantly why do you ask me osman is my uncle ashur last year he came to fez which is his native city in order to teach for a few months at the university we spoke of you and my uncle recognized who you were immediately we decided then that you must be helped to escape do not cry out my friend but your wife is here in fez she is a brave woman and from the moment she learned that you lived nothing would do but that she free you where is she nialls pulses were racing madly in the house of my brother kedar hamal said she has brought a ransom large enough to tempt the princess have you heard nothing we have told you these past months ashur there is no ransom ido not understand then niall replied your wife has come to fez in order to encourage you in your escape from the princess she could only enter the city as the member of a fasi household so she and my uncle osman devised a plan wherein she would pretend to be a slave girl and he would present her to my brother kedar when he made his yearly visit to algiers this was done and your wife came to fez as a slave named muna in the harem of my brother kedar christs bloody bones the oath exploded from nialls mouth without warning and hamal looked nervously about him be silent ashur he begged the big man do you not realize the danger we are all in because of this plot if turkhan learns what i have done we will both die never matter that she loves us think of your wife too tis precisely what i am thinking of hamal for i am no fool to believe that a man who would sell his own brother into slavery would bring my wife to fez out of the goodness of his heart kedar is not in on this little game is he no hamal replied low he believes her a slave and has used her as such she has in fact become his favorite and there is talk that he will make her his only wife i had planned to wait a little while longer in hopes that he would grow bored with her but he grows more enamored of her with every day that passes we no longer have the luxury of time the little fool he muttered low tis just the sort of thing that skye would do to come after me he smiled softly wait until you see her hamal she is the most beautiful woman ever created and of even greater import is her spirit her spirit is unconquerable she is a great and gallant lady my skye she would have to have a strong spirit to survive with my brother kedar is not an easy man hamal replied i spoke with your skye two days ago in the shop of yusef the goldsmith how beautiful she is though i could not tell she was properly muffled in a black yashmak we will see her and my brother tonight ashur whatniall was surprised turkhan has decided to expand her trading empire has asked my brother kedar to come for the evening meal he is allowed to bring with him two women and i expect that your wife will be one of those women they will stay the night and then in the morning kedar and the princess will discuss business is there any chance that i can speak with her nialls voice was hopeful no ashur my friend there is no hope that you may speak with one another turkhan would be furious should any lovely woman speak to you and kedar is a fiercely jealous man he put a friendly hand upon nialls arm you will have to be very brave my friend it will not be easy to sit calmly paying court to turkhan while kedar is cared for by your wife how can i possibly behave normally seeing my wife in the hands of your brother hamal you have children do you not my friend think of them if you will not think of yourself and your wife would you orphan the babes who cannot remember you would you deny them both their parents your wife must bear you a great love to have dared this deception how often have you told me of the insurmountable obstacles that you and your skye overcame in order to be together before you destroy the small chance you have of being together once again think of what she has gone through for you and do not let her sacrifice be a vain one ashur niall sighed why are you helping me hamal is it merely so you may have turkhan to yourself again hamal smiled at the question you are the first serious rival i have had for turkhans affections ashur none of the others mean anything to her they are passing fancies toys simple amusements you however are a different animal i am not afraid of you for i know that your heart is elsewhere and always will be even if you are forced to spend the rest of your life among us were i certain that i might have rid myself of you by the usual harem means i would have but had any harm befallen you i would have been under immediate suspicion though you know it not i have twice saved your life turkhans pretty pets are a jealous lot my friend i love turkhan and i always have although kedar does not know it i went out of my way to bring myself to turkhans attention three years ago in the beginning i saw becoming her favorite as a means to gain my own place in this world kedar would never have shared our fathers wealth with me and had i allowed him to see how really intelligent i am he would have kept me beneath his thumb for all my days i would have never been really free when i came to the princess i intended to work my way into her favor and eventually gain control of her wealth for myself i am in truth the product of my brothers upbringing but i had had very little experience with women other than stolen kisses and fondlings of the slave girls in kedars house i was a virgin when i arrived in turkhans bed a fifteenyearold boy who despite his outward face of confidence was in actuality quite terrified what if i failed her and she sent me from her forever she was nineteen then and very experienced experienced enough to know that i was untutored she was gentle and kind ashur she taught me to make love as the turks make love and i began to gain skill and faith in myself i also fell genuinely in love with turkhan i still mean to have her wealth and to run her trading empire my time is almost near ashur for when you leave her she will be devastated and turn to me for comfort then i will act and become a free man once more rid turkhan of her harem and make her my wife that is how it should be i will never take other women into my life for she is all the woman i ever want but i must be all the man she wants niall looked at hamal with new respect until this moment he had believed him just a soft and kindhearted boy now he knew better and it frankly surprised him how will you help us to escape he said coming directly to the point hamal spoke in a controlled voice it will take a few more weeks to complete my arrangements but i plan that turkhan shall insist that kedar escort her personally from here to algiers through the taza corridor so the princess may see the route herself and visit the port city that is when you and your wife shall both escape for i am certain neither the princess nor my brother will travel without their favorites niall could feel himself trembling with excitement hamal made it sound so simple so easy how could he wait a few more weeks his heart beat erratically and he drew several deep breaths to calm himself i think that i need some of rabis special brew he said to hamal i am as eager as a virgin for her bridegroom yes hamal answered you must not betray us ashur by any unduc show of enthusiasm let us return to the palace now and seek out rabi and her sherbets they will soothe you and take the edge from your excitement we will speak again and i will fill in all the details that you must know back within his own chambers niall eagerly downed the special fruit sherbet that old rabi had made for him his hands trembling as they clutched at the cup skye tonight he would see skye she knew that he lived and she had brave and bonny lass that she was come to aid him gods bones how he loved her rabi noted his mood and commented how excitable you are today ashur what has made you so hamal tells me that his brother will be visiting the princess tonight and that we are going to be allowed to have the evening meal with them i am excited that my lady turkhan trusts me enough to allow me such an honor i am also curious to see the brother of my friend rabi cackled and standing above him stroked his dark hair in a motherly fashion indeed my handsome charge you are being allowed a very special privilege not only will hamals brother be there but his two beautiful favorites as well they cannot possibly rival my princess for beauty niall said quickly rabi cackled again this time with delight you are falling in love with her ashur it is good it is good the old woman lowered her voice and spoke confidentially please her and you will soon control her give her a child and you will be master of this harem your fortune will be made ashur and not even the gentle hamal will surpass you in power she patted his arm nodding wisely rest now my big one and i will call you in time he didnt argue sleeping easily for several hours before rabi woke him and hurried him off to the baths there he allowed the elderly women who served as bath attendants to wash him all the while enduring the hostile stares of the other young men in the harem turkhan kept about twenty males in addition to hamal and himself most were of mideastern extraction but the princess did have a redhaired venetian two greeks a blond and overmuscled young swedish boy who like niall had been taken from a galley a surly russian and two slender blacks from the forests to the far south that they were jealous of him was very apparent since niall had arrived the princess had spent much time with him at their expense they refrained from any open action now because they had already tried once to teach this upstart his place only to have been badly mauled by the infuriated niall they had also been whipped by their furious mistress and threatened with being sold off more subtle means had been blocked by hamal who after their second attempt at poisoning niall had threatened to tell turkhan if it happened again that would mean an excruciatingly painful death and none was willing to risk that so the men of the princesss harem vented their frustration on niall through verbal means how does an irishman fuck one of the greeks said like a pig the other answered no my friend pork is forbidden a true believer and our fair princess is a true believer then he must fuck like the dog he is a darkeyed egyptian said niall smiled pleasantly at the group of men i thought that only greeks fucked each other like the dogs they are he said as for the rest of you and he looked mockingly at them youve nothing left to fuck with impotent eunuchs that you are no wonder that turkhan prefers only hamal and myself hell my infant son had a bigger pizzle than any of you have if it werent for the potion that old witch gives you ashur you wouldnt even be able to get it up the venetian snarled rabis potion but gives me extra strength to please my princess with ibrahim pity youll never again have the chance then with another smile he walked out of the baths leaving the others behind to fume with a rage they couldnt exhibit lest they anger their mistress staring after niall admiringly the old bath women chuckled with glee at the exchange rabi was awaiting him and carefully rubbed musk oil into his sunbronzed skin until it gleamed and shone with a rich color niall enjoyed sunning himself in the gardens and the dark tan he had now achieved only made his marvelous silvergray eyes more silvery he walked and swam regularly which had kept him from growing fat like several of the harem men who were content to loll about but his big slender body was of late growing a trifle too lean for his appetite had fallen off still his bronze skin dark hair and silvery eyes combined with his basically sound body to insure his good looks rabi handed him balloonlegged white silk pantaloons the ankles embroidered with threeinch bands of gold threads small pearls and rubies about his waist was fitted a belt of gilt leather six inches wide its rectangular buckle studded with rubies nialls feet were shod in gold leather slippers with turnedup toes and about his neck was hung a heavy gold chain with a heartshaped pendant carved from a large dark red ruby that lay upon his bare chest upon both of his upper arms the old woman clasped wide gold arm bands niall felt somewhat ridiculous outfitted as he was but he knew that it was the fashion here in fez as much as horsehair padding was in the clothing of european men at the courts of england spain and france sipping at the sweet grape sherbet that rabi had given him he wondered if skye would laugh when she saw him but then he considered what she would be wearing and felt his anger rise for a moment only to slide away there was nothing that he could do about it soonsoon they would be together again and all would be as it once had been you are the handsomest man i have ever seen rabi said admiringly as she brushed musk into nialls dark wavy hair they are a handsome pair remarked selwa the female eunuch who attended to hamal look to my little lamb rabi is he not magnificent tonight hamal grinned sheepishly as he burlesqued a twirl he was as exquisitely garbed as niall but his pantaloons were of midnight blue silk the ankle bands embroidered in silver and studded with tiny diamonds and sapphires about his neck hung a silver chain with an incredibly opulent pendant a quarter moon carved from a single enormous diamond with a long sapphire star hanging above it his belt and his slippers were of silvered leather both studded with sapphires and diamonds hamal was as fair of skin as niall was bronzed with the sun for fasi men of the upper classes abhorred sun on their skins thinking it a mark of the peasants come ashur hamal said we cannot be late as kedar is always on time he grinned mischievously at the two old women as they departed the chamber have a delightful evening torturing the other women as to the failure of their charges he teased selwa and rabi and they chortled gleefully indicating that was exactly what they intended to do is she here niall asked hamal nervously yes was the short reply but you must remember ashur that you can show no recognition of your wife whatever happens you must show nothing except devotion to turkhan my brother is very very possessive of his muna let him catch you in so much as a glance and he will destroy you himself if either of you betrays the other i can do nothing to help you nor will i even attempt to aid you if you will not think of yourself you must think of her niall nodded i understand my friend but you must promise not to be jealous of me tonight i shall dedicate myself to the princess and make her the happiest of women do not hurt her ashur hamals soft brown eyes were filled with concern how can i avoid hurting her hamal if i am to succeed in our plan i must appear to be totally enamored of her she must be completely certain of me hamal do not fret my young friend it has been my experience that womens hearts may be bruised but they are seldom broken she will appreciate you far more having been betrayed by me hamal sighed with regret but he knew that his companion spoke the truth better ashur love turkhan well before he made good his escape turkhan would be furious that something she desired did not after all desire her but the time had come for him to make his move his princess must begin to behave like the woman she was instead of a spoiled tyrant she might be an ottoman princess and have more freedom than any other woman save the sultans mother but she was still a woman sultan selim ii was at fault for allowing turkhan to remain unmarried hamal smiled to himself he would soon change all of that they had reached the dining chamber a lovely rectangular room with halftiled walls of sky blue and white above which rose rough whiteplaster walls the dark ceiling beams were intricately carved and the widebeamed floors were covered in thick wool rugs woven in a medallion design of gold and deep blue on a dark red background they entered the room by walking down two steps two low polished ebony tables had been set directly opposite the entry behind which lay a number of brightly colored cushions in silk wool and cotton the room was lit by large wall torches that had been fitted into carved golden holders in each corner of the room stood tall gold censers burning pungent incense and in the center of each table was a low crystal vase filled with fragrant pink lilies turkhan had reached the room only a moment before the two men and aiming she cried out with delight at their costumes you are magnificent both of you she purred with approval and you my princess niall murmured almost reverently fill my eyes with such incredible and flawless beauty that i am struck blind by the sight turkhan colored in surprise why ashur she said softly you are beginning to speak like a persian poet hamal shifted uncomfortably he thought that turkhan was behaving like a young girl she was almost simpering then he realized that he was jealous ashlars very flattering remark had pleased her before he might even comment he suddenly realized that ashur had been not jesting when he warned him not to be jealous of him this evening turkhan did not notice her young favorites quiet mood let us seat ourselves before my guest and his women arrive she said garbed in a cloth of silver djellabah whose deep v neckline and wide sleeves were embroidered with small black pearls and pink sapphires she was looking quite beautiful this night her redgold hair was dressed in two long narrow braids that were looped up on either side of her face and a long cape of hair that had been dusted with diamond dust streamed down her back from her dainty ears hung pink sapphires set in silver are my brothers women to join us hamal inquired curiously it did not seem fair that i deny him their company as i have yours my lamb turkhan said have you seen them turkhan laughed how well you know me hamal yes i watched them through the peephole in their quarters both are quite lovely tonight if you are very good my darlings we shall watch the unsuspecting kedar as he makes love to his women i am told that he is considered a highly skilled lover perhaps you will both learn something from him that will please me she teased them niall felt a chill sweep over him you have a secret peephole in the guest quarters he asked turkhan laughed of course i do my grandmother khurrem said that such things were invaluable when you wish to know more about a guest than they wish to reveal suddenly the princesss eunuch majordomo announced the lord kedar my princess turkhan looked lazily up from beneath her thick black lashes as kedar and his women entered the room you are welcome to my house kedar ibn omar she said pray be seated so the meal may begin i am honored by your invitation highness i hope that i may be of assistance to you kedar seated himself and impatiently waved skye and talitha to their seats one on either side of him with a swift look skye saw niall on one side of the princess her heart leapt almost painfully within her chest for he did not look well quickly she lowered her eyes lest anyone see her anger at the proprietary way in which turkhan openly caressed niall you would not be here in my house kedar were i not sure that you could be of assistance to me turkhan said sharply your brother has assured me that your knowledge of trading routes to the coast exceeds that of anyone else in fez hamal has always been trustworthy kedar felt a surge of impotent anger sweep over him at her bold words that a mere woman could speak to him in such a tone infuriated him ottoman princess or no if he had her in his power for even a single night he would have her tamed and begging for mercy instead he was forced to give a pleasant reply but both hamal and turkhan had seen the quick anger that had flashed for a moment in his eyes i am pleased that my young brother is such a source of joy to you highness i raised him myself turkhan smiled sweetly but there was a triumphant look in her eyes that kedar did not miss and he ground his teeth in frustration seeing that her master was incensed talitha leaned forward took the cup that had been placed before him and held it to his lips drink my lord she said and then in a lower tone you cannot offend the princess my lord calm yourself i beg of you kedar turned to look at talitha and he nodded his agreement he took the cup and drank a long draught of the icy and tart lemon water you are wise talitha he said with a wisdom that matches your beauty his hazel eyes scanned her and the anger drained away she was most beautiful this evening and her costume extremely flattering and pleasing to his eye she was garbed all in sheer palegold silk her pantaloons were edged at the ankles in tiny sparkling topaz which matched the topaz sewn to her clothofgold hip sash and her satin bolero she wore a longsleeved blouse with a soft open neckline that matched her seethrough pantaloons a headdress of gold chains and twinkling topaz formed a fitted cap over her shortcropped curb she was everything that a woman should be and kedar was delighted with her for he felt she brought honor upon him a leg of baby lamb was brought out and offered to them next followed saffron rice artichokes in olive oil and tarragon vinegar haunch of young gazelle in raisin sauce pigeon pie capon with lemon and new peas with small onions a platter of sizzling kebobs made of kid green peppers and small onions was passed and blue and white fezware bowls of yogurt and purple and green olives were set upon each table you will forgive the simplicity of the meal turkhan said a wellcooked meal is never simple kedar replied and your cook prepares well he opened his mouth to take the piece of lamb that muna was feeding him he was feeling expansive now and with the constant attentions of his women at less of a disadvantage he beamed benevolently at muna her garbor lack of itwas as pleasing to him as was the elegance of talitha muna wore diaphanous blushpink pantaloons with pearl ankle bands her hip sash was of pink and silver stripes and above the waist she was nude her small perfect breasts their nipples stained with carmine thrust forward proudly her waistlength hair was loose held only with a narrow silver band at her forehead for a moment kedars eyes lingered on munas breasts and he thought of the pleasure she had given him over these last few months of the pleasure she would give him this night skyes eyes again stole across the room to feast for a brief moment upon niall she knew that he must be feeling foolish in his eastern dress and she wished she could tell him how magnificent he appeared with his tanned chest he looked thinner and she wondered if he was getting enough to eat then chided herself for a fool if only he would look at her instead of paying such outrageous attention to the redhaired princess skye thought if her husband touched turkhan with another intimate touch or gave her one more secret smile that she was going to throw herself across the room and strangle the smug bitch kedars voice snapped her back to her role the princess sets a satisfactory table but i should far rather feast upon your flesh my jewel his voice was husky with desire she raised her sapphire eyes to him and smiled a slow and seductive smile would you shame me before that woman my lord she murmured low i am for your pleasure only and not the eyes of prying voyeurs my lord her red mouth pouted adorably and kedar wanted her desperately her pure female fragrance wafted up at him and he grew dizzy thinking of what it felt like to be deep inside of her niall burke stared for a second at his wife and ground his teeth silently as kedar fondled her with a familiar hand in his mind he had accepted what skye had done in order to reach him but accepting the fact was far different from watching the reality hamals brother was an attractive man and obviously a potent one he openly handled skye with the pleasure of a man who is fond of his favorite possession and she seemed to enjoy it she smiled seductively at him and murmured in a low musical voice words that could not be distinguished niall wanted to leap the distance between himself and kedar so he might stick a knife into the bastards gullet you are deep in thought ashur turkhans voice brought him back i dream of tonight if i dare my princess he touched her face with the back of his hand smoothing it over her soft skin tonight she whispered conspiratorially we shall spy upon our guest the three of us and then we shall all play together my glorious one i shall exceed your dreams ashur my beloved boldly niall leaned forward and kissed her upturned mouth quickly your pardon my princess but i could not resist turkhan laughed shakily and tapped his cheek with a long sharp nail in mock chastisement then she turned to kedar which of these women is the one hamal tells me your uncle in algiers gave you she asked him you may present yourself to the princess kedar said to skye she arose gracefully walked across the floor and fell to her knees in total obedience highness i am muna she said her head bowed to the floor her body bent stand up so i may see you girl you are reputed to be most fair but how can i tell when you are in that position skye stood up and posed tall and proud before princess turkhan her chin was high her silken hair flowing about her like a dark cape her beautiful eyes however were lowered lest she offend her hostess turkhan let her glance slide critically over the woman who stood before her that she was extravagantly beautiful was irritatingly obvious her wellshaped limbs were quite visible through the gossamer of her pantaloons and turkhan could see that she was finely made where did your uncle obtain such a prize she demanded of kedar she was a captive in algiers highness he answered it was by chance he saw her and knew that she would please me which she well does you have trained her that quickly she is of noble birth in her own land and really quite intelligent kedar replied they spoke about skye as if she were not even in the room or worse were an inanimate object and as they blithely continued to discuss her fine points skye let her eyes stray to niall once more her heart struggled within her as he stared directly back at her his silvery eyes bright with his longing she felt tears pricking behind her eyes and she fought furiously to keep them from showing niall she cried his name silently dear god he thought how can she be so very beautiful despite everything oh sweetheart i want you so much if only they might make good their escape this very minute instead he would be forced to watch while another man made love to his wife if that didnt drive him mad then nothing ever would i love you skye he said in his heart kedar was holding forth each one of my women has a weakness highness it is always useful to discover what form of pain terrifies i would never whip muna even with a carefully plied lash for just look at her skin turn my jewel and let the princess see skye moved obediently dragging her eyes reluctantly away from niall you see highness the skin is flawless it would be a crime against allah himself to destroy such beauty wantonly and yet still a deterrent is needed in munas case it is the bastinado she does not like the bastinadodo you my jewel no my lord skye whispered you have used it on her turkhan was interested have you ever known a willing captive kedar remarked in munas case i must admit that she was a trifle reluctant but of course that is no longer sois it my jewel thou sayest my lord skye replied i prefer the use of opiates and hashish myself turkhan said to use physical force upon a slave is an admission of having lost control she looked at skye casually you may return to your master girl now my beautiful ashur was not easy at allwere you my handsome one until recently he fought me at every turn but then he finally accepted his fate he has been my joy ever since a man that powerful could be dangerous highness kedar said better he were in the mines or sat upon an oarsmans bench in a galley i wonder that you keep such a creature about ashur illustrates my point perfectly kedar i have never physically mistreated him i have not had to for my sherbet and special comfits keep him totally under control if you do not believe me then ask your brother why even bother to argue the point further hamal said you both have your methods and they work for you you are content with muna my brother and you with ashur my princess he smiled his sweet smile at both of them kedar he continued will you speak a little to my princess of the trading routes that you use when going to the coast the servants began to clear away the remnants of the meal from the low tables and to replace the main course with bowls of fresh fruits there were bunches of fat green grapes perfect little pinkgold apricots big dark figs and stickysweet dates there were plates of rams horn pastries and bowls of pistachio nuts and sugared almonds a wizened old man squatted in a corner making coffee which was soon served in tiny porcelain cups the coffee was incredibly hot and very bitter you must drink at least two cups talitha said as she heavily sugared both their cups kedar will expect a full performance from us tonight it would not do to disappoint him muna skye drank the coffee with the air of one condemned she had practiced making love with talitha for two days now but she could still not reconcile herself to the act of intimacy with another woman she knew that there were women in this world who much preferred women lovers but skye omalley was simply not one of them she dreaded what was to come and had thought hard as to how she might escape the onerous task without offending kedar she had not however been able to find an excuse that he would consider acceptable the princess had not arranged for entertainment and so after they had finished the meal they sat but a brief time talking before turkhan arose putting an end to the evening tomorrow kedar ibn omar we will speak more fully your brother will bring you to me good night she left the room trailed by her two favorites kedar might have been irritated at having been dismissed so perfunctorily but the good meal and his two women had mellowed him he was feeling very relaxed and was now ready to begin a round of sensual adventures followed by talitha and muna he hurried from the dining room and back to his own chambers as they entered the room zada and dagan rushed forward to serve their master and his concubines bathe quickly kedar commanded them you also zada when they were safely in the womens bath talitha remarked he is in rare form tonight if he wants all three of us we shall be lucky to satisfy him by dawn most men grow less passionate with the advance of the years but kedar grows more so imagine what he will be like at sixty although i dont expect we shall be here to see it then she and zada laughed but skye didnt think it very funny be silent she said to them the lord kedar is with dagan just on the other side of this wall being bathed himself what if he should hear you and be offended you are correct talitha said and the three grew silent as they washed themselves when they had finished they cleaned their teeth with ground pumice chewed several mint leaves to sweeten their breaths and brushed their hair free with brushes moistened in musk and attar of roses then not bothering to dress they returned to the bedchamber where kedar similarly refreshed by dagan awaited them comfortably seated upon his couch smoking hashish through a water pipe the grayblue smoke perfumed the room and curled gracefully up about his head he too was unclothed kedars pulse was racing and as his glance flicked over the three women he felt his excitement rising fast his original intention was to have talitha and muna make love while he amused himself with the berber girl zada but as he took in the nude beauty of the three women it suddenly dawned on him how much the tall slender talitha with her shortcropped black curls resembled a young boy and how ultrafeminine the fullbosomed and fullhipped zada was let them make love he thought while he amused himself with his delicious muna i have changed my mind talitha you will couple with zada muna my jewel sit by my side and let us watch he patted the cushions next to him and feeling the relief wash over her skye sat down gratefully kedar slipped an arm about skyes waist and nibbled a moment upon her ear i am too jealous to allow anyone else even my faithful talitha to touch you he whispered to her and then looking at the other two he snapped begin talitha will play the boy and zada the maiden as my lord commands talitha murmured smiling and then she embraced zada kissing her soundly upon the mouth zada responded quite avidly wrapping her arms about talithas neck and pressing her lush form against her partners elegant one as the two women began to fondle each other kedar began to stroke skyes breasts and she was able to look away from her two companions in order to concentrate upon kedar he however kept his eyes glued to the two women and did not notice skyes distaste in the few days since kedar had taken zada the maidservant had become quite impossible kedars attentions had convinced her that she was in his favor as much as talitha or muna she would skye knew do anything to retain his attentions and although skye was repelled by the two women now writhing upon the rug before them she could not blame zada for her actions this was zadas world and the only chance she had in it was to please her master perhaps even to bear him a son if in order to enthrall kedar she must do certain things skye knew that zada would do them willingly look look kedar noticed that she was not watching the two women and forcibly turned her head they had skye thought done just about everything possible for two women to do they had kissed and caressed and licked and tickled and sucked and rubbed each other for several long minutes but to skyes surprise talitha was now rising and dagan hurried forward to strap about her hips a red leather harness from which protruded an ivory dildo identical to the one kedar occasionally made her use the device fastened securely talitha knelt down over the panting zada spreading her short shapely legs wide playing her role of the boy to the fullest she thrust forward pushing the dildo into her victim zada shrieked a sound of both pain and delight as talitha moved back and forth upon her and kedars excited breathing rasped sharply as he leaned forward to get a closer view glancing down skye saw that his own masculine weapon was poised firmly forward my lord you are hurting me she whispered as his hands cruelly crushed her soft breasts his grip loosened but he did not for several moments turn his head from the two women performing before him upon the thick rugs when finally talitha collapsed upon zada kedar let out a long sigh of obvious satisfaction and once more turned his attention to his companion he tsked to himself over the red welts his rough fingers had imprinted upon skyes tender creamy flesh pushing her back amid the cushions on the couch he fastened his mouth over her nipple and sucked forcefully while his hand vigorously teased her other one automatically her hand entwined in his dark hair and smoothed down to caress the back of his neck which she knew he liked she could feel him against her leg hard and demanding but she knew that he would not take her quickly the two other women had built his excitement high but it had not yet peaked and kedar enjoyed the foreplay almost as much as the act itself his head lifted and moved to her other breast which he bit at softly but sharply she gave a small cry of protest and in answer he rolled them off the couch onto the carpeted floor skye lay flat on her back as kedar slowly rubbed his swollen maleness over her face pausing suggestively at her mouth she kissed the throbbing length of him with what he believed to be great fervor and kedar growled to the other two women open her legs and hold them wide skye felt her legs being grasped and pulled up and apart while kedar continued to rub himself against her breasts torso and belly as he knelt by her side her arms were stretched above her head and for the moment she felt absolutely nothing half her brain was with niall although the other half kept track of what was happening to her and she occasionally moaned with convincing passion kedar now moved himself around and between her legs resting on his elbows he spread her nether lips with his fingers and then his hot mouth found her and began to feast upon her sensitive womans flesh allah turkhan whispered as she peered at the tableau before her your brother is most inventive my little hamal wait my princess hamal said kedar is but warming to his beautiful subject you think she is beautiful turkhan queried him sharply yes i do hamal answered she is nothing like you my magnificent mistress but she is fair in her own foreign way to compare you would be like making a comparison between a rose and an exotic lily impossible turkhan was well pleased by hamals little speech and reaching out she caressed his cheek although her eyes never left the scene being played in the guest apartment the slave girl was writhing and moaning in earnest now her shapely hips pushing upward to meet her masters eager mouth kedar sucked aggressively upon skyes little jewel and his tongue then licked at her with sure strokes until she opened for him and he was able to push his tongue into her with a lingering agonizing slowness for several long minutes he moved his tongue back and forth within heran exquisite torture finally he was no longer able to hold back his own lust and pulling himself up he drove into her wellprepared body allah turkhan exclaimed again he is a bull perhaps hamal teased kedar should have sold himself to you and left me in charge of our fathers business turkhan laughed softly at his jest but her eyes remained glued to the tiny peephole you are very silent ashur she noted are you not impressed by the lord kedars incredible performance with his slave girls he is too obvious and far too heavyhanded a lover for my taste my princess was nialls tight reply but he too could not take his eyes from his peephole his anger was so great that his entire body felt icy strange he thought i should at this minute be strangling that devil who so possessively rides my wife yet i am numb i can barely even feel my heart and i am so cold so damned cold he focused again upon skye her head with its marvelous wealth of dark hair was thrown back she was moaning audibly as she approached her peak he could even see the distended delicate blue veins in her slender white neck did she enjoy kedars lusty attentions were women like men in that the fulfillment came even if the love was not there this becomes tedious now turkhan said let us go and play our own little games my darlings i have heard that men when they have no women to amuse themselves often put their own lances into each other tonight you and hamal will amuse me thusly before i allow you to take me come there can be nothing else kedar can do after he has satisfied his passions upon his slave girl muna hamal hid a knowing smile for all her power turkhan was incredibly ignorant in matters of lovemaking kedar was only beginning but for ashurs sake his younger brother did not bother to tell his mistress that he could not really imagine how ashur felt but he knew what they had just witnessed was not to his friends liking european men had very strange ideas about their women in the meantime he and ashur would have to convince the princess not to force them to the particular perversion she was so innocently suggesting hamal was quite sure that ashur would be in total agreement with him although he knew that several of the young men in turkhans harem often amused themselves thusly particularly as their mistress was so engrossed these days with ashur kedar was equally engrossed with skye at that moment his lust was running quite high this night its fires stoked by the delicious performance zada and talitha had given for him once twice three times he brought muna to a wailing peak but kedar was barely satisfied now he noted with some slight annoyance that she lay unconscious he rolled away from her and lay on his back instantly zada was there flinging herself upon him with great enthusiasm braced upon her hands her head thrown back she rode him like a fury while talitha squatted over his head and presented herself for his loving attentions eventually the two women exchanged places and finally kedar was replete with their bodies and released his first burst of passion into talitha for several minutes the three lay panting with exhaustion upon the soft rugs zada was the first to rise and with dagans aid she bathed with cool rosewater first her own sex and then those of talitha kedar and the still unconscious muna when she had rejoined her master and the others kedar said help talitha to rouse muna from her swoon my spicy little berber zada felt a glow of pleasure at the endearment she would do whatever he wanted for she loved him when talitha began to suckle on one of munas breasts zada moved to munas other side and imitated the older woman clawing her way up from the dark depths and finding her two companions thus engaged skye wondered if she would survive this orgy she had never seen kedar so aroused and she was more frightened now than she had ever been in her months with him she had to survive she had to she was so close to success the night became a blur of sensuality where one body blended into another and one sexual act followed another so closely that she soon became confused as to who did what to whom she was spared the worst of it however for kedar was truly jealous of anyone else even another woman touching her eventually skye never remembered when they all fell into a deep sleep the bodies tangled together when she finally woke the sun was streaming into the room and as skye stretched gingerly her gaze met the very amused one of talitha so sleepyhead you are finally awake the older woman greeted her skye nodded where is the lord kedar meeting with the princess it is at least two hours past the noon hour the last thing i remember is the dawn skye replied we were up in time to see that our lord kedar was fed and bathed properly zada said smugly you could not be roused are you so in our masters favor zada skye said sharply that you dare to offend me the master is pleased with me zada retorted pertly he is that is not what i asked you now unless you have been relieved of your duties by the lord kedar you will fetch me something to eat and to drink my mouth feels like cotton and i am ravenous zada hesitated a moment looking to talitha for support but talitha took that moment to assiduously study her long nails defeated the servant girl hurried out to do skyes bidding you are stronger than you pretend to be talitha remarked calmly you know that i am of the nobility in my own land skye replied i am used to commanding servants yet i have never seen you act so authoritatively talitha said is it true then that kedar will make you his wife i know not skye answered truthfully then added to confuse talitha but it will be as he and he alone desires he is the master talitha might think what she would but she would never be able to say that muna said she was to be kedars wife skye stood up i am going to bathe ill come with you talitha replied so far there has been little time for indulging anything other than kedars various appetites skye laughed does kedar know how sharp your tongue is she asked genuinely amused no more than he knows how strong you are muna my friend hurry now lest that little upstart zada try to join us i can bear no more of her chatter today is she never quiet no was the short reply and the two women departed quickly for the guest bath they bathed in leisurely fashion and then returned to the apartment and ate what zada had brought them kedar was still with the princess and talitha and zada lay down to sleep while they could but skye took the opportunity to walk in the gardens that opened off of the guest quarters the day was warm but not uncomfortable and she enjoyed the peace and the solitude of her own company slowly she strolled along the carefully raked gravel paths about her a multitude of bright flowers bloomed in exotic and riotous fashion their many scents almost overpowering in the still air my lady muna she heard hamals voice but looking about did not see him i am on the other side of the hedge came the explanation it is better that we not be seen talking just walk along i will keep pace with you which way skye asked toward the fountains at the end of the hedgerow have you some news for me hamal i have managed to convince both my brother and the princess of the advisability of journeying to algiers as i have explained to turkhan she cannot entrust her goods to her own caravan people until she knows the risks and variables of the trail since kedar having never over the years lost a shipment is really the expert in this i suggested that he go with her to aid her also the dey of algiers is an old friend of the princesss father sultan selim ii he will aid her in her dealings in algiers and kedar will benefit by meeting the dey through turkhan everyone will profit all around what of niall hamal what of my husband the princess will take both myself and ashur your husband with her but how are we to escape skyes voice had a nervous edge to it kedar has confided in me that he is so enamored of you that if you could not go along he would not go oh god skye whispered i will never escape him courage muna you must only put up with my brother for a few more months i have already dispatched a pigeon to my uncle osman your ships will be awaiting you in algiers do not fear has my uncle not said it was not your fate to remain in this part of the world we cannot compromise osman skye said firmly do you think i am so foolish as to endanger him hamals voice sounded hurt i do not like returning to algiers skye fretted there is danger in that city for me what danger hamal was curious my second husband was khalid el bey the great whoremaster of algiers he was murdered by his best friend capitan jamil the sultans commandant of the casbah fortress in order that jamil might possess both me and my beloved khalids fortune your uncle helped me to escape hamal when osman sent for me a few months ago jamil was in istanbul by now however he will have returned if he suspects for one moment that i am there he will attempt to exact revenge on me for spurning him even if this jamil is there he can do you no harm hamal soothed her kedar is not apt to let you run loose in the city and it is unlikely that jamil will ever meet my brother and discover that they both covet the same woman besides all this happened long ago hamal said with the certainty and assurance of his youth surely capitan jamil has forgotten you by now then he quickly amended not that you are a forgettable woman skye was forced to laugh stop she begged him i am but thirty and you make me feel like an old woman you are thirty he sounded amazed and skye was overcome with a fresh fit of giggles suddenly she felt more certain than she had in days she had been frankly worried about escaping with niall from fez and making their way alone through unfamiliar and hostile territory to the coast she had almost been beaten down by kedars overpowering sensuality but now she suddenly felt lighthearted again she wished she might share that good feeling with niall when do you think we will be leaving hamal it will be at least two months before we can depart from fez it will take that long to prepare a caravan large enough to hold the goods of both the princess and my brother the trip itself is at least a month three months at the earliest between three and four months more likely it will be necessary to create a diversion in algiers in order that niall and i can escape skye said then we will need to travel in a large convoy in order to circumvent the dey corsairs the mediterranean is virtually an ottoman lake have osman alert my men as to our arrival my uncle is right hamal said admiringly you are really an amazing woman you know so very much about the world in a sense i envy you your knowledge i have lived here in fez my entire life i have never been more than a few miles from the city i have never even seen the sea ask niall to tell you about our homeland and about england and its queen and her court hamal now you must tell me how my husband fares i have spoken with you on everything but that which is dearest to my heart skye had reached a large azureblue tiled fountain the fountain was round and filled with bright golden fish darting to and fro in its center a crystal spray bubbled forth shooting at least nine or ten feet into the air hamal was still nowhere to be seen but skye knew that he had not left her knowing you are here heartens him as he is distressed by seeing you with my brother i was distressed at seeing him with the princess skye answered tardy he seemed to be paying her most ardent court i had been told he was resisting her fiercely he did not look last evening as if he were resisting her at all a chuckle sounded behind her her obvious jealousy in the face of her seeming passion for kedar amused hamal ashur decided a small while ago that to fight turkhan was not the proper tactic so instead he began to court her and believe me muna when he escapes her turkhans fury will know no bounds i imagine kedar will feel the same way at your flight skye walked slowly around the fountain pausing a moment to dip her hand in the cool water out of respect for your uncle my dear friend osman i will say nothing to you of your brother but that i will be glad to escape his clutches hamal again came the rich chuckle from the green shadows of the hedgerow if kedar knew you muna really knew how strong and disciplined a woman you are he would be very frightened if you could but be yourself how easily you would vanquish him i almost wish i might see it for it would destroy him skye hid a small smile as the truth dawned upon her you hate him dont you hamal despite your gentle manner and soft appearance you are as ruthless as he is and i think far more clever by right half of our fathers wealth was mine and yet my brother robbed me by selling me to the princess still you love turkhan your uncle tells me yes muna i love her but that does not wipe out kedars crime as long as i am a slave i can inherit nothing i strive for the day that turkhan will free me i will marry her then claim my fathers wealth from kedar and with turkhans wealth i shall be far more powerful than kedar he will regret having attempted to disinherit me are you not afraid i shall expose you hamal to whom muna not kedar for you care nothing for my brother to my uncle he would understand i assure you do not fear lady i shall aid you and ashur in your escape once we reach algiers now i must return to the palace do not be frightened if i do not attempt to speak with you until we arrive in algiers there is no need hamal skye called softly tell niall that i love him i will came the reply she was alone again she walked once more around the fountain watching the fish flashing golden amid the crystal bubbles escape from algiers was assured in skyes mind as much as she disliked no detested spending further time with the salacious kedar it was a small price to pay for what in the long run was going to be a better situation for both herself and niall completing her second circle of the fountain she began to retrace her steps back along the tall green hedgerows toward the palace where have you been kedars fingers dug into the soft flesh of her upper arm for a moment anger flashed in skyes eyes and then a warning glance from talitha reminded her of her situation i was but walking in the princesss garden my lord is it not allowed have i breached the code of good manners her voice sounded distressed and anxious kedars grip loosened somewhat it would have been better if you had taken talitha or zada with you my jewel i do not like you walking alone perhaps she was meeting a lover zada said spitefully with a roar kedar rounded on her releasing skye as he attacked the now terrified zada beating her viciously about the head and shoulders my lord my lord skye protested twas but the illconsidered jest of a jealous woman even talitha who normally would not involve herself added her voice to skyes in an attempt to stop kedar my lord if you kill her you will have lost a valuable slave how often have you admonished us not to waste owwww oh oh arrrrgh mercy master mercy the unfortunate zada wailed bitch little savage animal kedar snarled how dare you suggest such perfidy against your mistress your better do you think that because i have relieved my lust into your worthless body you are as good as she he cuffed her a blow on the side of the head you will receive twenty lashes when we return worthless one so saying kedar shoved zada away from him angrily ignoring the fallen woman talitha and skye quickly set about calming the furious kedar while talitha hurried to bring him a cool and refreshing drink skye wiped his brow with a cloth wrung out in rosewater you must not be angry with zada my lord she implored him she is but an ignorant berber and the honor you have done her has gone to her head talitha held a goblet of lemoned sherbet to his lips saying has this sort of thing not happened before my lord and it will continue to happen if you will not confine yourself to your harem the women of my household are there to please me kedar grumbled all of them that may be your right my lord talitha persisted but if there is no distinction between mistress and servant then the servants will believe that they are as good as their mistresses and this sort of thing will happen again and again kedar snatched the goblet from talitha and drained it you have been with me many years talitha and i have never known you not to act in my best interests i will think on what you have said skye could not help but raise an eyebrow such a reasonable concession on kedars part was surprising talitha merely smiled and said quietly you will decide what is best my lord skye did not see niall again they left the princesss palace in the afternoon to return to kedars house in the corner of their litter zada sat sniveling and finally annoyed talitha rebuked her sharply be silent girl you have brought this misery upon yourself muna was meeting a lover zada insisted i saw a man in the garden walk the same way that she did skye quickly debated with herself whether she should admit to meeting hamal and finally said the lord kedars young brother hamal was on the other side of the hedgerow from me talitha he but bid me good day and returned to the palace lest he compromise me should i say something to our master talitha laughed of course not muna more likely hamal feared that you would compromise him with princess turkhan especially now that she has shown such favor toward that handsome brute ashur she turned stern eyes on the complaining zada say a word to kedar and i will have you poisoned foolish one zada nodded she had no doubt that that old bitch meant every word of it will i really be given twenty lashes she quavered probably talitha said drily speak to kedar talitha skye intervened zada has already been sufficiently punished no talitha said she deserves to be beaten i will try however to see that her sentence is cut from twenty to ten lashes the next few weeks passed quickly in a haze of sameness for skye almost every evening except during the period when she was considered unclean she joined kedar in an orgy of dark sensuality during the day she slept heavily and long in order to counteract the debilitating effects of the previous night and to prepare for the night to come how kedar kept up such a strenuous pace she did not understand he seemed to gain his strength from the sexual encounters he had with his women with less than five hours sleep he was up early each morning busily preparing for the journey back to algiers he had not said yet that he would take skye and she fretted with uncertainty as he had always left his women behind when he led a caravan before finally a week before the trek was duc to begin she could bear it no longer kedar was feeling benevolent and relaxed that evening before him danced half a dozen attractive and supple girls their sheer rainbowcolored skirts whirling prettily as they swayed and dipped in time to the reed and drum he was alone but for his favorite muna who popped small very sweet dates stuffed with almonds into his open mouth she pressed her breasts suggestively against his arm and spoke breathily into his ear how i shall miss you my lord when you are gone to algiers i am not sure i can bear to be without you surely i shall have pined away before you return she ran her tongue around the inside of his ear and blew softly into it kedar turned his head and gazed into her gorgeous sapphire eyes which appeared to him to be liquid in their desire for him her mouth was but inches away from his and he was unable to resist kissing her her lips seemed to part eagerly and her soft tongue taunted his by playing hide and seek with him slipping out to swiftly brush against his before sliding away kedar felt his lust begin to build he had not intended to take her but as she flamed beneath his touch he suddenly realized he did not wish to be nay could not be without her for three to four long months she had a hypnotic almost druglike effect upon him she had infected his blood much as the opium infected those who overindulged he would take her with him he would marry her in algiers in his uncles house where he had first seen her he knew that osman romantic fool he was would enjoy that very much releasing her from the kiss he allowed her to cling possessively to him did i not tell you my jewel that you are to go with me the princess takes her two favorites and i certainly cannot be without you relief poured through skyes veins rendering her almost weak to the point of swooning seeing it kedar was pleased and found that he was also extremely flattered her concern at being parted from him was obviously quite genuine and he thought that perhaps she was falling in love with him but she dared not say the words for fear of giving offense many masters of such luscious creatures sought only the willing bodies of their women and wanted nothing more indeed he knew many men who sold off the women who fell in love with them for they did not want clinging females who grew possessive with their love kedar knew that his women gossiped among themselves and undoubtedly muna had heard such stories beguiled by her attitude kedar considered that muna was the first woman to ever really love him and he was further gratified he had been wise to wait all these years she was going to be the perfect wife she was discreet obedient and incredibly sensual what more could a man ask for he asked himself whatever else it might be the slaves could supply freed of her anxiety skye knew she must say something i am so happy you will not leave me behind my lord she murmured her voice soft with actual elation kedar smiled into her perfumed hair i should not admit this to you my jewel but i would be bereft without your sweet company were i only to be gone a month though i should not expose you to the rigors of the caravan trail what if you are with child i am not my lord my only displeasure with you he replied a small frown creasing his brow what does it matter she cajoled him you have several sons and daughters by your many concubines my lord if i grew round with child then i should not be able to grace your couch as i do now i do not wish some other to take my place she pouted at him no one he vowed fervently no one my fair muna my adorable precious jewel could possibly take your place with me skye smiled at him and kedar was so blinded by his growing approval of her that he did not see the cruelty in the smile gods bones she thought to herself how i despise you no it is more than despise i hate you kedar when i flee from you with my beloved niall i hope you suffer the tortures of the truly damned for that is what i have suffered at your hands not once have you touched me with love only with lust you are the most depraved man i know and i wonder if i shall ever be clean again or really free of your touch still if i may aid my dearest niall to safely reach home perhaps we may together free ourselves of the terrible memories this wicked land has given us and build our lives with our children once more kedar had begun to make love to her now and skye was still so engrossed in her own thoughts that she responded automatically he however was so totally fascinated with her by now that he did not even notice pride of ownership surged through him and he almost howled his triumph of possession as he quickly emptied his lust into her womb when he fell on her breasts panting with exhaustion she finally noticed and her lip curled with disgust as she wondered if she would ever get the stink of him and his unbridled passion off her skin out of her nostrils she shuddered and again kedar misinterpreted her feelings assuming the shiver was one of satisfaction we are so perfectly suited my jewel he said indeed my lord skye replied indeed chapter algiers skye had wondered when she left algiers those many months ago whether she would see the city again nor had she ever really thought to see osman ever again yet here he was hugging her his eyes wet with unshed tears allah be praised my daughter you are safe he stepped back and viewed her critically you are thinner she nodded it has not been easy you have seen hamal my friend osman nodded as you know he rode in ahead of the caravan three days ago so that we might be warned of your imminent arrival the old dey is in quite a dither over the prospect of entertaining the sultans daughter he was even prepared to invite kedar to stay at the palace but hamal discouraged it saying that kedar was only a business acquaintance of turkhans and besides he was my nephew and would want to stay with me getting your husband niall out of the palace will be hard enough but we should never have gotten you out are my ships here osman some in port some lying just off the coast over the horizon osman paused and then said quietly skye my daughter jamil is back in the city she sucked her breath in sharply iknew it i somehow sensed he would be here should i return it is said that his potency is restored find me an assassin osman would you have his death on your conscience my daughter osman was shocked khalid must be revenged how his murder has haunted me all these years osman i want jamil dead he deserves to die perhaps osman agreed but i shall not let you make this grave error skye my daughter it was khalids fate to die else you would not have returned to your own land to your own destiny i warned khalid the morning he told me that he was going to wed with you but he would not listen when he made that decision his fate was sealed but remember skye it was his right to decide his own fate his choices were clear and so are yours in allahs good time jamil will be punished but it is not up to you to wield the sword of justice over his head osman put a comforting arm about her how strong your passions are skye you are so consumed with your thoughts of revenge it does not even occur to you that you might be in danger yourself it is only logic osman i am in no danger and i know it the memory of skye muna el khalid is long gone from algiers and of the few who know muna the slave of the lord kedar who would connect the two i am simply an anonymous woman as are all respectable women in this city if jamil came into this house tonight he would still not know i was here for he would certainly not be allowed the run of your womens quarters i am more concerned as to when i may see robbie she said not until you escape skye osman cautioned it is too dangerous for him to appear in my house and i cannot take the chance that he be seen in your presence who would speak osman i managed to avoid bringing anyone here from your nephews house by pretending that i was deeply desirous of serving him personally and could take care of myself as a reward for my devotion he promised to buy me half a dozen maidens to serve me here in algiers talitha was eminently relieved to be left behind and much to kedars annoyance that chatterbox zada found herself with child and had to be left behind the little berber kedar bought to serve you is with child who is the father kedar skye laughed has he ever been averse to dipping his spoon into a handy honey pot osman sighed deeply kedar has never learned to be select in his lusts he remarked robbie skye reminded osman yes my daughter yes do not be impatient hamal and i have spoken and we have already formulated part of the plan for your escape tomorrow the fast of ramadan begins for the next thirty days no true believer will eat or drink between dawn and sunset immediately after the sun has set the feasting begins and by the second hour after midnight all are asleep filled with food and drink to sleep until the noon hour of the following day business is conducted in those few hours until sunset hamal and i think the best time for you to make your escape would be in the early hours just before the dawn it will be easy to slip some potent sleeping drug into kedars cup in order to allow you to slip away and niall osman what of my husband hamal and i believe he should not escape at the same time as you do the coincidence would be far too great and my family is far too involved now with princess turkhan to become the objects of her vengeance you will be safe at sea upon your ship where kedar will not even consider seeking you get niall out first osman skye said i wouldnt be able to rest easy if i had to leave him behind he didnt look well to me in fez and the few times i managed to catch a glimpse of him on the caravan trail he looked ill frankly and here skyes brow furrowed with concern i am fearful for him osman his ordeal it seems has been far worse than any i have suffered here in algiers or fez if you wish it my daughter osman promised give me your husbands birthdate now so i may plot his natal chart as i have yours guilelessly skye did so unaware that osman was fearful for her he had sought her own charts and updated them he saw within skyes current stars great pain and personal tragedy a tragedy that might well scar her emotionally for the rest of her days yet in the midst of the darkness was one great light a dominant leo who might save her from herself knowing that lord burke had been born under the sign of the scorpion osman now knew that he was not that man with a sad shake of his head and a deep sigh osman set about to again plot niall burkes stars knowing even as he did so what the end result had to be the fast of ramadan began and was strictly kept throughout the city of algiers by rich and poor alike the town was fairly quiet during the day but once the sun had set the scent of delicious foods could be smelled all over the city and it was said that the starving grew fat on the smells alone in the depths of algiers a tailor sewed upon a costume that his colorblind and tired old eyes could only half make out still his stitches and seams were neat with years of practice and when he had finished he was paid a generous although not munificent sum too many dinars would have caused questions to be asked the costume that of a janissary captain was smuggled into the deys palace and hidden carefully by hamal nialls escape was set for the ninth night of ramadan returning from the deys magnificent and rich feast turkhan demanded the immediate attendance of both of her favorites although they had traveled with her to algiers and the dey knew of their presence in his palace turkhan had wisely chosen not to flaunt her harem boys before her fathers representative now they appeared nude before her as she preferred but before she might direct their play into sexual channels hamal was pressing a cooling goblet of lemonade upon her and niall was stretching her out upon the floor pillows to massage her lush body with strong hands turkhan drank deeply and then purred i shall fall asleep ashur if you do he murmured low with hot breath against her ear i will not let you sleep long my princess only long enough to gain the strength youll need for a long night of my loving send hamal away my beautiful one turkhan shivered with anticipatory delight she pretended to consider nialls request while she drained the cup then she said my little lamb seek your bed now hamal knelt down tenderly kissed turkhans mouth rose up and left them niall returned to his ministrations of turkhans voluptuous form and was soon rewarded by her even breathing still he kept on and then she began to snore lightly my princess he whispered and then his voice grew normal my princess are you awake turkhan slept on and satisfied that his massage and the opiate in the lemonade had done their work niall rose and left the room he encountered no one along the short route to his own quarters hamal was awaiting him with the janissary captains costume niall dressed quickly and as he slipped the clothing on he felt sure and strong for the first time in months as hamal adjusted the sash about his waist and fixed the hat upon his head niall nervously popped jellies into his mouth it was going to work he knew it was going to work his spirits soared in a few minutes he would be outside the deyspalace in the city of algiers and robbie would be awaiting him now remember ashur hamal cautioned if you are stopped you must reply in turkish you could not have reached a captains rank unless you spoke turkish go back to turkhans chambers and leaving through her bedchamber cut across the deys garden to the western wall you will find a door hidden beneath the vines halfway down the wall it is open and the hinges have been oiled so it should swing silently keep to the shadows you should have very little trouble for the garden is not brightly lit but be cautious someone could be wandering the old dey it is said does not sleep well or perhaps one of his women one of your own people will be waiting for you on the other side of the wall hamal niall grasped the younger mans hands in his how can i thank you ashur my friend if i did not think that you were wrong for my turkhan i should not do this she is in love with you and your defection will cause her pain i will of course be here to ease that pain i understand your feelings for your beautiful wife and i have ever been a fool for happy endings we will both be happyyou with your lady i with mine go now while all sleep he pressed a small flat gilt box in nialls hand a small token those damned jellies that you like so well made just as old rabi prepares them for you niall grinned almost boyishly farewell my young friend hamal and thank you then he was quickly gone from the room hamal heaved a soft sigh of relief in just a few short minutes ashur would be gone from their lives and turkhan would be his alone she would be angry and heartbroken by turns she would demand that the dey find her favorite but within the hour niall would be safely at sea turkhan would have no choice but to turn to him for her solace faithful hamal a small smile played about his lips faithful hamal who would soon be a free man again a man who could legally claim half of his brothers wealth as well as all of his princess wifes he chuckled kedar would be quite surprised to discover his adversary was as ruthless as he himself was and why not had he not learned at his brothers knee before kedar had so cruelly sold him into slavery hamal slipped silently back into his own small chamber next to ashurs and lying down fell into a guildess and satisfied sleep in the meantime niall had quietly reentered turkhans chamber for a moment he stood over her staring down at this bold woman who had demanded everything from him expecting no less then without a backward glance he walked into the warm black night of the deys garden briefly he stood listening in the shadows and then hearing no sound other than the night insects he began his stealthy walk across the garden to the west wall he moved quickly and silently pausing every few minutes to listen to look about him high above him on the walls of the palace the deys own men paced their watch but not quite as alertly as usual being full with food and fermented fruit juices only a direct attack by the infidel would have roused them now ahead of him was a small fountain that he was forced to circumvent he paused for a moment confused as to his direction and for a brief second panic set in but breathing deeply to calm his fears niall pressed onward finally gaining the western wall carefully he felt his way along it the thorny vines catching at his clothing he smothered a curse as his hands grew badly scratched and pricked but at last he felt the smooth surface of the little door beneath his bleeding palms sliding his hands downward he found the latch slowly cautiously he pressed down on the handle and the door swung silently open for a surprised moment he stared out into the street then almost leapt through onto the cobbles banging his forehead in the process this elicited another curse then remembering his danger niall burke pulled the little garden door closed behind him and hurried off down the street at the bottom of the street a shadow joined him from a doorway and he almost wept to hear a soft devon voice say lets go mlord wouldnt do to have the turks catch us now would it robbie is it you his heart was hammering joyously and even the damned english tongue sounded good to his ears after so many months of first french and then arabic and turkish aye mlord tis me and glad it is i am to see you weve not far to go but twould be best if we were silent now lest we cause suspicion by our speech follow me the ease of his escape after so many months of torturous captivity amazed niall robbie was dressed like a corsair reis and the few people they passed thought nothing of the two men one a reis the other a janissary captain walking together toward the harbor they reached it fairly quickly for the deys palace was quite nearby niall followed robbie through the maze of docks until they arrived at a vessel he recognized as skyes flagship with suddenly shaking legs he somehow managed to mount the gangway expecting at any minute to hear a commanding voice from behind shout at him to stop there was no voice and he gained the deck to again follow robbie into the main cabin sit down mlord robbie moved quickly to the sideboard and poured niall a generous dollop of smoky irish whiskey he didnt like the look of the mans color at all handing it to the seated man he said drink it mlord ive got to go topside and get us underway where is skye robbie the plan was that we get you out first lady burke will be coming along in a few more nights no ill not leave without her robbie niall had risen in protest mlord robbie said patiently although his blood was beginning to boil angrily i have not the time to explain it to you for we are yet in danger but i promise i will come back once we have cleared the harbor if you are considering acting foolishly remember all the lives involved in getting you out especially lady burkes he then turned on his heel and slammed out of the cabin defeated niall sat heavily and pondered the amber liquid in his glass he didnt understand and he was frightened for skye was she even alive he had caught glimpses of her as they had traveled from fez to algiers although it hadnt been easy she had been forced to ride in a heavily guarded silkdraped wagon at least he and hamal had been given horses to ride although they were expected to pace their mounts on either side of turkhans palanquin he had not even managed a small sight of her in the last week before they reached algiers and then he had been housed in the deys palace while she had gone with kedar to osmans home surely if she were dead or injured or ill they would have told him wouldnt they reaching into his robes he drew out the gilt box hamal had given him he opened it and devoured three jellies for some reason they always seemed to help him when he grew edgy he frowned irritably he was a man he had never been given to fears and qualms before he had come to algiers granted his had been a rather harrowing experience but surely the shock would wear off now that he was safe among his own people again when he could hold skye in his arms once again it would be all right he needed his wife he needed skye absently he reached for another jelly and then he rose and refilled his goblet savoring the whiskey as outside on the deck he heard the noise and the activity of the sailors beginning to get the ship underway he heard the gentle creak of the vessel as it eased away from its dock and began to make its way out of the harbor looking out of the great window at the stern of the cabin he saw the dark outline of the city of the palace itself where turkhan lay soundly asleep unsuspecting that he had at last escaped her web dawn would not break for several hours yet and by then they would be safely at sea he didnt know how long he sat silently watching as the city grew more and more distant but suddenly he felt the full swell of the sea as the ship passed out of the sheltered harbor the door to the cabin opened and robert small entered the room again there now mlord were safely away skye why isnt she aboard niall demanded anxiously robbie poured himself a whiskey and seated himself next to lord burke it was thought if you both escaped at the same time a link between you might be established which would in time lead back to osman and his family twould be a poor way to repay osman for twas he who told us you were yet alive and arranged for lady burke to get to fez to verify your existence when will she come robbie when niall stuffed another jelly into his mouth which despite the whiskey seemed dry and scratchy a few days at the most mlord well just sit quietly off the coast waiting for her bran kelly and his crew will be there to take her out niall nodded hes a good man bran did he ever marry skyes little daisy last year mlord and within nine months of the wedding she gave him a redfaced and squalling son theyre waiting in devon for you both no england niall said i want to see ireland again i want to go home the children most of them are at wren court with cecily my bairns niall was surprised why mistress skye felt them safer with cecily in devon safer than with my father at burke castle again niall was surprised by skyes seemingly strange actions robbie hesitated a moment and then he began to speak he was going to have to tell lord burke everything for the man was full of questions having been out of touch almost three years when his friend had finished niall nodded now he understood skye had done well despite the odds but then she had always been competent in a mans world the fact that she had survived without him he found unreasonably irritating even though he knew that she had done it before she was an unusual woman but he loved her then we wait he said to robbie and the little man heaved a great sigh of relief niall laughed what robbie did you think i was going to order an immediate attack upon the city of algiers in order to rescue my wife he was beginning to feel better almost elated with the sure knowledge that he would soon see her youve been known in the past to act rashly mlord was the honest reply true robbie tis a fault skyes often accused me of but i think my time in captivity has taught me patience he grinned mischievously although i will not guarantee it for once i am back in my own land i may very easily revert to my old ways robbie chuckled ill not question yer behavior in ireland mlord only here while we have yet to regain mistress skye yell find the cabin comfortable and if you need anything youve but to ask as youve said we wait in the early afternoon skye met alima in the baths who whispered once they were out of earshot of the bath attendants your husband escaped this morning and is safely at sea dearest lady thank god skye breathed and alima squeezed her hand comfortingly osman says that the princess is hysterical and furious by turns the dey is embarrassed that a prized slave could walk with ease from his wellguarded palace and no one claims to have seen him go he has not been seen in the town and it is a great mystery the city guards have of course been doubled it will be difficult for the next few days for you to leave my husband advises patience skye laughed ruefully from the moment i was introduced to kedar i have been patient but the next days will be the worst alima still knowing that my niall is safe lifts the burden from my heart again alima squeezed skyes hand and smiled warmly at her let us walk in the gardens after we have bathed she suggested and perhaps you will tell me again of life in your queens fabulous court of course skye agreed generously she knew how very much alima enjoyed hearing of elizabeth tudors court and frenchborn as she was of the beautiful clothing worn by the men and women alike skye had many times explained in detail the quantity of beautiful gowns in her own possession and as the two women wandered hand in hand in the garden she wondered if her clothes would now be all out of style it was a thought she shared with alima who clapped her hands excitedly and exclaimed oh i hope so lady skye then you can have all new gowns made how wonderful skye laughed and it was the merry sound of her laughter that attracted the notice of the blond woman who had been pacing restlessly in osmans library the woman peered through the latticework that covered the windows down into the garden she stared hard and her breath quickened with excitement who are those women in your garden lord osman she demanded sharply osman arose from the rather disquieting chart he had been silently reading and peered down it is my wife and my nephews favorite muna who is her dearest friend why do you ask lady nilak the darkhaired one reminds me of someone i once knew she turned from the window with reluctance and then asked well lord osman you are reputed to be the most famous astrologer in all of algiers in fact one of the best in the known world what does my chart tell you it tells me you have done much evil lady nilak it tells me that you are not one bit repentant for your wicked ways you are as much the director of your own fate as are the stars she laughed harshly i am not interested in the past lord osman tell me of the present will the lord jamil marry me tell me of the future will the sultan make him the new dey will we rule algiers together these are the things that interest me nothing more jamil has recommended you highly tell me what you see i see death in your chart he said flatly horrified the woman stepped back her hand going to her throat you lie she hissed at him you are nothing but a fraud a faker you know nothing nothing i see your death osman repeated and before dying you will cause the death of at least two people with a small shriek of anger and horror nilak turned and fled the room osman did not bother to follow her he was far too excited by what he had learned quickly he drew both skye and kedars charts from their places on the shelves reaching up he drew down yet another rolled parchment this one belonging to jamil once the capitan commander of the casbah fortress now retired with the rank of full commander or agha spreading the three charts upon the large library table next to the one he had just done for the lady nilak he studied them carefully with growing interest there was no mistake the four people represented were fated to meet and their conjunction would end in death for three of them osman closed his eyes briefly most of the time he enjoyed his gift of sight but there were times times like this when he saw things that gave him pain then he did not enjoy his special ability perhaps just perhaps he might be able to prevent a tragedy for every soul was offered two paths by which to travel wearily he sat down and tried to think what he might do while osman pondered on what he had seen nilak hurried downstairs and climbed back into her silkdraped palanquin sharply she ordered her slaves to quickly return her to her house the girl in the garden had been skye omalleys twin and jamil had been enamored of skye when she was in algiers if she nilak could bring the girl to jamils attention and if she could buy the wench from osmans nephew would not jamil be grateful to her would he not see that she loved him and was looking out for his interests she did not care if jamil fucked the girl a dozen times a day as long as she claire oflaherty now known as the lady nilak was jamil aghas wife she smiled contentedly she was going to make jamil so very happy and then too she would be happy as wife to the sultans new dey surely jamil would gain the appointment to govern algiers once the old man who now ruled for sultan selim ii retired which according to rumor would be any day now claire had gone to istanbul with jamil and while the physicians had worked to successfully cure his disability she had made friends with the sultans favorite nurbanu a venetian noblewoman by birth when claire had told her that she too was a western noblewoman by birth the two had struck up a small friendship which claire carefully cultivated it had been nurbanu who had compared claires blue eyes to the lilacs that grew in the sultans gardens thus claire became nilak the persian for bluish lilac flower even jamil had been pleased and delighted that the sultans favorite had so honored the woman he considered making his wife claire smiled again thinking how her luck had changed since the day that niall burke had driven her out of london naked and stripped of all her wealth for a moment her face darkened as she remembered the taunts of the onlookers the jeers of the goodwives the garbage that had been thrown at her fouling her hair clogging her nostrils sometimes she could clearly feel the sharp sting of his dog whip upon her shoulders and back and when she did she hated lord niall burke with such a fierce hatred that she would not be able to sleep at night with the remembering when london had been left behind niall had slashed furiously at her helpless body with a final few strokes and then had tossed her a long shapeless sack its better than you deserve bitch he had snarled at her dont ever let me see your damnable face again madam the next time i will kill you claire laughed with the memory the next time they had met she had come close to killing him killing however was not what she had had in mind a quick death would have been too easy and she had wanted niall burke to suffer for having spoiled her successful venture as claro the most corrupt and famous madam in all of bess tudors london gods cock how she hated niall burke the devil however had smiled on his own claire had grimly begun walking she slept that first night in a hedge by the side of the road where she had been found the following morning by an elderly merchant traveling down from london he good soul knew nothing of claro and the scandal she had caused in the tudor court adney darton was a godly and gentle man who had neither chick nor child and he accepted claires story of being an orphaned noblewoman fallen upon hard times generously he took her home with him claire kept his house and attempted to cook his meals seeking to insinuate herself into his life he was therefore devastated when she announced that she would have to leave his home what would people think of an unmarried maiden of poor but good background living in the house of an unmarried man she could stay no longer she said adney darton was old enough to be claires grandfather but he proposed marriage as she had expected he would claire demurred adney darton fell to his knees and begged claire to accept his suit yes she whispered finally inwardly unable to believe her good luck the old man couldnt be long for this world and within a short time she would be a rich widow the banns were quickly posted and within the month claire became mistress darton it was then that she learned her husband had one living relative isham darton arrived too late to prevent the wedding but in time for the funeral of adney darton who had perished in the act of consummating his marriage isham darton was furious for his cousin had thoughtfully rewritten his will prior to his marriage and the marriage was quite legal claire darton was now a wealthy woman and isham darton had lost his inheritance isham darton considerably younger than adney had coveted the elders wealth it was clear that he lusted after claire and claire succumbed to his blandishments isham darton was a vigorous lover almost as venal and lustful as claire who set about to lure the man into marriage isham darton suggested that claire come with him to algiers where he was going to set up a trading company boldly claire told him she would only go as his wife and to her delight he agreed without hesitation isham darton had already decided that claire would be easy to dispose of in algiers and as her husband he would inherit her fortune isham and claire planned their marriage for the day after her years mourning was over in the meantime claire proposed that she travel to her former home in ireland to visit a final time the graves of her dear departed father and brother he need not accompany her claire had sailed to ireland upon one of her late husbands two ships to work her evil paying its captain a rather large sum to take the wounded niall burke aboard and sell him into the galleys returning to england she was married to isham darton and together they set sail for algiers as they crossed the bay of biscay isham darton was swept overboard in a severe storm the widow kept to her destination claire settled herself in algiers as a single seemingly respectable and very wealthy european widow living in a turkish city she had quickly come to the attention of capitan jamil of the casbah fortress claire knew that she must remain a proper matron or she would not be able to associate with the right people she also intended to add to her wealth by continuing trading if the damnable skye omalley could do it then so could she she soon had a thriving business going and there wasnt a man in algiers who drove a harder or tighter bargain than claire darton she remained very circumspect in her behavior and that in itself was most taunting and provocative to the men of algiers they very much wanted to meet with the beautiful blond woman with the lilacblue eyes how though was the big question capitan jamil succeeded where all others had failed soon he would retire and the rich wife he had picked for himself those long years ago the magnificent skye muna el khalid had eluded him he had arranged her husbands murder but somehow she had discovered he was responsible and fled him transferring all of khalids riches out of algiers then through her maidservant skye had sent him a plate of sweetmeats containing a potent drug which had rendered him unable to function as a man for five long years he had been totally impotent and then his manhood had begun to revive but only slightly another four years had passed and then he had heard of a physician in istanbul who could cure him he had not the gold he would need to pay the physician but he knew that the rich infidel widow did jamil waited a few weeks until the days grew shorter with the approach of the winter season and the evenings came early he arranged for the lady claires palanquin to be set upon as it passed through a particularly dark deserted area then he and a small troupe of mounted janissaries arrived to beat off the attackers when the tumult had died down he presented his compliments to the lady and personally escorted her to her house begging permission to call again claire had said that she would think on it but by the time his gift a carved lavender jade bracelet wrapped in a handkerchief of cloth of gold arrived the next afternoon claire had ascertained who her rescuer had been and whether he could be of use to her he could and consequently capitan jamil was invited to take coffee with her the relationship had quickly blossomed jamil was genuinely intrigued by claires blond beauty as well as her vast wealth and claire for the first time since her brother dom had died loved another human being strangely he had been able to consummate their relationship the first time he attempted to do so but he had been quite honest with regard to his situation eventually he had told her of the doctor in istanbul who could cure him her revenge against the burkes had been successful and she was in love she begged her lover to let her foot the expenses to the capital for them both so he might be cured jamil refused claire persisted he refused again but now she would not be denied and finally he gracefully gave in to her pleas it was while they were in istanbul that she learned of his previous involvement with skye omalley jamil did not know then that skye muna el khalid was skye omalley but claire knew how strange she thought that she was so passionately in love with the very man whom her bitterest enemy had scorned and almost destroyed by turning him into a partial eunuch she would settle with skye omalley once she and jamil were married she would destroy skyes own shipping interests by using the corsair reises who would be under her husbands command once the sultan appointed jamil the new dey for now however she was delighted that the famous physician who treated jamil had been successful her lover had regained his full potency and was a veritable bull in their bedchamber before they departed istanbul for their return to algiers he proposed marriage as she had known he would she blushingly accepted despite the fact that he warned her he would want nay he would keep a harem claire now the lady nilak cared nothing for the others he might bed as long as he loved her and she was his wife with the power a deys wife had jamil smiled at her honest admission thinking that they were really quite suited and agreed that their marriage would take place in the month of shawwal following the fast month of ramadan ramadan was now half over and claire was feeling quite pleased with herself at having discovered a skye lookalike how happy jamil would be and she claire would insist on paying osmans nephew whatever he wanted for the slave girl it would be one of her bridal gifts to her beloved jamil arriving at her home she hurried to find jamil he was being vigorously massaged by two young black girls but as she entered the room he sat up smiling at her his arms outstretched claire flew into them and was rewarded with a kiss a kiss that flamed into quick desire for both of them get out claire hissed at the two slaves and they fled jamil didnt even wait for the door to close behind them before he was pulling her clothing off and drawing her down onto the couch with him being already hard he wasted no time on the preliminaries and parting her thighs thrust into her with one smooth motion ahhh nilak my love he murmured moving quickly on her and claire sighed with delight afterward as they lay together he nibbling on her shoulder she said excitedly i have just come from the house of osman the astrologer my darling and what do you think i saw a slave girl walking in the garden the favorite of his nephew she is a twin to skye omalley the same gardenia skin the same marvelous black hair and although i was not close enough to tell i will wager the same blue eyes i want to buy her from osmans nephew for you no he said you must be mistaken there could not be two women in the entire world who look like skye muna el khalid but she does i tell you claire insisted i know her as well as you do jamil after all she was married to my brother this slave girl could be her twin jamil agha sat up you are certain he said sharply i am certain perhaps it is she the beauteous skye herself he half whispered to himself dear allah to have her in my power it cannot be skye jamil she grieves in ireland for her dead husband and besides osman knew her too how could skye become the favorite of his nephew without him knowing it this wench looks very like her but shes much younger let us go to osmans house now jamil said eagerly it is almost sunset and he is a hospitable man i am sure i can get a look at the girl if the family is at the evening meal and if she is all you say she is then we will buy her then and there he scrambled to his feet help me to dress nilak and then see that the slaves ready my horse as she aided her lover claire began to grow uneasy perhaps she had made a mistake in mentioning the favorite of osmans nephew and her startling resemblance to skye omalley jamil was far too eager and what if this little upstart of a slave were to supplant her in her beloveds affections never she reassured herself let jamil sate his lusts on the girl she nilak would be his legal wife in just a short while and then if the girl grew difficult she would simply disappear besides jamil would soon grow tired of her as he did of all women but claire she smiled to herself and went to order jamils horse and her palanquin it was a simple but filling meal that was served in the house of osman that night a whole redeyed mullet had been poached and was presented upon a bed of greens surrounded by lemons carved to represent seashells a wellroasted capon stuffed with dried peaches apricots and plums sat on its platter of blue fezware surrounded by matching bowls of saffroned rice and steamed artichokes one enormous bowl of couscous had been placed midtable and the marvelous scent of the wheat grains the lamb chunks and the many vegetables assaulted the senses of the four diners an individual loaf of flat bread warm from the ovens was placed at each setting as were small kebobs of kid green and red peppers and small onions hot from the grill there was a small bowl of yogurt at each place for dipping and a large glass dish filled with green and black olives when the diners had done justice to the meal and their profuse compliments had been sent to the cook who waited anxiously in the kitchen the table was cleared of the main meal and the fruits large seville oranges dark purple grapes golden pears and fat green figs were brought out along with delicate gazelle horn pastries and bowls of pistachio nuts a slave was handing around the delicate porcelain cups of black coffee when jamil agha boldly entered the room osman almost swallowed whole the grape he had just popped into his mouth and alima gasped audibly jamil did not notice his eyes were glued upon skye who was wondering what bad fairy had pushed jamil back into her life on the very night she had planned her escape from algiers skye knew that her only hope was in being muna the slave girl of the lord kedar and no one else then her eyes moved to the woman who mincingly accompanied jamil and she felt her anger well claire oflaherty the cursed claire crossing the room in large quick strides jamil reached skye and pulled her roughly up by the soul of the prophet he murmured excitedly you are truly a twin to skye muna el khalid i must have you and i will his hateful hand was cupping her chin angrily skye yanked her head away from his grasp as kedar recovering from his shock leapt to his feet with a roar of pure outrage and his hand went to his dagger you are a dead man he hissed no one touches what is mine without my permission you have offended me whoever you are and i will have satisfaction jamil with another burning look at skye reluctantly turned to osman is this loud fool your nephew osman osman nodded feeling strangely calm my nephew kedar ibn omar my lord jamil agha for your sake i will forgive him tell the fool who i am kedar this is jamil agha retired commandant of the sultans casbah fortress and it is rumored soon to be the new dey of algiers his rank does not give him the right to touch my property without my express permission and where muna is concerned you know my feelings uncle kedar turned to jamil my lord he said this woman is my betrothed wife you have rendered me a fierce insult by your actions if however you will offer me an apology for the sake of my uncle who obviously knows you well i will consider the matter closed i would be reluctant to come between my uncle and a friend i want to buy the woman jamil answered what kedar was astounded i want to buy your slave woman jamil repeated look at her osman is she not the twin to khalid el beys wife skye i must have her she has dark hair and blue eyes like the lady skye i will grant you jamil agha but other than that i see no great resemblance you must she is a mirror image of the lady skye nilak come forward my love you know my betrothed wife the lady nilak osman she knew the lady skye in her own land is this woman not exactly like her nilak my pet exactly my lord claire answered slowly aware that the kedars slave girl was fixing her with a murderous gaze in fact if i did not know that skye omalley was in ireland or england at this time i would swear it was she i fail to see a true resemblance osman said stubbornly i want her jamil said urgently name your price nephew of osman whatever you desire i will pay for i must have her she is not for sale kedar repeated icily she is to become my wife shortly he stared angrily at jamil agha name your price kedar ibn omar everything in this world has a price she is not for sale jamil agha can you not understand me i am to marry this woman when the fast month is over she is the one i have chosen to bear my heirs she is not for sale kedars mouth was set in a grim line and his eyes were snapping angrily some instinct told him that this jamil agha was a great danger to him and all his senses were poised and alert i must have her jamil repeated almost hypnotically and seemingly to himself i must he looked directly at kedar if you will not sell her to me then i must take her i am a janissary and by the sultans own law what i desire is mine i would not cheat you kedar ibn omar so i ask you a final time to name your price if you do not then i shall simply confiscate this slave for myself kedar felt anger an incredible raging burning anger overcome him in a quick sweep the blood pounded in his ears and in his head then suddenly he saw floating in a red mist before his bulging eyes the smug satisfied face of jamil agha he could almost hear his enemys unspoken words you are helpless the woman is now mine there is nothing you can do to prevent me taking her in his minds eye kedar saw the flawless nudity of muna writhing beneath the other man gaining pleasure from him giving pleasure to him his control snapped and with an animal bellow of undiluted rage he swiftly brought his hand up threw himself at jamil and drove his dagger deep into the other mans throat jamil died in an instant his eyes wide with surprise as he crumpled to the floor his dark red blood pumping out to stain both his robes and kedars osman stared both shocked and surprised while alima and skye clung to each other horrified all three watching as nilak added to the tragedy by stabbing kedar in a screaming fury at almost the same moment as jamil hit the floor she drove her own dagger into kedars chest following him down onto the floor to rage and cry as her bloodied weapon descended again and again and yet again until finally osman pulled her off the already dead body of his nephew and disarmed her have the servants call the guard osman commanded his shaking wife and alima fled the death chamber nilak was silent now but slowly she raised her eyes and fixed them upon skye it is you isnt it she said despairingly skye turned away uncertain as to whether to answer her old enemy skye omalley claire hissed the name it is you i know it at least tell me i am not mad skye whirled about you have always been touched with madness claire and you destroy everything you come in contact with you were responsible for the destruction of your brother and poor constanza burke my husbands former wife and now both jamil agha and kedar you dont mention your beloved husband niall burke claire taunted nastily perhaps you dont know that i was responsible i know what you were responsible for claire i know that you drove poor sister mary penitent to attempt murder i know that you saw that my husband was sold into the galleys but he is free now claire he is safely on board one of my ships and i join him tonight in that claire you have failed i hate you claire snarled venomously i have always hated you at that moment the doors to the dining room opened to admit a janissary capitan and several of his men osman quickly stepped forward and skye with incredible instinct moved back into the shadows slipping behind a tapestry my lord osman what has happened here praise allah capitan amhet there has been a terrible tragedy here my nephew and jamil agha fought over this woman and when kedar killed jamil she killed kedar that is not so screamed claire he lies he lies there was another woman that my beloved lord jamil wished to purchase and this kedar took offense and drew his dagger and murdered jamil agha osman shook his head as you can see he said quietly there are but four places at my table my nephew myself this woman and jamil agha ate here tonight the lady nilak was betrothed to jamil agha and yet she flirted outrageously with my nephew who is as you well know a connoisseur of beautiful women he was intrigued and beguiled by her charms by her immodest and unveiled face and blond fairness she is the cause of all of this osmans voice began to rise hysterically she is a wicked infidel woman who has caused the deaths of my old friend and my beloved nephew i demand the deys justice i demand it now then he broke into harsh sobs that he tried hard to contain obviously embarrassed to show such a weakness before other men the janissaries looked away in order that osman might have a moment to collect himself then capitan amhet said we will take the woman before the dey now my lord osman will you come with us to tell him your tale he lies claire screamed once more but she was silenced by a brutal blow to her head from the capitan silence infidel bitch how dare you dispute the word of the famous lord osman his honesty is legend the capitan pushed her back into the arms of two of his men hold her and keep her silent he commanded it is late said osman seemingly beginning to recover from his bout with grief the dey is old and i would hesitate to awaken him at so late an hour take the infidel woman with you and keep her the night after first prayers at dawn i will appear before the dey to demand justice capitan ahmet let his dark eyes slide over claires full bosom my men could use a treat before they must return to the fast in the morning he said meaningfully i will take your suggestion my lord osman i will see you at the palace directly after first light capitan ahmet then signaled his men with a wave of his hand and they halfdragged halfcarried claire from the chamber rest well capitan osman said softly and the capitan turned in the doorway and laughed osman waited until he heard the main door to his home close and the tramp of the patrol move off down the silent street before he said quietly you may come out now skye my daughter they may kill her with their attentions skye said as she came back into the light of the room then again they may not claire was once a famous whore in london better she die under the janissaries attentions this night my daughter for if she lives she will not survive the hooks skye shivered she knew all about the infamous hooks that were imbedded in the city walls which served as places of execution for those unfortunate enough to be condemned to them claire having actually murdered one man and having been accused of being responsible for the murder of another would most certainly be sentenced to the hooks her death would be a most painful one for the city executioners knew just how to toss a body onto the hooks so that the condemned victim lived in screaming agony for some timea warning to those tempted to mayhem an amusement to others god have mercy on her skye whispered you pray for such an enemy my daughter it is a horrible way to die osman even for claire he placed a fatherly arm about her you must rest now my daughter i will send a message to your ship that you will be delayed until morning no i would go now she said in the morning my daughter he repeated gently trust me skye have i ever disappointed you no she responded suddenly feeling totally exhausted as the shock of what had happened began to set in osman led her from the room and put her into the capable hands of his wife together the two women moved automatically toward the womens quarters where the slaves not even daring to speak helped the lady alima to put skye to bed i shall not sleep skye insisted although her eyes were heavy drink this alima insisted pushing a small cup of sweetened pomegranate juice on her friend there is in it a tiny drop of opium which will take you quickly to the land of pleasant dreams dearest friend think happy thoughts as you drift away my lady skye you are free of kedar your beloved husband awaits you and soon you will be reunited soon you will be home in your own land with your children her pleasant voice droned into skyes consciousness and skye soon found herself asleep when she awoke she felt just the tiniest bit groggy but a trip with alima to the household baths quickly made her mind sharp and quick again where is osman she asked as they returned to skyes chamber he has gone to the deys palace to testify against the lady nilak alima responded if she lived through the night skye remarked she must have else my husband would be back already he will be here to escort you safely to your ship my lady skye do not fear osman returned close to the noon hour a grim smile of satisfaction upon his face the two women hurried to his library both full of curiosity she has been executed upon the hooks he told them although she will probably live on for several hours her goods and wealth have been divided between the deystreasury and capitan ahmet it is over skye my daughter a door is closed and another is opening for you once again are you ready to depart i am ready skye said quietly her goodbyes to alima were said swiftly and privately within the library and then escorted by osman skye entered the large palanquin with him this time she felt no sadness in departing the house that had once belonged to khalid for it was now so clearly osmans house the bearers lifted the palanquin and began to move easily down the hill with their burden skye quickly noticed that they were taking the most direct route to the harbor where her own flagship waited as they exited the harbor gate nearest to the deyspalace osman commanded her look back and up a moment my daughter skye turned and the sight greeting her eyes caused her to gasp with horror and pity she swallowed hard forcing the bile back down her throat above her on the wall claire oflaherty also known in her lifetime as claro and nilak writhed weakly and helplessly one of the vicious hooks securely jabbed through her midsection another through a shoulder never again will her evil trouble you skye my daughter she has met her just end and you are at last free of her wickedness osmans voice said quietly she will die shortly and her body will rot there upon the hooks scavenged by the carrion birds and whipped by the elements until it is no more a fitting finish for a consummate villainess turn away now skye my daughter it is over it is a picture i will remember always osman skye said feelingly and she was unable to stop the tears that spilled down her pale cheeks you will forget he answered her with certainty i did not show you such a sight to distress you but rather to assure you of your adversarys end she will never harm you or yours again skye and i wanted you to be certain of that fact he reached out and touched one crystalline tear with a fingertip what a magnificent soul is housed in that beautiful body of yours my daughter it touches me beyond all that you can weep for so cruel an enemy she would not have wept for you perhaps not osman but her last hours have certainly made up for the evil she created it saddens me even now that we were so assuredly fated to be enemies he shrugged fatalistically it was allahs will skye my daughter one should never question god the palanquin suddenly stopped and was set down carefully osman parted the draperies and stepped out turning to assist skye from the vehicle they were directly before the gangway of her ship without a word she walked swiftly aboard the astrologer following behind within the safety of the master cabin she pulled her veil aside eyes shining with unshed tears she caught his hands and raised them up to kiss them fervently thank you my dear friend she said in a voice filled with emotion thank you for everything just over the horizon my dearest husband awaits me and i should not have gotten him back had it not been for you osman and your family we are ever in your debt my children and i will remember you in our prayers each night as long as we live for you have returned to us the thing most precious to us a husband and a father osman hugged her paternally half in affection half in concern it was better that she not see his face at this moment remember skye my daughter that all that happens is allahs will and with regard to each of us our chosen destiny will you try not to rail against your fate whatever it may be will you trust in the creator to care for you no matter what though sometimes the storm seems dark and without end the light will eventually overcome it that much i can promise you she drew away and smiled up at him it was the first relaxed and genuine smile he had seen on her face in a very long time i am learning osman slowly i will grant you but i am learning i will try to accept and to trust no matter what for now however i see nothing but happiness ahead for me niall and i will return to ireland and i think i shall never roam again osman smiled back at her be happy skye my daughter allah only knows that no one deserves it more than you do will we meet again osman she asked her curiosity getting the better of her perhaps he answered and then raising his hand in a gesture of farewell osman the astrologer turned and without another word left the ship finally the gangway was pulled aboard and the omalley sailors loosened the lines that bound them to the dock tossing them back to the quai as the ship began to move skye closed the cabin door and slowly began to remove her clothing thoughtfully she gazed at each piece of the silken gauze garments smoothing them carefully as the memories crowded in on her then with a sigh and a shake of her head she folded the clothes resolutely and began to draw on her own things the splitlegged skirt the silk shirt her hose her boots her belt with its celtic buckle of bright enamel for a long moment she felt very odd in such garments for she had grown used to her silken draperies with a laugh she began to brush her hair then braided it firmly into one single plait a quick glimpse in the cabins pier glass told her that skye omalley had returned and with a grin she whirled away from it opened the door and walked out upon the deck welcome back mlady bran kelly said thank you bran how is daisy well and our first bairn a lad also bran congratulations i see i shall have to train another girl to be my tiring woman now but i dont mind as long as you and daisy are happy i doubt daisy will let you mlady but time enough to argue with her when we get home bran chuckled how soon until we reach lord burkes ship bran a few hours if this breeze will hold mlady no more i promise skye walked to the bow of the ship and stood there quietly her face into the wind never once looking back at the city yes algiers had seemed a different place this time quite unlike the city she remembered adoring so in her days as khalid el beys wife then it had seemed a magical colorful wonderful place filled with love this time she had seen its harshness and its cruelty the memory of claire oflaherty twisting in agony would live with her for a long long time skye breathed deeply of the soft and warm sea air to clear her head of the memories looking back was not the answer she wanted to look forward now just over the horizon was her husband and she could hardly wait to reach him indeed had she believed that she could swim faster than her ship could sail she would have gone over the side and into the sea niall niall she cried to him with her heart skye skye niall burke twisted frantically upon the bed of the master cabin robbie robbie are you there im here lad robbie placed a calming hand on niall burkes feverish forehead and his face puckered with worry where is skye robbie where is my wife niall begged plaintively shes coming laddie robbie soothed the ill man shes on her way this very minute im thirsty robbie so thirsty niall moved restlessly once more here laddie robert small held a goblet of wine to lord burkes lips drink this niall gulped at the goblet eagerly but seconds later he was vomiting the liquid back into a basin where are my jellies robbie the comfits help when i feel poorly theyre gone mlord you ate the last of them several days ago if you only knew what was in them we might make you some i dont know robbie ive told you i dont know old rabi made them for me and hamal gave me a box just before i escaped but i have no idea what was in them nialls voice was reproachful and irritable at the same time then suddenly he slipped into a light slumber robbie sighed it was clear to him that lord burke had been poisoned with some potion why else would he be in such a state perhaps when skye came aboard her presence would encourage her husband to make a swift and full recovery robert small got up and moved to the cabin door keep an eye on his lordship he commanded the ships boy if you need me ill be topside waiting for lady burke aye sir came the obedient reply robbie stamped out on deck glad to be free of the stifling cabin with relief he drew in great lungfuls of clean sea air any sign of her he asked macguire as he came abreast of the old captain crows nest spotted a sail out of algiers harbor making for us just a minute or two ago its just visible now on the horizon hows his lordship not good i think hes dying sean and i dont know what in hell is killing him fash man niall burkes stronger than that ive known him since he was a brash young boy he cant be dying he is im telling you robbie argued worriedly hes constantly thirsty yet he cant hold anything either liquid or solid on his stomach and for two days his bowels have suffered with the bloody flux what sleep he can manage is disturbed by nightmares of horrendous proportions his eyes are red his skin and mouth so dry that both his lips and his elbows are peeling ive never seen anything like it man maybe we should cup him macguire suggested halfheartedly cup him jesu man youll kill him for sure gods bones i hope this wind holds maybe the sight of her will revive him if he dies itll kill her macguire said ominously to lose him once was bad but to lose him a second time after what shes been through he crossed himself nervously robert small stared grimly out to sea the very same thought had crossed his mind but he had anticipated a possible bad end to this whole venture and had come prepared for it he wasnt going to let her die and neither was adam de marisco de marisco had been frantic when robbie had returned to england and told him what skye had done the island lord had come off his lonely rock ready to mount an expedition to rescue skye now adam de marisco was waiting patiently in robbies own cabin to give her aid and comfort should she need it robert small watched with a sense of foreboding as bran kellys ship drew closer and closer to his own captain small lord burke is awake and calling for you the cabin boy looked anxiously up at him tugging him back into the present tell lord burke that his wifes ship is almost upon us and that i will stay on deck to greet her we will both be with him as soon as she is aboard aye sir the boy hurried back to the master cabin bran kelly maneuvered his vessel carefully in the rolling sea until the two ships were bobbing next to one another a plank was put between them and skye swiftly crossed the small space flinging herself into robbies arms with a relieved groan he hugged her enjoying the lovely fragrance of damask rose that always surrounded her god skye lass thank heaven we have you back safely she was taller than he but she still managed to press her face into his leather jerkin inhaling his tobacco scent robbie she murmured almost incoherently dearest robbie for a long moment they stood locked in a close and mutually loving embrace and then skye pulled away where is niall robbie where is my husband he looked up at her niall is in the master cabin skye lass but hes not been well for several days now not been well she repeated i dont know what it is lass hes had the bloody flux and he vomits im not a doctor he finished helplessly she whirled from him and ran directly across the deck to the owners cabin she burst through the door stopping short as she saw niall burke struggle to rise up from the bed to meet her only to fail and fall weakly back upon the coverlet niallshe was at his side in an instant her eyes huge in her white face taking in his appearance and knowing that it was not good niall she repeated he had gotten so gaunt she had not seen him in a month and he had gotten so thin and so wasted kneeling she took his hand in hers niall burke opened his silvery eyes and his glance was sad but filled with love with trembling hand he reached up to touch her cheek and then he sighed i had forgotten how soft your skin is skye my love he said low oh niall she whispered my dearest dearest love it will be all right now i promise you we are on our way home again in just a few weeks time we shall see ireland again and the children are waiting skye had no idea that she was crying the hot tears pouring down her face unchecked gods bones niall the children wont know either of us you went away just after padraics birth and deirdre was still a babe then hell be three and a half now and shes almost five my darling high time we got back to our bairns niall high time we gave them more brothers and sisters im dying he said noooooooshe sobbed the word but even as she did so she felt her heart constrict painfully as if a hand were squeezing it hard i dont want to he whispered plaintively but i am i dont know why but i am she couldnt breathe for a moment panic threatened to envelope her but then her chest heaved and air filled her lungs you are very ill niall my love she said in a firm voice a voice that belied her pounding heart but it doesnt mean you are going to die i wont let you die the ship is well provisioned with fresh foods and water and i shall cook for you myself remember you told me how ill you were those years ago when constanza took care of you its just a recurrence of your old illness youll see she finished brightly i shall make you well again he sighed sadly skye i am dying when constanza cared for me i was suffering from the effects of a nasty wound and shock i dont know what this is but i cannot last much longer he fell back on the bed again barely conscious with the effort of trying to make her understand dont die niall she pleaded piteously with him as if he had personal control over the situation you cant die not after what i have been through to help free you ton cant die his silvery gaze enveloped her again i know what you have been through my love i know you are so brave skye my darling you have the heart of a lion my love and the soul of an angel i shall miss you but i am grateful that darraghs blade did not kill me i rejoice that claires plot did not prevent us from saying our goodbyes now i know that there is a god in heaven skye for he has heard my most fervent prayers he had granted me a final glimpse of you my dearest heart she focused on him through the grayish blur of her tears and saw that he spoke a greater truth than she was willing to recognize dont leave me niall she said quietly i cannot bear it if you leave me now not now the choice is not mine to make skye now kiss me my darling wife one kiss before i must leave you a final memory for me to take with me on my journey his glance was steadfast almost sympathetic of her plight for he knew it would be far harder on her than it would be on him skye wanted to flee this nightmare in her brain pounded the one thought had it all been for this skye his voice was urgent his hand pulled loose of hers slowly she bent her head her eyes closing as her lips met with his for a brief moment she felt incredible joy at the touch of his mouth on hers but then the pressure of his kiss slackened and lifting her head skye saw that his silver eyes were suddenly dull and sightless niall burke was dead she sat frozen by his side for some time feeling nothing neither heat nor cold certainly not the beat of her heart she was numb to her very soul finally skye slowly rose and reaching up gently drew his eyelids shut farewell my first love my final love youre home safe in ireland now niall burke youre safe at long long last she turned as the door to the cabin opened and robert small entered the room hes dead robbie she said in a calm detached voice skye he moved toward her to comfort her set a course for beaumont de jaspre robbie i will not give my husbands body up to the sea i will ask permission of nicolas to bury niall in the cathedral at villerose in a few years when the flesh has rotted from his bones we will bring his remains home to ireland he would want it that way as would the old macwilliam skye tis madness you speak let us bury him now if you give him to the sea robbie then i will follow him into the sea do you understand me her voice was flinty hard its tone unlike anything he had ever heard from her before robert small knew instinctively that he must not argue with her or anger her she was poised on the very brink of madness and the merest faintest touch would send her hurtling into its dark depths all right lass he said quietly well do it your way do you want the body removed from the cabin now or shall we leave it the cargo hold is empty but for ballast aye then put him there robbie but not in the dark let there be candles about him and a velvet cloth on his bier i want a watch about him the entire time and i shall pray by his side until we reach port let me have the boy bring you something to eat before you begin your vigil robbie suggested gently some wine she answered nothing more i could not eat now some wine he repeated and backed from the cabin she stood where he had left her silent and stonelike the door opened again and she heard a small voice say mlady the wine you asked for is here looking down skye encountered the curious glance of a flamehaired boy about nine the wine mlady he held out a small tray upon which rested a goblet what is your name boy michael mlady michael what dont know mlady captain small found me in an alley with me head all bloodied i dont remember nothing except im called michael i have a brother named michael michael he is a priest would you like to be a priest no mlady i wants to be like captain small skye looked down at the boy and touching his hair with a gentle gesture said perhaps you will be like him one day michael hes a good man to follow yes mlady the boy said and then hurried from the room the doorway was instantly filled by adam de mariscos huge bulk skye he stood looking anxiously in at her come in adam she said youre not surprised to see me little girl he stated flatly have you not always been there when i needed you adam he stepped across the threshold and closed the door behind him i should never have let you go from me skye the choice was neither yours nor mine adam we are both elizabeth tudors loyal servants besides once my friend osman knew where niall was he would have found me wherever i was have i not given you enough pain adam that you seek me out to suffer further i only suffer because you suffer skye his arms went about her and he held her tightly against his chest then without a word adam picked her up carried her across the cabin and sat down with her in the stern window seat he cradled her tenderly as he would have cradled a child and sighing she pressed her face for a moment against his silkcovered chest the smell of him was familiar and reassuring can you not cry little girl he asked her she shook her head in the negative i seem to have no tears left in me adam i have wept so often for niall burke that now in the hour of his death there is nothing inside of me but a vast and cold emptiness he understood of all the people she knew in the world he understood the best i am here skye he said quietly i will not leave you i know adam was her answer and then they settled into silent sorrow it didnt surprise him that she fell asleep in his protective embrace he watched her slip from the painful reality of consciousness into a deep slumber not moving as several seamen led by robbie entered the cabin and quietly removed lord burkes body then the boy michael returned to change the sheets and coverlet upon the bed and when he had departed adam de marisco placed skye into it carefully removing her boots her hose her belt and her doublelegged skirt having tucked her snugly beneath the down coverlet he slipped from the cabin knowing that she would sleep for many hours for robbie had put a sleeping draught into her wine sleep adam knew was the best healer of all skye slept for almost two days her vigil forgotten and by the time she awoke they were arriving in beaumont de jaspre her long rest had wiped the dark smudges from beneath her beautiful seablue eyes but she was as calm and emotionless as when she had fallen asleep she sat propped up by several large pillows giving orders from her bed on the small table by her was a plate with the remains of an egg that had been poached in marsala to tempt her appetite skye had eaten it but it had had no taste she ate to survive nothing more will you go to edmond de beaumont robbie and request a place in the cathedral for nialls body tell him i will meet all expenses involved and of course there will be a generous donation to the bishop for his kindness then go to the coffinmaker i want the finest what of the young duc skye lass what about him she looked puzzled he loved you robbie said helplessly he has i am sure by this time found a bride besides i am not interested in taking another husband robbie and i am most certainly not interested in nicolas st adrian he was a most charming and loving man but that moment is past one should always know when a moment is past when it is time to walk quietly away what if they want to see you then they are most certainly welcome to visit me on board this ship but please make it most clear robbie that i will not set foot in the castle robbie bowed formally as you wish lady burke he said shortly and backed from the room what will you do once niall is buried skye adam de marisco asked i dont know adam sail home but then where is my home is it at burke castle i think not i have never liked burke castle but i lived there because it was nialls home innisfana is the home of the omalleys but it really belongs to my stepmother anne and her sons ballyhennessey is ewans holding and lynmouth is robins only greenwood my london house is truly mine and for now i am not of a mind to live in london i dont know where i belong adam she smiled a small rueful smile skye omalley the wealthy and allpowerful she gently mocked herself is without a place to lay her head come with me he said to her where i am of a mind to visit my mother he said slowly a smile lighting his big features and where does your mother live she demanded a small smile surfacing on her own lips in the valley of the loire i told you that my mother remarried when i was twelve my stepfather is the comte de cher and the owner of archambault a château located on the river cher a small ways from blois archambault cannot rival chambord or amboise or blois or even chenonceaux but it is a charming and warm place i would like you to see it skye i would like you to meet my family how strange she remarked seriously i have never thought of you having a family adam yet i do though i left france twenty years ago to return permanently to lundy i have occasionally made visits to see my mother and her family but this time i have not been back in seven years did you know that i have two full sisters a halfsister and two halfbrothers skye they are all grown and married but i have family sweet skye i have a family almost as large as your own come with me to them why not she answered flatly there is nothing else for me to do now you will have to go home eventually skye you have your children but for now i think it best you come with me and purge your grief for niall burke adam my children do not need me with the exception of the last two they are virtually grown and the little ones have done without me for two years if i never came back it would not matter to them i have no husband and i am not needed by anyone the omalleys have obviously managed quite well in my absence so what is to keep me from joining you at archambault she said dully he had never heard her sound like this so spiritless so lacking in enthusiasm for everything life in particular he would have rather she had screamed and raged at the heavens for nialls death he would have far preferred she sobbed and wept at her loss this cool detachment was a little frightening adam prayed it would pass with time she was wrong he thought her children did need her and more important from his point of view he adam de marisco needed her once he had lost her once he had deliberately let her go now he had no intention of ever letting her go again she didnt know it yet but he was never going to let elizabeth tudor use skye again he would never again let her be helpless in the face of the queens demands skye would not return across the channel until she was his wife once she had accused him of not loving her enough to fight for her this time he would fight any and all who tried to take her away from him skye was his for now and for all time part france chapter edmond de beaumont sighed sympathetically of course skye may bury her husband in the cathedral msieur robert pauvre belle how is she robbie shrugged she grieves but shows it not her mien is strange and distant but i have known her for so long that i know she is in shock over the suddenness of lord burkes death edmond nodded will she see me of course robbie said but she did say that you must tell the duc shell not set foot in this castle edmond nodded i understand but i doubt he will he has a wife robbie prayed the answer would be yes but of course edmond said we could not take the chance of the french claiming beaumont de jaspre three months after skye left him nicolas was married to madelaine di monaco their first child is due within the next few weeks good robbie said shes poised on the edge of insanity edmond and shed not be able to cope with the young duc spouting a lot of passionate nonsense at her im glad that nicolas is happy edmond nodded again but said nothing it was better that robert small not know that nicolas still hungered for skye he had done his duty to the duchy by marrying a young daughter of monacos prince honore the duchesse madelaine was a lovely child of sixteen with palegold hair and soft brown eyes where skye had been tall and slender madelaine was petite and round the two women were alike only in their sensitivity and intelligence edmond had chosen his uncles bride carefully seeking someone who would understand nicolass disappointment and be willing to wait for it to ease he had found the perfect candidate in madelaine di monaco who adored the young duc from the first but sensing his pain sought to soothe it i hope for your sakes the babe is a boy robbie said pleasantly yes we all pray for it edmond answered still both nicolas and madelaine are young and healthy they should quickly fill the nursery of the castle the door to edmonds library opened and a lovely blond girl entered the room petit ami i heard that we had a visitor yes madelaine this is an english lord my friend robert small robert may i present to you madelaine the duchesse de beaumont de jaspre robbie his court manners elegant bowed low over the little duchesses hand madame he said i am honored merci msieur robert i hope your stay in beaumont will be a happy one alas madame la duchesse my mission is a sad one but it need not concern one so fair robert has asked our permission to bury one of his passengers an irish nobleman who died aboard his ship the gentlemans widow asked he be buried here rather than at sea edmond explained the poor lady madelaine exclaimed is there something that i might do for her something that would give her pleasure even in her grief merci madame la duchesse robbie said genuinely touched by the young girl lady burke needs nothing at the moment but a bit of peace this incident has been very hard on her as you can well imagine i will go with robert now madelaine edmond said hopping down from his chair where is nicolas it is his day to sit in the cours des aides edmond it should soon be over though i peeked earlier and there were not many cases to be heard or judgments to be rendered today will you ask him to come to me when he is finished madelaine she nodded and then turned her sweet smile on robbie will you stay and dine with us msieur robert alas madame la duchesse i cannot my thanks however he made her a polite leg and the young duchesse nodded toward him before departing the room shes lovely he said to edmond he ought to be damned happy with her she loves him was the simple reply does she know about skye only that there was another woman and that the woman and nicolas could not marry edmond said no one in beaumont de jaspre would take it upon themselves to tell her about duc fabrons wife for they would not hurt madelaine good then with luck she need never know who skye is unless nicolas makes a fool of himself robert he is not entirely over losing skye surely he wouldnt risk hurting the lass especially since she is soon to give him a child no no of course you are right edmond said and prayed that nicolas would behave sensibly he walked to the table stood on his toes to reach a decanter and poured them each a small goblet of beaumont rose then edmond handed robbie his glass regained his chair and lifting his goblet said to better days mon ami aye robbie agreed and together they downed the wine as the cool sweet liquid slid down their throats the door to edmond de beaumonts library swung open again and nicolas st adrian duc de beaumont strode into the room where is she he demanded his green eyes flashing with impatience sit down mon oncle edmond warned the duc sit down and you will be told what you need to know nicolas flung himself into a chair and with a gesture of frustration ran his hand through his auburn hair please he said to robert small where is she is she all right lady burke is aboard her ship which is anchored at quaiside in your harbor monseigneur robbie said she has returned to beaumont de jaspre to ask that you allow her to bury her late husband lord niall burke in a niche in the cathedral she intends in several years when the flesh has left his bones to return those bones to his own home in ireland in the meantime she must inter him where she can retrieve him when the time comes msieur edmond has graciously agreed to allow lord burke burial space ma pauvre doucette nicolas said softly i must go to her he stood up and was gone from the room before the tiny edmond could prevent his leaving nicolas the dwarfs voice followed his uncle dont fret yourself edmond robbie said an amused smile creasing his face do you remember lord de marisco the blackhaired giant indeed i do edmond replied he is with her aboard her ship and he will not allow nicolas either to hurt her or to make a fool of himself it is better this way my friend the young duchesse will not be party to any of what transpires between those three and nicolas will understand once and for all that skye is not for him edmond relaxed back into his seat you are right robert it is better this way more wine and together the two sat companionably quaffing the beaumont rose while nicolas st adrian called for his horse and then hurried from the castle down through his tiny capital to the harbor it wasnt hard to find her vessel for the pennant flying from its mast the gold sea dragon upon a field of sea blue was as clear a signal as a beacon on a black night as he stamped up the gangplank he was met by bran kelly msieur le duc bran said bowing politely it is good to see you again and you captain kelly your good daisy is well i trust yes monseigneur announce me to your mistress captain as you will monseigneur please to follow me bran led him across the deck to skyes quarters knocked at the door and entering said duc nicolas to see you mlady he may enter came her voice but nicolas was already pushing past bran into the cabin doucette monseigneur her voice was impersonal her gaze equally so nicolas st adrian felt some of the confidence drain out of him the pale beautiful woman garbed in black who stood before him was somewhat forbidding his remembrance was of a passionate creature whose every movement every gesture every word was filled with life and love the lady before him was however quite distant and cool he recognized the face and the exquisite form but as for the rest i welcome your return to beaumont de jaspre madame he said feebly for a second her manner softened thank you nicolas i am so sorry to inflict this pain upon you but there was nowhere else i might go you do understand he nodded slowly and then he said quickly i have never stopped loving you doucette never and his arms were about her drawing her close to him i however stopped loving you the moment i knew that my beloved niall was alive she said harshly pushing him away freeing herself from his unwanted embrace for shame nicolas do you think that because my husband is dead i shall come running to you what of your bride what of the child she carries they mean nothing to me doucette he exclaimed rashly you only you mean anything to me i have prayed dear god i have gotten down on my knees and prayed for your return to me i have not prayed like that since i was a child you are still a child nicolas a selfish little boy do you hear what you are saying you are saying that you will abandon your wife and your heir for me where is your sense of responsibility nicolas did i teach you nothing your duty is to beaumont de jaspre and then to your people you also now owe a duty to your wife and the child that will soon be born i do not want you i want no man ever again all i ask of you is that you allow me to bury my husband here if you are not of a mind to grant me that request then tell me now and i will be on my way doucette i implore you he said and she felt a certain pity for him nicolas skye said in a sad yet patient voice i implore you i implore you to give up this fantasy you seem to have about me i loved you i will not deny that fact but now i question the quality of that love i felt no reluctance in leaving you nicolas i was only sad to go because i disliked hurting you i would have never returned to beaumont de jaspre were it not for niall even if i had not found him nicolas i would have gone home to ireland or perhaps back to elizabeth tudors court but i would not have come back to you instinctively you must have sensed that and you did what you should have done you married and begat an heir she reached out and touched his face gently i left the gullthis afternoon and walked about the market by the harbor a hood about my head so i might not be recognized the talk is all of the little duchesse madelaine and her coming child nicolas they say she is a madonna and that god blessed them greatly when duc fabron made you his heir and you took madelaine di monaco to wife you have done the right thing nicolas why can you not see it why do you seek to destroy that which has brought you the most happiness can you tell me truthfully that you do not love your wife of course i love her he exclaimed one cannot know madelaine and not love her she is sweetness itself but with you it was different she is honey but you are fire doucette how i crave your warmth skye allowed herself a little smile nicolas would ever be the romantic frenchman he was irrepressible fire mon brave can destroy you she said hear me well nicolas when niall burke died i died oh i realize that my mind and my body still function but believe me when i tell you that i am a dead woman there is naught left inside me but a wasteland go home to your wife nicolas and leave me be he stood staring dumbly at her and skye would have sworn that there were tears in his forestgreen eyes then suddenly from the comer of the cabin a shadow arose and nicolas was stunned to see a giant of a man with ravenblack hair and smoky blue eyes come forth you have heard lady burke lad go now pure unreasoning anger swept over nicolas and blindly he drew his sword who is this man he shouted at skye he is your lover i know he is your lover he lunged murderously at adam adam de marisco stepped easily aside and with a quick movement disarmed the younger man i am adam de marisco the lord of lundy island msieur le duc my own holding is larger than this tiny bit of land you call a duchy i have known skye for many years i intend to marry skye when she is over her grief it is an honest offer which i can make her but you cannot monseigneur now you may leave this ship under your own power as lady burke has asked or i shall toss you from the upper deck if you so choose msieur le duc he smiled affably down into nicolass surprised face adam skye gently admonished him then she turned to nicolas please go nicolas what was once between us is but a memory yet a sweet memory doucette and one i will remember all of my life the anger had drained from him as adams sensible speech penetrated his brain gallantly he took her hand and raised it to his lips to kiss it ardently you are welcome in beaumont de jaspre as long as you choose to stay and i shall not disturb your mourning again skye forgive the impetuosity of my behavior doucette i have really tried to be as you advised me to be and i believed i was succeeding until i learned of your arrival skye gently disengaged her hand from his you are strong of will nicolas you will not backslide again now go home to your wife after nialls funeral i do not want to see you again he nodded and sending a warning look at adam said i will know if you are not good to her monseigneur de marisco then he turned and was quickly gone from the cabin if you laugh i shall never forgive you skye snapped at adam whose whole face was collapsing with mirth i cannot help but wonder what revenge your little french cock would take on me were i to mistreat you you had no right to tell him that i will marry you she said with more spirit than he had seen her show in the last few hours but you are going to marry me skye i have no intention of allowing you to be used by anyone ever again even you adam she asked cruelly even me little girl he said affably and skye found herself totally nonplussed by his attitude niall lord burke was placed in a wooden coffin and the coffin put into a marble vault in the chapel of st anne in the duchys cathedral père henri now bishop of beaumont de jaspre blessed the tomb and then said a mass over the remains he had hoped to comfort skye and so that he might not be hurt she told him that he had but the truth was that she felt empty niall was dead and she was haunted by the thought that it had all been for nothing she bid robbie and bran kelly a hasty farewell i cant go back she told robert small not yet i am not ready to face either my family or my children or the queen especially not the queen and lord burghley god only knows what plan they have for me this time robbie and i am not strong enough to deal with them where will you be he questioned her with adam he will make no demands on me robbie he is taking me to visit his mother at archambault in the loire valley robert small nodded he had never seen her so low she would be safe with adam de marisco and for now that was all that mattered shall i tell the queen if she asks where you are can you deny elizabeth tudor robbie yes he said without hesitation i can for you skye lass if asked i shall say you are in france but i know not where thank you robbie she replied hugging him hard nicolas st adrian had insisted on outfitting them for their journey you are whether you remember it or not the dowager duchesse of this little kingdom of mine he told her firmly i would be remiss in my duties to my late brother if i did not see that you had a coach outriders and your own saddle horses she thanked him there in the cathedral where she had been making her goodbyes you are generous nicolas you will also find all your clothes packed and stored in the coach doucette your daisy would not bring them back with her to england saying that you would have no use there for french feathers as she so tardy put it those feathers however will stand you in good stead now as you travel across france you once more have my thanks she told him he nodded briefly go with god doucette he said lifting her hand to his lips and placing a tender kiss upon it thank you nicolas she said softly and i hope that it is a healthy son your petite duchesse carries then skye turned away from the young duc and slipping her arm through adams left the cathedral at the foot of the steps was a fine dark blue traveling coach with the coat of arms of beaumont de jaspre emblazoned on its sides upon the box sat a coachman and his assistant there were a dozen armed outriders four of whom would ride before the coach four behind and two on either side there were two mounted grooms each leading a pedigreed horse the coachmans assistant was quickly down to open the door of the vehicle and help skye into it the interior was as elegant and as luxurious as the exterior the walls padded in fine soft creamcolored leather the seats done in paleblue velvet the windows which could be raised or lowered were venetian glass edged in bright brass on each side of the coach were delicate crystal vases filled with fragrant arrangements of dried lavender and lemon thyme and small carefully mounted crystal lamps their gold holders fitted with pure beeswax tapers you will find that the back of the seat facing you pulls down madame the coachmans assistant said should you need it there is a lap robe as well as a basket with fruit cheese bread and wine she nodded her thanks and the assistant withdrew to climb back onto the box while adam pulled himself up into the coach the door securely shut the vehicle rumbled slowly off across the cathedral square through the narrow streets and finally onto the north road that led to france and into the loire valley skye never looked back she had done what her instinct had told her to do with nialls body he had not been lost to the sea and in this she had cheated mannanan maclir one day niall burke would come home to ireland and be buried in irish soil next to his father where he belonged she could almost feel the old macwilliams approval of her deed they rode in silence the entire day and when evening came the coach stopped at a comfortablelooking inn despite the elegance of their equipage only one room could be given them for the inn was crowded adam offered to sleep in the stables with the outriders but skye would not hear of it i think that we can share a bed platonically she said and he nodded i think you only agree to let me in your room so you will have someone to maid you he teased her gently skye had refused to take a girl from beaumont to be her servant she was not so helpless she had declared that she could not care for herself the relatively short time of their journey once they were at archambault adams mother would see she had someone to care for her they ate a simple country meal of roasted duck artichokes with olive oil and tarragon vinegar new bread a soft cheese and a bowl of early cherries the innkeeper served them a smooth rich burgundy wine with their meal afterward they watched as a troupe of gypsies played and danced in the courtyard for the guests coins when the gypsies had finally disappeared back to their encampment adam and skye climbed the stairs to the inns second floor where their room was situated it was a cheerful airy chamber overlooking the moonlit fields there was a fireplace in which a small fire burned to ward off the evenings chill a chair and a big comfortable bed with blue and white linen hangings the bed had been opened by a maid and beckoned them enticingly their coachman had brought skye a small trunk that he told her contained the things she would need on her journey the duchesse madelaine packed them herself for you madame you know the duchesse skye queried him curious ah yes madame my wife is her tiring woman we came with her from monaco your mistress knew that i was the last duchesse of beaumont yes madame you will thank her for me when you return to beaumont de jaspre her kindness is appreciated skye thought about nicolass young wife as she opened the tiny trunk and lifted out a simple white silk nightgown she was far wiser and more mature than nicolas suspected skye smiled nicolas although he didnt know it was in very good hands and beaumont de jaspre was going to prosper what are you smiling about little girl she looked up at him nothing adam just a womans thoughts will you unhook my gown she felt his big hands gently undoing the fastenings there he said when he had finally undone the last of them adam hadnt realized the effort it would take on his part not to touch her am i a ravening beast he questioned himself that i cannot undo her gown for her without wanting to make love to her dear god he loved her so very much he wanted to take her in his arms and comfort her he wanted to drive away all the bad times in her life and make her remember only the good slowly he turned away and began to undress himself pulling from his saddlebags a white silk nightshirt that he rarely wore tonight however it would be best to have as much as he could put between himself and skye when he turned back to her she was seated on the edge of the bed brushing her long black hair with a gold brush would you rather i slept on the floor little girl he asked in what he hoped passed for an impersonal voice i could easily wrap myself in the coverlet and with a pillow for my head i should be quite comfortable the floor is damp she said looking up at him with a smile then her eyes widened and skye giggled adam looked puzzled what is it he asked youre wearing a nightshirt she exclaimed amused youre wearing a nightgown he countered ive never seen you in a nightshirt she answered i never felt the need to wear one with you skye he said solemnly she thought a moment and then said oh in a small voice and her teeth caught at her bottom lip ill sleep on the floor he said no adam youll catch your death if you do look the bed is large and comfortable she paused a moment then added and if i am not ready or able to to you know what it is i say we are two grown people who surely can control our passions i know i am being unfair adam but i need you near me do you understand what it is i am saying get into bed skye the night has grown chill you need your sleep and we have an early start obediently she climbed into the big bed and snuggled down beneath the warm coverlet bending adam blew out the single candle and only the low firelight lit the room as he slipped in next to her for some minutes they lay in silence upon their backs each stretched out long and stiff and then adam quietly reached out and took her hand in his large paw you say nothing and yet i can hear you screaming with your pain little girl tell me now tell me what is in your mind and heart tell me before it grows so big that there is no controlling it and you destroy yourself it was all for nothing she said the anguish plain in her trembling voice it was all for nothing adam she sighed and a shudder rippled through her slender frame niall is dead he is as dead now as he was to me two years ago but two years ago i had learned to live with it do you know what i have done adam i have whored i am no better than those women who inhabit the waterfront brothels in every port i used my body and i have been used i did not think when i agreed to osmans proposal that it would be so hard and perhaps if my husband had survived it might not have been but niall is dead now and i cannot reconcile myself to the fact that it has all been for nothing you got him out of morocco skye he died a free man it was as if she did not hear him or if she did the facts were not enough to soothe her kedar she said gods blood adam how i hate the very sound of his name he was osmans nephew and the man whose slave i was look at my ankle adam she stuck her foot out from beneath the coverlet and in the dim light from the fire he could see something glittering on her ankle do you know what is written on the medallion of the anklet it says munapropertyofkedari have not yet had the time to have a smith remove it propertyofkedaradam and i was most assuredly that my very life depended upon his goodwill he possessed me with a ferocity i have never known adam he took everything i was forced to offer and much i did not i spent those months in his possession terrified that he would devour me both body and soul with his passion with his terrible need to consume me he did things to me adam things that i did not imagine a man could do to a woman and it was never enough oh god i shall never be free of him the memories of him will haunt me all my life and the memories of my beloved niall will haunt me too i see now that it would have been better if i had left him to meet his end in morocco rather than to betray the vows we made before god when we were wed oh adam i am so lost with a low growl of anger adam climbed from the bed and flung the covers back gently he lifted her ankle in one hand while with the other he snapped the gold band from her leg as if it were a ribbon striding to the window he threw back the shutters and flung the offensive anklet as far as he could then he closed the shutters again and calmly climbed back into the bed skye turned and pressing her head into his shoulder began to weep stunned adam wrapped his arms about her and let her cry tears he knew were a catharsis there was nothing else he could do for he could never completely wipe away the terrible memories she would retain of her time with kedar gradually her sobs died and her breathing evened out and she slept nesded against him adam also slept then only to be awakened by piteous cries as skye caught in the middle of a dream relived some of her moroccan adventure he did things to me adam things that i did not imagine a man could do to a woman she had said he was both horrified and shamed by what a member of his sex had done to her skye was a woman to be cherished and adored she was a good companion and a brave comrade she had been made to be loved and she was the best friend he had ever had it both pained and angered him that she had suffered so it took them eight days to reach archambault from beaumont and during those eight days adam learned in detail skyes adventures in morocco after that first night he had insisted that she tell him everything and as more and more of her agony came to the surface the less violent her nightmares became as he listened he realized how very much he loved her this time she was not going to get away from him and the afternoon they neared his mother and stepfathers château through the exquisitely rolling green countryside of the loire river valley he told her so you are going to marry me skye i will never marry again adam i have had all i can of belonging to a man i will be my own mistress until i die please try to understand that my darling i understand that you have had a terrible experience skye but i am determined that you will be my wife being married to me will not make you my property you will always be your own woman but you will be my wife as well i love you little girl i have for so very long a time my greatest treasures are my good name and my honor i would bestow my name upon you how cruel you make me feel to refuse such a magnificent gift adam but no i must be free please try to understand he sighed you need time skye and i am willing to give you all the time you need you are impossible she scolded him i am a man in love he countered you are the first woman i have asked to marry me in twentytwo years skye oh no adam de marisco she cried outraged you shall not make me feel guilty because the daughter of some obscure count once refused your suit you know better where i am concerned you will marry me he laughed pulling her into his arms and nuzzling her neck with his lips dammit little girl i love the smell of you she pushed halfheartedly against his chest i wont she said stubbornly yet skye felt lighter of heart than she had in months adam de marisco was so very good for her and she knew it suddenly he was serious again and he gently tipped her face up to his his thumb and forefinger on her chin his smoky blue eyes seemed to envelope her and she thought for a startled moment that she might faint but she didnt instead her heart raced madly and a faint flush touched her skin as he murmured in his deep voice i adore you you sapphireeyed celtic witch and then his mouth was closing over hers in a tender and melting kiss that left her both breathless and near to tears you see he teased her when he had lifted his lips from hers you are yet alive and still very much a woman little girl she was surprised when niall had died she had thought that she could never again stomach a mans touch not after kedar and his excesses still this was adam her dearest and most beloved of friends but deep in her heart skye knew that was not the whole truth she had always loved adam in her fashion and she strongly suspected that love was now deepening in a far different way i will not give up my freedom she thought furiously to herself iwont adams mouth was smiling knowingly at her and she hit him upon the chest with her fist i will be my own woman you ass i will never again belong to anyone but myself stop smiling adam oh i hate you when you are smug he began to laugh and his laughter warmed her much to her outrage in the end little girl you will marry me he said in a voice deep and tender with his love for her you may take your time skye whatever time you need to admit to what you know in your own heart god only knows i have proved a patient man where you are concerned hah she snapped at him how many times did you turn me away adam de marisco twice as i recall and now suddenly it is i who would turn you away but you will be patient i swear to you i will not marry again i will learn to use men as they use women i wonder how patient you will feel when you see me flirting with another man adam he grinned infuriatingly at her get it out of your system little girl and when you are ready to be sensible again i will be waiting patiently for you as i always have ohhh gods bones he was making her so angry he was treating her as if she were a child instead of a woman of thirtyone who had just come through a terrible experience skye drew in a deep breath to scold him further but he forestalled her saying look there is archambault unable to resist skye looked through the coach window there on a gentle hill that rose above the river cher she saw a charming small château with its steep redtiled roof its four rounded corner towers and very french dormer windows below it along the river were the vineyards of archambault and behind them a generous estate of fields and woodlands it was a perfect summers day with a cloudless deepblue sky and bright golden sun the river ran cheerfully by the green vines and ripening fields of maize and wheat the forest was in full leaf there were cattle grazing in the fields and sheep too it was altogether the most peaceful scene skye had ever seen she had not believed that there was any place on this earth that peaceful the coach rumbled onward up the hill to the château drawing to a stop before a tier of steps crowned with carved and gilded double doors of weathered oak as the vehicle stopped the doors to the château were swung open by a liveried servant and several footmen came running down the steps followed by a rather beautiful woman in a taffeta gown the color of purple primroses its lownecked bodice embroidered in silver and crystal beads the womans hair was coiffed as skye wore hers parted in the middle drawn back and gathered into an elegant chignon there were pearls in her hair adam maman he sprang from the coach and caught her up in a bear hug of an embrace squeezing her until she shrieked and kissing her soundly upon both cheeks put me down you great oaf she scolded him laughingly you are destroying my coiffure and what will your lovely skye think of me if you do she will think what i think she will think you are the most beautiful the most marvelous mother in the whole world he set her gently on her feet gabrielle de savilles glance softened with the fondness a mother harbors for her firstborn then quickly she demanded well where is she my son where is this paragon you have written me about skye felt her cheeks coloring as she heard adams mothers words as she stepped down from the coach her small hand in adams big one she had no idea of how lovely she looked she was wearing a simple light silk traveling dress of leaf green with a soft scooped neck and comfortable hanging sleeves which were cool for coach travel she had only a simple strand of pearls about her neck and matching earbobs in her ears she looked fresh and very beautiful maman may i present to you skye lady burke better known as skye omalley skye my mother the comtesse de cher you will call me gaby my dear adams mother said graciously and i shall call you skye you are every bit as fair as adam has written welcome to archambault i hope you will stay with us for a long visit skye blinked back her sudden tears madame gaby your welcome is most kind i am so grateful for your hospitality gaby de saville put a motherly arm about skye there my dear you are safe now here at archambault nothing will hurt you adam has written to me a little bit about your bravery and how you sought to rescue your poor husband from morocco i am so sorry about his death skye bowed her head come said the comtesse we must not stand here the family is gathered inside waiting to meet you as they walked up the steps and into the château skye looked admiringly at adams mother she had borne her eldest son when she was fifteen she was now fiftyseven yet her thick dark blond hair was still full of warm golden lights and her eyes the same smoky blue as her sons were bright and knowing she was nearly as tall as skye herself and she was as slender as a girl with fine full breasts adam skye decided did not look like his mother except for the color of his eyes and his nose for gaby de saville had given her son her aristocratic elegant french nose the comtesses face was that of a little cat though with a pointed chin and a provocative rosebud of a mouth as they followed her into a lovely salon with long windows looking out onto a colorful garden of brightly colored flowers skye thought that she was going to have a friend in this charming frenchwoman the salon was filled with chattering people who all stopped in midsentence and stared as they entered the room in the moment of heavy silence that followed a scholarly looking man detached himself from the group and hurried forward to place an arm about the comtesse skye my dear this is my husband antoine de saville comte de cher msieur le comte you are so kind to offer me your hospitality skye said holding out her hand to be kissed she liked the look of this balding somewhat paunchy man whose brown eyes twinkled appreciatively at her madame how could i refuse such beauty the comte said kissing skyes hand fervently his greeting seemed a signal for the room to erupt adam three of the women shrieked flinging themselves at him with a delighted roar adam de marisco managed to envelope them all in a crushing embrace mesenfantsmesenfantgaby cried you must wait to greet your brother until after i have introduced our guest pardon maman the three said with one voice as they stepped away from adam skye my dear these three illmannered creatures are my daughters this is isabeau and clarice and musette the three women curtseyed as did skye in return she knew that isabeau rochouart and clarice st justine were adams full sisters children like him of gabys first marriage to john de marisco the two sisters looked like their mother but their hair was dark as was their brothers musette de saville sancerre was adams halfsister and she a miniature of her mother was just twentyfive the youngest of gabys children now the others came forward to be introduced alexandre de saville the oldest child of the comtesses second marriage a widower with three young children yves de saville and his wife mariejeanne with their children robert sancerre musettes husband and their three children then there was isabeaus husband louis and their daughter matilde who was sixteen the last to be introduced was henri st justine he and clarice were the parents of four children ranging in age from nineteen to eleven and they had all come to see their uncle adam skye was both delighted and astounded by the size of adam de mariscos family this was certainly a side of him that she had never known or even suspected existed for her he had always been the rather lonely island lord whose mother had remarried and lived in france he had mentioned his sisters isabeau and clarice in passing but she had never realized that his mother had had a second family and that adam was so obviously beloved by them all even his two younger halfbrothers she stood now almost shyly as they clustered about him kissing and hugging him and chattering all their news then she felt a hand on her arm and she was led off to a comfortable settle they will all talk at him for the next ten minutes until they realize he is really here and intends to stay for a time said the comte antoine de saville smiling at her i did not realize that his family was so large skye said he does not talk about them no she answered slowly but now i suspect he kept this knowledge to himself lest he grow lonely for you while living by himself on lundy he would not neglect his small holding perhaps now the comte said that will change madame of course it will darling gaby said seating herself next to them adam tells me that he plans to wed with our lovely skye nothe word burst harshly forth from between her lips as skye reddened with embarrassment oh dear gaby murmured looking equally chagrined you dont understand gaby skye said in an effort to explain i love adam but i will not marry again each of my husbands has suffered death i am a jinx besides i want to be my own woman now not someones possession has adam told you that i spent close to a year in the harem of a wealthy moroccan in my effort to rescue my husband for the arabs a woman is a possession like a sword or a hawk or a garment and i was treated exactly like that i have had all i can take of that sort of treatment at a mans hands and i have been most frank with adam about it still he persists you say you love him my dear gaby said i do it is a strange love for it has grown during the time i have been happily married to others yet love adam i do i want his happiness gaby but i am not that happiness he must understand that of course my dear of course adams mother soothed men can be so obstinate when it comes to women they simply do not understand us she smiled at skye thinking what a lovely daughterinlaw she would be the irishwoman was everything adam had written of her she was beautiful intelligent and warm that she did not know her own mind right now was most apparent to gaby de saville when the shock of her experiences in morocco and the death of her husband had worn off then she would see clearly that adam de marisco was the only man for her we are going up to paris in a few weeks she said brightly to skye king henri of navarre is marrying with our own princesse marguérite de valois on the eighteenth of august you will naturally come with us i should love it skye exclaimed i have never been to paris then that is settled gaby replied she stood up come my dear i will show you to your apartments now you must be exhausted after eight days on the road i am skye admitted we passed through some lovely cities avignon lyons nevers bourgesbut we didnt stop adam very much wanted to get to archambault to see you all gaby de saville led her guest from the salon where adam was still surrounded by his family catching skyes eye as she passed him he grinned and shrugged helplessly and she was forced to smile back at him he blew her a kiss with his fingertips he is a good son the comtesse was saying as they moved up the main staircase of the château to the bedroom floors you have no idea how hurt and ashamed he was when that wretched athenais boussac spurned him and then not satisfied with merely refusing my son made his bad luck a public thing he has of course told you of her i have heard the story skye replied he never mentioned her name to me how like my adam a gentleman even in regard to thatone she was a fool gaby the fact that he cannot sire a child has had nothing to do with his abilities as a man skye stopped a moment as they reached the carved door of what was to be her apartment while at archambault you know that we have been lovers adam and i but of course my dear the comtesse laughed it does not shock you you are both free of any spouses and of an age my dear skye if you will forgive my mentioning it that should allow you both to choose your own course in life you and my son are good for each other and despite what you say i suspect that one day i shall welcome you as my bellefille no gaby put two fingers on skyes lips to stifle her protest do not argue with me my dear leave me some hope skye had to laugh gabys attitude was so very much like adams now she said i know where adam gets his stubbornness gaby chuckled back as she opened the door to the chamber and ushered skye into the small salon his father was equally pigheaded she said oh the fights john and i used to have they fairly made the old walls of lundy castle ring hes been dead over thirty years now my dear and i still miss him without my dearest and kindly antoine i dont know what i would have done then lundy was still whole when adam was young skye looked about the little salon it was a most charming room with its linenfold paneling and a wall of diamondpaned windows that overlooked the river and the fields there was a small fireplace flanked by stone greyhounds with a fire already laid and ready to light yes the comtesse replied john de marisco unfortunately got into an argument with henry tudor over the favors of a rather amply charmed lady of the court she was more than willing to take on both king and courtier the king however was not of a mind to share even a temporary mistress in a temper king harry sent one of his ships out of bideford and they blew the castle almost to bits both my husband and the lady in question happened to be in residence at the time they were killed how terrible for you skye sympathized the loss of the castle or the loss of my husband was the reply both skye said gaby de saville laughed yes she answered it was terrible john occasionally strayed and i knew it but then i am a frenchwoman and we are taught to ignore such things still this particular piece of foolishness cost my children their home and adam his full birthright the king was furious and could not bear the sight of us having transferred his anger to all the de mariscos now that john was dead when adam then but eleven accused the king of murdering his father our fate in england was sealed we were banned from court and having no other place to go i brought my children home to france we were welcomed at king françoiss court as my father had been one of his most trusted advisors in his younger days the king gave us a small pension took adam on as a page for queen eleanor and the next thing i knew he arranged a marriage for me with my dear antoine she smiled sometimes things work out for the best even when it doesnt seem they will sometimes skye agreed and then again sometimes not the comtesse ignoring the last part of skyes remark said pleasantly i hope you will be comfortable here my dear your bedchamber is to the right and adams to the left i see that you have not traveled with a servant and so i shall choose a competent woman for you if i may please gaby do i did not take my daisy to morocco with me as the dangers involved were far too great she is now back in england and i did not like to bring a girl from beaumont de jaspre only to have to send her back a mischievous smile turned up the corners of her lovely mouth adam has been a most helpful maid to me these last few days gaby laughed a role in which i do not see my son as successful but i shall take your word for it skye is there anything i might get you now oh if i might only have a bath it was impossible along the road and my hair and the very pores of my skin are filled with dust the comtesse nodded with understanding i shall see to it immediately my dear now i shall leave you to yourself a servant will attend you presently then with a quick smile gaby turned and was gone closing the door behind her skye looked more closely at the salon the wide floorboards of the room were clean and polished and the windows were hung with naturalcolored linen drapes with a rose and green design on one wall was a long dark oak table flanked by chairs on either side and on either side of the fireplace were tall wooden chairs their high backs and seat cushions embroidered in rose and cream tapestry before the fireplace was a fine oak settle with a dark green tapestried seat cushion builtin bookcases filled with leatherbound volumes lined another wall of the salon skye smiled to herself she was not of a mind to read right now but she would eventually see what reading matter the de savilles had furnished this guest apartment with there was a door on the bookcase wall and opening it skye peered into a tiny windowless chamber furnished with a narrow cot and a small trunk this would be a servants room walking to the end of the room she opened the door to what gaby had said would be adams room it was a mediumsized chamber with a small fireplace a bed and a small candlestand next to the fireplace was another door and skye walked through it to find herself in her own bedchamber this room was furnished with a much larger bed two candlestands and a comfortable chair by its fireplace it had two other doors one leading back into the salon and one opening into a fairsized garderobe skye looked with pleasure at the bedchambers dusky rose velvet drapes and bed hangings highbreasted stone maidens flanked the small fireplace and upon the mantel was centered a little bowl of pink roses that perfumed the room the windows looked out over the gardens with woodlands beyond there was a warmth about the room that appealed to skye and she knew that she was going to be happy here bonjourthe voice came from the salon and skye hurried back into the main room of the apartment to confront a tiny blackeyed woman of middle years dressed neady in the clothing of an upper servant good day she said bonjourmadame i am mignon the woman smiled madame la comtesse has sent me to take care of you she turned quickly as she heard the door opening behind her ahh the footmen with your bath madame into the bedchamber mesamisvitevite she hurried ahead of them leaving skye standing rather amused the footmen who struggled with the bulky oak tub were followed by a brisk procession of their fellows each lugging two buckets of steaming water until finally the tub was filled mignon stood in the bedchamber door and said come madame i am ready to begin skye nodded and walked into her bedchamber mignon had flung the windows wide and the soft warm summer air was easily dispelling the dampness of the room and mingling the fragrance of the cut roses in the bowl with the many flowers blooming in the gardens below mignon quickly undressed her new mistress saying as she did so i have prepared a basin of warm water madame and i will first wash your hair mondieunever have i seen so much dust did you roll in it like a naughty puppy skye laughed i might as well have she said ruefully it was eight days of travel and no rain to hold the dust down on the roads we do not need the rains now mignon replied the more sun the sweeter the grapes the better the wines this harvest gently she pushed skye over so that her long dark hair was in the porcelain basin then with quick deft movements she began washing skyes hair skye sniffed disbelievingly damask roses she exclaimed maisouicame the calm reply is it not your scent yes but how did you know madame la comtesse told me mignon rinsed and began a second washing how much had adam told his mother about her skye wondered obviously he had written quite a bit to gaby skye was touched he really did love her she thought and realized that when he had turned her away saying that she needed a greater more powerful husband than he could be he had done so because of that love khalid geoffrey niallall had loved her deeply but had they loved her as much as adam de marisco obviously did comparison was unfair in this instance skye knew yet she was touched by his devotion to her and sad that she could not accept his proposal adam deserved to be happy but could she bring herself to marry again not now perhaps and the thought slipped into her mind unbidden much to her annoyance perhaps later he had said he would wait but would he suddenly adam de marisco was of a mind to marry and he might grow tired of a woman who could not make up her mind well if he did skye thought mutinously then so be it she had had all she could bear of being owned mignon was now wringing out skyes long black hair having emptied a final bucket of rinse water over her head vigorously she toweled her mistresss waistlength hair then politely said if you will sit for a few moments madame here on the window seat with your hair spread out in the sun i shall prepare your bath for you skye stretched herself so she might lie straight out the back of her head resting upon the windowsill while her flowing hair fell over it and blew in the gentle breeze having clean hair felt wonderful and skye closed her eyes for a moment in the bright sunlight humming lazily to herself as mignon poured the bath oil into the waiting tub and mixed it with a wooden paddle it was several long minutes before the scent suited the tiny frenchwoman and by that time skyes mane was almost completely dry sit up madame mignon said with a cluck of satisfaction swiftly she pinned the hair atop her mistresss head you will find your tub perfection she said as she helped skye up a pair of steps and down into the water ohh yes skye murmured as the hot fragrant water soaked into her skin and tired muscles mignon chuckled eight days in a jouncing coach is exhausting she said sympathetically could i soak for a few minutes skye begged and mignon smiled of course madame i will begin to unpack your things which the footmen have brought up to the garderobe i am going to find you a comfortable robedechambreso you may rest for a few hours until the evening meal i have ordered up some fruit cheese bread and wine for you as i suspect that you are hungry then she was off to the garderobe as skyes thanks rang out what a jewel skye thought and how fortunate she was that mignon was available to serve her skye sighed and snuggled down deep into the warmth she could feel the very pores in her skin welcoming the heat and the silken bath oil how foolish those poor women were who thought bathing was injurious to health and covered their body odors in layers of perfume bathing was truly heavensent and nothing cleaned a body like soap and water do you want company skye didnt even bother to open her eyes not now adam she pleaded prettily i dont know the last time i so enjoyed a bath his deep laughter rumbled about the room her refusal did not he knew stem from prudishness or a cold nature she simply did not wish to share her tub this time her enjoyment was plainly written upon her face ive already instructed old guillaume to have a tub prepared for me but i stopped on the chance you might be willing to share little girl i will be back when i have bathed when she opened her eyes briefly he was already gone why was he coming back then the truth dawned on her for almost two weeks she had slept in the same bed with him and other than hold her close in the night he had made no move to touch her adam was a man however and he had his needs as she had hers he wanted her she had not needed to see his face or the look in his eyes to know that she had heard the longing in his voice adam was the one man she would never use skye thought seriously if he wanted to make love to her then they should make love she smiled to herself and then a tiny frown creased her brow as she remembered that no man had made love to her since kedar are you ready to be washed madame skye jumped at the sound of mignons voice yyes she managed to answer as her eyes flew open i am sorry madame mignon apologized i did not mean to startle you its all right skye assured the tiring woman i was merely thinking about msieur adam mignon inquired slyly i have known him since he was a boy he is how you say it formidablemagnifiqueungrandhommepassionnéhe is your lover she is to be my wife you nosy creature adam chuckled from the door that connected their two rooms she is in mourning now for her last husband but we have known each other a long while mignon and skye will marry me sometime next year msieur adam mignon dropped the sea sponge with which she had been washing skyes back and clapped her hands together with delight then she ran to him took his face in her two hands and kissed him on both cheeks bon chancemsieur adam she exclaimed i am so happy for you did i not tell you those long years ago when that wretched mamselle athenais spurned you that somewhere there was a wife for you madame skye is far more beautiful than that other one she has a good heart too mignon adam said seriously you are impossible skye fussed at him go and bathe you great fool you stink of half the roads of france mignon this water grows cold with another chuckle adam disappeared back through the connecting door into his own room mignon realizing the truth of skyes complaint about the bath water clucked and fussed as she swiftly washed her new mistress then assisted her from the tub to dry her madame la comtesse tells me we are to go to paris for the royal wedding she chatted i did not think to be included in that journey what a tale to tell my grandchildren you are married skye was surprised to guillaume who valets msieur adam he is much older than i of course but we have been married many years i had my two babies before i came to be a tiring woman when comtesse gabrielle married with msieur antoine and brought her children to the château guillaume was assigned to be msieur adams valet now my husband is retired but when he learned that msieur adam would be visiting nothing would do but that he serve his old master we have several grandchildren madame and they will enjoy the tales we will bring back of the royal wedding in paris skye smiled remembering how very much daisy enjoyed the galas and entertainments at court a wedding is a wedding she said i expect this one will be far more lavish nothing more still perhaps we can find some special treat to bring back to the little ones madame you are too kind i have children too mignon and i know that even the smallest of gifts delights them mignon fairly hummed with approval of her new mistress as she helped skye into a palerose silk caftan with tiny pearl buttons seating her mignon unpinned skyes hair and began to brush it out only faintly damp it shone with soft blue lights and was sweet with the scent of roses at last the tiring woman was satisfied there madame it is done now where shall i serve you in the salon no skye said i am weary bring me a small piece of bread with a bit of cheese and a little wine i will eat it here by the window and then rest mignon hurried to do as she was bid and when she had placed the plate and goblet by skyes side she said your gowns are frightfully wrinkled from all that travel while you rest i shall see if i can get one in decent condition for you to wear tonight mercimignon skye replied as the woman departed the room she chewed slowly savoring the fresh crisp bread with its covering of soft ripe cheese the golden wine was sweet and very mellow to her taste her gaze moved out through the windows into the gardens below where several children were playing under the careful supervision of three nursemaids for a moment skye wondered how her own children were faring then she shook her head irritably they were all safe and well fed and warm and clothed they survived quite well without her quick tears sprang forth from her beautiful eyes she was being unfair to her children they survived without her because they had to but she knew that they didnt like being apart from their mother any more than she liked being apart from them still she was not quite ready to return to england not yet ready to be a mother again to pit her wits against those of elizabeth tudor the last two years had been very harsh and she needed time to regain her strength she brushed the remaining crumbs from her lap drained the goblet of the last sip of wine and standing up walked over to the bed and lay down gods bones she was tired and her head had barely hit the down pillows when she was asleep she had no idea how long she slept but she awoke to find the shadows long in the room and adam snoring lightly by her side she gazed down on him for a moment and then smiled he was such a big man he made her feel small which she most certainly was not there were the faintest flecks of silver in his shaggy black hair now and she wondered how many of them she had given him strange she thought she had never noticed how beautifully sculpted the planes of his face were the skin stretched over his high cheekbones was smooth although tanned with the sun of the outdoor life he preferred living she liked the way he wore his beard now clipped close and coming down from the round of his mustache which enhanced his sensuous mouth he was such a handsome man do you intend to eat me or just paint me little girl he inquired humorously as he opened his eyes and looked up at her i was just deciding what a handsome man you are she said frankly you mean you never noticed until now he demanded in a slightly aggrieved tone no she giggled but gazing at you in sleep i looked closer than i ever have ive always thought you were handsome but on more acute inspection i have decided you are veryhandsome she was resting on an elbow looking down at him as she spoke and now his arm came up to draw her down to him come here to me little girl he said in a low deep voice and then his mouth was finding hers tenderly kissing it gently seeking a response that he knew existed despite her protests for a moment skye was startled even surprised although she had been expecting him to ask to make love to her then she realized that it was because for the first time in well over a year she was being kissed with love not just lust this was not kedar with his voracious appetites for her body with his insane passion to possess her totally this was adam adam her gentle giant who had loved her for so long she felt her tears flow unbidden as a mixture of joy and relief flooded her he lifted his head slowly and tenderly began to lick the tears away skye shivered at the pure sensuousness of his simple action knowing at the same moment that she wanted him not just for now but for all time she wanted to laugh at how foolish she had been in her grief over nialls death adam had understood bless him he had understood the pain and the disappointment and the anger that had welled up in her and he had loved her nonetheless and said he could be patient men were born to die and if she had lost previous husbands it had only been in the fabric of life do not tight your fate so hard osman had always warned her with a sudden burst of clarity skye knew that adam de marisco was her fate oh adam she whispered almost brokenly i love you he lifted his great head and with a mischievous grin he replied i know that little girl why do you think i was so damned willing to be patient you simply needed time to come to yourself again she hit at him weakly with her fist how could you know when i didnt she demanded you knew too skye omalley you knew that you loved me you were just not willing to admit to it i was sure being the sensible creature you are that eventually you would with a smooth action he turned her so that she now lay upon her back and he hovered over her i love you my celtic witch i have loved you from the first but you were not ready then to love me in my foolishness i thought that you should be married to a more powerful more important man but i was wrong little girl i am the only man for you skye he bent his leonine head down and brushed her mouth with his very lightly sending a pleasant tingle through her yes i am the only man for you my darling and you are the only woman for me i am still not sure that i want to marry again she said softly that feeling will pass he said with such certainty that she had to laugh adam well it will besides we should wait a year a whole year she teased him well he reconsidered perhaps not a whole year after all little girl niall was presumed dead over three years ago and the queen gave you no time to mourn then that is why i need a little time now adam was her reply i was hustied into marriage with the duc de beaumont de jaspre three months after nialls alleged murder it was indecent of elizabeth tudor but i needed her help and she needed a bride to send to the duc give me time now my darling we will go up to paris with your family and enjoy all the festivities that go with the marriage of a royal princess and an heir to frances throne we do not need to be married to have a good time my darling adam her eyes twinkled humorously at him we have never needed to be wed to have a good time my lord of lundy you are a minx he said and his own eyes twinkled back at her then his hand moved to the little pearl buttons on her rosecolored caftan do you remember the last time that you wore this for me he asked skye shook her head in the negative when i came to london just before you departed for beaumont de jaspre you told me that you were being sold into marriage a loveless marriage and that before you went we would spend our time together loving each other so we might have sweet memories do you remember now skye he bared a soft round breast and bending kissed it tenderly yes she whispered i remember adam did he love you your duc his tongue flicked out to begin a tortuous encirclement of her sensitive nipple skye shivered as the warmth of his tongue and the cool air of the early evening worked together to bring her nipple to a hard point fabron did not know how to love she gasped as he bared her other breast and began to tease at it he was a sad man damn adam you will drive me wild stop i adore you wild he chuckled indulgently her answer was to fumble with the laces on his silk shirt and successful at that slip her hands inside to caress his broad back she could feel the hard muscles beneath his skin tense as he restrained himself wickedly she ran her sharp nails lightly down the skin and heard with total satisfaction his sharp intake of breath she impishly caught at the lobe of his ear and gently bit it wench he growled with mock fierceness you shall pay for that liberty make me she taunted and then squealed as he yanked the caftan apart baring her to his fiery gaze his hands slid with delicious familiarity over her torso and to his vast amusement she sighed with great delight wanton he muttered at her you dont understand adam she said the last time a man made love to me it was not because he loved me it was because i belonged to him and he sought to relieve his lust when you touch me it is with love oh my darling adam i want you to touch me with love i want you to make love to me i so very much need to be loved again as a woman and not as a possession his smoky blue eyes gazed down into hers it is not a very hard task you set me skye he said softly lovemeshe repeated as softly and his mouth again descended upon hers to make her his warm and willing captive her arms slipped up around his neck to draw him even closer her round and tender breasts pressed hard against his furred chest he had never kissed her with such deep passion his sensuous mouth seemingly welded to hers sending alternate shivers and waves of heat throughout her body he demanded much yet he gave as well and skye felt herself soaring under the sweet pressure of his lips she yielded herself to him to his care and he kissed her hungrily muttering fiercely against her mouth i love you i love you my sweet skye then they heard it the insistent knocking at the bedchamber door with a smothered curse adam broke away from her roaring what is it dammit the door opened it is time that you begin to ready yourselves for the evening meal mesenfantsmignon said calmly with all the smug privilege of an upper servant of long standing go away mignon nonmsieur adam your maman has had the cooks preparing for days for your arrival she would be most distressed if you did not appear in the dining hall tonight her cherryblack eyes twinkled you had best eat monchoui suspect you will need all your strength for later she chuckled up with you now and go to guillaume he is waiting to dress you grumbling about no privacy and being treated like a lad not yet breeched adam de marisco got up and with a regretful look at skye left the room with a pretty blush skye drew the two edges of her caftan together and sat up were you able to salvage one of my gowns she asked in an attempt to change the subject and save her dignity oui madame came the cheerful reply and madame must not be embarrassed we french understand about love and it is most obvious that you and msieur adam love each other then too you are betrothed and who is to gainsay you if you love a little while you wait to wed she smiled at skye come now madame i have managed to ready a lovely silk gown for you the bluegreen color of the sea let me bring you your jewelry case so you may decide what you will wear with it i have no jewelry case with my clothes skye said my jewels went back to england with my tiring woman perhaps she forgot madame for there is a small carved ivory box among your things mignon replied skye shook her head she did not remember an ivory box and it was not like daisy to forget her jewelry bring it to me she commanded mignon disappeared into the garderobe a moment returning quickly with a rectangular box carved of creamy ivory there you are madame she said placing the box in skyes lap as the maidservant turned away to finish her chores skye turned the little gold key that was in the lock opened the box and gasped with a mixture of shock and surprise as the lid raised to reveal the contents stuck within the lid was a folded parchment and prilling it out skye opened it to read doucetteihadthesemadeforyou whenithoughtyoumightreturntomesinceiwillnotgivemywife jewelrymade for anotherwomanibegthatyoutakethissmalloffering thatwasmeantonlyforyounicolas skye gently put the parchment aside and concentrated on the jewelry before her there was a marvelous assortment of pinktinged pearls and a huge ring set in gold and there was an absolutely stunning necklace of diamonds with matching earrings a collection of hair ornaments of diamonds pearls and rubies set in gold several more rings bracelets and additional earrings of sapphires emeralds and rubies set in gold it was a small fortune and for a moment she wasnt sure what she should do with it it had been wonderfully kind of nicolas to send along the jewelry but could she keep it she was to marry another man he was a married man then common sense took over he had had the jewelry made for her before he married madelaine and before she agreed to marry adam he might have kept it but he had chosen to give it to her anyway she would consider it a wedding gift and tell adam only what she had to i think i shall wear the pearls she said to mignon i shall save the diamonds for paris very good madame the tiring woman approved as she reentered the room carrying the gown skye stood up and donned the silk undergarments that were handed to her but when she slipped on the bodice and the skirt of her gown both she and mignon gasped with surprise for they were too large i knew that i had lost weight skye exclaimed but i did not think i had lost so much that my gowns would not fit do not fret madame mignon soothed her i shall pin the garments for tonight and we shall have the seamstress come tomorrow to alter all of your gowns for paris the necklines must be lowered for one thing as it is now more fashionable it is skye was a trifle surprised for she thought that the necklines were low enough mignon worked quickly all her movements were swift and the little tiring woman seemed to waste neither energy nor time in anything she did she firmly sat skye down and brushed her hair out before fixing it in the lovely simple chignon that skye favored when we go up to paris madame and you visit the court she said i am going to try doing your hair in the long curls that are the corning fashion the style is most provocative and msieur adam will adore it she fastened two white roses into her mistresss hair there madame she said pleased now the gown when mignon had finished with her skye stood looking at herself in the pier glass it was the first time in so long that she was dressed as the lady she really was the bodice of her gown had a low square neckline and was embroidered in tiny crystal beads with gold thread the sleeves were legofmutton padded and puffed and the wristbands held by many tiny gold ribbons were embroidered in crystal beads and turned back to form a cuff the silk overskirt of the gown was bluegreen separating in the front to show the skirt of the undergown which was striped in the same color and gold her stockings which would only show if she danced were palepink silk embroidered in climbing roses and her shoes matched her gown vous êtestrèsbellemadamemignon said quietly as she daubed essence of damask rose on skyes pulse points why is it you women take so damned long to dress little girl adam demanded from the connecting doorway she whirled prettily and curtseyed is it not worth it adam she teased him taking in his own appearance she had rarely seen him dressed as magnificently as he was now in an elegantly fitted velvet doublet embroidered in gold thread and she would swear small diamonds his jerkin was sleeveless and edged in ermine he was dressed entirely in dark blue which flattered his eyes slowly he inspected her and skye found that she was blushing her heartbeat quickened and she realized that she very much regretted mignons untimely intrusion raising her eyes to his she could read in them that he felt the same way he reached for her hand and slowly raised it to his lips his mouth scorched her skin but the warmth of his gaze filled her with rapture and she could not tear her eyes away from him how is it possible that you grow more beautiful with each year little girl he asked wonderingly as he tucked her small hand into his adam she began and then her voice died for she was at a total loss for words his deep and abiding love was so plain and skye was beginning to realize how different he was from the other men who had been in her life those whom she had loved had indeed loved her as well but they had taken boldly of her though giving something of themselves in return adam she realized with some surprise intended to take but he was the first to truly consider her wellbeing and her own feelings along with his own silently he escorted her downstairs to the familys dining room it was a beautiful paneled room with an enormous red and white marble fireplace capable of holding whole logs above the mantel hung a large tapestry done in azure blue green red silver and gold showing in intricate detail a castle under siege a captive virgin an embattled knight and a rather ferocious dragon antoine de saville noting skyes admiration of the tapestry came forward saying it took three generations of women in my family almost four years to complete that tapestry it is over two hundred years old its exquisite skye exclaimed no more so than you my dear was the gallant reply beaupèrei warn you adam said teasingly that i would fight a ducl over this woman i have no doubt adam that she is more than worth it the comte replied i am a most fortunate man for i possess a beautiful wife three beautiful daughters a beautiful daughterinlaw seven lovely granddaughters and now you are to give us another beauty to add to the family mondieuit is more than one man can bear he peered at skye through slightly nearsighted eyes you are going to join the family machériearent you suddenly the room which was rilled with the entire de saville clan grew quiet and all eyes turned to skye i suppose i must she replied mischievously adam refuses to give me any other choice and i find that i love him what else can i do but follow my conscience the joyous noise that erupted about them as the whole family tried to offer their good wishes at the same time somewhat overwhelmed them she found herself being kissed upon both cheeks first by comte antoine and then by gaby next came adams sisters and their husbands and children and his halfbrothers and sister and their families never in her entire life had skye felt so cherished by a family it was true that her own family loved her dearly but they all depended upon her for everything they expected that she would care for them all no matter what the de savilles expected nothing of her to them she was the woman who would marry gabys eldest son another daughterinlaw to be treasured at this moment in time skye realized that that was more than enough for her she was so tired of having total responsibility and she wanted to be treated like a woman just a woman for now his arm tightened about her shoulder and she looked up at him you understand dont you she said yes was the simple reply nothing more just yes suddenly gaby de saville cried out adam my son the ring have you given skye the ring no maman i have not adam replied i thought to do it when she accepted me but she has surprised me by accepting beaupèresproposal in my name he reached into his doublet and drew forth a large round sapphire set in red gold upon the face of the sapphire was a small redgold sea hawk with its wings outspread in flight this ring he said quietly to her was given by geoffroi de sudbois to my ancestress matilde de marisco in token of their love ever since it has been the betrothal ring of the men in my family my father gave it to my mother and now i give it to you skye omalley i need not tell you that with it goes my everlasting love and my fidelity for all time gently adam slipped the ring onto the appropriate finger of her left hand while around them the de saville family once again proclaimed their delight at this turn of events skye barely heard them i am loved she thought dear god dont take adam away from me as you have taken the others i could not bear to hurt him please let us grow old together again as if she had uttered the words aloud adam de marisco understood her feelings bending he tenderly touched her mouth with his then murmured softly i will always be here for you little girl always looking up into his eyes skye had a sudden premonition that she was finally safe this time there would be no parting or pain she remembered that osman had told her that her happiness would be assured by the influence of a strong leo in her life what is your birthdate adam she asked him we are to be married and i realize that i do not know your birthday his birthday is in two weeks my dear gaby said it is the ninth of august my oldest son is born beneath the sign of the lion does it make a difference to you are you compatible skye looked again at adam and the relief in her eyes puzzled him yes gaby she answered the comtesse we are compatible two fire signs for i am born beneath the sign of the archer what is it he asked her in a low tone osman she said but it is all right my happiness he said would be assured with a man born beneath the sign of the lion for some reason i suddenly remembered that adam smiled at her half relieved himself half amused you will always be safe with me little girl he promised always chapter skye and adam came together again as man and woman the night of their betrothal the welcomehome dinner a magnificent feast began with thin slices of loire salmon served on silver platters decorated with watercress and carved lemon halves the fish was followed by a turkey stuffed with truffles from the périgord a bayonne ham beef rissoles a small roe deer basted in burgundy rabbit pie with a marvelously flaky pastry crust tiny whole partridges stuffed with rice and dried fruit and small silver platters of rhine perch there were bowls of creamed onions carrots glazed with honey saffroned rice cress and lettuce scallions and radishes the last course was made up of several cheeses brie angelot from bray in normandy and a caci marzolini from florence there were baskets of black cherries and fat golden peaches and a wonderful brandyflavored gâteau with marzipan decorations throughout the meal the goblets were kept well filled with the fine red and white wines bottled on the estate from archambault grapes the family ate heartily and with appreciation of the châteaus fine chef but skye and adam picked at their food casting long and languishing looks at each other throughout the meal how strange thought skye i feel like a young girl again instead of a woman who has seen a thirtyfirst birthday toast after toast was raised to the betrothed couple and skyes heart beat erratically as adam took her right hand in his and began to delicately kiss each fingertip with a slow lingering kiss his smoky eyes caught hers in a blazing blue gaze and she was so fascinated with the passion she saw in their depths that she forgot to breathe and suddenly found herself gasping she blushed realizing that she could barely wait to be alone with him and he chuckled softly i also he said in a low voice obviously reading her mind her color deepened how can i feel this way and niall but newly buried she protested her stern conscience demanding the answer niall was dead to you long ago he replied softly a second death was but anticlimactic sweetheart you have had a bad time of it this last year in your attempts to rescue him and now you need my soothing she thought a moment and realized that it was true you were ever good at soothing me adam she teased him running a playful finger down his cheek around them the de saville family watched the lovers with tolerant amusement they were french and they understood better than any other race in the world the sparks that flew between skye omalley and adam de marisco antoine feigned a yawn as the servants were clearing away the remnants of the meal from the long table mondieuhe murmured i must be getting old for i cannot seem to keep my eyes open he turned to his wife do you think monamourthat i should be considered a bad host if i called a halt to this day maisnonchérithe comtesse exclaimed brightly i am sure that both adam and skye are exhausted after their long journey nestcepasmesenfants yes maman adam said solemnly we are quite fatigued skye suppressed a giggle fatiguedadam spoke with such delicacy was this the lord of lundy the very same fellow who upon their first meeting had so boldly demanded her presence in his bed in exchange for his aid her mirth but increased when he fiercely waggled his thick black eyebrows at her in mock warning as he rose from the table pulling her up with him taking her by the hand adam led her over to his mother and stepfather good night maman beaupèrehe said quietly as if daring skye to laugh good night my son gaby murmured and looking closely at her skye saw that adams mother was also close to total mirth she obviously knew her big son well bonnenuitadam the comte said bonnenuitmabelleskye skye bid him goodnight softly and then taking her leave of gaby and all the others she followed adam from the dining room silently he led her up the main staircase of the château to the bedroom wing then down the hall to their apartment inside both mignon and old guillaume awaited them and they parted and went into their separate chambers inside her bedroom skye bore with mignons delighted chatter for the tiring woman had already heard of the official betrothal indeed the châteaus servants were all atwitter and as pleased as could be that msieur adam had at last found true happiness skye found herself smiling as mignon asked madames children will like msieur adam as their beaupère my children adore adam they will be very pleased mignon mignon bridled with pleasure at her reply as she silently admired skyes ring adam was quite obviously a favorite of hers he is a good man she declared and then she lowered her voice i lit candles in thanksgiving when thatonescorned him she did not fool me for a minute with her virginal airs and her soft voice she was ambitious for wealth and position thatoneshe would have destroyed him the same way she destroyed the old duc she finally wed mignon handed skye a silken nightgown but skye shook her head i will not need it she said just this little knit shawl for my shoulders and she climbed into bed bonmignon said with a chuckle of approval then i will let you sleepshe finished as she hurried out leaving skye alone a little fire glowing in the fireplace and one small chamber stick lit by the bedside she sat quietly enjoying the peace of the room the smooth feel of the lavenderscented sheets beneath her and the plump goosedown pillows behind her back the fire cast playful shadows upon the ceiling as it sputtered and whisded softly in the grate the door to adams room opened and skye looked up to see him silhouetted between the two rooms she held out a hand to him and he was quickly at her side bending he blew out the chamber stick then climbed into the big bed pulling her into his arms he held her gently skyes head was resting upon his shoulder one palm flat against his chest they lay together for some time in silence and then as her fingers began to entwine themselves playfully in the dark mat upon his chest she asked mischievously how many hearts have you broken my lord of lundy since we were last together i have never been a man for keeping count he said seriously but know my love that i tried very hard to forget you to forget the kerry blue of your eyes the sweetness of your kisses the outrageous softness of your skin his hand now began to stroke her as he might a cat and skye shivered with pleasure adams voice deepened with his desire i could not forget you my celtic witch you are in my blood and now i shall never let you go skye neveri shall defend what is mine against all including the queen if need be sweetheart i am not afraid anymore adam i am not afraid for i know that we are meant to be together and what a pair we shall make my darling elizabeth tudor will be hard pressed to stand against us we may have to remain in france skye he said quietly i intend to marry you with or without the queens permission and before we return to england if the marriage displeases her she will attempt to separate us as she has done with others our only refuge then will be here in france my children she said softly if we are forced to remain in france then your children must come here ewan is virtually a man grown with his own holding and god willing tis so small a holding that the english will leave him in peace the others however must be with us murrough can study here in paris as did his father and his little betrothed will live with us until the marriage robin cannot be left to elizabeth tudor despite the fact that he is her favorite his holdings will be safe in de grenvilles hands until he is ready to marry alison de grenville mistress willow should be with us too your little burkes have the most to lose i know but the english will eventually snatch the burke lands as they will all of ireland perhaps your omalleys can hold your sons lands until he comes of age but until then it is not right that deirdre and padraic be separated from you skye he turned his head and kissed her mouth quickly i want you to be happy sweetheart what of the responsibilities i owe to the omalleys adam i cannot simply walk away from them i promised my father twas a deathbed promise a promise made fourteen years ago skye when your brothers were babes but they are men grown now and brian already has children of his own it is time they accepted their responsibility brian omalley has run the omalley enterprises these last two years while you have been away your uncle seamus could not do it and defend burke lands as well he is growing very old although he would knock me down if he heard me say it i would take nothing from you sweetheart and neither would your brothers we adore you but if we must live in france then you will have to allow your family to take care of themselves i have always taken care of them she worried his big hand reached out to cup one of her perfect little breasts you will have me to take care of now skye omalley and i am a very big responsibility he said as he rolled her in one smooth motion onto her back to take a nipple into his warm mouth ohhh she gasped softly his action catching her by surprise his lips clamped firmly around that sensitive little knob of flesh seemed determined to draw her soul from her body gently he bit down upon the tingling peak eliciting another ohhhh from her she didnt need this torture to know that she wanted him desperately with a groan adam raised his dark head and she could see the hunger in his stormy eyes god forgive me little girl he whispered harshly but i cannot attend to any of the niceties this time i must have you skye i ache for you oh god yes adam she answered to his delight i cannot wait either i keep remembering how it was with us before i left england and i shall die if you do not take me now assured he would neither harm her nor offend her adam covered her beautiful body with his own beneath him her shapely thighs opened smoothly and she eagerly reached for him to guide him home with a low cry of pleasure he thrust deep feeling her push up to ease his passage even more her arms wrapped themselves around him and their mouths met in a searing kiss the kiss was seemingly endless deepening and easing again and again as his strong hips drove her downward into the feather mattresses he could not get enough of her nor she of him skye reveled in his strong passion urging him onward with soft little cries that were obvious in their delight she felt the delicious tensing begin as his wonderful maleness filled her with his love and his warmth the first rockets burst came quickly thereafter followed by several other starbursts in quick succession her sharp nails raked fiercely into his smooth back as he tore his head away from her gasping for breath sweet hot little bitch he moaned damn but you have unmanned me too quickly then she felt the warm rush of his love flooding her and she wept with joy and murmured softly je tadoremonmari i love you my husband adam de marisco shuddered with the pleasure both her body and her words had given him marry me when we return to archambault after the royal wedding he begged her will michaelmas be soon enough she teased him the end of september tis too far away he grumbled i need time for a trousseau she pouted and perhaps we shall even be able to have the children here i foresee problems in marrying an older woman he said mischievously olderwomanwith a little shriek of outrage she shoved him off her catching him unawares in his relaxed and weakened condition youll be thirtytwo in december he countered beginning to laugh you are no gentieman adam de marisco to mention such a thing out loud she said with mock anger and began to tickle him you are ten years my senior a veritable graybeard i might have a young man of twenty for a husband should i so desire she mocked him from her perch atop his chest he laughed until the tears rolled down his cheeks stop witch he begged her as her nimble fingers found yet another sensitive spot upon his helpless flesh to tickle god how he loved her it was a dream come true for him not until you apologize for marrying you or for saying you will be thirtytwo he teased ohh beast she leaned forward and grasping a handful of his thick black hair yanked it hard in retaliation ouch he roared in pain enough you witch and reaching out he grasped her about the waist and lifted her high off of him for a brief moment he held her above him while she shrieked in mock terror and then he lowered her gently onto the mattresses while his mouth swiftly found hers i love you skye omalley he whispered against her trembling lips i love you my little girl they loved seemingly without ceasing that night and in the days that followed the night before they left for paris skye drifted off to sleep replete with his love and wondering how they would ever start off the next day she was still tired when she was forced to crawl from her bed as the dawn was beginning to tint the edges of the horizon adam was gone and mignon was bustling busily about i have already packed your things madame but you must hurry the comtesse has arranged with père jean that the formal betrothal ceremony be said in the chapel before you leave for paris vitevitenow madame her bath was drawn and she was not allowed to enjoy soaking in its perfumed warmth the bath this day mignon declared was for washing not pleasurable daydreaming skye was washed and dried and powdered and perfumed quickly by her adept tiring woman her silk stockings with the climbing roses were rolled up her slender legs and fastened with rosette garters of silver ribbon her silk chemise silk blouse and silk petticoats were swiftly donned to rustle elegantly beneath her crimson silk gown with its pink satin undershirt creamy lace dripped from the sleeves and modestly garnished the neckline of the gown which revealed more breast than skye would have normally shown but the châteaus dressmaker had sworn that it was the lateststyle and that madame would be totally out of fashion if her necklines were any higher while mignon did her hair skye slipped her feet into a pair of red leather shoes with tiny heels the tiring woman dressed her hair in nicolass pearls and she wore pearls about her neck and in her ears when mignon had finished with skyes hair she signaled her mistress to stand and then fastened about her waist a gold cordeliere to which she attached a small mirror and a pomander if madame will allow me i will escort her to the chapel mignon said as she picked up skyes crimson silk cloak with its pink satin lining père jean is to say a late mass for the family and then you and msieur adam will repeat your vows before god skye nodded to mignon and followed her from the apartment she caught her breath with delight as they entered the familys private chapel for the octagonshaped room was really a little jewel although she had seen it earlier its beauty still astounded her situated in the oldest part of the small château it had floors and walls of stone but on either side of the altar which faced the double doors entry doors were long gothic windows of exquisite stained glass the rich reds and blues and golds of the windows cast dancing shadows on the gray stone on either side of the room were dainty shrines one to the blessed mother mary the other to her mother saint anne the delicately carved statues had been painted so that the two women resembled living creatures mary had been portrayed as the young mother and was gowned modestly in pale skyblue robes a white veil over her blond hair her coloringpink cheeks fair skin and real sapphire eyeswas quite lovely she was seated and in her lap a laughing pink and white cherub of a baby boy sat waving his fat little hands the statue of saint anne opposite that of saint mary represented her as a slender standing woman her face was that of a warm and loving woman as she gazed with pride across the room to her beloved daughter and holy grandchild her skin was pale her braids dark her eyes genuine topaz her robes a dark red there were only four pews on either side of the chapel and they and the altar were beautifully carved with religious scenes as skye and mignon entered the chapel a priest in green and gold vestments greeted them mignon stepped respectfully back and curtseyed bonjourmonpère bonjourma fillethe priest replied softly and then he gave his complete attention to skye madame la comtesse has told me about you madame burke you are irish and i believe a true daughter of holy mother church ouimonpèremy uncle is a bishop and when was the last time you made your confession ma fille skye reddened i have been in a moslem country for over a year monpèreit was not possible père jean smiled of course he murmured understandingly but you will naturally wish to confess to me now before the mass and before you take your vows with msieur adam ouimonpèreskye was mortified but she knew that there would be no escaping her religious duties she wondered almost hysterically what the priest was going to think of what she had to tell him she would wager that he had never heard a confession such as she was going to give him now meekly she followed him to the confessional where she knelt and said forgive me father for i have sinned some twenty minutes later both she and père jean exited the booth the priest looking somewhat exhausted and blearyeyed never the priest declared softly never have i listened to such a tale ma fillei am astounded that these things can occur in our poor world yet you gave me no penance monpère the priest stopped and looking into skyes face he took her hand in his what penance could i possibly give you mafillethat you have not already suffered you have twice lost the same husband a man for whom you truly cared you have suffered a shameful and degrading captivity in your brave if foolish effort to free your husband from an equally shameful captivity you have been bereft of your children threatened wickedly by your sovereign queen and yet still you survive without bitterness i may only be an unsophisticated country priest mafillebut i know anguish when i see it god has already punished you i can certainly do no more he smiled at her and patted her hand you are a good daughter of the church mafilleit has taken great courage to tell me your mountain of sins but you were brave enough to do it now you are following the dictates of holy mother church by marrying once more i will pray that god bless this union between yourself and the seigneur de marisco with many children come now the family is assembled and ready for the mass mafillethe priest gallantly escorted her to where adam awaited her in the pew with his mother and stepfather as she knelt in prayer during the service skye thought sadly that père jeans prayers would be wasted with regard to a child for her and adam she did not care for herself but for adam she was sad he was a man who loved children and should have sons of his own she signed herself with the cross at the masss end and then with adam she knelt before père jean and repeated her betrothal vows as thrilled as a maiden to hear his deep voice speak back pledging himself to her till death afterward they broke their fast in the familys dining room and then the comte and comtesse de cher and their family piled into several coaches with their servants and their baggage to begin the trek to paris there were twentyone adults and children in the party the six youngest children having been left behind it would take them five days to reach paris traveling at a reasonable speed as they crossed the river at tours suddenly the reality of the trip seemed to touch the family all at once the marriage between henri de navarre and marguérite de valois was the most exciting thing to happen in france in some time especially considering the fact that the bride was most vocal in her opposition to the match marguérite de valois was as strongwilled as her florentine mother queen catherine de medici but being far more beautiful young and gay she was more popular than the dowager queen all paris devoudy catholic was in extreme sympathy with their lovely princess who was being forced to wed with a huguenot were not their fear of catherine de medici greater than their love of her daughter the young prince of navarre might have found himself in extreme danger even the princesss lover henri de guise dared not act against the bridegroom it was painfully obvious that the lovely young queen of france elizabeth of austria would produce no more children than her little daughter and king charles ixs only son was a bastard by his official favorite marie touchet the kings heir was therefore his younger brother the comte danjou whose favorite pastime was dressing as a girl the french a practical race realized there was not much hope there the eventual king would be henri of navarre who it was hoped would by then be converted to the true church and his queen would be their own beloved princess perhaps this union would bring an end to the religious wars that had been plaguing france the last few years the de saville coaches raced onward toward paris the women of the family chattering excitedly about what they would wear to the ball that was to be held the night before the wedding at the louvre skye could not but help feel some of their excitement in her own contentment and happiness outside the coach the french countryside was lush with midsummer the fields ripening the vines heavy with their fruit it was very different from both her beloved ireland and beautiful england but skye thought it was just as lovely in its own way she prayed that someday she might return home but if she could not it would not be so difficult to live in this fair france at least here she had no fears that she would be disdained for her race or her religion although there were many disreputable inns along the highway the comte seemed to know the best places to stop and despite the fact the roads were thick with other travelers on their way to paris and the wedding there always seemed to be places to sleep and a private dining room for them skye shared a chamber with gaby and her two older daughters isabeau and clarice while her youngest daughter musette shared with isabeaus sixteenyearold matilde and alexandres eightyearold known as petite gaby and clarices two daughters mariegabrielle and catherine the three youngest girls were in a positive frenzy of excitement for it was their first trip to paris their elder cousin matilde a betrothed young lady had been there twice and was quite superior about it skye cheered the younger ones by telling them it was her first trip too suddenly they were there paris skye swiveled from one side of the coach to the other looking looking looking if anything she was a bit disappointed for it reminded her of london with its narrow crowded streets they would have to be ferried across the seine for the house they had rented from a wealthy huguenot was next to that of the duc de guise in the marais district on the rive droit the huguenot unlike most of his persuasion had been forced to remain in the country to mourn a recently deceased wife the de savilles were not wealthy in the sense that skye and adam were wealthy they had archambault and its lands successful vineyards and a happy productive peasantry they had a small house in paris but as adam gently pointed out to his stepfather the small house in the rue soeur celestine would simply not shelter them all and no one had wanted to be excluded from the wedding of henri of navarre and marguérite of valois the lord of lundy suggested that the paris house be rented to someone else coming up to paris for the festivities and it had been quickly and easily done then the larger house was rented for the comte and comtesse de cher and their family adam discreetly insisted upon paying the lions share of the rental our own mansion on the rive gauche was in a far better location gaby declared emphatically i dont care if the de guises have made the marais fashionable this place was once a swamp and the air is still bad if you ask me im only sorry we couldnt all squeeze into our paris house but it only has six bedrooms and we need a minimum of nine drat i dislike renting other peoples homes they are never clean enough to suit me you wait the place will be thick with dust mark my words now now machérieantoine soothed huguenot housewives are known for their cleanliness but the lady is dead and how long since she was last up to paris no the servants will have to turn everything out a little to the comtesses chagrin and skye thought amused even her disappointment the rented mansion was fresh and welcoming to its guests the owner though bowed by grief was nevertheless not so overcome that he forgot his wifes ways he had sent orders to his caretaker to hire the necessary help to clean the house for its tenants the windows sparkled the draperies and the upholstery were cleaned and brushed there were bowls of fresh flowers in every room you see machériethe comte said to his wife his brown eyes twinkling it is all quite in order we have but to enjoy ourselves they had barely time to rest from their long journey the royal ball was to be held the following evening and the de saville servants spent almost all the night and the following day pressing out ball gowns for all the ladies skye had chosen to wear a magnificent creation of peacockblue silk its shockingly lowcut bodice embroidered in tiny blue crystals and silver beads to match its embroidered clothofsilver underskirt skye lived in nervous apprehension that if she took a deep breath her entire bosom would be freed of its restraints adam chuckled with delight at the prospect as he fastened the diamond necklace about her throat i do not remember this necklace he remarked casually as he fussed with the clasp but then you have a great deal of jewelry nicolas presented me with it as a goingaway gift when we left beaumont she said deciding to hide nothing from him it was really quite thoughtful and typical of his nature for he knew that i had no jewelry daisy having returned to england with my own things skye stood very still wondering at adams reaction as he stood behind her his hands yet on the clasp the hands moved slowly from her neck and smoothed over her shoulders is it ducal jewelry no he had it made especially for me when he believed that i might come back it was before he was even contracted to his little duchesse i would not have accepted it otherwise adam i wonder that you accepted it at all she heard the jealousy in his deep voice though he strove hard to hide it funny adam thought i have never been a jealous man before then he smiled to himself i have never been betrothed to skye omalley before either i cannot return the jewels without hurting nicolas but if it displeases you i will put them away for my daughters and never wear them again skye said and then she turned to face him i love you my lord of lundy smiling she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him sweetly the damned jewels mean nothing and well you know it adam de marisco he grinned ruefully down at her you can hardly go to the most elegant court in christendom without jewels he admitted and that was the end of it the carriages were at the door and as they exited the house into the courtyard skye could see that next doors inhabitants were also preparing to leave for the louvre the duc de guise hissed adams eldest sister isabeau de rochouart to skye he is the princess marguérites lover guard your tongue gaby snapped at her daughter like your late father you do not know when to be quiet well everyone knows it clarice st justine declared coming to her big sisters defense what people know and what is said are two different things gaby replied and you two are more than old enough to comprehend that the two sisters flushed under their mothers rebuke and made a great pretense at smoothing down their ball gowns as they prepared to enter their coach they would be sharing it with their husbands isabeaus daughter matilde and clarices eldest daughter mariegabrielle in the first coach skye found herself wedged between adam and his eldest halfbrother the widowed alexandre while across from them comte antoine sat between his wife and granddaughter catherinehenriette st justine who was but eleven it was her very first ball and the child was almost sick with the excitement in the third coach the rest of the party yves and mariejeanne de saville musette and robert sancerre and their two nephews henri st justine and his brother jeanantoine were crowded the three younger children who would be left behind stood with their nurses watching sadly as the coaches pulled away once out of the courtyard the coaches moved briskly through the streets of the marais district quickly gaining the rue st honore which would take them directly to the louvre palace now however they were forced to join a long line of carriages that were also bound in the same direction and their pace slowed considerably adam took skyes hand in his and squeezed it lovingly i am indeed blinded by the presence of so much beauty maman alexandre remarked both you and my bellesoeurare radiant tonight beware little brother adam warned teasingly i have only this evening discovered how jealous a man i am if i were betrothed to so glorious a creature as skye i should also be jealous adam but fear not i dont believe i could steal her away from you now that my period of mourning for hélène is over i shall have to find myself a nubile young heiress to wife little adam your godson is a healthy fellow but one son is not enough for archambault gaby beautiful in midnightblue silk suddenly pointed look the louvre i have not seen it in over ten years we were last at court during the brief reign of little françois ii and his lovely queen marie of scotland i think queen catherine was almost glad to see her son die so she might be rid of the beautiful marie how they disliked each other those two i understand that it has not gone well for marie since she returned to scotland the scots are not an easy people gaby skye said their rulers have ever had difficulty with them the de saville coaches were now pulling into the grand courtyard of the louvre palace which was magically lit up footmen in elegant livery were stationed everywhere and others ran back and forth with torches lighting the way for the guests who were disembarking from their vehicles as they exited the coaches comte antoine said let us all remain together mesenfantswe will first present ourselves to the king and then the evening is ours follow me for i remember the way a court is a court thought skye as she hurried along clutching adams arm she studied the faces of the other guests as they moved into the palace distinguishing the ones who had just come into paris for the wedding from the truly important who belonged with the court from the hangerson and those hopeful of gaining entry into the fabled circle one thing she did note was the magnificence of the clothing worn by almost everyone she knew that only the most wealthy nobility did not have to make sacrifices to be decently clothed and coiffed tonight on that score she had nothing to fear for her gown was as elegant as any and her jewels magnificent skye couldnt help the tiny smile that played at the corners of her mouth bless nicolas for his marvelous french foresight at the wide double doors to the formal reception room their names were given to the majordomo who was presiding then as their names were called they advanced into the room toward the throne where frances royalty awaited their guests led by comte antoine and gaby skye and adam reached the king and his party antoine de saville bowed low your majesty i am honored to have been included along with my family in this festive occasion merci msieur le comte charles ix replied in a bored voice he had absolutely no idea who this provincial fellow was you will remember the comte de cher my son crackled the dry voice of his mother catherine de medici i have certainly never forgotten him for he supported my marriage to your father from the moment it was proposed welcome back to paris antoine de saville we are happy to see both you and your lovely gabrielle skye was fascinated they could say what they would in england about catherine de medici but by god she was politic madamele serpentshe was called behind her back and skye could well imagine it was justified she had no beauty in fact she was rather plaina small dumpy woman with olive skin and dark hair now streaked with iron gray which showed beneath her cap her eyes however were incredible sharp and as black as raisins they were the most alive thing about her they were intelligent eyes thoughtful eyes secretive eyes they saw all and passed it on to her facile brain which sorted and used every piece of information obtained here was a power to be reckoned with skye thought antoine de saville had introduced his large family to the king young queen isabeau and queen mother catherine now skye heard him say and this is my stepson madame adam de marisco the seigneur de lundy and his betrothed wife madame burke adam bowed beautifully while skye curtseyed low you are english catherine de medici queried adam yes majesty i was born there my father was an englishman although my mother is french my lands and title are however english and your betrothed is english i am irish your majesty skye replied irish ah the irish forever giving poor elizabeth tudor problems no more problems than she gives us majesty catherine de medici stared hard at skye and then she cackled with laughter it is all in how one looks at it eh madame then her laughter died you are catholic madame yes majesty and you msieur de marisco are you a member of englands church or the true church i was raised in the holy catholic faith majesty adam replied the queen mother nodded satisfied with his answer this is my daughter the princesse marguérite she said and her betrothed our young king of navarre again skye and adam made obeisance to the royal couple the princess had her mothers coloring but fortunately she looked like her valois relations and was quite lovely henri of navarre was a very tall powerfully built young man with dark hair and merry amber eyes boldly he assessed skye his eyes dropping to her extreme décolletage his eyes widened appreciatively caressed lingeringly and then shot up to meet hers in a daring challenge adam being occupied with the princess fortunately did not notice but skye grew warm with embarrassment msieur she scolded the king of navarre gently determined that he should not even contemplate her encouragement madame cannot blame me he replied i am a connoisseur of beauty and you madame are the most beautiful creature it has ever been my incredible good fortune to meet but tell me when and where we may meet i must make love to you msieur you are to be married tomorrow what of your bride henri de navarre smiled charmingly margot she wont mind i am an affianced woman then we have something in common skye was exasperated she must discourage this impetuous man taking a deep breath she said you are naught but a rude boy of nineteen msieur i am a woman past thirty ahh he smiled warmly at her you are experienced then and i adore women of experience while skye tried to extricate herself from this very difficult situation catherine de medici watched from beneath hooded lids deciding that her daughters conversation with de marisco was boring she listened in on skye and henri de navarre so the huguenot with the prodigious appetite for women was interested in the irishwoman here was a situation that could perhaps be used to her advantage henri was going to need to be diverted soon and the beautiful irishwoman looked as though she could certainly divert him if only she were willing skye wasnt willing however and catherine knew enough about human nature to see that the lady was not playing coy it was unfortunate the queen mother thought but then she had a number of lovely creatures in her flyingsquadronwho could be ordered to distract the king of navarre if the proper time came henri de navarre however was not discouraged by skyes stern rebuffs all women he had discovered could eventually be wooed and won some were just harder to win than others but it had been his experience that those ladies were the sweetest conquests of all reluctantly he allowed skye and adam to pass on but he was determined that sooner than later he would hold the irish beauty in his arms and she would swoon with delight as all the others did at his passionate kisses you are angry adam said when they were out of earshot of the royals i must assume that the young king of navarre made indecent suggestions to you sweetheart he took two goblets of chilled wine from the tray of a passing servant and handed her one i cannot imagine henri of navarre not being taken by your beauty it is outrageous filmed skye he is to be married tomorrow and here he is propositioning women the night before adam chuckled typical behavior of the young man i am told the poor princess gods bones skye dont feel sorry for that hottempered little bitch marguérite de valois she is the duc de guises mistress in fact she wished to marry him and he was quite agreeable unfortunately catherine de medici felt the match with navarre more favorable to her and de guise had just hurriedly wed with the princess de porcienne to escape a possible royal assassination the queen mother wouldnt hesitate to inflict lamorteitalienneupon de guise in face i suspect she is quite sorry he escaped her the de guises are too ambitious and catherine considers them a threat to her sons she has never forgiven them for the way they treated her when her eldest françois ii was married to their little niece the queen of scots what a family skye exclaimed they are as bad as the tudors adam chuckled power he said is a very heady draught sweetheart from some hidden corner the musicians started to play and the guests began to get into formation to dance skye moved gracefully in and out of the figure smiling softly in her pleasure at adam who partnered her with the utmost grace for so big a man mischievously he stole a kiss and she found herself laughing up at him with pure happiness as far as she was concerned they were the only two people on the face of the earth how fortunate i am she thought somehow it has all come out all right in less than two months adam and i will be married bess tudor will be angry but i know that eventually shell forgive us and well go home again well rebuild adams castle on lundy it is the perfect place for usan island between our two countries well gather my children and together we will grow old together that didnt seem like such an awful idea to skye he saw her smiling and asked what makes you so happy sweetheart gazing back up at him she said i was thinking of our growing old together adam he chuckled do you think we might be young for just a little while longer skye with you for my wife my life is but beginning oh my darling she cried softly and there were quick tears sparkling like diamonds in her sapphire eyes what a lovely thing to say to me adamadam de marisco is it really you as the dance ended they heard an excited feminine voice they looked about for the owner of the voice and an incredibly beautifully woman whirled into their sight reedslender with a magnificent high bosom and tiny waist she was dressed in apple green and gold silk which complimented her wonderful reddishblond hair merdeadam swore under his breath and skye giggled at the oath the woman stopped before them eyed skye briefly dismissed her insultingly and then flung herself on adams chest adam machérii cannot believe it is really you mondieuyou are a hundred times more handsome than when we last met detaching the woman from his doublet adam set her back from him and said in an icy tone skye this is athenais boussac nonnonchérithe beauty was not a bit disturbed by adams unfriendly tone you will remember i married de montoire i am the duchesse de beuvron and how is your husband madame la duchesse quite dead chériand in hell i hope he was the most wretched man you know but a realman madame la duchesse i have no doubt knowing your opinion on that subject tell me how many sons did he father on you now skye knew who the woman was this was the very same creature who had once scorned adams love when she found out he could not have children skye put a gentle hand on adams arm come my love she said i see your mother signaling to us across the room who is this female adam tell her to go away we have much to talk about chéri as always athenais your manners are deplorable this female is my betrothed wife madame burke now if you will excuse us adamathenais de montoire caught at his sleeve adam she repeated pleadingly we must talk there is nothing to talk about madame la duchesse and taking skyes arm adam moved across the floor to where his mother and stepfather were standing sacrebleuexclaimed gaby who had witnessed the entire exchange that creature is shameless what did she want my son to talk she said hah was adams mothers angry reply athenais de montoire was never noted for her ability to converse more than likely she has decided she wants another husband and now that she is rich and titled in her own right she is after you again quellechienne you will remember maman that the reason athenais broke our betrothal was that she learned i could not have children i doubt she has changed so much over the last twenty years and in any case i am not interested in the bitch my son gaby de saville said men can often be great fools athenais cares nothing for children she said what she said to you twenty years ago because the duc de beuvron had made her father a rather handsome offer for her and it was more to baron boussacs advantage to marry his daughter to a wealthy old duc than to a then penniless english lordling it was a miracle that they received such a magnificent offer but de beuvron was elderly and childless he lusted openly after athenais and she was a virgin how she used that one honest jewel of hers to lure de beuvron onward to his doom it is said that the duc demanded to know from baron boussac what athenaiss dowry would be well my dear there was no dowry as you well know and so here gaby lowered her voice it is rumored that the baron brought athenais into the room where he and the duc were ironing out the agreement and when he removed her cloak she was stark naked beneath it as i heard the story de beuvron looked at athenais who turned to show him all and the duc almost had an apoplectic fit then and there his lust was so hot then the baron said there monseigneur is my daughters dowry to you a flawless face and form no amount of gold that i could give you would equal such graces as he covered his daughter again with her cloak the duc practically fell over his feet to sign the marriage contract instead of boussac givingde beuvron gold he received a fortune for athenaiss maidenhead the duc did manage to get one son on her after five years of marriage the birth almost killed her it is said for the baby came feet first she was never able to have another not that she minded the old duc died two years ago and his son is now fifteen the boy is the image of his father and it is said a bit weak in the head he dotes upon his mother i am told you have certainly kept up mother havent you adam teased with a grin athenais de montoire has always been the topic of gossip in the district adam after her son was born any man who took her eye was quickly in her bed her lovers were legion but since de beuvrons death she has spent a great deal of time at court and i have lost track but only for a lack of any informant to gossip with the comte chuckled antoine gaby pouted pretending to take offense she is very beautiful skye said thoughtfully oui gaby replied but it is the same kind of beauty that a rotting lily has to the eye all is perfection but beneath the surface one finds decadence and writhing maggots you are far more beautiful adam soothed skye it is not her beauty that disturbs me skye said there is something about her something wicked i see it in her eyes she looked across the room to where they had left the duchesse de beuvron athenais de montoire stared boldly back at her but skye was not one bit perturbed equally bold she openly surveyed the woman in defiance of fashion the duchesse wore her gorgeous reddishblond hair long and loose it fell in rippling waves down her back like a shining mantle her face was a little cats face with a high broad forehead narrowing into a determined little pointed chin her amber yellow eyes were large and round her mouth long and narrow and painted red only her nose might be considered less than flawless for although long and elegant it hooked under slightly at the end spoiling the perfection she was still a beautiful woman though as she grew older she needed more of the artifice of paint to catch the eye gaby put a hand on skyes arm drawing her attention away from the duchesse i have heard that athenais is a member of the queen mothers escadrillevolantée her flying squadron skye cocked her head puzzled what on earth is that the queen uses beautiful women here at court to seduce the men she wishes to use and to influence the women who do her bidding are called the escadrillevolantéeor as you would say in your tongue flying squadron more than one hapless man has been lured to his doom in catherine de medicis quest for power skye let her eyes wander back to where athenais de montoire had been standing but the duchesse was gone now the hidden musicians were playing another sprightly tune now and adam led her back onto the dance floor forgetting about the duchesse de beuvron skye began to have a wonderful time she danced with adam and his charming halfbrothers and the husbands of his sisters and his nephew they all partook of the magnificent buffet that had been set out in the rooms surrounding the ballroom a buffet so incredible that skye thought never to be hungry again just looking at the bounty of france spread before her wondering eyes there were pâtés foie gras from toulouse partridge pates from nérac fresh tunny pâtés from toulon there was seafood in profusion raw oysters opened cold and fresh by kitchen boys for the diners mussels in dijon mustard sole in white wine lamprey eel platters with whole salmon on beds of cress and with whole carp both from the loire river there were dishes of salted white herring smoked red herring and a herring that had been bloated salted and smoked there were silver platters of small game birds partridge woodcock from the dombes and skylarks from pézenás there was roast goose and capons from caux in ginger sauce cooked tongue from vierzon bayonne hams boar stag roe deer beef and lamb there were pies of sparrow and lark rabbit and hare there were plates of larded ducks and roasted teal heron and whole swans the greens were few artichokes in olive oil bowls of new lettuce scallions and radishes there was fresh bread and rolls and tubs of butter both sweet and salted as well as half a dozen varieties of cheese and platters of eggs both hardboiled and deviled an entire table was devoted to sweets the centerpiece being a huge marzipan confection of the cathedral of notre dame its square complete with the bridal couple as they would appear tomorrow there were gâteaux of every description meringues early apples anjou pears sweet black cherries large round golden peaches and small plump apricots the wine flowed both red and white the entire evening catherine de medici did not stint on the prenuptial feast of a princess of france after they had eaten and skye swore that adam sampled everything on all the tables a point he vigorously denied there was more dancing when the young king of navarre appeared before the startled de saville family and claimed skye for a dance he first made it a point to charm all the ladies he was courteous and smiling to gaby and her two eldest daughters he flirted mischievously with musette and two of his nieces matilde and mariegabrielle he was charmingly teasing to the youngest girl in the family attending the ball and little catherinehenriette later swore to her mother she would never in her lifetime love anyone else but king henri of navarre then with a polite bow and a smile to the gentlemen henri of navarre led skye firmly to the dance floor have you missed me chériehe laughed down into her face how could i miss you monseigneur i do not even know you was her cool reply his arm tightened about her waist we must remedy that oversight madame for you have enchanted me with your celtic beauty you would do better to contemplate the beauty of your bride monseigneur henri laughed at the severe tone of her rebuke and bringing his face close to hers he murmured you have a mouth that was meant for kisses chériehow can you be so cold to me when i burn for your touch for a kind word skye turned her head to the left as the pattern of the dance dictated and then she deliberately stamped upon her partners foot mind your manners monseigneur de navarre he winced as her little pointed heel dug into his foot but he could still not resist a chuckle your coldness inflames me chérie he said with disturbing intensity for i know that beneath the icy hauteur of your words is a passionate woman the softness of your lips gives you away as does the adorable little pulse in your beautiful white throat that is beating so frantically at this very moment skye was momentarily disturbed he was too young a man this king of navarre to know so much about women but gathering her wits she replied calmly the pulse in my throat beats quickly because the pace of the dance is swift monseigneur henri smiled knowingly you have a quick mind chériei like a woman who can offer a man more than just beauty i have offered you nothing monseigneur nor do i intend to i will be quite frank with you so that there is no further misunderstanding between us my impending marriage is a love match i would never betray adam de marisco in anyway now that you understand this monseigneur de navarre i know you will cease this futile pursuit of me the pursuit of love and beauty is never futile chériewas his answer skye was becoming annoyed with this spoiled young king monseigneur i do not doubt that this room is filled tonight with women who would kill for the honor of sleeping in your bed i however am not one of them she said the dance had come to an end and to her relief there was adam at her side skye curtseyed low to the king of navarre and taking her betrothed husbands arm she allowed him to lead her away adam was chortling softly beneath his breath from the look on the face of msieur de navarre sweetheart you have just given him a severe setdown what an impossible boy skye fumed his attitude is that he is irresistible to women it is his reputation skye he cannot understand the word noadam it is not i imagine a word often tendered him sweetheart she stopped and looking up at him said arent you even the tiniest bit jealous adam the king of navarre wishes to seduce me in truth sweetheart i am enraged but i must think of our future if elizabeth tudor refuses to recognize our marriage and we cannot return to england france is our refuge we cannot however remain safely in france if i have killed or wounded a royal prince of the blood in a ducl therefore i must remain outwardly calm skye but believe me i am not calm i stood and watched henri of navarre with his hands all over you and his bold eyes mentally undressing you assessing your finer points i would have enjoyed putting my hands around the elegant throat of that puppy and squeezing the life from him skye smiled up at him sweetly satisfied do you think your mother would think badly of us if we went home now we could send the coach back for them it is not far now why sweetheart would we want to leave such a gay gathering he teased her because my mouth which the king of navarre assures me was made for kisses longs to taste yours because monmarii long to feel your hands on me because i am a totally shameless wench adam de marisco and i am hot for your loving he felt a bolt of desire tear into his body at her provocative words her smoldering look heedless of how it might look he yanked her none too gently into an alcove of the ballroom and his arm tightened about her as he looked with blazing eyes down into her face what sorcery is this you work on me you celtic witch his lips were dangerously close to hers and skye felt a weakness in her legs which threatened to give way beneath her loveshe didnt say the word aloud but rather mouthed it arid so tempting were her soft lips that unable to resist he kissed her passionately skye slipped her arms up around his neck pressing her practically naked bosom against the soft velvet of his elegant doublet her pulse was pounding in her ears and he groaned softly against her mouth licking the corners of it suggestively take me home adam she whispered to him against his lips he drew a deep breath and said you will have to give me a moment to collect myself sweetheart and it would be best if you untangled yourself from me and stood quietly her blue eyes were twinkling as she stepped back and folding her hands demurely she waited for him to regain his composure she said nothing but her lips were twitching with her suppressed amusement how she loved this big man he reminded her of skyes eyes grew wide with the sudden realizationhe reminded her of geoffrey in face and form they were nothing alike yet there was similarity of spirit that could not be denied what is it sweetheart he had seen her face heard her unconscious intake of breath geoffrey she said for some reason at this moment you remind me of geoffrey southwood we were cousins adam reminded her yes skye said slowly i remember your telling me that the southwoods were the legitimate branch of the family and the de mariscos the illegitimate branch thats right he said geoffrey and i both descend from the original geoffroi de sudbois who came with william of normandy to england he springs from geoffrois wife gwyneth of lynmouth and i from the line of geoffrois mistress matilde de marisco in fact his southwood grandfather and my de marisco grandmother were brother and sister for over the years the family did intermarry whenever the southwoods had a spare younger daughter and a little dowry they married the girl to the heir of lundy thus keeping the family ties strong adam sighed there will be no more heirs to lundy he said sadly and the de marisco line dies with me she put a comforting hand on his arm take me home mon marimy greatest sorrow will always be that i cannot give you a child but as the blessed mother is my witness adam i will love you till death and even beyond as no one has ever loved you before then i shall be the luckiest of all the de mariscos in the last five centuries skye he said gallantly and taking her arm he led her from the ballroom of the louvre and to their waiting coach chapter the wedding of marguérite de valois princess of france and her very distant cousin henri king of navarre a huguenot was a most controversial match it had been engineered by her mother catherine de medici over the protests of the holy catholic church the pope had refused a dispensation but that would not be known until after the marriage for the queen mother knew that the archbishop of paris would not marry her daughter and henri of navarre if he learned of the holy fathers refusal to cooperate catherine de medici had come to france as the bride of françois is second son henri with the death of her brotherinlaw four years later she found herself the future queen of france her husband despised her finding her physically unattractive he was not intelligent enough himself to discover that behind the plain face was a highly developed mind catherine de medici bided her time ignoring the insults of the mocking court her husbands mistress was an astoundingly beautiful woman some twenty years his senior and to catherine the greatest offense of all was that diane de poitiers was in sympathy with her how the charming beauty strove to be kind to the dumpy little florentine how she defended her against baseless slanders that to catherine was the unkindest act of all for she wanted to hate this woman who had stolen the heart of her husband before henri even knew that catherine de medici daughter of the duke of urbino existed it was six years before diane could persuade her lover to consummate the marriage he had made for france and afterward he only came to his wifes bed when forced it was eleven years before catherine bore her first child the future françois ii two daughters followed one sickly boy was not enough and henri ii king of france took to visiting his wifes bed on a more regular basis these conjugal sojourns became embarrassing and emotionally painful for catherine for although she had never known any man intimately except her husband she somehow sensed that there should be more to their coupling than there was each time it was the same henri would arrive announced in his wifes bedchamber he would say but three things to her and they were always the same arriving he said bonsoirmadamebeginning his legal assault upon her body he would cry for france and shortly afterward he would say in parting adieumadamecatherine was pregnant a total of eleven times and bore seven live children four of them sons when henri ii was killed as the result of an accident on the tilting field his widows first act was to send diane de poitiers from court but catherine was no longer queen of france a saucy and beautiful chit of a girl named mary of scotland was mary was guided in her every move by her mothers family the powerful house of guiselorraine who because catherines foolish son françois ii was so besotted by his little wife also guided the king catherine gritted her teeth and moved to block the dangerous and growing power of the de guises there could be no challenge to the house of valois fortunately françois ii died within a year and mary of scotland was quickly sent packing back to her own land where she had not lived since she was six charles ix catherines second son was but ten and the queen mother ruled for him this was what she had waited for all these years power it was an incredible aphrodisiac for twentyseven years she had stood in the shadow of others but now catherine de medici came into her own she was surprisingly a tolerant woman who strove hard to make peace between the two warring factions that threatened to tear france apart during the reigns of both her late fatherinlaw and her husband the protestant movement had gained a strong foothold in france catherine had been born a catholic but she was too intelligent a woman to believe in only one possible path to salvation when the de guise family put itself at the head of the majority catholic faction catherine subtly championed the opposing side religion meant nothing to her although she followed the tenets of her faith enough to prevent church censure her overriding concern was for france and its ruling family they must survive and she would do whatever she had to do to insure that catherine de medici had learned a great lesson from her husbands passion for diane de poitiers a beautiful woman could gain much from a besotted man consequently she began gathering together a small force of the most beautiful women at court women who needed something from the queen some needed money to maintain their extravagant lifestyles others wanted favors for themselves or family members or even lovers catherine let it be known she was there to help but once in the queen mothers debt you were expected to repay her by aiding her to manipulate the powerful men of the kingdom catherine de medicis escadrillevolantéebecame notorious but not so notorious that those approached by its beautiful and sensual members did not give in to their demands catherine was not one to fool herself and she had seen the handwriting on the wall françois ii had never even consummated his marriage to mary of scotland being too ill to do so the current king her son charles ix had only a little daughter by his wife isabeau of austria and a bastard son by his mistress marie touchet charles was sickly and subject to fits however and there would be no more children for his latest illness had rendered him impotent catherines two other sons were not particularly promising the duc danjou was disgracefully effeminate wore an earring in his ear and consorted with a band of similar young men the youngest valois son hercule rechristened françois after his elder brothers death was also not physically strong the next in line for frances throne was therefore henri son of anthony duc of vendôme and bourbon and his wife jeanne queen of navarre henri de bourbon prince of navarre was a big healthy ruddy boy who had been brought up to ride hard run barefoot over the rocky hills of navarre with the goats fight drink and make love well he was his grandfathers pride and his mothers source of despair for jeanne of navarre was a strict and militant protestant at fifteen henri proved along with his younger cousin the prince of condé to be the protestant forces salvation he was it seemed an excellent military leader seeing this catherine de medici decided there was only one course open to her she had met henri on several occasions what had been clear to her was that he was no religious fanatic this was a realist like herself and when the time came henri of navarre would do what he had to do to gain the throne of france she was betting that this would not involve trying to force the french to the protestant faith after her sons he was frances hope and in her heart she knew he would be king for the house of valois would die with her sons this had been told her by a great parisian fortuneteller and being a believer in such things catherine had decided to marry her youngest child to henri of navarre the king of navarre was agreeable he saw the obvious advantages in such a match marguérite of valois was not so agreeable she was in love with henri de guise and had even allowed him to take her maidenhead in the childish belief that it would force her mother to consent to their marriage catherine laughed at her daughters tactics and hinted to the de guise family that unless duc henri took himself a wife he might find himself in an early grave to marguérites fury and frustration duc henri quickly wed with the princesse de porcien and now tomorrow august th she was to be married to that big boor henri de navarre staunchly catholic paris was outraged that their adorable margot who was so terribly in love with the handsome blond duc de guise should be sacrificed this way but catherine de medici wanted peace between catholics and protestants lest spain and england involve themselves in france now however on the night before her so carefully arranged wedding she was having second thoughts about the advisability of it all paris was filled with wedding guests many of them huguenots the huguenots were in many cases being extremely offensive boasting in the taverns of what they would do to the catholics when their leader the king of navarre became the king of france then too there was the very strong influence wielded by admiral coligny the great huguenot nobleman on the weakwilled king twice today charles had overridden catherines advice in favor of colignys and it was not the first time this had happened catherine de medici decided that admiral coligny had to be removed she was convinced that once that was accomplished the king would accept her advice again and the protestants would calm down august th dawned fair and warm because the groom was not a catholic the marriage ceremony itself was to take place on the steps of notre dame cathedral and the bride would then enter the great church to hear mass while her new husband waited outside the square outside the cathedral was crowded with the invited who ohhed and ahhed as the bride arrived clothed in azureblue silk the underskirt of her gown embroidered with the golden lilies of france several small children of the highest nobility held up the heavily trimmed ermine and clothofgold cloak that fell from the brides shoulders as she made her way to her place all the agreements had been signed before the ball at the louvre the night before and now the actual marriage was to be quickly accomplished but marguérite de valois was defiant to the bitter end when the elderly bishop of paris asked in his quavery voice if she would have henri de navarre for her husband the princesse remained mutinously silent a very long minute passed and the bishop now visibly nervous repeated his question a small wicked smile played about margots mouth as she sensed victory if she didnt answer they couldnt force her to this marriage it was all so simple why hadnt she thought of it sooner suddenly king charles leaned forward and hooking his fingers into his rebellious sisters hair nodded her head vigorously up and down with a sigh of relief the bishop then demanded of henri of navarre if he would take marguérite de valois as his wife henri hesitated just a brief second long enough to tease margot into thinking that perhaps he wouldnt after all when he finally spoke up in a loud sure voice she sent him a quelling look but henri was not intimidated and grinned back at his furious bride along with the de savilles skye and adam had been invited to enter the cathedral for the mass afterward as they rode back in the enormous royal procession toward the louvre and the marriage feast they heard people in the streets cheering the duc de guise who pretended he did not notice skye raised an eyebrow and said well that should take msieur de navarre down a peg or two adam laughed henri of navarre had really annoyed his beautiful skye with his persistent refusal to believe she was not interested in him there had even been flowers this morning for skye brought by a dirtyfaced street urchin who only said for madame burke from navarre before grinning impudently and running off skye had thrown the bouquet from the window with a shriek of outrage de guise deludes himself if he thinks he can overcome navarres claim to france adam said i suspect we have not yet seen the last of frances civil wars how unfortunate how foolish of the french to fight over semantics skye replied i have never understood how sane men could argue about the way in which they worship i have often thought adam said softly that if the christ returned to earth today he would shed bitter tears over the cruelties men perpetrate in his name she nodded and slipped her hand into his let us think on something more pleasant my darling like our own wedding i have already sent a messenger to england for the children adam replied they all will be easy to gather but for robin i have written to robbie asking that he bring robin from court on the pretext that his sister is ill and wishes to see him i will not write to the queen until after our marriage for fear she forbid it i do not want to have to go directly against elizabeth tudor no skye said she will be angry enough when we present her with the fact of our marriage but i too would prefer not to defy her openly for the next week paris was a city of celebration in honor of the royal marriage there were fairs with fortunetellers and dancing bears and wonderful food distributed by the king in honor of his sister and for the nobility the feasting and the dancing at the louvre hardly stopped neither did the intrigue the huguenot colignys influence grew and catherine de medici seethed well madame you see what your meddling has gotten you the duc de guise sneered softly to catherine one evening it is not good i will admit the queen mother said i would be quit of coligny navarre will come around eventually admiral coligny must pass by the house of an old tutor of mine on his way home madame i would consider it an honor to aid you in your hour of need we are both of us after all for france the queen mothers eyes gave no indication that she had even heard de guise you will msieur le duc of course do as your conscience dictates she murmured as she moved away from him on the twentysecond of august admiral coligny was shot at and wounded as he walked the short distance from the louvre palace to his own paris house there had been witnesses unfortunately and it was ascertained that the shot had come from a house owned by the duc de guise who had fired the shot however was not known the huguenots in paris for the wedding were outraged and it was all the kings men could do to keep order for the city was seething with anger as the two factions met in various public places trading insults threats and sometimes blows the princes of navarre and condé as well as admiral coligny himself worked valiantly to keep their people under control a hothead the admiral declared twas only a shot fired by a fanatic did god not spare me my friends is that not a sign that i am meant to five on to carry out his work the huguenots settled down to an uneasy truce with the catholics in the louvre charles ix was outraged furious and fearful by turns the lucid mood that had prevailed duc to his sisters nuptials was fast dissolving into terrified paranoia helped along by his mother and the duc de guise still rational charles demanded that the assassin and his accomplices be brought to justice coligny is my friend he shouted his first thoughts are for me and for france he would end this civil strife between his huguenots and the catholic league civil war is not good for the country you have said so yourself mother you have told me a hundred nay a thousand times that a king who cannot maintain order is doomed charles paced nervously about his apartment a blow against coligny is a blow against me against france i want the cowardly assassin found catherine de medici sat very still in her chair her hands were folded in her lap her black eyes flat and expressionless you are getting needlessly upset charles and you are beginning to babble no one has struck a blow against either you or france admiral coligny has of late usurped your very authority and it is obvious that someone who saw that attempted to correct the situation that the means chosen were less than peaceful is regrettable still we must examine why coligny and his huguenots have of late been less than cooperative come sire de guise murmured you have been more than generous to these heretics and now they attempt to stab you in the back what do you mean the king was beginning to look terrified now chariot the duc of anjou replied the kings next brother is it not obvious is not whatobvious henri i do not understand charles quavered anjou put an arm about his elder brother and spoke in a confidential tone coligny is shot at and his witnesses all huguenots claim the shot was fired from a house owned by colignys archenemy de guise here how do we know that coligny did not plan the whole thing himself and that the alleged assassin is a huguenot but why would he do that henri most obvious dearest chariot most obvious if coligny could rouse all his supporters to believe that you our beloved king and de guise your loyal servant were responsible for the attempted murder he could then incite them to rebellion right here in paris he could convince them to storm the louvre itself and the louvre could scarce be defended against an armed mob brother they would kill all the valois and then put their huguenot king of navarre upon your throne his claim after we are all gone is quite legitimate and with our sister margot as his queen who would gainsay him france this is not a plot against coligny my brother it is a plot against you against france rubbish everyone the frightened king included turned to look to charless youngest sibling the duc dalençon really charles the goodnatured alençon drawled you are allowing de guise and anjou to terrify you out of your wits whatever the truth of this matter neither coligny nor his huguenots are plotting to destroy you if i were looking for a villain i should certainly look closer to home brother and exactly what do you mean by that alençon the duc de guise demanded his hand going to his sword mondieude guise you are bold and quite sure of yourself the youngest valois prince taunted will you dare to draw your weapon in the kings presence messieurs messieurs catherine chided seeing the situation begin to get out of hand damn alençon anyway we are getting away from the heart of the matter why are the two greatest houses in france the valois kings and their premier noblemen the house of de guiselorraine bound not only by blood but by religion squabbling may god have mercy on me for my shortsightedness in trying to make peace between the heretics and the mother church i have been wrong and it has caused needless suffering catherine de medici rose from her chair and walking over to her son she knelt at his feet forgive me charles i have been wrong and i have given you bad counsel i shall retire to a convent and spend my days atoning for this terrible sin both anjou and de guise cast their eyes heavenward in their attempt to appear pious but the poor duc dalençon was hard put not to burst into laughter at his mothers theatrical gesture he knew as did the others that she had no intention of taking up the religious life a less religious woman he had never known the king however was now totally shaken and confused the one constant in his life had always been his mother she had never ever failed him no mother no do not leave me we will solve this problem together he cried helping catherine to her feet there is only one way majesty de guise said ominously we must kill the huguenots but it is a sin to kill the king whispered no brother anjou murmured soothingly the church will not condemn us for destroying the heretics they will sing our praises charles looked to his mother catherine de medici said nothing but she did nod her head in the affirmative i cant youmustde guise pounded there is no choice anjou said it is either you or them dearest brother we cannot lose you you are france all of them allde guise thundered a fanatics gleam in his eye not navarre or condé the queen mother said with sudden determination in her voice if margot were freed of navarre it would only be a matter of time before the princesse de porcien was put aside by her husband de guise catherine knew that her sons would then be killed ruthlessly and with navarre gone de guise would press his slender claim to the throne with a valois heiress as his wife ohnomycleverfriendcatherine thought iamsmarter thanthat it must be all de guise insisted navarre and condé will convert to catholicism when faced with no other choice with their leaders gone the remaining huguenots will also have no other choice but to return to mother church we need these people charles they are industrious and clever and have much to offer us navarre and condé must be spared yes mother i understand but as for the rest kill them all i want not one left alive to reproach me not one he began to shiver uncontrollably with fear marie he whimpered i want marie catherine turned her allseeing eyes to alençon you she snapped pointing a fat accusatory finger at him fetch mademoiselle touched with a mocking smile of congratulation and a sketchy bow the duc dalençon said of course maman at once and he left the kings chamber mademoiselle touchet the kings mistress was quickly brought to him from her nearby apartments seeing his distress marie touchet ran to the king with a sympathetic little cry and began to soothe his fears with her gentle reassurances from soft hands and voice the queen mother nodded approvingly and then signaled to the others to follow her out of the room the frightened king never even saw them go outside the kings rooms catherine de medici turned to her son anjou and the duc de guise i mean what i say gentlemen if anything happens to navarre or condé you will not survive them any longer than it takes me to find out and you know that i do not speak idly messieurs when is it to be done anjou demanded come with me to my apartments and we will speak further on it his mother said moving swiftly away from the kings rooms entering her salon she abruptly dismissed her women and then turning to de guise and her son said it must be done tonight there is no time replied de guise the soldier you have no choice catherine said at this very moment coligny lies wounded but tomorrow or the next day he will be well enough to come to the king with his personal accusations then all is lost for us it must be tonight now before coligny has the opportunity to see charles again it is not yet evening de guise mused slowly perhaps if we worked quickly and spread the word to our people once it has begun all paris will join in to destroy the huguenots yes it can be done when the tocsin sounds at two oclock tomorrow morning we will begin is that satisfactory majesty is that time enough yes was the reply it is a good time for the pious huguenots will be sleeping in their houses she smiled all but my good beaufrèrewho will be celebrating with the rest of the court at the last ball to be given in honor of his marriage to my daughter tomorrow margot and navarre will go down to chenonceaux for their honeymoon trip away from all distractions of the court i still say that navarre should be killed too de guise muttered why so your adulterous union with my daughter might be made legalafter of course the removal of your wife i think not de guise be grateful i did not have you removed forcibly these past three afternoons from my daughters bed where you have lingered while henri of navarre played tennis with alençon in the courts by the river madame the duc de guise made an attempt at denial which catherine waved aside do not bother to deny the truth msieur it is of no import in this matter what is important is that we keep our dear navarre and condé amused tonight i think for condé it will be mademoiselle de grenier you cannot lure condé with a woman mother he is newly married himself and besides he is an awful prude anjou said catherine laughed you underestimate me my son condés passion military strategist that he is is chess mademoiselle de grenier is the finest chess player at court she will engage him in a tourney and keep him thus occupied as to his wife i will see that alençon keeps her amused for she is quite fond of him in a sisterly way and navarre the duc de guise queried catherine for navarre i have a special treat messieurs since the night before his wedding he has been vigorously pursuing the comte de chers soontobe bellefilleshe is an irishwoman named madame burke betrothed to marry the comtesses son by her first marriage a seigneur de marisco the lady has been quite adamant in her refusal of henri which of course only makes him more ardent what of the betrothed husband anjou demanded where does he stand in all of this he is amused the queen mother said and does not consider navarre a severe threat to his betrothed wife were it not for my aid navarre would not have a chance with the lady but i shall give him that chance the duchesse de beuvron was once to marry the seigneur de marisco now that she is widowed she would like to regain his favor i will see that she has a chance to plead her case tonight while you anjou will lead madame burke to a secluded place to meet navarre she will not of course know she is meeting him she will believe she is to see me that i wish her to carry a personal message from me to elizabeth tudor when she returns to england what if she plays on navarres sense of honor de guise asked what then madame catherine de medici snorted must i outline everything for you anjou my secret study you know it the one with the bed in the alcove mother yes you will bring madame burke there drug her or stun her with a light blow yes perhaps that is better for a drug might render her useless bind her hands and see she is in a state of dishabille upon the bed she has beautiful little breasts and i note that navarre is fascinated with them one good look and his gallantry will dissolve as his lust takes over she chuckled richly yes one can depend upon navarres reactions when a beautiful woman is involved wait until after one oclock before you lure madame burke away anjou we want navarre well occupied when the two oclock tocsin sounds the final ball that night was a triumph that spilled out from the ballrooms of the louvre palace into its neat flowerfilled gardens that bordered the river seine except for henri of navarres unwelcome and persistent attentions skye was enjoying her time in paris immensely yet she decided that she preferred the tudor court to this one there was too much intrigue in the french court whose inhabitants were a touch too chic and too wicked to suit her taste i never thought she said to adam that i should say i preferred the english and their bluff honest ways but compared to the french they are less complicated he chuckled down at her do you think you damned impossible irish will ever stop fighting us sweetheart she looked up at him her sapphire eyes wide with innocence why adam she said sweetly tis not the irish who are fighting the english tis the english who are fighting the irish not this englishman he murmured bending low to brush her lips with his skyes heart began to race wildly he seemed to be having that effect on her these days devil she whispered back at him if you dont stop your provocative behavior i shall certainly cause a scene mesenfantsgaby said lightly i regret to intrude and they broke apart laughing but the queen has requested my son that you give audience to the duchesse de beuvron nevermamanadams brows drew together in a frown adam you cannot refuse queen catherine athenais is one of her favorites i know that nothing the duchesse says can change how you feel nor should it but as the queen has personally involved herself you must give athenais a fair hearing adam skye said softly how often have i wanted to refuse elizabeth tudor and both you and robbie have not let me what is good for me must also be good for thee go and speak with the bitch i do not mind i suppose we cannot have catherine de medici angry at us especially should we need her refuge from the tudors all right sweetheart ill go and let athenais prattle at me for a while and i promise maman not to wring her deceiving little neck he stomped away across the ballroom to where the duchesse of beuvron waited by queen catherines side smiling smugly you are so very good for him my dear gaby said softly i have not really seen my son happy in many years you are the cause of that happiness and i shall ever be grateful to you for it it is not hard to make adam happy gaby i love him she said quietly had he not been so concerned for my welfare and i not so concerned about everything else we might have wed long ago now i will let nothing stop us madame burke the two women turned and recognizing the duc of anjou they both curtseyed low your highness he acknowledged their obeisance and then said madame burke my mother would like to speak with you privately if you will follow me please queen catherine wishes to see me forgive me msieur le duc but i do not understand i believe madame that my mother wishes you to carry a personal message back to england when you go a message to your queen they have become quite friendly duc to the negotiations between our two families regarding the matter of a marriage between my brother alençon and elizabeth tudor go my dear gaby said you are being honored that queen catherine would speak to you herself gaby reached out to smooth skyes hair and dress in a motherly fashion there ma belleyou are quite ready allezallez the duc of anjou smiled pleasantly and led skye off i must say madame he said as they departed the ballroom that your gown is a triumph this evening that particular shade of mauve pink highlights the creamy clarity of your skin and i should have never thought to use silver with pink crystal beads for the panel of your underskirt your dressmaker is obviously french and not english you have found me out msieur le duc skye replied i must admit to having had this gown made at archambault by the châteaus dressmaker did she choose the colors no i always choose my own colors and fabrics you have an eye madame most women i have found are willing to be led in the matter of dress which too often results in their looking ridiculous where are we going skye asked anjou as they seemed to be moving farther and farther away from the ballroom my mother has a private study in a remote part of the palace it insures that she not be disturbed there are some who are very much against this proposed marriage between my brother alençon and your queen you will therefore understand her desire for privacy madame of course skye murmured and followed the duc as he moved through one corridor after another she tried to keep track of where they were going but she eventually gave it up as hopeless the duc now led her up two flights of narrow stairs at the top of which was a small paneled door flinging the door open he stepped back saying please go in madame burke my mother will be with you in a few moments merci she said politely as she moved past him and then her brain exploded in a fiery burst of quick pain and the blackness rushed up to claim her skyes instinct for survival aided her to climb back from the darkness and she awoke with a small cry to find herself lying upon a curtained and canopied bed had she fallen had she suffered a fit that caused her head to ache so gingerly she attempted to sit up and in doing so she discovered that her arms were bound behind her at the wrists for a long moment confusion reigned as she tried to remember where she was slowly the memory became clear the duc of anjou had told her that his mother wished to speak privately with her and she had allowed him to lead her to queen catherines private study it was as she had been entering the study that she had fainted why were her arms tied skye now managed to sit up the alcove in which the bed was situated had a curtain drawn across its entrance msieur le duc she called are you there msieur danjou there was no answer only silence greeted her she still felt too weak to rise from the bed and skye looked curiously about the alcove to her total shock she saw the bodice and skirt of her ballgown lying neatly upon a chair startled she glanced down at herself and found that she wore only a single silk petticoat and her silk underblouse the rest of her undergarments including her stockings and garters were with her gown beyond the drawn curtain skye heard the door to the queens study open and a mans firm footsteps crossed the floor of the room toward her the curtain was whisked aside with a jingling of brass rings and henri of navarre stood there a huge smile splitting his face as he said in a pleased voice ah chérieyou have come all evening i have been sick with worry that you would change your mind in that instant skye knew that she had been led to and prepared for a seduction but by whom and why she was only a visitor to frances court she had no part in its intrigues or its politics obviously the king of navarre was not a party or at least not a knowledgeable party to the plot he was being used as she was msieur de navarre she said in what she hoped passed for a calm and reassuring voice i do not know what you mean can you not see my hands are bound most securely behind me i am not here willingly henri came into the alcove and seating himself next to her on the bed said but chérieyou have answered one of my love notes suggesting that i meet you here in my bellemèressecret study during the ball tonight at half after the hour of one oclock msieur i am a stranger to the louvre how could i have known of this room please undo my bonds i am most uncomfortable adam de marisco and his family will be worrying and wondering where i have gotten to and even i am not certain how to return to the ballroom will you aid me you did not answer my love note chérie henri of navarre looked perplexed i did not even receive it skye protested yet you are here he persisted the duc of anjou brought me here he said that the queen wished to speak privately with me that she desired me to carry a private message to my own queen in england catherine de medici knew her opponent well she had predicted that the sight of skye half dressed would divert navarre and in that she had been correct he barely heard her words for he was far more interested in her beautiful breasts which swelled provocatively above the neckline of her silken underblouse heaving temptingly in her agitation the beautiful irishwoman had inflamed his senses from the moment he had laid eyes on her and now here she was quite conveniently at his mercy her lovely body every bit if not more delicious than he had imagined it in his salacious daydreams of her still madame he said softly you are here and i am here and how foolish we would be not to avail ourselves of this golden opportunity reaching out he undid the ribbons that held her underblouse together the two halves parted easily and when henri had pushed them back over her rounded shoulders skye was effectively bare to her waist navarre caught his breath in genuine admiration for she had the most perfect little breasts he had ever seen msieur de navarre she said pleadingly i beg of you do not do this thing i am betrothed to a man i love how can i go to him if i have been despoiled by another navarre reached out and reverently caressed the silken flesh of one creamy orb chériei will wager that having seen these exquisite little fruits you possess a saint could not be stopped in his intent toward you besides you are not a virgin madame my knowledge of you is that you have outlived several husbands you have no maidenhead to protect i have my honor skye cried a womans honor is easily mended chériethe king of navarre said softly give her a diamond necklace or a small château and all is well again you have acquired a great deal of knowledge in your nineteen years msieur skye replied tardy he laughed enjoying her show of spirit i had my first woman when i was thirteen madame i do not think that a night has passed since then that i have not had a woman to pleasure me henri of navarre stood and began to divest himself of his clothing you have appealed to my finer self madame and you have scolded me neither of which has deterred me from my intent perhaps chérieyou did not come willingly to this bed but you are here and if i released you i should regret it all my days i shall scream she threatened him he laughed no one will hear you chériecatherine de medici put her private study in the most remote part of the louvre for many reasons not the least of which was that no one hear what transpired in this room should the queen decide to interrogate a prisoner if you scream not one soul will come to your aid and you will give yourself a very sore throat his forefinger reached out to smooth across her cheekbone then his hand slipped behind her head and loosened her hair pulling the pins out and placing them on the small nightstand until her midnightblack locks fell about her naked shoulders like a satin mantle dont be afraid chériehe soothed her in a low and now passionate voice you will like what we do together i am an expert lover i promise you and i will only give you pleasure chériei wont hurt you i swear it skye looked into henri of navarres amberbrown eyes and knew that nothing she might say would divert the young king from his path of seduction she was helpless before his lust and the best that she could hope for was that he was telling the truth and would not hurt her he would however get nothing from her she would lie quietly while he had his way with her and she hoped he would be quick they were leaving court and paris tomorrow and she would never see him again adam would never have to know skye was ashamed of her final thought but she would not hurt the man she loved with this tale when there was no need will you untie my hands monseigneur my arms are numb and i am most uncomfortable i promise not to fight you reaching behind her henri undid the silken cord by which she had been held fast and skye rubbed her arms which ached painfully as the blood began to flow back into them in freeing her he had taken the opportunity to remove her blouse entirely and now to her surprise he pushed her back onto the pillows drew her arms above her head and retied them quickly im sorry chériehe said genuine regret in his voice but despite your vow i know that your natural morality will cause you to defend your virtue against me i have far better uses for my hands at this time than fending off your blows standing up again the king finished undressing skye assessed him from beneath lowered eyelids he was a tall man almost as tall as adam and he was bigboned if anything he erred on the side of thinness which gave him an awkward appearance and she noted quickly as he climbed onto the bed with her he had huge feet his hands however were big slender and very elegant she saw as he drew her petticoat off her and caressed her hip he was gentle and soft in his leisurely exploration of her body how lovely you are he said quietly you have skin like the finest silk but i suspect i am not the first man to make that comparison still i have never known a woman with such fine skin chérieit has an almost druglike effect upon me he bent down and began to kiss her breasts his lips scorching the tender nipples with their fiery touch mondieuchériebut you are perfection damn him skye thought furiously as a tiny quiver rippled through her he is an expert lover and he is not going to devour me like a piece of cheese but rather go slowly until i can no longer bear it the bastard the kings mouth closed fiercely over her left nipple where it sucked hungrily forcing a small cry from between her lips instantly he lifted his head you like that chérieyou must tell me what pleases you i care not what you do she replied coldly it matters not what a little liar you are chériedo you think that you can hold back your passion from me youre too honest a woman he laughed softly soon mabellesoon he whispered into her ear soon you will lie beneath me crying with your pleasure you are one of those deliciously rare creatures born for loving and i am a man who was born to love women we will be incredible together then his mouth left a trail of kisses down her straining throat before moving upward to capture her lips with his own he kissed her with an expertise born of much practice forcing her own lips apart with the pressure of his his tongue leapt forward to plunder within her mouth tasting of her greedily slid beneath her upper lip along her teeth leaving the scent of mint wherever he touched her it swirled around her mouth to sweep downward and skye felt the first stirrings of desire awakening within her she despised herself for her weakness with an angry cry she tore her head away from him hissing furiously you bastard have me and be done with it he looked down at her his amber eyes dancing devilishly and then he laughed so chérieyou begin to feel it too i feel nothing she snarled back at him i can feel you quivering mabelleoh it is very faint and very deep down but i am sensitive to such things i am not sure monseigneur which is bigger your imagination or your opinion of yourself she said scathingly again he laughed neither chérieas you will soon discover for i possess an altogether larger part and already it grows hungry for the taste of your wonderful body straddling her easily he bent and again began to taunt her nipples with his tongue nipping licking and sucking teasingly until she thought she would shriek with the pleasure that began to tug at her i hate you i hate you i hate you skye muttered the litany as she cursed her treacherous body which was beginning to respond shamelessly to his ardent suit skye knew what she felt was lust but she nonetheless was angry at herself that she could not prevent the delicious stirrings within herself what was worse was that he knew what she both felt and thought the amber eyes looked mockingly down at her daring her to deny the truth with a sob skye turned her head away from his gaze hating him even more for his gentle tone as he soothed her distress no mabelleyou mustnt hate yourself yield to me chérieand i will give us such pleasure nnever with a sigh of regret the young king moved from her lovely breasts and began caressing her long torso with his hungry lips slowly tortuously his mouth moved downward firmly parting her resisting thighs to stare admiringly at her hidden treasure to kiss it softly his curious tongue began to explore her inhaling her haunting womans fragrance slipping along the folds of sensitive flesh pushing gently into her to rouse her passions until she was no longer able to deny them skye clenched her bound hands into fists her rounded nails digging cruelly into her palms she bit her lip so hard that it bled but she could not prevent the sob that was torn from her reluctant throat he lifted his head to stare at her his eyes passiondrugged slowly he pulled himself up and atop her then with a quick thrust he was inside her warm body moving smoothly rhythmically after what seemed like an eternity to skye the king demanded does it please you chériewill you admit now that i am the best lover you have ever known this is not love monseigneur skye whispered this is rape do you not know the difference how stubborn you are mabellehe groaned but i will not give up i have been known to stay hard and potent within a woman an entire night before spilling my seed from the city there was the faint sound of the two oclock tocsin and henri of navarre buried his face into the perfumed tangle of skyes hair inhaling the taunting fragrance of her damask rose scent he had been modest if anything when he numbered the women he had possessed in his young life but this woman never had he enjoyed a female as he was now enjoying madame burke had she been willing instead of reluctant she would he suspected have unmanned him half a dozen times already skye lay beneath him wondering if he would ever cease she had been gone from the ballroom an hour now and adam might begin to seek her how was she going to explain a longer absence god only knew what anjou would say to set adam on the wrong track the passion navarre had managed to arouse in her died away with her concern she had to force him to release his seed and skye knew just how to do it closing her eyes so he could not see she was deceiving him skye moaned convincingly and began to move her body in time with his using the old trick she had learned in the harem she tightened her internal muscles about his manhood navarre groaned with total pleasure ah chériehe halfsobbed into her ear what delicious torture you abuse me with dont stop i beg of you he was not an easy man to break she found and she almost grew too tired to continue when with a loud shout of triumph he flooded her with his creamy tribute skye cried out herself but it was with relief now perhaps he would be content and she could go back to adam before he learned of her shame for several long moments the king lay on her breasts catching his breath mon dieuchériehe finally exclaimed you are magnificent but then i will wager you have been told that too skye let a deep sigh escape her now monseigneur now that you have satisfied yourself may i please go chériewe have only just begun to love i have no intention of releasing you until the dawn still lying atop her he bent and kissed her softly come mabelledid i not please you the tiniest bit you most assuredly pleased me he smiled winningly at her and although skye felt she should hate this arrogant young man to her surprise she found that she did not monseigneur if you hold me until the dawn what will i tell my betrothed husband i will have to tell him the truth that the duc of anjou kidnaped me from the ballroom under a false pretense and prepared me for your rape my husbands mother was with me when anjou came to me she will swear to my story think of the scandal msieur de navarre you are married less than a week to a princess of the blood royal of france and you are already philandering with another woman and an unwilling woman at that release me now and i can return to the ballroom with no one the wiser you reason well mabellebut the fact i am already chasing other women will cause no scandal it is my nature and it is expected of me bridegroom or no my dear wife has already betrayed me with her lover de guise allowing him into her bed in the afternoons when i have been with my brotherinlaw alençon now thatmadame is a scandal but because i am a huguenot and margot a good catholic it is not considered a sin by the good people of france margot considers it her royal duty to cuckold me therefore my making love to you madame will be no scandal msieur be reasonable where is your pride do you truly find deep satisfaction and pleasure for your ego in forcing a bound woman who does not want you for shame msieur de navarre you are really most adorable chériewhen you are angry he teased her but before skye could spit out her angry reply the door to the study burst open and the prince of condé rushed in frantically calling to his cousin henri thank god you are safe get up get dressed we are about to be murdered and we must escape navarre looked lazily at his cousin as he rolled off skye henri he said your timing is deplorable as usual what are you babbling about paris is in civil disorder cousin condé cried our people are being massacred in their beds by the members of the catholic league led by de guise already a mob looking for you and for me has tried to storm the louvre the kings soldiers held them back but god only knows how long they can i have already received word that coligny is dead get up henri but navarre was already up and pulling on his clothes his smiling boyish face of moments before had grown grim and old with his cousins words i believe that we are safe henri he told condé i dont know howinvolved madame le serpent is but she is involved he turned to skye madame i regret i ignored your words of caution earlier my weakness has always been that my cock ruled my head still i regret nothing of our interlude but that it was not longer follow the stairs from this room down three flights the door at the bottom opens into the gardens and you will easily find your way back to the ballroom from there bending he kissed her quickly the regret clear in his eyes adieu chériehe turned to go monseigneur she cried after him henri of navarre turned madame monseigneur you have not unbound my hands the king leaned over and quickly undid the silken knots your pardon mabellehe said softly god go with you navarre she answered him quietly suddenly he grinned rakishly at her saying as he ran from the room i knew i had touched your heart chériethen both he and condé were gone skye had to laugh that damned vain boy was within a hairs breadth of losing his life and all he cared about was that he had been successful in his lovemaking suddenly she heard the sounds of battle and terrible cries of agony outside skye rose from the tumbled bed and dressed hurriedly her fingers fumbling with the laces and ties of her gown she had to find adam and she knew that he would be frantically searching for her it was not easy getting into court gear without mignon to help her but skye managed to attain some semblance of order with her clothes and her hair without a backward glance at the room she fled down the staircase to the gardens once outside she could hear the frantic screams of the poor unfortunates being murdered in the various districts of the city stopping a moment to get her bearings skye saw the lighted windows of the ballroom across the garden from her and she moved swiftly to gain its safety the cacophony within the ballroom was tremendous as the court chattered frantically to dispel their nervous tension notably quiet were the few huguenot noble families who felt like early christians in the arena as they huddled in small groups about the room trying to look inconspicuous on the raised royal dais catherine de medici sat quietly with her son his wife and her daughter margot navarre condé and condés wife catherines sharp eye noted skyes entry into the room and for a minute the two womens eyes met and skye knew in that instant that the queen mother had planned everything including her own seduction by navarre shaking her head skye looked away missing the look of triumph that flickered briefly across de medicis fat face skye my god sweetheart i have been frantic where have you been adam catching her shoulders whirled her about and looked down into her face suddenly seeing him skye realized the danger she had been in and unable to control herself she burst into tears oh adam i was so frightened there lamb he murmured at her come now sweetheart its all right come with me maman was worried too his loving arm about her he walked her across the room to where gaby and the entire de saville family awaited mafillewhat is wrong gaby was instantly anxious you were gone so long i had begun to grow worried especially considering the atrocities going on in the city now not here gaby skye pleaded later i will explain later now that we have skye safe the comte said we must get to the house my sons are you ready the men in the party nodded and adam seating skye next to his mother explained antoine is worried that because the house we are renting is owned by a huguenot the mob is apt to attack it he wants to go back to the marais district and get the children and the servants lest they be hurt we should not be long she nodded ill be all right my darling go with them ill be here with your maman the comte de cher his sons sonsinlaw and stepson moved quickly to the royal dais where antoine spoke urgently to queen catherine for a few moments finally the queen nodded and the party of men hurried from the ballroom when they had gone gaby turned to skye she sighed it was a trick to keep navarre occupied and safe from the mob gaby the duc danjou took me to his mothers private closet stunned me with a blow disrobed me and left me trussed up like a christmas goose navarre thought i was meeting him for a love tryst but when he found you had been duped ma fille alas gaby chivalry did not prevail in navarres case he raped me and you mustnt tell adam adam will lose his temper and kill him i would certainly hope so ma fille gaby replied indignantly a small giggle escaped skye the whole situation was total madness no gaby adam cannot kill a prince of the blood an heir to frances throne he cannot even complain to the queen who is responsible for the whole situation if elizabeth tudor refuses to recognize our marriage then we cannot go home to england and france is our refuge if we displease france then where may we go gaby please promise me you will not tell adam gaby nodded skye was as practical as she herself was and adams mother approved there was no necessity to tell adam skye was correct in that he would be monumentally angry and of course would want his honor avenged the disadvantages far outweighed the advantages you are right ma fille gaby said but before we drop the matter there is one thing i must know is heas good a lover as they say her lovely eyes sparkled with curiosity he is young yet skye replied drily but his skill is growing and the potential is there gaby laughed softly completely understanding skyes point i imagine the king of navarre would be most disappointed in your rather candid evaluation of him she said low madame burke both gaby and skye started and then rose quickly to their feet to curtsey to catherine de medici the queen mother smiled warmly at gaby and then turned her eyes to skye i will not forget the favor you have done me this night madame she said whatever may be said of me i do not forget those who give me their aid you have a friend in catherine de medici why me skye asked quietly wondering why she felt no anger because madame you were his passion for the moment and i needed you for only you could keep him occupied long enough and safe from de guise and his mob you did not seek navarres attention which in itself was a stronger attraction my beaufrèeis not used to being disdained and spurned by a beautiful woman you are a member of the tudor court madame and my information on you says that you are an intelligent woman if you did not understand my position you would now be screaming and shrieking charges for all this court to hear i would not hurt my betrothed majesty with the dishonor that has been visited upon us both tonight but know one thing i do not like being used nonetheless came the disconcerting reply it is the way of the powerful to use and you well know it when is your wedding at michaelmas at archambault catherine de medici turned to gaby i shall come she said calmly i will be staying at ussé that week but i shall stop a night at archambault i understand from comte antoine that you will be leaving paris tonight so i shall bid you adieuuntil michaelmas with a nod at gaby the queen mother turned away and walked back to the royal dais mon dieu gaby gasped we have never entertained royalty at archambault i cannot believe it skye mafilledo you realize the honor being done us the queen is coming to your wedding skye had to laugh royalty she would never really understand them royalty were the damnedest people in the world well perhaps catherine de medicis appearance at their wedding would sit well with elizabeth tudor and she would give her blessing to them despite the fact that they were marrying without her royal permission when i was married to adams cousin geoffrey southwood i was married in elizabeth tudors presence at her palace at greenwich she told gaby in fact geoffrey and i spent our wedding night there gaby was impressed adam did not tell me that she said it was a happy marriage with southwood was it not very happy so the queens presence brought you luck now you will be married again in a queens presence and that will bring you luck once more chérie what a good thought gaby skye leaned over and hugged the older woman do you know she said i have never had a motherinlaw as my previous husbands mamas were all dead i am so glad you are going to be my bellemèregaby gaby de saville felt the tears pricking at her eyelids she would have made the effort to love any wife of adams but with skye it was so easy not only that they were friends and gaby considered that even better i shall light a hundred candles to the blessed mother that my son has you she said feelingly and i shall light a hundred more to her that i have him skye replied oh gaby this time i know that everything is going to be all right chapter the comte de cher and his party reached the marais district just in time an angry mob was preparing to storm the house that they had rented for their paris stay all the mob knew was that the house was owned by a huguenot family the comte and his sons clattered into the overrun courtyard of the house while around them the mob brandished pikes and homemade weapons shouting kill the heretics stop antoine de saville shouted but he could not make himself heard over the uproar adam saw one of the duc de guises men leading the crowd and riding over to him he said msieur though this house is owned by a huguenot he is not in paris the house is being rented by a good catholic nobleman the comte de cher it is his family and servants inside not huguenots the house is to be burned the ducs man replied orders of msieur de guise i understand adam replied realizing that the duc whose own mansion was next door was taking this opportunity to confiscate the property for his own nonetheless you will allow my stepfather to remove his people and his goods the comte de cher is in both the kings and queen catherines favor the ducs man nodded well hold the mob but tell your stepfather to hurry the canaille grow madder with their blood lust with each minute that passes by adam turned his horse back to antoine and reaching him said we just have time to get our things the children and the servants beaupèretheyre going to burn the house alexandre yves the comte shouted go to the stables and have every coach in there made ready even those we dont own louis henri robert you will remain mounted before the front door adam come inside with me it did not take long to marshall the de saville children servants and all their personal property the servants had spent their evening packing for their masters departure the following day and it was merely a matter of loading up the coaches in the rear of the house while the howling mob was held at bay out front within minutes the house was vacated and adam and the comte departed through the main door of the mansion mounted their horses and thanking the ducs man rode off behind them the paris mob freed of restraint burst into their former abode looting and destroying before putting the building to the torch when they reached the palace their women were eagerly waiting and anxious to leave paris behind in the confusion skye found herself alone in a small carriage with adam she snuggled into his arms and pressing her cheek against his hard shoulder fell asleep the whole evening had been a traumatic experience and as always following a crisis skye was exhausted when she awoke they were miles from the capital but as they drove along there was evidence here and there of the same sort of violence and destruction and mayhem that they had left behind in paris in several places along their route gallows had been set up and both men and women as well as children dangled from them swaying in the clear summer morning skye wept at the sight i cannot believe that god condones such cruelty she said sadly the huguenots are no better he answered her religious fanatics hear nothing but their own dogma what matter how one finds god as long as we find him do not look sweetheart there is nothing you can do for those poor souls now they didnt bother to stop but for brief meals and to change the horses antoine de saville was anxious to get back to archambault there was going to be another civil war and in times of trouble it was best to be in ones own château the trip to paris had taken them five days but the return only took three they arrived at archambault after dark tired and emotionally exhausted by what they had seen and been involved in over the last two weeks the huguenots in the district around archambault had for the most part been untouched although their pastor had fled to la rochelle with some of his flock the majority waited knowing that the comte would protect them for they were his best vintagers barrelmakers and cultivators it was fortunate that the village priest was a kindly old man with a good heart who abjured the catholics not to imitate the excesses of paris and the other cities that had followed its example because they were far from paris the shock of the st bartholomews day massacre was not strongly felt among those who made archambault their home life swiftly returned to normal with the return of the de saville family and the preparations began for the marriage of adam de marisco and skye omalley originally it had been planned that the celebration be a small intimate family one but now with the queens promise to attend that was all changed it would be a grand fete as august dissolved into september skye counted the days eagerly until her marriage and until her children were with her once again the wedding was set for the twentyninth of september the feast day of st michael and skyes children arrived on the twentieth tumbling excitedly from the coach that had brought them from nantes where skyes ship had docked they were all there even her eldest son ewan who had left his holding in ireland to be with his mother on her wedding day dont worry mother he told her with a grin my uncles shamus and conn omalley are holding ballyhennessey for me where is your wife she demanded gwyn and i decided to wait until you could be with us before getting married shes still very young mother are you anxious to be a grandparent he teased are you so sure you can be a father ewan she countered he chuckled and then blushed as his brother murrough said hes spawned two bastards already mother ewanskye was mortified but adam and the de saville men laughed heartily with obvious approval of ewans accomplishments sacrebleuthe comte said wiping his eyes these are fine new grandsons you give me skye he peered at ewan through kindly nearsighted eyes so you like the ladies eh lad i of course am too old for such games but my sons can i am sure tell you the nicest girls on the estate beaupèreskye scolded you must not encourage him in this behavior why not chériehe is a man full grown be proud of him skye looked helplessly to gaby who raised her eyes heavenward in sympathy but said nothing nonetheless the de savilles welcomed all of skyes children as if they were blood kin and the children who had never had any real grandparents wanned to the french couple the comte and comtesse loved children and indeed their two sons and their daughter lived at archambault along with their spouses and children isabeau and clarice and their families were within just a few miles and consequently the château was always filled with family for skyes children who had had so little family life the great change was wonderful ewan and murrough quickly made friends with henri and jean st justine who were close to them in age and together the four young men spent their days riding and hunting and skye suspected from the occasional selfsatisfied smirk on her sons faces wenching as well catherinehenriette st justine was just a year younger than willow and the fact that the elevenyearold had attended a ball at the louvre made her an object of much admiration to willow who had still not been allowed up to the tudor court robins new friend was charles sancerre and little deirdre burke who was going to be five in january was placed in the château nursery with fiveyearold antoinette de saville there was even a little boy his age for padriac to play with michel sancerre skye marveled over her children the older ones were of course happy to see their mother again but the two burke babies did not remember her and were cautious in their approach deirdre however remembered adam who had been with her a great deal of the time that skye was away she was quite determined that he was her papa and padraic burke who followed his older sisters lead in everything therefore called him papa too let them adam said quietly when she attempted to correct them in time they will understand about niall but for now they need a father to skyes great surprise her four older children took to calling adam father also robin had never called anyone but geoffrey father before and her oflaherty sons who could not remember dom had in their irish pride not been able to call either geoffrey or niall by that title willow had called niall papa but even she succumbed to adam de mariscos charm what magic is this you weave about my children she teased him no magic sweetheart it is simply that we need each other oh adam she said feelingly i am so glad that you do and she kissed him with love upon his mouth then three days before the wedding as the dressmaker worked on the final fitting of skyes gown the kneeling woman remarked her mouth full of pins madame you have fattened again you must be very happy indeed for most brides lose weight before the wedding i shall have to alter the waist again skye stood very quietly as the woman did her job but gaby had seen how she had paled at the dressmakers words when the woman had made her adjustments and taken the gown away mignon helped her mistress into a comfortable chamber robe and departed on an errand gaby de saville looked at skye and asked what is it mafillewhy are you so worried skye looked up at the lovely woman who was to be her motherinlaw and said brokenly i am pregnant gaby there is no mistake i am pregnant dear god what am i to do for a moment a stricken look crossed the comtesse de chers face and her hand moved instinctively to her mouth to stifle her cry of distress then seeing skyes anguish gaby de saville pulled herself together and spoke firmly it is of course navarres child curse him why could he not leave you alone once gaby skye said her voice shaking he only took me once how could this have happened once mafilleis often quite enough the comtesse remarked how can i marry adam now gaby how can i marry the man i love while carrying another mans bastard dear heaven has not adam suffered enough i cannot make him accept someone elses child as his own oh gaby what am i to do you have no choice mafilleadam must be told no yes listen to me skye i know my son and i believe that i know you despite our short acquaintance you and adam love one another you have traveled a rocky road to be together and you skye have made my son happier than i have ever seen him in his life he was half a man a shadow figure it is you who have made him whole and if you leave him i dread to think what he will do we will tell adam the truth of this matter surely you do not think that he will desert you or blame you if i know adam his first thought will be of you and what you have suffered at navarres hand his second will be of revenge and together we must keep him from that folly i know an old witch woman in the forest who with potions can help you rid yourself of this unwanted child or if you cannot do that have the babe and we will find a peasant woman to raise it i cannot destroy an unborn child gaby it is not in my nature to do so i know that adam will forgive me but it seems so unfair to ask him if he decides to repudiate me i will understand she said and a large tear rolled down her cheek fetch msieur adam gaby commanded mignon as she reentered the room the tiring woman turned around and hurried out while the two women sat in silence awaiting adam de marisco gaby noticed how terribly overwrought skye was twisting and shredding her cambric and lace handkerchief as they waited it is going to be all right mafilleshe said i promise you that everything is going to be all right entering the bedchamber adam heard his mothers words he rushed to skyes side and knelt looking up into her face what is it little girl he begged her what is the matter skye however could only look mutely at him as the tears began to trickle down her face before her son could go mad with worry gaby de saville quickly explained skyes predicament to adam dammit the lord of lundy exploded at his mother you let her bear this cross all alone and after what she has been through in morocco i thought you had better sense maman dont speak to your mother that way adam de marisco skye sobbed she has been wonderful to me ill kill him adam roared which is precisely why i did not share my knowledge with you you great fool gaby snapped a lot of good you would do us all skye included killing the heir to france do you think that there is a place in this world where you might hide if you committed such a heinous crime it is appalling that skye is enceinte but the chances of that happening were so slim that neither she nor i even considered it after the attack on her it is too late now to worry over it i will understand if you do not wish to wed with me adam skye whispered woman he shouted what damnedfool nonsense is that of course i want to marry you i have wanted to marry you for six long years ive lain awake more nights than i care to remember aching for you and cursing myself for my stupidity in letting you escape me i could kill henri of navarre for raping you but that child you are carrying is half yours and i will raise it up as my own we will have no foolishness about farming it out to some stupid peasant skye now stop your damned weeping little girl and come here and kiss me he stood up pulling her with him and his mouth tenderly took hers oh adam she said against the warm pressure of his mouth i do love you so very much but everyone in your family will know that the baby isnt yours i cannot shame you like that nonnongaby injected when athenais broke her betrothal with adam and spread her vicious lies my de saville children were too young to either understand or remember only adams sisters his full sisters know the truth along with antoine i will tell them of your plight mafilleand they will understand and keep silent they love you as much as i do for the happiness you have brought their brother you see he murmured down at her you cannot escape me this time little girl you are meant to be my wife great happiness flooded her being and she suddenly smiled up at him with a smile of pure radiance i had best watch my diet for the next few days she said lest i grow out of my gown again the gown however was pure perfection when skye wore it on her wedding day the bride was a vision of loveliness in applegreen silk the low bodice embroidered with gold thread and tiny pearls that matched the panel of her slightly darker velvet underskirt the legofmutton sleeves were held by many tiny gold ribbons the wristbands turned back to form a cuff with a gold lace ruff just above her slender hands the bodice had a long wasp waist that ended in a pronounced downward peak the bellshaped skirt of the overgown separated in front to reveal the elegant skirt of the undergown the shape of the entire dress being dictated by a cartwheel verdingale with a padded hip bolster beneath this all were silken undergarments outrageous palegreen silk stockings embroidered with grape vines and delicate silk slippers sewn with pearls mignon had done her hair with palegold silk roses and skye wore with them tiny gold chains studded with small diamonds about her neck she had chosen to wear creamy white pearls with unusual foresight willow had carried her mothers jewel cases from england and skye was able to put away the pieces that nicolas had given her knowing that adam would be a lot happier if he saw she did not wear the ducs gift on their wedding day the groom himself was attired in a magnificent bronzecolored velvet suit decorated with gold embroidery and creamy lace because the ceremony had grown from a simple family celebration into a neighborhood fete by virtue of catherine de medicis appearance it could not be held in the châteaus chapel instead the village church was swept and cleaned and then decorated with roses and all manner of late flowers the queen had arrived the night before and was housed in a suite of apartments that gaby was sure would not be fine enough but catherine assured the comtesse otherwise the wedding party walked from the château upon its little hill above the cher river to the church of archambault down in the village all the villagers had dressed in their finest and even decorated their cottages in honor of the couple not knowing adams history they nodded approvingly at the brides six children murmuring that the comte and comtesse were sure to have more grandchildren before it was all over as she knelt by adams side during their nuptial mass skye had the strangest feeling that behind her stood unseen gueststhe ghosts of her former husbandsand in her minds eye they were all smiling with their approval dom of course was not there but she could see khalid el bey and geoffrey southwood the angel earl of lynmouth and niall burke andyeseven fabron de beaumont that poor tortured soul whose wife she had been but briefly then as adam placed the heavy gold ring on her finger they were gone and if skye felt a moment of sadness for what had been her heart was too quickly refilled with gladness for what was to be as they exited the church to the shouts of congratulations from the assembled guests and the peasants she laughed with joy as to the delight of all adam de marisco swept his beautiful wife into a passionate embrace and kissed her soundly then leading the procession they returned to the château for the marriage feast it was a beautiful day with a soft warm wind and a cloudless blue sky never could skye remember such a lovely wedding and in her heart she believed that it portended a happy future for herself arid for adam are you as happy as i am lady de marisco he asked her and the smile she flashed him gave him his answer on the broad green lawns of the château tables had been placed the bridal table upon a raised dais where all might see the happy couple catherine de medici and the princesse margot who had arrived unannounced from chenonceaux early that morning seeing marguérite de valois skyes heart had leapt into her mouth for fear that navarre had accompanied his wife but she relaxed as the princesse scathingly and loudly told her mother monseigneur de navarre is occupied elsewhere then she had proceeded to attach herself to the duc de guise who was also mysteriously there without his spouse the tables were quickly filled by the guests neighboring nobility from the nearby châteaux the lower tables were for the people of archambault village and its twin village of saville from which the family had taken its name the cellars of the château had yielded up oak casks filled with rich and heady red wine put down three years before and saved for a special occasion the silver goblets were filled with this brew while below the salt the villagers were delighted with earthenware cups of archambaults vinordinaire comte antoine rose and lifting his goblet said adam de marisco does not bear my name nor will he inherit any part of my lands but this son of my beloved wife is as dear to me as my own two boys i rejoice with him this day i rejoice that he has found himself a wifebut not simply a wife rather a woman who has captured his heart long life to both you and your beautiful skye my son viveviveshouted the guests all raising their goblets enthusiastically the comtes toast was followed by many others and skye was forced to sit smiling as most of those good wishes called for the newlywed couple to have many children at one point adam reached over to take her hand in his and squeezed it reassuringly she turned her face to his for a moment and the warm look in his eyes washed over her leaving her feeling more loved than she had ever felt in her entire life the feast accompanying the toasts was bountiful as a first course there were several varieties of pate and fish freshly caught in the cher along with a barrel of oysters brought from the nearby coast and packed in ice there was goose and small game birds duck and capon as well as beef and lamb the estate huntsmen had been most active the last few days and on several open fires turned a wild boar two red stags and two roe deer there were cheeses and hardcooked eggs and newly baked breads with tubs of butter some bowls of cress and lettuce all to be washed down with good archambault wine a last course consisted of newly picked apples and pears and grapes from the orchards and vineyards a beautiful gâteau of several layers topped by a marzipan bride and groom the sides of the top layer having alternating marzipan shields being the de marisco and the omalley coats of arms was the piècederésistanceof the feast everyone ate until stuffed and then the villagers danced for the entertainment of the nobility to the peasants delight skye and adam joined the dancers at one point encouraging the others at the high board to do so too twilight fell and then night torches were lit to brighten the scene and a fat full moon rose to gild the sky no one wanted to go home for it was a wonderful party finally it seemed that the only way they could get their guests to leave was for the bride and groom to go to bed skye was taken off with much ceremony by her motherinlaw and sistersinlaw and dame cecily who had come with the children it was at that moment that skye missed her faithful daisy most but daisy was back in england expecting a second child she felt almost shy disrobing before all the other women but neither gaby nor her daughters seemed to notice dame cecily however gave her an encouraging pat saying i feel certain dear skye that this marriage between you and adam is one made in heaven i did not like it that queen elizabeth sent you so far from us the last time the queen knows nothing of this marriage yet dear dame cecily skye replied robbie must leave next week for court to bring her word of our nuptials youd best send some rich gift along with my brother not that thats likely to placate the queen here she lowered her voice although of the de saville women only gaby could either speak or understand english tis said these marriage negotiations of hers make her fretful and irritable she does not like to see happiness in others these days before skye might answer her old friend there were cries of delight from the de saville women as mignon brought in and displayed skyes nightgown for all to see of pale pink silk its lowscooped neckline was part of the molded bodice falling into a simple skirt that swirled about her ankles the sleeves were long and flowing and deceptively modest skyes petticoats and blouse were quickly taken away and the gown dropped over her head it slid down her body with a soft hiss of silk gaby and dame cecily gasped at the open sensuousness of the gown but adams sister clarice spoke for them all saying mon dieumasoeurskye why have we bothered to clothe you the gown fits you like a skin and if i know my brother you will not wear it long try to see that he does not tear at it in his eagerness the men are coming musette said from the door quickly then gaby cried as her wits returned into bed ma fillei do not believe that adam would appreciate others seeing what is for him alone skye climbed into the big bed and with swift fingers drew the pins and silk flowers from her hair and handed them to dame cecily mignon was instantly there to brush the hair free of tangles the door to the bedchamber burst open and adam was pushed into the room by his halfbrothers and the other male guests he wore a silk nightshirt hes as ready for you as hell ever be madame de marisco alexandre de saville laughed if i had something that lovely waiting for me yves chuckled i would not have been so long in getting to bed out the lord of lundy roared get out all of you gaby stopped to kiss her son saying as she did so you are both so lucky mesenfants the bedchamber emptied slowly as the guests straggled out through the salon back into the hall of the château when he was sure that the last of them was gone adam firmly closed the door to their bedchamber walked back over to the bed and sat down upon it for what seemed a long moment they sat in silence and then skye said softly my god it is really true we are married adam he grinned almost boyishly at her and her heart contracted painfully i love you skye de marisco he said quietly i love you very much you dont have to sleep with me if you dont want to she said suddenly i will understand where else would i sleep skye you know what i mean adam will it hurt the babe no for how long skye you have to tell me these things for ive never been a father before youre not a father now she wanted to cry at him in her pain i can never give you the man i adore a child this is a bastard i carry and we both know it instead she said it varies with each child adam when i get too big and the baby is low we dare not but for now there is no harm good he said standing up and pulling off the silk garment that they had dressed him in for you see skye i intend exercising my marital rights to the fullest skye swung her own legs from beneath the coverlet and stood up also then she turned and smiling at him asked do you like the gown monmari his eyes raked slowly down her provocative length and then he said pleasantly if you intend to keep that garment whole madame you had best remove it quickly before i rip it off you slowly skye slipped the gown from her shoulders letting it fall to her waist she hesitated a minute allowing him a long look at her beautiful breasts before pushing the cloth over her hips and letting it slide to the floor his mouth twitched appreciatively at her pretty performance as she stepped lightly from the puddle of silk at her feet then as boldly as he she let her eyes sweep his long length you like what you see madame i trust he said amused i always have monmarishe returned do you like what you see i always have he chuckled now get into bed dammit little girl i need very much to feel your softness against me slipping back into the bed she turned toward him to find that his arms were already reacfiing out to draw her to him skye wrapped her arms about her husbands neck and sighed with delight dearest adam she whispered to him i do love you you are so wonderfully good to me then she boldly sought his mouth and he groaned at the hungry touch of her lips feeling the sparks ignite instantly between them as the kiss deepened and grew until they both drew away breathless pressing her back into the pillows he tangled his fingers in the night cloud of her hair and kissed her again until her lips ached with the sweetness with which he was filling her her breasts began to grow taut with her rising desire her nipples thrusting up sharply and tingling with their longing he felt the rounded push of her against his furred chest and reaching down with one hand he caressed the warm little globe of flesh cupping it in his big hand rubbing against the nipple with his thumb skye shuddered with the pleasure his touch gave her adam laughed a low and intimate sound of equal pleasure you are the most sensual creature i have ever known mafemmeit pleases me that marriage has not turned you into a little prude his shaggy dark head dropped so he might take the nipple in his mouth slowly he sucked on the tidbit of tender flesh while her fingers kneaded at his neck with increasing urgency leisurely he played with both of her beautiful breasts kissing and touching and loving them with growing ardor skye could feel the hot hard length of him against her leg and she shuddered again with delighted thoughts of what was to come he made love to her that night as if he had never before known her slowly he explored her silken flesh as if he had never touched it mafemmemy wife he called her my beautiful bride sweet sweet skye his kisses burned across her body leaving her shaken and yet yearning for more slipping his hand between her thighs he stroked the softness of her sensitive skin until her legs fell open beneath his tender assault toying with her nether lips he teased her with a single finger that rubbed at the very heart of her femininity until she was squirming and panting beneath his touch oh my darling she begged him let me touch you also not yet sweetheart but soon he promised and then he turned her over onto her stomach slowly his big warm hands smoothed over her legs and her back and her buttocks and her shoulders fanning the flames of her burgeoning desire until she moaned low with her hunger she felt his great weight on her as he placed his body atop hers pressing her deep into the mattress his throbbing maleness rubbed suggestively against the halves of her bottom igniting her passion even further she could scarcely breathe but she cared not if only he would possess her adam adam please she pleaded with him i am so hot for you tonight monmari he rolled off her returning her to her back as he did so and swung himself around so that his dark head was pressed against her white thigh caressing her in leisurely fashion he said softly now little girl now is the time to touch me skyes slender hand reached out to return her husbands gentle caresses and the feel of him beneath her fingers roused her further after a while she pushed herself into a halfsitting position and turning he cuddled against her breasts kissing them lightly while she fondled the hard length of him she suddenly realized the truth of what he had been telling her all these years there was no need to rush the passion that built slowly between them was far more exciting than any she had ever experienced finally when she thought it could be no more wonderful than it was now adam pulled skye beneath him gently mounted her and thrust into her warmth she cried softly with the pleasure his entry gave her molding him harder against her with the flat of her palms against his smooth back its like mulled wine he groaned against her mouth being inside of you tonight is like being in hot mulled wine and for a moment he couldnt stir so delicious was the sensation but then he began to move sensuously on her she barely heard him for his tender possession of her had pushed her into a world of such uninhibited ecstasy that skye was only aware of wave after wave of rapturous passion sweeping over her and surrounding her it left her at last feeling totally satisfied and content oh adam she murmured how can it be so good between us and he laughed softly saying how can it not be sweetheart when we love each other so loveit was the unbreakable bond between them a bond forged by the fires of experience of pain and of passion at archambault love surrounded them for the de saville family was a close one whose members cared for and protected each other as adams wife she was now one of them the comte had insisted that they remain with the family until after the baby was born antoine de saville was a quiet man but he was also a very wise one he knew that the closer the bond between skye and his family the easier this hard time would be upon her he understood that her predicament despite adams love and understanding was a traumatic and harsh one yet he was a man who loved children and he believed that not only the mother but the corning infant must be protected in this situation both murrough and surprisingly ewan went happily off to the university in paris ewan had decided that since he was here he would take advantage of a french education as his father had he was not the scholar that murrough was but he would do well enough and given the situation in ireland it could not hurt him to have french connections willow fretted about allowing her dearest dame cecily to return to wren court without her but robert smalls sister was adamant on the subject youve not seen yer mother in almost two years miss and she needs you now besides with that silly daisy having another babe by the new year ill have my hands full there daisys ma has been too ill to help and well you know it willow secretly and guiltily willow was relieved she loved dame cecily with all her heart but she loved her mother more and she had missed skye so very much this wonderful voluble loving new french family was very much to her liking with a light heart she waved her surrogate grandmother off on the road to nantes where she would be embarking upon an omalley ship for bideford then willow attached herself to her recently acquired grandmère gaby and began learning all the secrets of a good chatelaine when she was not tagging after the comtesse she was with her new cousins matilde rochouart and mariegabrielle and catherinehenriette st justine it was the first time in her life that willow could remember having friends of her own rank and close to her own age antoine de saville aged seven and his cousin charles sancerre aged eight became the close partners in crime of his lordship robin the nineyearold earl of lynmouth together the three boys roamed the estate of archambault riding birding and daydreaming a troupe of shaggy dogs at their heels the three scrapegraces became very adept at eluding their tutor until finally adam sternly threatened his stepson with a sound thrashing if he did not behave himself comparing notes in hushed tones the three discovered that all had been promised the same punishment by their outraged elders and so they finally settled down in the big nursery of archambault little deirdre burke learned her first embroidery stitches with her very best friend antoinette de saville while wee lord padraic burke played on the floor at wooden soldiers with his new cousins jeanpierre claude and michel the four watched over by their nurses plump rosycheeked country girls with broad laps and big pillowy bosoms who spoiled the little boys shamelessly it was an ideal situation for skyes pregnancy was not an easy one in the beginning to her great amusement and equal annoyance adam reveled in her condition he happily held the basin for her when she awoke in the mornings feeling wretched her fussy appetite was an excuse for him to hover over her offering any delicacies he thought might please her he rubbed her ankles which seemed to ache at the most inconvenient times sometimes it made her feel guilty as she remembered that this wasnt adams child but the child of a royal rape she tried for his sake to maintain a cheerful attitude but occasionally a shadow of unhappiness would cross her face and when it did there were four people who understood the reason for it when they were together adams sisters isabeau and clarice consoled their beautiful sisterinlaw as best they could you must not hate the child skye said isabeau the elder poor baby tis as much a victim as you were i pray it not look like its father skye said if it does how can i help but detest it think of adam clarice said her blue eyes filled with concern oh skye you dont know what it was like for him when that awful athenais broke off their betrothal he was so young then and he believed himself in love with her he needed her understanding at the most and at the least he needed discretion instead she shamed him publicly spreading terrible lies around the district concerning his manhood with her quick match to the old duc de beuvron nobody of course believed her they thought she was attempting to make excuses for taking a better offer but adam knowing the truth was so shamed he has always wanted a child let this be his child i beg of you skye remembered how adam had told her that several of the girls on lundy claimed that he had fathered their babies and he had not denied it but rather acknowledged the paternity and seen to it that neither mother nor child wanted for anything she saw how good he was with her own children slipping easily into his role of father he wrote letters filled with news and advice to the oflaherty boys in paris and both ewan and murrough wrote back respecting their stepfather and skye realized when they arrived for christmas even harboring affection for him willow skye discovered was trying out newly discovered feminine wiles on adam constantly soliciting his opinion on everything when at new years he presented her with a strand of palegold pearls to complement her skin which was darker than skyes willow flung her arms about adam crying oh papa i do love you so and i am so glad that you are my father skye felt the quick tears pricking at her eyelids and she turned away her heart overflowing with happiness robin quite openly idolized adam de marisco he had been so little when his own father geoffrey southwood had died along with his baby brother john he had not been six when niall burke disappeared adam was the most stable male influence in his life and had always it seemed to him been there in robins mind it was only natural that the lord of lundy marry his mother adam of course reciprocated the young boys feeling loving the little golden lad the child of his cousin as he would love a child of his own had he one each day the two would ride together early in the morning robin exchanging boyish confidences with his stepfather each afternoon adam would invade the nurseries of the château to romp and play with deirdre and padraic and the nursemaids nodded approvingly at the big bluff man when he tossed the little ones high laughing with them as they shrieked their delight later when the babies slept watched over by the undermaids the nursemaids would gossip in the servants hall about what a fine father the seigneur de marisco was to his wifes children and smile that he was to become a real father himself soon they knew that the babe would come earlybut what did it matter that the seigneur and his beautiful wife had celebrated their wedding night before the wedding the child was fortunate to be born to two such lovers at new years the de savilles held a fete to which the neighboring nobility were invited including the duchesse de beuvron it was not expected however that she would attend as she far preferred living in paris to everyones surprise athenais de montoire arrived squired by her son renaud a gangly youth with a pockmarked face who danced attendance on his mother like a trained dog renaud is not yet betrothed athenais simpered coyly to henri st justine your mariegabrielle is just a year younger than my son perhaps we might talk it would be quite a feather in your cap to marry your daughter to a duc inwardly henri shuddered at the mere thought of turning his lovely daughter over to renaud de montoire he knew the reason for renauds pitted skin the boy had the pox left alone on his estate while his mother cavorted in paris he ran wild and having athenaiss unquenchable appetite he was hardly fastidious in his choice of partners alas madame la duchesse henri st justine said smoothly both my girls have previous contracts and then with a bow he left her standing alone it was at that point that skye and adam entered the châteaus great hall and to those who had been unaware of her condition it was quite evident that madame de marisco was enceinteit was also quite evident that she and her husband were deeply in love athenaiss green eyes narrowed maliciously she had just received a hard setdown from baron st justine and she knew it she felt a need to retaliate and here was a perfect opportunity smilingly she approached the couple and then as she reached them her eyes widened with apparent surprise as she gave a little shriek madame de marisco you are enceinteathenais declared loud enough for everyone in the vicinity to hear i thought it was fat but you really are with child mondieuhow can this be about them the men snickered at what appeared to them to be obvious each had the same thought if the beautiful madame de marisco was newly married to them she would indeed be enceinte adam however was aware of the hidden insult to his wife but before he could defend her skye said sweetly mondieumadame la duchesse has it been so long since you were able to lure a man to your bed that you have forgotten how these things are accomplished i do not think it is something that we might discuss in mixed company but if you would care to come with me i shall be happy to enlighten you privately about them everyone laughed at skyes words for although she did not know it she had come very close to the truth athenais de montoire at forty was finding it harder to get lovers and it was said by the court gossips that she paid young men to service her desires the duchesse gritted her teeth angrily what i meant she said cruelly but then perhaps madame you did not know it was that my betrothal to your husband was broken off twenty years ago because of his inability to sire a child a soft hiss of shock escaped the assembled guests and now the entire hall was listening avidly i do not understand madame la duchesse skye replied smoothing her hand across her distended belly which was covered in claretcolored velvet how such a thing can be on my husbands holding in england are several mothers who would like me disagree with such a statement one might accuse a peasant of a less than accurate memory but one could not accuse me of such a thing there was a dangerous silence while skyes kerryblue eyes looked defiantly into the green ones of athenais de montoire then the duchesse said sullenly i only know what i was told back then madame bah the comtesse de cher snapped coming to her sons defense you rejected my son for which i now thank god because you were eager to marry the old duc de beuvron athenais the entire district knows the story of how your late papa bartered your virginity in order to make you a duchesse do not put the onus on my son you are just feeling spiteful because when you recently tried to regain his affections he spurned you being in love with ma belleskye the entire court knows how you begged queen catherine to intercede for you that adam wouldnt even speak to you except her majesty requested it athenais de montoire gasped and then grew pink with her outrage how dare you she cried how dare you insult me so i shall complain to the queen madame la comtesse she will see i am compensated for these insults i will stay no longer at this stupid country gathering my son and i but came to lend lustre to what would otherwise be a dull fete come renaud and with a swish of her goldembroidered white velvet gown she stormed from the hall good riddance gaby snapped and then she signaled to the musicians in the gallery above at once they began to play a sprightly tune and unable to resist the guests began to form the figures for the dance i could kill that bitch skye muttered her motherinlaw replied you would have to stand in line chériefor madame la duchesse is a daughter of the devil himself and has made many enemies you must not worry however for she cannot hurt you skyes tart remarks to the duchesse earned her the instant respect and approval of the noblewomen of the district for too long they had suffered under athenaiss superiority the evening was declared a success by all the winter set in and skye grew larger with the child during lent with its forty days of fasting because she was enceinteand also thirtytwo the châteaus priest absolved her from the strictest fast allowing her meat on sundays tuesdays and thursdays on the other days she was expected to keep the fast with the others she felt guilty about having the chef broil her meat while about her everyone was forced to eat fish the de savilles however were more fortunate than many for they could catch fresh fish in the cher rather than being limited to a diet of salted cod and herring to skyes secret relief adams devotion never wavered even now as her time drew near none of her other husbands had been so enchanted by her fertility as he was it seemed to give him great pleasure to lie in their bed with her propped against his broad chest her chamber robe open while he stroked her swollen belly and caressed and marveled over her suddenly heavy breasts gods bones he muttered to her one morning how i long to see the baby suckling at your wonderful breasts i had thought to put the child out with a wet nurse she replied casually perhaps later he said but for a time i want you to nurse our child gently he lifted one of her breasts from the looks of it sweetheart youll have plenty of milk for the baby why put the child with a peasant who must feed both her own and our baby when you are capable of nursing yourself i am of a mind to stay in france for a while longer we are happy here and so are the children his long face however belied the reasonableness of his words what he had to tell her was something hed been avoiding for several days in hopes of finding a good time there was it seemed no good time you have heard from robbie she was instantly wary he nodded knowing better than to conceal it from her yes i have heard from robbie the queen may god damn her sour and driedup maiden soul will not recognize our marriage she says we have forfeited her goodwill by our deceit what deceit i should like to know the witch is simply jealous of our happiness she has never been woman enough to give up all for love but she resents those who are brave enough to do what she secretly longs to the queen can go to hell skye muttered irritably adam laughed but then grew serious again there is more my love skye smiled grimly i would expect that elizabeth tudor would not content herself with mere words tell me all adam for it will get no better with the waiting shes taken the burke lands skye the bitch she swore to me padraics claim was safe if i wed with the duc de beaumont de jaspre i kept my part of the bargain adam damn these tudors for the treacherous dogs they are damn her damn her damn her then suddenly skye remembered and she asked of her husband uncle seamus what has happened to my uncle here adam chuckled he did not give in easily skye first he tried diplomacy reminding the queen of her promise to you and that you had indeed kept your bargain when that did not work that wily old cleric secretly filled burke castle with gunpowder and then blew it to smithereens the night before the new english owner was to take possession every tenant farmer on the property had been given notice of eviction by the new owner and so as burke castle went so did all the cottages and farmhouses on the estate all thats left of the holding is the land itself and a number of piles of stones the castle being the largest pile but the people skye fretted what is to become of burke people theyve left the land skye some have gone to the omalleys and others to ballyhennessey which so far has escaped the queens eye ballyhennessey is too small skye said it can barely support its own peasants let alone refugees from burke lands where has my uncle gone to the omalleys of course with a large price on his head for wantonly destroying crown property my brothers will protect him adam but he is such an old man now to have to face such a commotion hes seventyone you know would you like me to bring him to france skye hed not come adam for he has his duty to his people as bishop of connaught especially now he could see that her eyes were sad with his revelations and it pained him to fret her further but he had no choice the queen has also taken lundy skye oh adam she looked up at him stricken i am so sorry my darling all this is because of me skye i will not lie to you i loved lundy and i even loved that damned tumbleddown tower which was all that was left of my castle i will miss my rooms at the top of that tower the rooms where we first met first made love but little girl if i had a thousand times the possessions i should gladly give them all up to have you for my wife besides the queen got nothing but the island when i knew that i was going to come after you some instinct made me transfer all my wealth to my bankers in paris if we cannot persuade the queen to relent then i shall obtain lands here in france and we shall settle here the queen took nothing of lynmouth or robert smalls possessions which will one day come to willow it is only your burke children she has acted against and i suspect skye that given the situation in ireland now the english would have eventually stolen those lands i am sorry but there is no help for it what of the omalleys adam what of innisfana my brothers anne geoffreys two daughters for the moment they seem to be safe i hope you will not be angry with me skye but i instructed robbie to take over the six ships that belong to you personally and to separate them from the omalley holdings your brothers have joined forces with your kinswoman grace omalley and she is the queens mortal enemy in ireland this way i have protected your own wealth skye nodded her agreement my brothers are hotheaded fools she said sadly they will tear down everything i have built up for the omalleys and leave our people in poverty but i can do nothing to help them they are men now and they will not listen to me adam they see only the glory of rebellion against the english and they see not the misery their actions will bring a deep sigh of regret escaped her and then she said send for geoffreys two daughters gwyneth and joan and beg my stepmother anne to come with them i dont know if anne omalley will leave her sons skye perhaps not adam but i will ask her nonetheless that much i can do in my fathers memory in time skye the queen will relent of her decision i am sure no skye said i am not so sure she will adam do you remember when lady catherine grey married secretly with edward seymour the earl of hertford like ours it was a catholic ceremony but when the proof was needed the priest mysteriously could not be found both their sons were declared illegitimate by the queen catherine grey was a claimant to the tudor throne skye the queen was but protecting herself no adam elizabeth tudor likes to totally control the lives of her court she is not capable of loving or giving love once she told me though she said she would deny it if i quoted her that she would never wed for if she did she would be neither a queen nor a woman in her own right but rather a mans possession and she feared it she does fear it adam but yet at the same time she longs for it she tries to surround herself with women she deems like her women of wit and beauty and intelligence when these women fail her by falling in love she is merciless in her disapproval and her revenge they have she honestly believes given in to their baser natures but elizabeth tudor will never give in to her feelings she will live and die a virgin queen what will happen to england then he mused mary stewart has a son skye said and it is this little boy james who i believe will one day rule england adam listened to his wife but in his heart he still hoped that one day elizabeth tudor would forgive them so they might return to england he liked france but he was an englishman in his heart eventually although he did not tell skye he intended to win the queen over geoffrey southwoods twin daughters gwyneth and joan arrived from ireland in midapril they had stopped in cornwall on their way to attend the wedding of their elder sister susan to young lord trevenyan susan at fifteen had sent her stepmother a properly correct letter offering to accept responsibility for her two sisters now that she was to be a married woman gwyn and joan however had fled happily from their strictly protestant sisters household at the suggestion that they might marry her two young brothersinlaw you should have seen them bellemèrejoan giggled two pimplefaced boys with damp hands that were always seeking to get beneath our skirts when no one was looking but oh how pious they became when it was necessary gwyn laughed with her sister indeed bellemèrethough susan was shocked that we chose to honor our betrothals to your sons we love ewan and murrough when may we wed you are but fourteen skye said when you are sixteen we shall speak on it this summer you shall stay with us here at archambault and then in the autumn perhaps i shall obtain places among the young french queens maids of honor for both of you and willow do you think you would enjoy a few months at court the answer was obvious and shone in the delight upon the young girls faces i am sorry that anne would not come with you skye remarked she will not leave her boys bellemèrejoan said though they will surely be the ruin of the omalleys that is why i sent for you skye replied i did not want you caught up in such an affair joan and gwyneth settled comfortably into the routine of the family joining their stepsister willow and her french compatriots in their studies and their games on the twentyninth of april skye went into labor with her child a bit early gaby observed but i can see the child is large and certainly ready to be born nature seldom makes a mistake in these matters no it does not said eibhlin omalley the nursing nun who had accompanied her nieces from ireland in order to be with her favorite sister in her travail the salon in the de marisco apartments had been turned into a birthing room and all the ladies of the household were available to help though eibhlin thought it unnecessary this would be skyes eighth child it was not however to be an easy birth the labor began and then it stopped began again and stopped once more skye paced the room feeling the nervous perspiration sliding down her back beneath her robe perhaps it is not a true labor she said to eibhlin this has not been like my other confinements in what way sister eibhlin kept her voice level she did not want skye to know that she was nervous i was very sick in the beginning this time and the child has not been as wildly active as my others eibhlin heaved a mental sigh of relief each time is different to some degree skye i just worry because this little one is so slow in coming you have always borne your babes quickly skye awoke on the morning of april th in severe labor before she might rise from her bed her waters broke flooding everything she was furious and muttered already this royal bastard causes me trouble i wish to god it would never be born for shame sister eibhlin scolded the babe is innocent of its fathers crime be grateful that your husband loves you so very much that he is willing to raise this child as his own skye looked at her sister her beautiful blue eyes ripe with raw pain i dont want him to raise this child eibhlin she whispered i hate this babe that was forced upon me the young king of navarre used me like a whore and i can never forget that as long as i must be a loving mother to his bastard it is not fair eibhlin it simply is not fair adam who is the best man in this whole world cannot sire a child duc to a youthful fever yet he is meant to be a father it is his child i want not the bastard of frances future king eiblilin who had always understood this beautiful and brilliant younger sister of hers put an arm about skye you cant change what has already been sister she said sadly you must face the truth of this matter henri of navarres child is soon to be born to you your husband whom you profess to love above all wants this child for his own you do not have a choice in this skye for adams sake you must accept this little one with as good a grace as you can muster it is the only thing he has ever asked of you skye and adam de marisco has given you so much in return for love of you he has lost lundy he has for love of you lost his country of all the men who have loved you skye he has given you the most for he has without shame or reserve given you his total heart all he asks in return is this child which will put an end to any of the evil rumors that have been spread by the duchesse de beuvron this babe will restore to him his own sense of manhood you owe him that sister skye burst into tears at her sisters words and sobbing she flung herself against the nuns chest i know that all you say is true eibhlin but i cannot in my heart resign myself to it i know that i am being selfish but i cannot i cannot you will eibhlin said positively i have faith in your nature skye which has always been a good and generous one with a loving hand eibhlin stroked her sisters head skye sobbed her misery out against her sisters spare bosom for several long minutes she wanted to be the woman that eibhlin claimed she really was and she wanted to make adam happy but every time she remembered itsconception she rebelled with anger she remembered navarres golden amber eyes filling with lust as he examined her bound and helpless body she remembered the feel of his lips and his tongue upon her and most of all she remembered that he had been totally aware that although she resisted him in her heart and mind her body could not deny him she remembered he had smugly voiced his knowledge and had laughed at the futility of her rejection of him all the love that adam had to offer could not wipe out the terrible shame she felt and having to face the result of navarres rape for the rest of her days was not going to help then suddenly she was being pulled from her sisters embrace and enfolded in her husbands bearlike embrace dont weep little girl please dont weep adam begged her his normally strong voice sounding somewhat distraught tears of frustration poured down her face scalding her but looking up at this marvelous man whom she loved so dearly skye said in what she hoped passed for a reasonably normal voice dammit adam having a baby hurts and all women cry would you want me to act any differently for ourchild than i did for the others she saw his face sag with relief and knew in that minute that he would give up his little dream for her if she asked for a moment she was tempted to but then she forced a small smile to her lips reaching up she touched his cheek with her hand its truly all right sweetheart he begged for her reassurance its all right you big fool she teased him wearily no wonder god gives the task of bearing children to women you men go completely to pieces at the slightest little thing adam nodded his head at her saying i will admit that i should rather face an enemy in battle than go through what you are going through right now little girl still i will stay by your side if you want me i would like that skye answered him but you must promise me that should you become distressed by my labor you will feel free to go i will understand eibhlin sighed a secret sigh of relief part of the difficulty with skyes erratic labor had been that she had not wanted to bear this baby and her mind had been exercising a fierce grip on her entire body now that skye had come to terms with herself eibhlin knew that the labor would progress and indeed it did but at a far slower pace than the nun had expected finally eibhlin felt she must examine her sister more closely and adam and gaby helped skye up onto a table that had been prepared with a mattress and clean linens eibhlin washed her hands thoroughly and then began a gentle examination of her patient skye was but half dilated as the nun slipped a hand within her sisters body scarcely breathing eibhlin reached out and found what she had been expecting a soft celtic curse escaped her as she withdrew her hand what is it skye was instantly alert eibhlin washed her hands again the babe is turned the wrong way she said tis breach will it right itself perhaps the situation is not yet acute and so i think we can wait a bit skye was helped from the table and with grim concentration she began to pace back and forth adam walking with her knowing what was to come gaby and eibhlin both took the opportunity to sit down and rest the pains began to come with greater regularity now and finally after several hours eibhlin felt she must examine her sister once more this time skye was fully dilated but the baby had still not turned itself correctly it was well past midnight and now may st ill have to try and turn the child myself eibhlin told her sister can you do it skye returned ive done it successfully many times was her answer dont worry skye it will be all right skye tried to keep her mind off what her sister was doing while adam sat by her head and sought to comfort her by talking she had not wanted this bastard child but suddenly now that the babe was in danger skyes maternal instincts all rushed forward as she silently prayed all would be well there eibhlin said triumphantly now sister bear down so we may get this child quickly into the world the infant is turned gaby sounded anxious yes madame la comtesse the child is properly positioned now to be born look you can even see its head a mighty pain tore through skye forcing a cry from between her lips instinct took over and she pushed hard to force the child from her body adam mopped her steaming brow with a cool cloth and she saw that he was white about the lips she was suddenly reminded of geoffrey southwood who had helped her to birth their son in a barge on the thames if only adam could stay by her as geoffrey once had she thought she knew that like geoffrey adam was a man of great sensitivity who would treasure the memory of the birth another pain cut into her and she heard gaby cry ah mafille the child is being born weve got the head and shoulders sister eibhlin said just a little more dearest skye felt the proximity of victory and it showed in her face for adam said i want to see the baby coming from your body sweetheart yes yes she said urgently through gritted teeth and he stood up and went to stay by eibhlin she watched him with an almost pagan joy for the look on his face was one of both wonder and amazement then he caught her gaze with his own for a quick minute and the love and admiration that flowed from him gave her new and incredible strength at the next pain she bore down as hard as she could and she actually felt the baby sliding from her body there was a tiny hiccough and then a small cry of outrage as the infant was born and took its first breath tis a little girl eibhlin said with a smile a perfect little girl give her to me gaby said holding out her hands for the baby i will clean her off so she may be properly presented to her mama and papa she took the baby from eibhlin and skye laughed with delight as adams eyes widened with pleasure at the sight of the baby she was she decided going to love the child no matter the manner in which it was conceived and more important adam loved it another pain knifed through her and skye worked to rid herself of the afterbirth eibhlin worked swiftly and efficiently to finish with skye the job of the birthing as mignon carried off the basin holding the afterbirth the nun cleaned away all traces of skyes travail youve been torn a bit she said by the size of the child she is a big girl chew on this herb sister for i shall have to stitch you up she handed skye a piece of something green and skye obediently put the green herb in her mouth and grimaced for it was bitter in taste within skyes sight gaby watched by adam worked to make the baby fresh and pretty for its parents suddenly adams mother gave a startled little cry mondieuhow can this be but it is she turned to her big son commanding adam fetch isabeau and clarice at once vitevite maman it is the middle of the night he protested and as proud as i am of the child it can wait until morning to tell them of it doasisaygaby commanded again please adam do not argue with me vite with a shake of his head adam stumbled from his apartments to fetch his sisters isabeau and clarice who had come to stay at archambault at the news that skye was in labor walking through the chilly halls of the château he found their rooms and banging upon each door called to them the doors were opened by sleepy tiring women who eyed adam balefully when he told them to fetch their mistresses what is it adam isabeau came to her door pulling a quilted velvet gown about her the child is born and maman insists that you and clarice come immediately is skye all right demanded clarice who had now come to her door both she and the child seem fine but maman has suddenly gone mad i think the two sisters looked at one another and then pushing past their brother they hurried down the hallway adam quickly followed them and they reentered the apartments shared by the de mariscos maman what is it isabeau cried maman are you all right clarice echoed yes mes fillesi am fine but i need you both here because there has been a miracle and both of you can help me prove the existence of that miracle gaby picked up the newly born infant which she had wrapped in a soft blanket carrying it over to skye she said machèreskye this is no child of henri of navarre this child is of our blood and i can prove it to you masoeurshe said to eibhlin take your niece a moment she handed the baby to the nun and then gaby bent down lifted her skirts and drew her undergarments down to bare her hip do you see it she said do you see the small mole in the shape of a heart skye yes skye was puzzled gaby dropped her skirts that birthmark is the mark of the st denis women only women of our own blood have that mark isabeau clarice show skye your birthmarks the two sisters undid their gowns and raising their nightdresses each revealed a tiny dark heart upon the left hip just atop the bone the mark was identical to that of their mothers all our daughters bear the same mark skye isabeau said before i married i was mademoiselle st denis gaby explained that particular birthmark has shown up on the women in my family for at least ten generations musette also bears the mark as does her little daughter aimée i did not call musette however since she does not know her brothers difficulty nonetheless ma chèreskye this baby you have just borne is my own true granddaughter the child of my son adam she turned to eibhlin unwrap the infant masoeurand when the nun had done so she handed the baby to gaby look skye on the little ones left hip just atop the bone the birthmark of the st denis women there has been a miracle mafillethisisadamschildandnooneelses skye looked at her daughter and then she looked to eibhlin her voice confused eibhlin you are a physician can this be is it true is it even possible can this baby be adams daughter eibhlin looked closely at the newborn infant the tiny dark heart atop the left hipbone was quite plain there was no mistake about it she took the baby rewrapped her in the blanket and handed her to her mother then turning to adam she said who told you that you could not have children adam twas an old herb woman adam said i had been ill with a very high fever and she claimed that the fever had burnt all the life from my seed eibhlin nodded an only halfaccurate diagnosis my lord what i suspect is really the truth is that for a time your seed was lifeless but nature sometimes has a way of reversing itself and it is very possible that now many years later you have perhaps a small amount of life to your seed i have heard of cases like yours she looked down at the baby and smiled she has your mamas nose there is no doubt this child is of your flesh my lord but do not get your hopes high for there is very little chance of your siring another child you have been fortunate and god has heard my sisters prayers but as your mother has said this is a miracle adam de marisco moved to skyes side and together they gazed wonderingly upon their daughter how do i thank you sweetheart he said and she heard the catch in his voice she shook her head her eyes filling with happy tears her own voice catching in her throat i i cant believe it adam then she looked about the room and saw that both her sister and the others had tears in their eyes finally eibhlin managed to regain her equilibrium and taking the baby from its parents she said it is time that everyone went to bed is the cradle in the bedchamber yes masoeurgaby said corning to herself give me my newest granddaughter and i shall put her in her cradle while you and adam help skye she turned to her daughters well dont just stand there you two go and open skyes bed for her must i tell you everything isabeau and clarice giggled not one bit put out to be scolded by their maman they felt giddy with happiness at the wonderful good fortune that had befallen their beloved brother and his beautiful wife hurrying into the bedchamber they drew back the coverlet of the freshly made bed with its lavenderscented sheets carefully adam de marisco lifted his wife up and carried her to their bed gently he set her in it and drew the covers over her skyes eyes were beginning to close as all the tension of the last months and the lengthy labor she had just endured caught up with her she was asleep even as his lips softly brushed her mouth is she all right he asked eibhlin yes eibhlin nodded with a kindly smile but she is very very tired had this kind of a labor come when she was a girl i should be less concerned but she is past thirty adam and that is not a good time for a hard birth is there any danger eibhlin i dont believe so for skye has always been healthy i am just cautious eibhlin led them all from the bedroom closing the door behind her as she went go back to your beds mes fillesgaby ordered her daughters i am certainly going to seek mine and you masoeurdeserve a good rest also i will see that the nurse is sent to watch the baby while we all sleep clarice and isabeau hugged their brother and then departed the room closely followed by eibhlin and gaby who with tears in her eyes kissed her son stating a final time itis amiracle when they had left adam de marisco tiptoed back into skyes bedchamber once more and stood for several long minutes looking down at the sleeping form of the newborn child hisdaughterhe had a daughter not some royal bastard that he would accept for skyes sake but his own child itwasamiraclehe wanted to pick the baby up and examine her carefully but he was afraid to do so they had all said she was a fine big girl but to him she looked so tiny tomorrow tomorrow would be time enough to become acquainted with his new little girl he walked over to the big bed where skye lay sleeping and his heart went out to his lovely wife she looked so very tired after her long ordeal he had loved her for so long and now he owed her a debt that he could never repay for she had given him a child somehow he was going to get them home to england ireland he knew was totally out of the question and skye knew it too if there had been troubles in ireland before they were going to double in the next few years bending down he kissed her lightly once more and then went through the connecting door between the two chambers and sought his bed in his sleep adam heard the baby whimper and he was instantly awake stumbling across the room and through the door to his surprise and his relief the nurse was already there she smiled at him and curtseyed tis all right monseigneur go back to sleep he gratefully complied and the sun was halfway across the skies above archambault when he finally awoke again he had fallen into bed without even removing his clothing although he had remembered to take off his boots now adam peeked into skyes bedchamber and seeing his wife sitting up in her bed eating an egg he hurried to make himself presentable stripping off his clothes he called for old guillaume to bring him water for washing and while he bathed and trimmed his beard and mustache the old valet laid out fresh clothing for his master which adam hastily donned her blue eyes lit up as he came into the room and she smilingly held out her arms to him bonjourmonmarishe said gaily sitting on the edge of the bed he took her into his arms and kissed her passionately jetaimei love you he murmured softly at her you are the most marvelous woman in this world lady de marisco gracious she teased him and what has made you so happy today my lord but then skye could not keep up the pretense and she called to the nursemaid ila bring the baby for my lord to see oh adam you should see her she is so perfect her own eyes were shining with joy and happiness and he took her hand raising it to his lips to kiss it mercimafemmehe said millefoismerci ila brought the baby from its cradle laying her carefully upon the bed she said i shall go and get the extra linen i need if madame will permit it yes yes skye encouraged the nurse and then she turned to her husband look at her adam isnt she just perfect he looked down at the swaddled little bundle with only its small heartshaped face showing i really cant tell he said honestly can we undress her skye unwrapped the baby from her blanket and carefully removed the little shirt and napkin then she looked up at her husband well adam de marisco gazed down with wonder at his daughter she was indeed perfection she had plump little arms and legs and a fat little tummy she was rosy and creamy with a thick headful of dark curls and now when she opened her eyes he saw that they were a beautiful blue she stared at him boldly and with a soft chuckle adam touched the baby with a gentle finger her skin was softer than anything he had ever known and he was enchanted by it shes roses and ebony ivory and white velvet he said quietly skye smiled at his pride as she carefully redressed and rewrapped the baby the infant whimpered and quietly her mother opened her gown and put the baby to her breast skyes milk would not be in for another day but her breasts already tingled with a clear liquid that preceded the milk and it was this nourishment she offered her daughter adam sat watching her and he felt more at peace now than he had ever felt in his life what are we going to name her he asked his wife a name for the child was something that skye had not been able to discuss while she believed it to be henri of navarres baby would you like to call her after your mother and she might have marie as a second name as may is the month of the blessed mother skye looked to her husband that is kind sweetheart he remarked but clarice has a daughter who is mariegabrielle and alexandre has a daughter who is gabriellemarie our daughter might bear both those names but she must also have her very own name a name by which she can be distinguished from her cousins he looked again at his daughter who was busily and hungrily nursing upon her mothers breast once more he was overcome by the urge to touch her and he did so gently his pinky rubbing softly against her cheek again the word velvet came into his mind and then adams eyes lit up velvet he said i want to call her velvet it is perfect skye said excitedly velvet gabrielle marie velvet de marisco velvet de marisco chose that moment to get a bout of the hiccoughs much to her parents amusement and then the baby not the least bit impressed by the importance of the occasion that had elevated her from nameless infant to velvet de marisco fell asleep over her daughters head skye looked lovingly at her husband and adam de marisco smiled back for the moment there was no longer any need for words chapter when she was three days old velvet de marisco was baptized in the family chapel of archambault by the châteaus priest to everyones surprise queen catherine and her daughter marguérite arrived from chenonceaux where they had celebrated may day the princesse insisted upon standing as godmother to the baby she is not navarres child skye said boldly i would have no misunderstandings between us highness she is too pretty to be navarres child madame the princesse laughed no i choose to be this little girls godmother because if i were a good wife i should now be giving birth myself i am not a particularly good wife but then henri is not a good husband humor me madame i shall be good to the child skye bowed her head politely you do my daughter great honor highness who is the other godmothertobe catherine de medici asked elizabeth tudor skye said softly ha ha the queen laughed you play your cards well madame de marisco well it cannot hurt the little one to have both an english queen and a french princess on her side who knows where she may end up someday who is the godfather msieur le comte skye replied and her halfbrother the earl of lynmouth a good choice the queen approved again you chose to straddle both sides of the channel the wars of religion were giving everyone a nervous summer a nearby wealthy huguenot merchant decided to relocate to the protestant stronghold of la rochelle and was very grateful to find in adam de marisco a buyer for his small château belle fleur belle fleur was only four miles from archambault a fairytale gem of a house located upon a small lake and set in the middle of an enormous garden on the edge of a forest skye was charmed by her new home which had been built in the early fifteenth century by an ancestor of the previous owners wife belle fleur had an air of enchantment about it with its witchs cap roofs and its moat which spread into a small lake on one side the château appeared to hover on the smooth surface of the water and seemed even more mysterious by virtue of the surrounding forest of archambault built of flattened roughhewn blocks of reddishgray schist it had four polygonal towers crowned by dark slate roofs shaped like witchs hats which defended each corner of the building access to the courdhonneurcould only be gained through a tall heavily fortified châtelet flanked by rounded and corbeled towers that rose high on either side of the entrance arch surrounded by water on three sides the château was on its fourth side planted in an exquisite and colorful garden filled to overflowing with sweetly scented blooms the creatures of the forest were kept from the garden by a low stone wall it was this magnificent garden that had given the château its name it was not a large home but it had a fine hall where the family might gather and where they could entertain on a small scale and there were enough bedchambers for all of the children and room for a decent staff of servants there were goodsized stables for the horses a respectable kennel for the dogs and a suitable place for the falcons the former owner had sold the château furnished and it was filled with pleasingly good furniture and hangings adam had a bed made to his own specifications for himself and skye she purchased both table and bed linens from a nearby convent and they were ready to move into their new home mignon and guillaume came with them from archambault along with a full staff of servants provided them by the comte they spent the rest of the summer settling in surprisingly isolated from frances unpleasant religious wars they were the contented parents of nine children six of skyes her two stepdaughters and their own baby daughter velvet skye could not remember a more content and domesticated period in her life ewan and murrough were home from the university in paris for several months and along with their younger brother robin and their stepfather they spent long days on horseback hunting or sprawled lazily by the lakeside fishing then too the older boys had suddenly become very aware of gwyneth and joan southwood to whom they had been betrothed since childhood skyes stepdaughters the children of geoffrey southwoods previous marriage were pretty girls with long darkhoneyblond hair and soft gray eyes they were now fourteen and had been in skyes care since they were five the twins adored their stepmother and skye loved them back with all of her generous nature she had placed them with anne omalley when she had left for beaumont and under that sweet ladys tutelage the southwood girls had learned all that needed be known by a good wife and mother as little girls they had been rather plain and their new prettiness delighted skye and greatly pleased her sons in this happy summer gwyn and joan and their stepsister willow were content to be with skye who took them riding and boating and on wonderful picnics in the nearby forest it was not long before adam and the boys began to join them on their alfresco outings and soon deirdre and her little brother padraic were clamoring to come also it was a good time in the evenings the family would gather in the great hall for the meal and afterward adam and ewan would play chess while murrough and robin both once pages at elizabeth tudors court would play upon their lutes while the ladies sang skye watched her children with pride and glowed herself in their reflected happiness it had never been quite like this for any of them in france they were far from the angloirish situation they were far from the intrigues of elizabeth tudors court for the first time skye thought we do not have to be wary we do not have to be afraid in the autumn willow gwyneth and joan went up to paris accompanied by ewan murrough had decided he had enough of education and went off to sea with old sean macguire the girls were to take their places for a few months in the household of the young french queen isabeau of austria young robin southwood grew restless with his elder brothers gone and adam concentrating on the running of the small estate you want to return to england skye said understanding robin now ten looked sadly at his mother i am an englishman mother he said i am the earl of lynmouth i know that i am but half grown but i belong at the court where my father spent his youth and i belong on my estates my lord de grenville cannot truly act for me if you go she said we may never see one another again neither adam nor i dare set foot in england for fear of the queens wrath she will not recognize our marriage and she has branded wee velvet illegitimate she is not a happy woman robin replied wisely she longs for yet she fears that which other women have she is not so much angry at you mother as she is at herself skye was amazed at her young sons apt appraisal of elizabeth tudor but then robin had been the queens personal and favorite page and he was not a stupid boy i will write to both robbie and dickon de grenville to see if your return would be a welcome one she said with tears in her eyes dont worry mother he said in an effort to comfort her bess tudor cannot keep me from you if i desire to be with you i am southwood the premier earl of england skye looked hard at her son he had grown taller over this summer and she suddenly realized that the arrogant tilt of his head the fierce pride in his voice the very way that he stood made him his fathers son yes robin she said softly you are indeed southwood skye kept her promise to robin and wrote that very day to both robbie and de grenville for several weeks the correspondence flew back and forth between france and england skye insisted that she receive the queens word that robin would be allowed to come to his mother and stepfather whenever either of them should desire it the queen wrote back that robin might certainly come to visit his mother lady burke and lord de marisco her lover whenever he chose elizabeth tudor wrote in her elegant hand that she knew the pain of parental separation from her own personal experience and she would certainly not visit it upon the child of her late dear friend the earl of lynmouth however the queen primly noted that she did not think the living arrangements chosen by lady burke as well as the presence of her bastard daughter were conducive to correct moral behavior and young people were so easily influenced ohhhh the jealous bitch skye spit furiously if she could retain her maidenhead and still entertain a randy cock nightly she would the hypocrite ill not let robin go adam roared with laughter but then he grew serious you must not make him stay skye i would go home too if i could and if robin desires it then he should go he is lord of a vast estate and his people need to see him he has his place at court skye even if we dont it is his right young lord southwood rode out from belle fleur on an early november day he had bid his tearful mother a loving goodbye and accompanied by his stepfather made his way to nantes where he would embark for plymouth on one of skyes ships ill soften the queen up so shell recognize your marriage mother he promised gallantly it is not right that she not do so and i will not have my sister velvets honor compromised skye hugged him muttering motherly things about getting enough sleep and eating properly and not allowing himself to be seduced by anyone either male or female for the pages were always prey to such debauchery especially when they were as handsome as robin his lordship flushed at his mothers words and adam swallowed a guffaw at skyes concern saying enough now sweetheart else we miss the tide and old macguire wont be happy with you then besides you know how treacherous the bay of biscay can be at this time of year skye understood her husbands silent message and pulling herself together she kissed robin soundly on both cheeks saying god go with you my son remember i love you she watched them disappear down the forest road and then skye walked quietly through the château and upstairs to the bedchamber she shared with adam where she had a good cry after a while she began to giggle as she remembered adams remark about the tide realizing that as always her tears would have rendered him helpless the tide mattered not for it was two days ride to nantes from belle fleur her sense of humor restored and facing the fact that she really could not keep robin from his heritage skye put it all behind her and set to work to keep busy while adam was away there were now only three children left at the château her burke son and daughter and little velvet since they were all cared for by their nurses skye could spend her time at other things the previous winter had been a cold one and neither had the spring and summer been successful growing seasons the fourth french religious war raged on but was thankfully confined to la rochelle and sancerre yet the coming winter would bring famine and shortages to all of france skye had already seen to the import of grain from the barbary coast which was brought into nantes on her ships this grain she shared with archambault and the miller there had seen to the grinding of the wheat into flour which was then stored in a guarded stone granary hidden within the forest throughout the winter the flour would be parceled out to the peasants so that they might survive in a burst of generosity the comte de cher and his sonsinlaw permitted hunting in the fields and forests of archambault twice monthly on specific days poachers caught at any other time were subject to severe punishment both skye and adam knew the forest of archambault abounded with rabbits far more indeed than could ever be eaten it was understood among the peasants of the neighborhood that the seigneur de marisco and his wife were known to look the other way when coming upon snares and fishing discreetly in the belle fleurs lake was not discouraged you are too kind to them gaby scolded skye as she visited with her daughterinlaw while adam was away they have to eat skye argued by letting them snare rabbits without ceasing we make the rabbits wary enough to avoid the gardens which means the vegetables have time to reach maturity we will need the cabbages and carrots and the leeks and onions this winter it is simply a matter of careful planning you have managed an estate before gaby was surprised did adam not tell you of my estates gaby it seemed to me that he told you everything else about me skye laughed oh i know about the wealth you inherited from your husbands but i was not aware you knew how to manage that wealth it is not something a woman usually does i have never been an ordinary woman gaby when i was still a girl my father bypassed my five older sisters and their husbands to put his wealth and power in my hands i am the omalley of innisfana i followed my fathers teachings and increased the holdings and the wealth of the omalleys of innisfana considerably at the same time i managed my son ewans holdings and later on the wealth left to me by my second husband for his daughter willow and then all of lynmouths lands and goods and finally the burkes i was not so successful with the burke lands alas the irish gaby threw up her hands forgive me mafillebut they are an impossible people charming but totally mad skye laughed indeed we are she admitted i regret that the irish would rather destroy themselves than accept compromise and survive even i rebelled against the english in the end had i gone back to england instead of marrying adam here in france my son padraic would still have his lands and adam would have lundy lundy good riddance gaby snapped a pile of stones upon a rock but ah before adams father allowed his lust to control him so that he defied and insulted king henry tudor ahh then mabellelundy and its castle was a most fantastic sight i had my first glimpse of it when i arrived there as a bride over forty years ago john de marisco had come to paris to wed me and then brought me back to england we stopped at lynmouth to pay our respects to johns liege lord your robins grandpèreand then we embarked from lynmouth for lundy across the water it was early morning and the fog was thick soon i could no longer see lynmouth and i could certainly not see lundy then suddenly a light wind sprang up and the dawn began to pour across the skies lundy appeared like a fairytale castle seeming to float above the sea streamers of mist swirling about its turrets ah twas a glorious sight for a moment her face was soft with the memory but then the practical frenchwoman resurfaced then that marvelous idiot i married managed to destroy my sons inheritance and left us with barely enough for me to bring my children home to france lundy pah you are better off here at belle fleur excuse me madame but it is time for mademoiselle velvets feeding the nursemaid said bringing the baby to her mother skye took her little daughter who was now six months old and growing more like her father every day her coalblack curls were already thick and tangled her blue eyes were avid in their curiosity about everything ahmapetitebébégaby crooned have you a small smile for grandmère velvets eyes swept tolerandy over her grandmother and then turning away she grasped at her mothers breast thrusting the nipple into her mouth with a sigh she settled down to the business of food skye chuckled like her father and her mother she will not be deterred from her desires you are still nursing her why gaby demanded surely you can find a wet nurse i could find you one ma fille adam prefers that i feed her myself skye said and frankly i am enjoying it gaby this is the first time in my life i have been able to enjoy being a mother there was always something to take me from motherhood this time there is not will you stay in france skye i do not know gaby there is nothing for me in ireland any longer and i would far prefer not to have to live beneath elizabeth tudors thumb still adam longs for england and he says that it is velvets heritage perhaps one day the queen will forgive us for marrying without her permission and then i know that adam will return we are his family and we will have to go with him but we shall keep belle fleur even when that day comes for i have been happier here than anywhere in my whole life adam returned from nantes and shortly thereafter they received word that his lordship the earl of lynmouth had reached england safely christmas new years and twelfth night came and went and the winter settled in around archambault and belle fleur willow wrote from the french court that the king was not well and it was expected he would die soon as for court she wrote it seems very much as robin has described the english court to me there is much intrigue both serious and silly most people are terribly impressed by ones title andor pocketbook the young men play a game as to who can seduce the greatest number of noble ladies what they do not know is that these ladies are playing the same game you need not worry mama wrote willow for my stepsisters and i are shocked by such disgraceful behavior gwyneth and joan of course are relatively safe for they are neither overly pretty nor wealthy enough as for me i have my share of admirers but i will not permit them to be alone with me thereby avoiding any idle gossip that should destroy my good name skye smiled reading willows letter she had no fears about willow who was a practical little miss with ambitions to wed an important title littleno willow could no longer be considered little she would be fourteen in april and it would soon be time skye realized to seek a husband for her eldest daughter remembering dom oflaherty skye prayed that her daughter would fall in love with a suitable young man and thus avoid the pain that she had suffered she would not force her child to any marriage as she had been forced by her wellmeaning father the spring of the year was more promising and velvet de marisco celebrated her first birthday she was already walking toddling about the château with so much zeal that skye forbade the babys nursemaid to leave her alone for a moment for she feared her daughter would fall into the moat velvet was also talking making her demands which were many and constant known in a mixture of both english and french adam was an appallingly doting father but then skye had expected it yet she worried when her big husband took their tiny daughter up on his horse and rode out into the forest velvet however was no more fearful of that than skye had been of the sea at her age skye could simply not bring herself to chide adam for his great love and delight in his daughter were so painfully obvious she could not spoil his fun and so it fell upon her shoulders the task of disciplining their child nonnonméchancetéskye scolded her baby daughter one afternoon as velvet attempted to stuff a sweetmeat into her mouth she spanked the tiny hand gently and wiped the stickiness from it velvets enormous eyes grew moist and she ran on fat little legs to her father clutched at his leg threw her mother an angry glance and distinctly said papa loves adam longed to laugh and pick his precious child up in his arms for a kiss but seeing skyes warning look he instead said mama loves you too velvet but you must always obey her outraged at this unpleasant turn of events velvet stalked away to her nurse who took her from the hall what a minx she is skye said you realize that we are going to have our hands full with her could lebondieunot have given us a gentle and quiet child he chuckled she is ourdaughter sweetheart skye smiled back at him you will not feel so indulgent when she is older and the men begin to crowd about her she teased thats a long time away adam said smugly shes just a baby barely a year old the time goes quickly adam ewan is eighteen now and i dont know where the years went madame you are depressing me he said let us go to bed now before we are too old although i have been told by authorities on the matter that one never grows too old based on the wisdom of your vast age what do you have to say on the matter come to our bedchamber monseigneur and i shall explain my thoughts to you in detail skye promised with a seductive glance at her husband as she went from the hall these were the times she loved the best the times when they might retire to the delicious isolation of their apartment in the big bed that he had had made specially for theman enormous oak bed with its eightfoothigh headboard all done in linenfold paneling its carved and turned posts its naturalcolored linen hangings with an embroidered design of grass green velvetthey could lie for hours in the nude caressing each other leisurely and making long slow love until the fire burned down to nothing but glowing ashes and they were forced to retreat beneath the down coverlet for them the lovemaking grew better each time particularly after velvet was born adam could not love her enough and skye adored her giant of a husband when he lay his naked length against hers pressing her deep into the mattress she reveled in the firm flesh of his thighs against hers the tickly feeling of his furred chest against her breasts the hardness of his very maleness seeking to mate with her there were times when she could not get enough of her handsome husband and she would shamelessly awaken him with delicious kisses across his big sleeping form several times adam awoke to find she had roused him while he slept and now sat astride him reaching up he would caress her beautiful breasts until they thrust forward with taunting invitation yet with the incredible passion that blazed between them was also a profound sense of peace as if both skye and adam understood that what was between them would be forever charles ix died and his next brother anjou who had the previous year been made king of poland fled his adopted country like a thief in the night to return to his beloved france anjou however stopped in both vienna and venice to be royally feted before finally gaining his native borders where his irritated mother awaited him elizabeth of austria retired from court and because her retinue was smaller now skyes daughters came home to belle fleur that summer ewan arrived from the university in paris murrough appeared bronzed and taller home from his first voyage and even robin appeared suddenly one day to surprise them all a great deal of fuss was made over the baby although skye begged her older children not to spoil velvet she is already quite impossible mesenfantstheir mother said with an indulgent smile after several months back in england robin was once more the perfect english courtier you should really let me take padraic back with me in the autumn mother he said to skye he will be close to six then and should begin his education at the tudor court the queen may have taken his lands but my brother is still lord burke no skye said as long as adam and i are not welcome at the tudor court then none of my children except you robin shall go a nobleman without lands is nothing and until the queen restores the burke lands to the burkes i want nothing to do with either her or england besides padraic is still a baby i am not padraic burke his fathers image glowered up at her skye looked down at nialls son and smiled at him in time my darling she promised him be patient for now then she looked around the hall and said i am so glad to have you all here again this is how i like it best my children about me adam by my side i can only stay a month robin said i promised her majesty that i would rejoin the court in its summer progress at hardwick hall i have given my word ill be returning to ireland when robin goes ewan said suddenly whatskye looked sharply at her eldest son this is rather sudden ewan isnt it ive been in correspondence with my uncle michael for over a year mother hes done the best he could but hes a priest my other omalley uncles have not been interested in ballyhennessey since they joined with grace omalley to fight with the queen i have to go home mother my lands need me he finished then he looked at his mother i want to take gwyneth with me mother it is time for us to marry but she is just fifteen skye protested the twins had celebrated their birthday on june th you were fifteen when you wed my father ewan said quietly i was too young no mother you were not too young you were simply wed to the wrong man that is not the case with gwyneth and me i cannot bear it if ewan leaves me madame said the quiet gwyneth i am past ready to be a wife i also joan said but murrough has just begun to learn seamanship if he is to make it his life he cannot stay home to husband you joan skye was beginning to feel besieged by her offspring macguire is not sailing again for almost two months mother murrough said his ship needs repairs joan and i can be wed and even have time together before i must leave whenever she weds me she still has to get used to having a sailor for a husband i will buy us a home in devon near lynmouth robin coughed a bit and looked a trifle uncomfortable all right robert southwood skye snapped what else is there i bring an invitation from the queen for willow she is invited to join the maids of honor ohhh willow shrieked esctatically and then she turned on her mother you promised me that one day i might you promised mama youve been to court a french court willow scoffed scornfully no please mama soon i shall be too old to go please skye looked at the children all ranged in a row and seemingly allied against her ewan murrough gwyneth joan willow robin and padraic they all wanted to leave her hand flew to her mouth and she cried but i have had you such a short time then toning from them she ran from the hall adam watched her go his own eyes saddened and then he said of course you must follow your own destinies mes enfants you are all quite old enough now but it is hard for your mother to understand this leave her to me and i will make it all right for everyone adam found her weeping piteously on their bed and quietly gathered skye into his arms she sobbed for some minutes as he gently rocked her back and forth and then gradually her sobs began to fade away it will be dull without them i know he said soothingly i like dull she said i have had enough adventure to last me three lifetimes adam why when it is finally as i want it does it have to change because the years have flown little girl and they arc grown or half grown they are their mothers offspring for they wish to strike out on their own and why shouldnt they i know that it is hard for a mother to admit that her sons are grown but your oflahertys have become men my darling he chuckled if you had eyes in your head skye youd see at least three of their bastards on this estate high time that they were married i say but willow skye all of your children but willow spring from the loins of noblemen willow may be a great heiress but she hasnt a great name she needs to go to court if she is to find a suitable husband willows father was a spanish nobleman skye said hotly his family neither knows of her existence nor would they recognize her as a legitimate offspring if they did you and khalid el bey were married under muslim law and in the eyes of the christian world that makes willow a bastard your good name your wealth and your power along with robbies generosity to willow have however protected her from that stigma nonetheless she must make the proper contacts for a suitable marriage and as the earl of lynmouths sister she will have the opportunity at court unless of course you propose a french marriage for her my nephew jeanantoine st justine is seeking an heiress he would be very good to her and very french skye responded no a frenchman is not right for willow she is an englishwoman to her toes and she needs an english husband then let her go to the tudor court skye how strange this all is she said we are not welcome there but the queen personally invites our children i wonder at it adam you are too suspicious little girl it never hurts to be too suspicious when dealing with the tudors mon mari skye warned him perhaps this is the queens way of making friendly overtures and eventually forgiving us why should she even be reminded of us skye mused robin is with her adam reasoned and then too this business of a french marriage for her and we are in france it is logical it is odd she answered him then she sat up and pulled away from him let us go tell the children that they may go before i am accused of breaking their hearts or worse before i change my mind skyes two eldest sons ewan and murrough oflaherty were married to geoffrey southwoods twin daughters on july th although the girls were not identical twins they chose to wear identical iceblue satin gowns embroidered in silver thread and clear crystals their lovely hair was unbound and fell to their hips and atop their heads they wore wreaths of white roses and fluffy babys breath the young earl of lynmouth proudly gave his halfsisters away in the church at archambault where the wedding was held it was not a large wedding the only guests being the family of the comte and comtesse along with skye and adams family tables were spread out over the lawns for the feasting afterward and following the dancing the young couples were put to bed with much teasing and hilarity on the next morning two bloody sheets hung from the two nuptial chambers at the château waving in the summer breeze as the two couples accompanied by their brother robin and their sister willow rode off to nantes to embark upon an omalley ship for bideford and ireland willow was torn between the wild excitement she felt over returning to england and joining the court and leaving the security and love of her mother and stepfather skye hadnt stop lecturing her eldest daughter since the decision had been made to allow willow to go you must beware of the young men at court believe me they will seek your virtue and that virtue along with your fortune are the only assets you possess to obtain a titled husband yes mama what you did in paris last winter was very good my darling never be alone with a young man lest you compromise your good name gossip can be such a vicious thing willow and even if it is not true it raises an element of doubt yes mama the queen prefers her maidens to be virtuous remember that yes mama do not lend money to anyone people will quickly know that you are an heiress and they will come begging you cannot afford to lend to anyone lest you offend someone else say that you have a small allowance and that barely enough to last until the next quarter dame cecily will be in charge of your funds willow and she will advance you nothing before you should have it so be advised you must live within your income i am sending you with more than enough clothes so what you will need monies for i know not still i would not have you penniless yes mama willow stifled a yawn her mother was being so tedious she had said these things a hundred times over the last few weeks you will listen to your brother robin hes three years younger than i am willow looked outraged nonetheless he has spent a good deal of his life at the tudor court he knows its ways and he knows the gossip pay heed to him willow for he would not have you shamed yes mama a final word about men willow oh mama do not oh mama me miss in this i have experience and you would do well to listen to me men can be utterly charming creatures when they seek to gain their own way with a girl when you are tempted to listen to some young gallant willow ask yourself if i give in to his pretty pleas will he still marry me is he in a position to marry me if he is why is he assaulting my virtue prior to our wedding night does he not respect the delicacies of my feelings enough to wait you will find willow that a decent young man will approach you through your brother or sir robert or the queen you do not have to settle for a relationship of stolen kisses in a dark corner what makes you trunk that i would mama willow demanded you are ever a practical little puss my darling skye said but you lack experience i only seek to share my experience with you so you will not be hurt willow flung herself at skye and hugged her hard oh mama i shall make you so proud of me i promise you i shall only have the most noble of husbands and i shall make the queen relent and allow you and adam to come home skye smiled through her tears and kissed her daughter tenderly i am going to miss you she said oh how i am going to miss you let us be off the earl of lynmouth fussed impatiently she has either learned her lessons mother or she has not willow has always been bright and i do not expect her to be an embarrassment to us skye next advised her eldest son to attempt to remain neutral in the continuing fight between the english and the irish it wont be easy she said but try to consider the long run you have a wife now and soon there will be children ewan all you have to offer them is ballyhennessey and its been oflaherty land for over three hundred years dont be driven by the hotheads or the church into losing your heritage my son it will come down to religion in the end mother i know that ewan but ask yourself this what difference does it make how you worship god as long as you worship him ask yourself why you should endanger your lands and your family because an italian pope and an english monarch cannot decide and argue over dogma is that why you never took sides mother your grandfather dubhdara omalley of sainted memory god assoil him taught me that the family came first ewan it has ever been thus with me i have not had as much of a hand in raising you as i would have wanted but you are my son you will do what you believe best and you will follow your conscience i do not envy you ewan ireland is a torn and angry land she held out her arms to him and walking into them he hugged her god speed my eldest skye said the others came then for their hugs and kisses while his young and impatient lordship the earl stood tapping an elegantly shod foot he had said his goodbyes privately as robin believed befit his dignity finally the others were ready and the three young women climbed into the coach the men were to ride leaning from the windows of the vehicle as it pulled away they waved happily to skye and adam behind them came a second larger coach containing the tiring women the valets and the luggage the household goods that the newly married young women would need had gone on to nantes several days earlier when the travelers had disappeared from view around the bend in the drive adam heaved a mighty sigh lets go home little girl he said and he helped her into the smaller waiting carriage skye climbed into the vehicle feeling terribly depressed her elder children were gone and her three youngest would be staying at archambault for several days visiting their cousins she sighed deeply as the carriage moved down the drive and onto the forest road back to belle fleur i am old she announced in a sad voice adam looked at his wifes beautiful woebegone face and began to chuckle have i domesticated you so sweetheart that you are that lost without your brood of chicks dont you understand she said my two eldest sons are married after last night their wives could already be with child my eldest daughter is off to court to seek a husband i could be a grandmother in a year i am old he began to laugh and pulling her into his arms he slipped a hand into her dress to capture a plump breast madame he said as he began to tease at her nipple you are a woman of maturity i will grant you but youve not yet attained your thirtyfourth birthday skye his fingers skillfully undid the laces on her bodice successfully freeing both her breasts god theyre beautiful he groaned burying his face in the valley separating them and covering her suddenly trembling flesh with hot kisses skye felt herself begin to grow tingly with the pleasure he was arousing in her her slender hand entangled itself in his thick black hair and began to slip softly down to the back of his neck to rub against the soft flesh if you think to turn my interest monseigneur she murmured with faint protest and then as his other hand slipped beneath her skirts and moved upward she cried out adam oh my darling what a shameless hussy you are old woman he teased her i am not old she said suddenly realizing how foolish she must have sounded and also realizing that she didnt feel one bit older now than she had at twenty feeling better she mischievously moved her hand to caress him and felt her heart quicken at the hard hungry length of him i shall never be old as long as i can do that to you my darling she whispered in his ear as she loosened his garments and released him roughly adam pulled her onto his lap raising her skirts to position her on his mighty lance with a gasp of delight she found he had taken the most complete possession of her her legs were over his thighs her feet pushing into the velvet upholstery of the carriage seat his arms were tightly about her as hers were about him and he was suddenly kissing her ardently his tongue fencing with hers while they rocked back and forth with the motion of the coach the sensation was one of complete rapture and skye cried out softly to her husband as the delicious warmth and excitement of his lovemaking began to fan a flame of incredible passion within her dazzled and stimulated body ohhh aaadam she breathed as the first small wave of pleasure swept over her and then oh oh oh as the full impact of the delight rendered her weak and satisfied and she fell against his chest panting his breathing was ragged in her ear but she was too weak to move for the minute finally as the wild beating of their hearts calmed he said softly havent you ever made love in a coach before little girl no though once geoffrey mentioned it as we came down from london in the end however he decided it was far more comfortable to do so in a bed she laughed softly remembering yes adam considered geoff was always one for his comforts as i recall tell me madame are you still feeling ancient and haggard i feel marvelous she enthused how quickly do you think you can make yourself presentable he queried why she snuggled against him because little girl belle fleur is in sight and i should hate to shock the footman who will open this coach door in a few moments with his amused aid she quickly scrambled off him and began relacing her bodice smoothing her skirts and her hair you had best see to your own dishabille monseigneur she teased him as his smoky eyes fastened upon her bosom how long are the children gone for little girl a fortnight she answered good he said i intend to spend all of that time with you my love and most of it in our bed it has been a long time it seems to me since we were alone and free to be lovers can we not ride and picnic in the forest she teased him only if you allow me to make love to you beneath the stately oaks her face softened and she whispered yes oh yes monmari just as their carriage clattered over the drawbridge and into the courtyard of the château adam de marisco was a man of his word and so for the next two weeks he and skye spent almost every waking and sleeping moment together it seemed to them both that they were more deeply and powerfully in love than they had ever been when the three youngest children returned adam took it upon himself to begin to instruct young padraic in the business of running an estate while deirdre began to follow after her mother learning all that was necessary to the running of a household of all her children skye noted deirdre was the quietest she seemed to learn with ease whatever she was taught be it the proper way to make soap and perfume or her latin she was a pretty child who looked very much like her mother but skye could only assume deirdres shyness came from all the time she had spent away from her mother in her early years now skye worked very hard to make up those years to her daughter still it was to adam that deirdre always went with her successes and her problems i dont think she likes me skye said to adam one day she is in awe of you he said and she fears you a little but i believe she loves you she loves me because i am her mother skye replied with keen insight but she does not like me i dont understand why i have tried so hard with her if you feel that way then why dont you ask her sweetheart best to get it out in the open rather than let whatever is disturbing her fester until it is blown so out of proportion that it cannot be controlled i will if you will be with me when i do no if we stand together while you attempt to interrogate deirdre she will feel we are allied against her and she will say nothing and deny all this must remain between you two it was not easy but skye finally screwed up her courage one afternoon in late summer as she and deirdre sat on the lakeside making daisy chains why is it you dislike me deirdre she asked bluntly for a moment deirdre burke looked startled and she slowly flushed a beetred then as bluntly as her mother had spoken she replied because you left padraic and me when you went off to your new marriage because when you finally brought us to you you sent us quickly away again promising to bring our real father back to us you never did mama before you married adam we had not a happy life and i cannot help but wonder how long it will be before you run off from us again with some excuse or another skye was shocked by the venom in her small daughters voice does your brother feel this way too she asked padraic says you love us it seems to be enough for him but not for you my daughter i can see your brother is right you know i do love you it never however occurred to me to explain to a baby the difficulties of my life deirdre if you had asked me when these things began to fret you i would have told you anything i felt you needed to know skye took her daughters resisting and stiff little form into her arms deirdre she said looking down into the childs cold and closed face i love you you are a child born of love the love that niall burke and i had for each other i will try not to ever go from you again although there will come a day when you go from me to marry you say you will try not to go from me but you must promise me you will not go deirdre i cannot skye said i have never lied to you and i will not lie now even to gain your approval i will try suddenly deirdre burst into tears her whole small face crumbling with her distress dont leave me mama dont leave me she begged her mother between sobs wordlessly skye took her daughter onto her lap and rocked her soothingly all the others had survived her travels but despite her stiff little spine deirdre was a creature easily bruised by life in a way skye thought she is much like niall despite the fact she looks like me i have no plans to go anywhere deirdre she said quietly do not weep my baby ill not leave you my precious one on michaelmas the servants were paid for the year but the nursemaid who had tended velvet since her birth found herself with child by a footman and was quickly married a new girl a plump cheerful lass from archambault village was found to replace the first nursemaid and velvet seemed to take to the change well but less than a week after the girl had been hired both she and the baby disappeared and could not be found both skye and adam were frantic afraid that the girl and her charge had fallen into the moat but they quickly discarded that thought for the château gatekeeper had seen margerie and the baby walking across the drawbridge and down the forest road a search was quickly made for fear that a wild animal had attacked the pair but no trace of them was found the search expanded to archambault and its village in the hopes that margerie had simply taken velvet on a visit without requesting permission but the girls family had not seen her her best friend in the village however came forward timidly to say that margerie had told her that she would soon have enough gold for a fine dowry and it would not come from drudging at belle fleur comte antoine could see that his big stepson was close to the breaking point and very desirous of shaking the informant until her teeth rattled taking the girl by the hand he gently said jeanne ma petite try and remember exactly what margerie said to you did she mention where she would get the gold for her dowry the peasant girl scrunched her brow in thought and then suddenly she grinned but of course msieur le comte margerie said she met a manthough he spoke our language she said she could tell he was a foreigner for his accent was something terrible he told her that he had heard that the petite velvet was the most beautiful child in christendom and if margerie would bring the baby to him to see with his own eyes he would give her six gold ecus jeanne finished trumphantly where was margerie to bring the baby the comte probed further to some inn at tours was the reply did margerie tell you the name of the inn jeanne no msieur le comte but gilleet the carter would know twas he who gave her a ride yesterday find the carter the comte ordered youre a good girl jeanne he said and then he dropped several pieces of silver down her bodice the carter who had only just returned was quickly brought before the comte and readily admitted having given margerie a ride from archambault to the nearby city of tours yes she had a little girl with her her sisters child for company she said he let her off at an inn le coq dor on the west side of the town adam the comte and his two sons immediately rode for tours when they returned several hours later to belle fleur adam carried with him a heavy sealed parchment addressed to skye with grim face he handed it to her skye broke the seal and tore the letter open for a moment she could not breathe and her vision blurred at the sight of the familiar hand the message was brief madam it began i have need of your services come immediately it was signed elizabeth r where did you get this skye demanded of her husband it was awaiting me on my arrival at le coq dor in tours it had been left by two gentlemen who arrived alone and departed with a nursemaid and a child the innkeeper said they took the nantes road and they left the parchment for whoever came looking for a woman and a child do you know who has our child skye handed adam the parchment that damned tudor bitch has velvet she has kidnaped our baby for god only knows what purpose but you may rest assured mon mari that that purpose will be to elizabeth tudors liking alone dear god i had thought to be quit of the tudors and all their ilk i will go to england adam said we will go to england skye amended she doesnt want you my darling she wants me but this time by god ill not be cowed by that bitch she holds velvet hostage in return for my aid but before shes through well have lands for ourself adam de marisco and lundy back and my burke son will be given back what belongs to him the queen will accept with good grace that we are truly and lawfully married and there will be no more talk of velvet not being legitimate skye adams voice held a warning it is my daughters life she holds in her hands do not trifle with velvets survival it is our daughter adam and believe me i would not allow any harm to come to velvet listen my darling the tudor queen quite obviously desperately needs my help needs it enough to try to insure that i will be forced to give it that is why she took velvet she knows that i will come after her but elizabeth tudor is no murderer of innocents she will not harm a hair on velvets head adam but i shall bargain hard this time we leave tonight i knew that you would leave me sooner or later deirdre cried entering the room and hearing only skyes last words leave you no ma fille you and your brother are coming with us we will stand before englands queen a family united deirdre i dont know if you are magnificent or a madwoman adam said as he put his arms about both his wife and his stepdaughter probably a little of both my darling for i dont even know what the queen wants perhaps i go to do battle for naught no skye this time you will not do battle against the queen alone this time your lord will stand by your side the queen has never had to face that whenever you have been vulnerable you have been alone this time you are not alone little girl they left belle fleur that night and it was with great sadness skye left their home behind the château would not however be closed and the comte would watch over it for his stepson while deirdre and young lord burke dozed in the traveling coach their parents rode knee to knee through the early autumn night a bright moon lit the coast road silvering the villages and the vineyards and the small stands of oak forests it took them two days of traveling at top speed to reach nantes where an omalley ship awaited them for skye had several of her vessels based in this french port to import wine to england and northern europe from the loire valleys famous vineyards even with a good wind it was several days sail from nantes to england the weather was good as they edged around the bay of biscay staying within sight of the french coast just past brest they swung around into the english channel to meet with a spanking sharp breeze from the south that pushed them across the water with greater rapidity than they had anticipated again they kept within sight of land and skye pointed out to her children the various landmarks as they went they passed the isle of wight and the great chalk cliffs of dover and at margate head moved into the thames sweeping up the river with the tide to the pool of london skye stood silently with adam at the rail of her ship as they anchored on the shore beyond they saw a small party of the queens guards my god adam said is she expecting us then shes expecting us skye said with a smile of satisfaction you have on your battle smile he chuckled i havent seen that look on your face since he thought i cant remember when for its been that long the last time i smiled like this was probably the last time the queen and i did battle once before i beat elizabeth tudor adam and i will defeat her again pray god that this time will be the last time part england and ireland chapter you play a dangerous game madam william cecil warned nay cecil elizabeth tudor replied tis no game i play at all you might simply have forgiven lord and lady de marisco their marriage and then asked for their help stealing their child is only bound to bring out the tigress in lady de marisco and you do remember the last time you incurred that ladys ire madam dont you it was never proven to our satisfaction that skye omalley was behind those piracies cecil hah the queens advisor snorted and then clamping his lips shut he said nothing more there was no arguing with elizabeth tudor once she had her mind made up and in this instance he wasnt sure she was not right it was really very unlikely that skye omalley would willingly help the english crown against her own marauding family they would need a strong hold over her and what was stronger than the bond of mother love the child is all right cecil she is at hampton court with her nursemaid and a proper little tartar she is i am told the queen chuckled i saw her the night that she was brought from france she is de mariscos image and i doubt not he loves her dearly tis another good card i have to play cecil the child is doted upon by both her parents cecil shook his head the seagull was sighted off margate head this afternoon ive dispatched some of your gentlemen pensioners to escort them here to greenwich you are too diligent my old friend the queen chided him there is no need to bring them to me for they will come of their own free will we will say my gentlemen are a guard of honor she laughed drily skye omalley will appreciate that cecil she has wit that damned woman she has great wit while the queen enjoyed her little joke sir christopher hatton captain of the gentlemen pensioners found himself on shipboard facing a woman he knew by reputation alone it was a confusing reputation for elizabeth tudor admired this woman and spoke of her with great respect while at the same time robert dudley earl of leicester claimed that the lady in question was a passionate drab who could not get enough of his loving hatton was inclined to dismiss leicesters boasting for the queen would hardly like any female or accept her at court if she was openly out to snare the earl my lord skye looked questioningly at hatton i am sir christopher hatton madam the queens captain i am here to escort you to greenwich and by what means sir christopher are you to escort me i see no coach nor do i see horses am i to walk perhaps behind your horse like a roman captive hatton shifted uncomfortably realizing he had forgotten to provide transport skye laughed easily do not fret sir christopher i have full intention of hieing myself to greenwich as quickly as possible but i have only just arrived after a hectic voyage i am going to my house on the strand to bathe and change my clothes before i see her majesty i will not present myself before the queen until then unless of course you have orders to drag me before her majesty immediately he had no such orders and hatton was totally nonplussed by this beautiful woman who seemed so in command of the situation of course lady burke lady de marisco my lord i was given to understand that you were the widow of lord niall burke madam sir christopher was further confused indeed sir and i am but lord burke died some time back and i remarried lord de marisco is my husband and has been for two and a half years now skye smiled sweetly would you care to come with us to greenwood my lord if the queen has ordered you to bring us to her you had best not appear back before her without us i will be happy to send a message to your men on shore the door to the main cabin opened and adam came in the barge is here sweetheart well sir christopher are you coming with us i can as easily ride madame if you will but tell me where greenwood is located it is on the river next to the earl of lynmouths house i will meet you there sir christopher said and then he beat a hasty retreat adam waited until he was sure the captain had gotten off the ship and then he chuckled youve frightened him to death skye not an easy task under normal circumstances i would imagine i see that though the queen still enjoys the virgin state her taste in handsome young men has not changed skye muttered the rumor is that he dances divinely adam guffawed perhaps skye said but there is a good mind ill wager behind those beautiful eyes of his bess tudor does not suffer fools within her inner circle with an impatient gesture she picked up her cloak let us go adam even though i know that our velvet is safe i want to know what this is all about where are the children gone on ahead in the first barge he answered her slipping the cape over her shoulders bending he held her a moment against him and kissed her gently on the cheek dont worry sweetheart well soon have our little one back the greenwood barge took them swiftly up the river to skyes london town house mignon had been left behind in france with guillaume for they were too old to travel to england and belonged at archambault where both had been born and spent their whole lives i shall have to train a new tiring woman skye thought irritably as they arrived at the landing but who was that coming down the lawn wildly waving mlady mlady oh dear mistress skye welcome home skye stopped and her eyes teared briefly as daisy came running up to her for a moment the two women stared at each other and then they were hugging frantically what on earth are you doing here daisy she exclaimed they broke apart and daisy explained when dame cecily told me that you were coming home i knew you would need me mlady old mistress kelly brans mum came to live with us over a year ago when her man died and the english landlord took her cottage my babes have given her a new lease on life twas she who insisted i come up to london the youngest babys weaned and dont need me anymore come along now for youve been at sea several days and i know youll want your bath she turned her gaptoothed smile on adam ive brought with me that pirate kipp who always served you on lundy mlord they took everyone off the island yknow good lord adam exclaimed i didnt think theyd touch my people what happened to them daisy the bailiff at lynmouth made room mlord they had gained the house now and as they climbed the stairs skye said ill have to hurry a bit daisy for the queen is expecting me even now ah daisy smiled i knew youd be back in her favor quick enough entering her apartments skye said grimly im not in the queens good graces at all daisy and id not be in england except that she stole our daughter oh daisy wait until you see velvet de marisco she is the most perfect little girl but why would she steal your child mlady daisy began to undress her mistress she seems to want my help in some matter daisy and felt i would not give it to her unless she had some sort of strong hold over me she will not recognize my marriage to lord de marisco because we did not ask her permission but it has mattered not to us we have a beautiful home belle fleur in france i did not think the queen could touch us daisy frowned i wonder she mused aloud what do you wonder skye replied climbing into the perfumed tub and settling down into the water im wondering if its about your brothers tell me what you know daisy theyre wild mlady every one of them ive heard bran say it a dozen times a day when you ran your family the omalleys prospered and kept the peace but your brothers have almost run through everything you built up for them and they harry the english each chance they get they deliberately bait them mlady and taunt them something fierce and you know the difficulties in ireland are bad enough without that their mother the lady anne has tried to control them but she hasnt the strength they laugh at her advice and then gift her with things theyve stolen from their raids and tell her not to worry but she does fret and shell not keep a thing they give her still there is naught that she can do about them they are too strong for her skye nodded with understanding her brothers were proud and stubborn irishmen with hot heads and no sense she had left their raising to their mother for it was indeed annes responsibility after dubhdara omalley died but anne omalley was a gentle woman with a kind heart who had no real strength of her own what have the omalleys been doing to irritate the queen daisy it cant simply be that my fool halfbrothers have reverted to the piracies of my father bran says theyve joined with your kinswoman grace omalley to fight the english came the reply fools skye muttered shes a fascinating woman bran says she is indeed skye said shes from the nobler and more powerful branch of my family the omalleys of clare island shes even married to a burke as i was her husband is a distant cousin of nialls shes a dangerous woman though daisy she believes herself a patriot shes fought the english since her youth and ive no doubt shell fight them right to the moment of her death in one sense i admire her courage and her determination but i have a cooler head than grace and she cannot win over england no matter the right of her cause she does not see this however and if she were only responsible for her own life i should not argue how she live it but she drags others into her schemes if elizabeth tudor wants my aid in preventing my brothers from joining with grace omalley then she shall have it daisy i will not allow them to destroy everything i have worked and sacrificed for since our father may god assoil him left the responsibility of the omalleys of innisfana to me daisy said nothing but she saw the gleam of battle in her mistresss eyes with a hidden smile she washed skyes hair thinking that it was good to be back here with her lady she loved her bairns but wiping their runny noses and wet bottoms was dull stuff compared to serving skye omalley there was a knock at the door and a housemaid appeared to say sir christopher hatton awaits you mlady tell sir christopher that i am in my bath skye said mischievously and that i shall attend him eventually then see that he and his men have plenty of wine beef and bread yes mlady the housemaid bobbed a curtsey and was gone it will be at least two hours before youre ready daisy said i make it closer to three skye said calmly and the tiring woman giggled youll want to eat while your hair is drying aye but sparingly enough to take the edge off my appetite so that my stomach doesnt grumble while im with the queen but not enough to spoil my appetite should we be asked to stay for the evening meal bread cheese and some good devon cider mlady aye and a bit of ham too daisy bring enough for two for my lord will be hungry also daisy helped skye from the tub and carefully and thoroughly dried her mistress off before wrapping her in a long quilted velvet gown to ward off the chill of the autumn afternoon next she toweled all the water from skyes hair and settled her mistress by the fireplace to brush her own locks dry while she hurried downstairs to the kitchens to fetch the food when adam came through the connecting door between their rooms skye never even looked up as she continued brushing her hair by the fire youre glad to be back in england arent you she said hearing his soft happy humming aye sweetheart he admitted coming to sit across from her he loved watching her do simple feminine things ive sent daisy for food hatton and his men already wait below but ill not come down until im clean and fed if i have to deal with the queen id best do it from a position of strength daisy thinks its my brothers the four of them have managed to run through the wealth i spent years building up for the omalleys and now theyve joined forces with my hotheaded kinswoman grace omalley to harry the english theyve not their older sisters wisdom he said quietly ah adam she answered i would have the english out of ireland too but i know that it will take more than the omalleys to do it that is the problem with the irish they cannot unite and as long as they cant the english will hold ireland whether the irish desire it or not it is our weakness my love for ireland is a land where every man is a king i am not the stuff of which martyrs or heroines are made and ill not sacrifice everything ive fought for and built up for that elusive willothewisp called irish independence even if they got it theres not one man they could all agree on to make king right now the irish arent even serious in what they do tis the fighting they enjoy no matter the widows and orphans they make no matter the misery they cause the famine the children dying from lack of decent shelter all that counts for naught in the face of glorious battle with those who sporadically lead the rebellions they switch sides with the regularity of a whore entertaining her customers each of them always seeking a better position over his neighbor and joining with his neighbors enemies if he cant maintain his own superiority alone tis a wicked game adam and ill have none of it but if you openly join with the english skye your own people will consider you a traitor they are too simple to understand the complexities of the situation do you understand that sweetheart i have no intention of joining the english adam i am the omalley of innisfana no matter my halfbrothers they cannot take from me that which our father gave me they must obey me or be outlawed among their own and i do not believe that they have the stomach for being cast out by their own people what i shall do will have nothing to do with politics be they english or irish what i do i will do for the survival of my family and that is all will you tell the queen that he asked amused skye laughed softly let bess tudor think what she will for i shall not let her know that i intend to stop my brothers no matter what if she thinks i do her a service so much the better for us adam you dont intend to be one bit repentant about us do you adams dark eyebrows waggled with amusement what difference should our marriage have made to her skye demanded irritably neither you nor i are of any importance to the english crown dynastically we have never been permanent members of the court the only time i followed the court was when geoffrey was alive she may say whatever she will but she has no excuse for denying our marriage or calling our daughter a bastard we were married by a priest of the holy catholic church and though the queen may deny the church dominion in england before her own authority she has never denied the right of the mother church in spiritual matters no matter the protestants and their clamor what a pity adam said that you and elizabeth tudor cannot be friends you have that sharpness of intellect that the queen admires she needs too much fawning upon adam and i have not the patience neither have you for that matter would you really enjoy spending your days dancing in constant attendance upon a very stubborn lady in her middle years she would give us no time for ourselves adam and i for one could not abide that skye gave her head a final touch and putting the brush aside she flung her hair back with a graceful motion there she said tis finished and i hear daisy coming open the door for her my darling with pleased confusion and a rosy blush daisy reentered the bedchamber carrying a heavy tray of food oh mlord thank you tis nothing lass and it is good to see your pretty face again he answered the tiring woman gallantly daisy flushed again with pleasure and said ive brought cider for you mlady but i knew his lordship would appreciate some good nutbrown english ale tis a while ill wager since hes tasted it she set the tray down on the table by the fireplace as they drew their chairs forward daisy lass youve the soul of an angel and the heart of a loyal englishwoman adam exclaimed my stepfather may bottle some of frances finest wines but i far prefer honest english ale thank you lass he said and bending from his great height he gave her a hearty buss on the cheek ohh mlord daisy grew redder and then she scolded sit down mlord and eat the queen will be in a fine tearing temper as it is the tray that daisy had brought them contained thick slices of bread upon which had been set slices of pink ham and wedges of good english cheddar that had then been toasted the cheese was yet soft and burning and the meal delicious to their taste in its simplicity when the last crumb had been eaten and the ale and cider all drunk they sat back for a minute in their chairs smiling across the small table at one another another knock at the door brought them the news that sir christopher and his men were growing restive i suppose we must get dressed and attend the queen skye said i think so little girl adam replied rising from the table and walking across the room to the connecting door between their rooms with a grin he blew her a kiss before reentering his own quarters a delighted smile touched her lips and then skye rose with a lazy yawn is the black sapphire gown still in fashion daisy aye mlady ill fetch it immediately it took almost a full hour for skye to dress completely but when she had finished she was well pleased with the results the blue velvet of the gown was so dark it seemed almost black in color it had a low squarish neckline trimmed with two loops of pearls that were sewn in such a fashion as to outline her bosom from the sides of the neckline protruded a fanshaped neckwisk of delicate gold lace and the full gold beribboned sleeves had beautiful matching cuff ruffs of the same lace the overgown was plain the undergown of the same material and color heavily decorated in pearls gold beads and golden threads that had been sewn in an intricate pattern of flowers bees and butterflies the bodice was done more simply being decorated only with pearls skyes hair was gracefully fixed by daisy into its elegant chignon and dressed with loops of almost pinkish pearls she wore a strand of matching pearls about her neck from which bobbed one enormous sapphire teardrop that nesded between her full breasts there were pearls in her ears and even her dainty handkerchief was edged in the jewels the buckles on her velvet shoes were carved from mother of pearl and her heels had been covered in the iridescent shell with a smile skye pirouetted for her husband as he entered the bedchamber what think you mlord am i formidable enough to discomfit the queen aye little girl and make her jealous as well he struck a pose and what of me madam do you approve my costume am i fit to be by your side aye mlord she said with heartfelt admiration taking in his black velvet costume the doublet of which was outrageously and heavily decorated in diamonds and gold thread about his neck adam had chosen to wear the de marisco pendant a large round golden medallion with a raised sea hawk wings spread done in enameled colors with a ruby eye between his great size and the complete fashion of his costume he was really quite magnificent are you ready madam he demanded noting with some amusement that despite the richness of her jewels she had chosen to wear upon her hands only his betrothal and wedding rings her subtlety delighted him and he knew the queen would notice for elizabeth tudor rarely missed a thing as he watched them descend the staircase to the main floor of the house sir christopher hatton caught his breath they were a simply stunning pair and the queens captain could not help but wonder why they had never been to court in his time he caught skyes hand as she reached the bottom step and raising it to his lips he said with total honesty madam you are more than well worth the waiting for if my lord de marisco you will allow me the compliment to your wife we accept the compliment in the spirit in which it was given sir adam said softly the footmen hurried up with their capes and skye and adam were enveloped in the furlined cloaks skyes with a furtrimmed hood escorted by hatton they hurried outside into the crisp wind of the late afternoon and climbed into their waiting town coach immediately the door was shut upon them they were off their carriage surrounded and escorted on the road to greenwich by the queens own gentlemen pensioners where in hell is she elizabeth tudor swore for the hundredth time that afternoon her damned ship anchored hours ago where is hatton this is intolerable cecil patience madam counseled william cecil lord burghley she will be here shortly he already knew that skye omalley that marvelous and impossible woman had gone to her house on the strand he knew exactly what she was doing but in this particular instance he had no intention of informing his mistress for elizabeth would only fly into a temper and her anger could ruin everything lady de marisco was as stubborn as the queen cecil smiled to himself he had thought of skye omalley as lady de marisco and indeed despite the queens petulance in the matter she was that he knew would be the first order of business between them cecil smiled to himself again and a small chuckle escaped his lips it was going to be an interesting evening what do you find so amusing elizabeth snapped but before lord burghley was forced to answer there was a knock upon the door and a maid of honor popped through it to announce lord and lady de marisco are here madam elizabeth whirled surely mistress ann you mean lady burke and lord de marisco the queen snarled yyes madam your pardon the maid of honor quavered she was going to be in a great deal of trouble if the queen found out about her liaison with lord dudley and lettice knollys the bitch had seen them and was threatening to tell they may come in elizabeth said regally and quickly sat down in a highbacked thronelike chair as quickly she stood again remembering the height of her guests and not wanting to be at any disadvantage cecil knowing her thought hid a smile behind his hand as skye and adam swept into the room by god lord burghley thought at his first sight of them this time she has truly found her mate well not beat her now skyes gaze met that of elizabeth tudor and neither of them wavered then skye curtseyed low and prettily as by her side her husband bowed with incredibly elegant flair a flair not missed by the queen who appreciated such graces and good manner i have said more than once lord de marisco that you were wasted upon that island of yours you are indeed a man fit for my court adam smiled warmly thank you madam but if i had my choice i should prefer my rock to your court i am a simple man and such radiance is too overpowering for me i far prefer the quiet life but your choice of companion sir is indeed not conducive to peace and a quiet life the queen looked defiantly at skye as i have said madam i am a simple man simple men follow their hearts and i have followed mine as i know you would follow yours were the burden of england not upon your frail shoulders how fortunate your people are in their queen and are you lord de marisco fortunate in your queen you have my loyalty madam until death but not your heart no madam not my heart for i cannot give what i no longer possess i long ago gave my heart to skye omalley i could clap you in the tower for that remark lord de marisco i could send you both there but i suspect it would not make one bit of difference to either you or that celtic jade you have married in france in a popish ceremony a small grin teased at the corners of adams mouth and he strove mightily to keep it from bursting into full bloom madam i must plead guilty and i must beg your forgiveness and your indulgence for both my wife and myself but in all honesty neither skye nor i would change anything we have done elizabeth tudor burst out laughing and with surprising familiarity she gave adam a friendly punch on the arm that my lord is what i like about you she exclaimed you are just what you seem and there is no deceit in you very well you are forgiven your marriage for i am forced to admit that looking at the pair of you i can see you are meant to be together she turned to skye as for you madam we have other more pressing business first i want my daughter skye said bluntly what madam you would bargain with me elizabeth looked outraged would you not bargain with me skye demanded why else have you taken my daughter the child is safe at hampton court madam she will be returned to you when the queen looked at skye closely and then sighing said i will send a messenger out tonight your word is not enough madam came the shocking reply adam put a hand on his wifes arm in warning while cecil thought for a moment his heart had stopped it was a fierce insult and elizabeth tudors grayblack eyes narrowed in anger at that moment she looked very much like her father madam must i remind you that you are my subject and i am your queen you are the queen of england madam but i am irish to protect my burke sons lands i did you a favor a great favor madam i left my homeland and my children to marry for englands sake the husband you chose for me madam was a cruel and unhappy man but i offered no complaint for you promised me that you would protect padraic burkes lands and his rights you have given those lands to an englishman madam my son is bereft of his heritage despite your promise to me skye looked defiantly at elizabeth tudor i kept my word to you madam would that you had done the same you are a thorn in my flesh skye omalley the queen said and you have ever been thus but i need your aid now and i will have it return what belongs to me and mine madam and you shall have that aid i want my child the burke lands and lundy island in return i shall do your bidding your child i will send for this night the burke lands i cannot return for fear of offending a loyal englishman who serves me well but i will give your son lands here in england as for lundy i return it with one stipulation you may not live on it either of you ill give you no island base from which to strike out at me again i will however my lord de marisco give you lands and a manor house of equal value for i suspect that in marrying this termagent you have actually done me a service my son is an irish burke skye cried for despite the fact that she knew the queen was being overly generous she ached at the loss of padraics inheritance precisely madam and by resettling him here in england as a child i shall have one less rebel to contend with in my old age for he will grow up to be a loyal englishman i have no doubt elizabeth tudor laughed at the irony of her victory over skye now madam i have done much for you you must in return do something for me give over little girl adam said softly youll not beat her in this shes been generous where she might have been harsh skye looked up at him and he saw the sadness in her eyes which were wet with diamond tears she would not shed you cannot always win skye he said and she nodded this time their battle was a draw very well madam she answered but her very agreement was edged in defiance what can i do to help you your brothers and the omalley fleet have joined with that great rebel your kinswoman grace omalley to wage war against me they harry the shipping lanes which hurts this nations commerce and they encourage rebellion in ireland it is impossible madam to stop them for they are i am forced grudgingly to admit marvelous sailors i sent drake to ireland a year ago and even he cannot catch them you could you could stop your brothers madam and if you do you will cripple grace omalley that woman is a menace to england and i would have her stopped skye pretended to consider the queens request and then she said if i can stop my brothers madam i will need pardons for them all i will not betray my family even for englands queen granted then i shall try madam skye said with feigned innocence you had best succeed madam came the sharp warning i can only do my best madam then god help your brothers the queen cackled her good humor suddenly restored she peered closely at skye you took your time in getting here madam i was told that your ship arrived at midmorning i could not appear travelworn before englands majesty madam i went home and took a bath came the calm reply you kept me waiting while you frolicked in your bath elizabeth was outraged i should have done your majesty no honor had i not bathed and attired myself in my finest clothes madam i am not so ill bred as to arrive before you smelling of sweat and the sea you claim to do me honor madam and yet i sense that you actually defy me elizabeth grumbled but enough you will stay for the evening meal and you will tell me about the duc dalençon he seeks to marry me yknow in france they speak of nothing else skye said demurely elizabeth tudor preened and then with girlish enthusiasm asked what is he really like he is an amusing man madam i believe you would find him quite compatible amusing he has wit majesty or at least as much wit as any son of catherine de medici could have they say he is badly pockmarked he grows a beard even now to disguise it madam he is an attractive man and a great favorite with the ladies cecil listened to skye and marveled one moment she gave to the queen and in the next instant she took away the duke was charming but he was his mothers son he was pockmarked but handsome he longed to be with elizabeth but the ladies of the french court would be desolate when he left them cecil smiled this woman was definitely the queens equal but that was a thought he would keep to himself leaving the queens closet they adjourned to the dining hall where the court was awaiting the arrival of elizabeth tudor the queen had now transferred her attentions to adam and skye was left to herself as fair as ever a displeasingly familiar voice murmured in her ear and robert dudley the earl of leicester came around her into her view as lecherous as ever ive not a doubt she returned irritated as his eyes plunged boldly to fasten on her breasts you look as if you would eat me my lord is there not meat enough at the queens board to satisfy you only you could ever satisfy me skye only you my lord could ever revolt me so much with your want of delicacy ah you celtic bitch as always your refusal of my passions ignites me with desire he exclaimed backing her against the wall his arms pinioned her while his head dipped to press hot wet kisses across the tops of her breasts remembering a similar situation of several years earlier skye thought with a wicked little smile the fool never learns and then she brutally jammed her knee into the earl of leicesters groin she was rewarded by instant release and the silly pained surprised look upon his face calmly straightening her gown skye pushed past him saying dudley i cant believe you dont remember our last encounter of this nature i would also remind you that the last time you accosted me you were rather violently removed from my house by lord de marisco he was only my friend then now he is my husband and a most doting husband at that i would that you think on it before you approach me again then with a polite mocking curtsey she moved from the shadows and up to the queens table where a place had been made for her robert dudley swore and then swore again as he heard low laughter near his car hatton say one word of what you saw and i swear i shall run you through he hissed through gritted teeth sir christopher hatton chuckled with pleased laughter i would not have believed it my lord he jibed at the earl did you not tell me yourself that she was a passionate little drab and quite hot for you by god dudley i should hate to see a woman who didnt like you laughing merrily he moved off leaving the earl most discomfited after the meal there was dancing and although skye would have far preferred to leave greenwich and return to her house she could not depart until the queen had left and elizabeth tudor it seemed was full of energy and as merry as may this night she danced with verve and more with sir christopher than any other man in the room remembering adams teasing remark about hatton dancing divinely skye had to admit that he was the best dancer she had ever seen and seeing dudley sulking on the sidelines gave her great pleasure good even mama robin said coming up to stand beside her skye turned and with a pleased smile gave her son a swift kiss you are not surprised to see me she asked the queen told us some weeks ago that you would be returning to court mama did she also tell you the manner of her invitation to us robin the young earl looked puzzled i dont understand he said the queens agents kidnaped velvet skye said quietly gods nightshirt do not use such language robin the mother in skye scolded your pardon mama but i was so surprised by your disclosure i could not help myself is velvet all right so the queen assures me although i have insisted that my baby be returned immediately velvet is at hampton court why your uncles in ireland are causing difficulties and the queen wants my aid in suppressing their high spirits robin laughed the irish are always causing trouble he said matteroffactly this is serious skye said and i would remind you my lord earl that you are half irish by blood yes madam robin replied quietly but my heart and my loyalties are all english yes robin they are i have raised you to be your fathers son i might have done otherwise i however am irish but i do not condone these useless rebellions in which your uncles have involved themselves and i must stop them before they do any serious damage to the family the young earl nodded he understood the difficulty of his mothers position i am sure that the queen has not hurt velvet he said no she has not but nonetheless it was a terrible thing to do to us i have however exacted my price in return for my aid the queen has recognized our marriage both adam and your brother padraic have been given estates and lundy has been returned to us padraic has his lands back not in ireland the queen would not give him back the burke lands robin saw the sadness in his mothers eyes and he put a hand on hers saying i am sorry mother but at least we are now less a house divided and for that i am glad where is willow skye asked her son changing the subject for she could no longer think of padraics loss without weeping look for the earl of alcester mama robin said wherever he is willow will be gods blood skye swore did i not warn her about involving herself with a man tis not willow who has involved herself with alcester but rather the other way around robin said with a smile he is quite smitten with her and in a position to offer marriage mama tell me james lord edwardes earl of alcester robin began aged twentyfour a widower with one child a daughter educated well mannered neither drinks nor gambles to excess he seems to enjoy the ladies but is no lecher im told i rather like him mama and willow for all her hoitytoity ways likes him too although she hasnt given the poor fellow the least encouragement robin chuckled a sophisticated sound far beyond his years skye thought hes rather shy i think what of his family skye demanded for this young man surely had a family who would object to their sons marriage to a young woman not of the nobility his parents are both dead mama he has a paternal grandmother i am told but no one else of note what of his finances surely there is some gossip about that hes not rich mama but neither is he a pauper i have been told that his estate is small but well kept here robin made his voice even lower he doesnt know the extent of willows wealth mama no one at court does for she hasnt been here that long besides willow is rather closemouthed about her affairs and spends very little of her allowance skye smiled with satisfaction her daughter was being quite discreet and that was all to the good she looked about the room and finally spotted willow standing amid a group of laughing young people how lovely she looked in her garnetred velvet gown and how delighted khalid would have been with her the doting mother couldnt help thinking which one is alcester she asked robin the young man by her right elbow skye let her gaze assess her daughters wouldbe suitor he was a pleasantlooking young man of medium height with light brown hair he was well built and his young face had an intelligent and kindly look to it introduce me she commanded robin robin offered his mother his arm and led her across the floor to where his sister stood with her friends suddenly willow saw them coming and her eyes lit up joyfully breaking away from the group she ran the few steps between them mama skye enfolded her daughter into her arms and hugged her tightly i have missed you these weeks she said and how lovely you look tonight my precious i see you are wearing nicolass pearls and how pretty they look on you mama skye looked up and then moving away from willow she saw robin with the earl of alcester yes robin she said feigning surprise mama i would present to you lord james edwardes the earl of alcester my lord my mother lady de marisco alcester caught her hand and raising it to his lips kissed it lady de marisco it is my pleasure now i know where mistress willow gets her beauty really alcester willow said flushing with pleasure though her voice was sharp with pretended annoyance i am said to look like my father both you and your mother have dark hair poor alcester protested quite true my lord skye agreed how astute of you to notice it and as for you willow surely i have taught you better manners his lordship offered you a compliment thank him and accept it graciously skye smiled at her daughter then at the earl now she said you will excuse me for i must find my husband willow we are at greenwood for several days and then we must go to ireland please come to see us skye kissed her daughter and then smiling again at alcester she bid him farewell finding adam she remained with him until the queen had left and they were free to depart for greenwood as they rode back to their house she told him of willows suitor i think we will be approached by his lordship before we leave for ireland find out what you can about the young man robins information is encouraging what does willow think of him adam queried i have not had the opportunity to find out but i suspect from what i have seen she is not averse to his suit we shall see i will never force her to a husband as my father forced me to dom oflaherty adam put his arm around his wife all that was long ago sweetheart we will be certain it is what willow wants neither skye nor adam had the opportunity to check further on the earl of alcester however for the following afternoon he arrived unannounced at greenwood i hope you will forgive what must seem a lack of manners on my part he apologized but i understand that you will not be staying in london long and i wished to speak with you about willow indeed sir be seated adam invited the earl who sat down on the edge of a chair what is it you wish i want to marry your daughter sir the earl said willow is my stepdaughter my lord she is my wifes child by her second marriage to a spanish nobleman why is it you wish to wed with my daughter my lord skye asked quietly alcester flushed and then said as quietly because i love her madam i do not see how you can love her my lord though i doubt not your good intentions you have known willow but a short time my daughter and i are very close and she has not written me of you nor has she said anything about her affections being engaged madam willow is the most discreet of maidens from the moment she arrived at court i could see she was different from the others she is chaste where many are not she is kind and devout and intelligent i worship the very ground she walks upon and i would make her my wife if my lord adam said we were to consider your suitand mind you we will do so only should willow approvewhat dowry would you ask i am not a wealthy man my lord the earl replied but i am not povertystricken i can provide comfortably for a wife whatever dowry you wish to offer i will accept you are not aware then that my daughter is an heiress my lord skye looked closely at james edwardes an heiress the earl of alcester looked dumbfounded i ddid not know madam studying the young mans face skye decided that he was telling the truth willows father was a wealthy man my lord and she is also the heiress to her godfather sir robert small should she agree to entertain your suit a generous dowry will be set aside for you but the bulk of my daughters wealth must remain in her hands if you are willing to agree to that then we shall speak with willow do you control your own wealth madam i had heard the rumor that it was so i do my lord and it has always been thus since my first marriage a man is entitled to his dowry but a woman is also entitled to have her own monies so she may not be beholden to anyone you have noted that willow is an intelligent girl and so she is intelligent enough to know how to invest her capital for i have taught her and so has sir robert if you will trust her she will increase her wealth unusual as it is madam i will agree to your terms for i truly do love willow there are others madam like the countess of shrewsbury bess of hardwick who control their own wealth if shrewsbury can live with it then surely i can he smiled mischievously and seeing his smile for the first time skye thought that the earl was a most handsome young man besides madam willow is far prettier than bess of hardwick i should certainly hope so willow exclaimed coming through the door of the morning room good day mama papa alcester what are you doing here he has come to ask for your hand in marriage willow skye answered thinking that her daughter was perhaps a trifle too pert i am not sure you are old enough however mama willow shrieked and blushing she turned to james edwardes mama is not teasing you really want to marry me the earl looked down at willow with a tender expression in his brown eyes my dear i have wanted to marry you from the moment i first set eyes on you will you have me willow i will do my best to make you happy boldly he drew her close to him and gazed into her face looking up at him willow whispered oh james i did not dare to hope yes oh yes i shall be so proud to be your wife the earl bent to kiss willow and skye felt adam reach for her hand she looked at him and he saw the tears in her eyes he knew her thoughts in that moment she was thinking of willows father khalid el bey he would be proud of her adam said softly yes she answered him he would be proud of her and then skye thought of how she had kept willow safe all these years safe to reach adulthood to marry a fine young man like james edwards yes khalid would be content willow looked positively radiant all rosy with blushes and the earl was suddenly very sure of himself and totally masculine skye and adam both smiled at the young couple and then skye spoke you cannot be married until next spring after willows fifteenth birthday she said and you must have the queens permission she becomes i have found most irritable when not kept informed with regard to the lives of her courtiers the earl nodded and then turned to adam when would you like to sign the betrothal agreements my lord not until after the queen has given her permission alcester we will not give elizabeth tudor the chance to spoil your happiness by claiming that she was not informed from the very beginning the queen was told that evening that the widowed earl of alcester wished to marry mistress willow small a maid of honor looking at the pair elizabeth tudor was strangely touched usually the defection of one of her maids was cause for a temper tantrum and in the short time willow had been at court the queen had grown fond of the young girl still willows innocence was unquestionable and alcester was known to be an honorable man if i give my permission the queen said when would the marriage be celebrated madam and she looked at skye not until after willows birthday next april majesty came the calm reply the queen nodded it was a respectable amount of time for a proper betrothal period i am happy to give my permission for your daughter to wed with the earl of alcester lady de marisco i shall expect to be invited to the wedding provided that you have settled things in ireland by then i shall do my best madam skye said demurely not for the world would she spoil willows good fortune there was a knock at the door of the queens closet where they had been gathered and elizabeth called out her permission to enter the door opened to reveal sir christopher hatton who was carrying something in his arms you sent for this majesty give it to lady de marisco the queen commanded hatton handed his bundle to skye and with pounding heart she took it as the woolen cloak fell away to reveal the sleeping velvet oh my baby she whispered as adam leapt to her side with a soft oath to gaze down at their daughter with a gentle ringer he touched velvets pink cheek and the baby opened her blue eyes to sleepily murmur papa at him now madam elizabeth said you have your daughter back when do you leave for ireland as soon as i have settled my children majesty the queen who knew that little velvet was her godchild chucked the baby under the chin and said court is no place for my goddaughter i assume that you will send her to devon but what of young mistress burke and her brother would you allow them to remain here at court lord burke may join my pages and his sister would be safe in the countess of lincolns household skye knew that elizabeth tudor was demanding her children as hostages for her success in ireland lord burke she said i know would be thrilled to take his place among your pages madam and with his brother the earl to watch over him i know he would be safe my daughter deirdre however is another matter although i feel she would be better off with the countess she carries a fear of being separated from me again might we leave that decision up to her the queens face softened with sympathy she understood the fears of a lonely child well having been motherless since age three of course she agreed if mistress deirdre wishes to go with you i will understand much to skyes surprise deirdre wanted to stay with geraldine fitzgerald the lovely countess of lincoln like her sister and her brothers the little girl was fascinated by the tudor court it was one thing to be left with an elderly uncle or aunt but to be left at court was quite another matter skye felt almost betrayed and grumbled indignantly adam however found the whole thing amusing on one hand and very fortuitous on the other your mission is a serious one sweetheart he said it is better we not be encumbered by the children i fear not the queens captivity but in ireland it could be dangerous for them to be used as pawns she knew that he was right and so they drove down to devon where velvet was left safely at wren court with dame cecily told of willows betrothal dame cecily burst into tears sobbing that she was so very very happy for her baby i cant believe shes old enough to wed the good woman wept joyously twas only yesterday i was changing her nappies skye smiled to herself as she patted her old friend comfortingly willow she thought amused would be simply mortified to be reminded of such a thing she reassured dame cecily that james edwardes was a wonderful man and the perfect husband for willow then skye took the opportunity to see daisys two small sons both looked like their father but for their gaptoothed smiles which were their inheritance from their mother the de mariscos did not stay long in devon though departing the day after their arrival for innisfana island on the west coast of ireland the ancestral home of skye omalley skye had taken the precaution to send a message on ahead calling her brothers into a family council she knew that were they not on innisfana they would be easy to reach for grace omalleys sailors never ventured far from ireland it had been a long while since she had seen them over five years and in that time they had squandered everything she had built up for the omalleys since her fathers death she knew that her gentle and softspoken stepmother had exercised no control over her four sons but why had she allowed them to take up with grace omalley she knew her brothers well enough to know that they were not patriots she could only conclude that they had joined with grace simply for the fun of a little hellraising it was not harmless fun however skye thought and had her own family not been so intimately involved she would have let her halfbrothers pursue their own destructive course she had no future in ireland and neither now did any of her children she agreed with elizabeth tudor who had said there is only one christ jesus and one faith the rest is a dispute about trifles she and the queen would never be friends but skyes loyalty was never seriously questioned for her views were erastian enough to protect her they sailed south into st georges channel around cape clear and north to innisfana it was november now and the northerlies were sweeping down the atlantic from the arctic still the sky was clear and although cold it was pleasant sailing only once did they see another sail on the horizon but that was from a ship inward bound to england from the new world and they did not pass within hailing distance of each other skye owned eight ships and they were all with her having by fortunate coincidence been in england at this time when she needed them like all the omalley ships they were sleek and built for speed as well as cargo each one was well armed in order to defend itself and as a fleet they were a powerful weapon particularly since they had added more cannon as they were carrying no cargo this time several days before they sailed skye had assembled all her crews and spoken quite frankly to them about why she was going home and the fact that they might find themselves in a fight about half her men were irish and she offered them the opportunity to remain in port and take passage on other vessels rather than fight their own people bran kelly spoke for the irish were your men and our loyalty is to you the omalley weve all got family in ireland most of our people on innisfana or oflaherty lands if yer brothers cause more trouble with the english its our women and children wholl bear the brunt of their vengeance there came a chorus of ayes as the irish nodded and whispered among themselves wed just as soon stick by you mlady bran continued and the rest of the men again nodded their agreement there was little to do on the voyage and skye spent a good deal of time pacing restlessly about the decks or leaning over the bow rail staring hard ahead into the endless horizon she disliked dissension and because she must reassert her clan authority upon her brothers she was going to cause much dissension within her family she wondered how anne would react would she agree with her stepdaughter or would she side blindly with her beloved sons dammit skye said aloud it was not up to me to raise them why could anne have not been strong adam stood behind his wife his strong arms wrapped about her lithe form you judge people by your own yardstick skye he said softly most women are not strong like you they are meek gentle creatures who rely upon their men for everything including their very thoughts anne omalley has been widowed for sixteen years now her whole life has been the memory of your father and her boys my dear brothers who have all been spoiled rotten and obviously have no sense of responsibility skye fussed i sent them to the sea to learn its ways and i saw that they were taught to read and to write and to do their numbers yet they waste everything i have built up for them and they play at rebellion without a care for their families or their people in das time a man might be a freebooter without incurring the royal wrath but times have changed yes little girl you see that for you are out in the world but your brothers have never left ireland and have no desire to do so change is slow in coming to your green and misty land skye your people are a hundred years behind england and you know it skye pressed her lips tightly in a narrow line of disapproval there was no use talking for talk would change nothing adam was right ireland was behind the times she sighed deeply with regret and wondered if she could really prevent her four halfbrothers from destroying themselves from destroying innisfana and their people is this a fools chase she asked adam turning her face up to his i dont know sweetheart you can only try damn grace omalley skye said vehemently she plays the power game as does the queen but ill not let her destroy us ill not chapter grace omalley the pirate queen of connaught looked directly at anne omalley her kinswoman and then said to her first in command signal my ship to fire on anyone attempting to enter innisfanas harbor without my permission aye the man grunted and went off to do his mistresss bidding you cant do that anne protested my stepdaughter the omalley will be arriving any day now tis her domain and youve no authority over it she forfeited her authority when she married an englishman grace spat aye brian omalley agreed im the omalley now mother unless skye passes on her responsibility to you brian as your father passed it on to her youre not anne snapped and none of our people will recognize you as such shut yer mouth woman grace ordered rudely and with an outraged look anne fell silent there was going to be some difficulty when skye finally came anne knew skye and grace would detest each other on sight but she prayed that her stepdaughter could right things most of it was her own fault anne realized she had been so lost after dubhdara had died and she had clung to her sons indulging and spoiling them so they would love her and she wouldnt be alone they had grown into four big mirror images of their father but they had not dubhdara omalleys strength of character they were anne was ashamed to admit weak but well meaning men who drank too much and wenched too much and were given to foolishness such as pirating with their distant cousin grace and her men eventually the english were going to descend on innisfana and wreak their vengeance thank god that skye was coming home she would set everything to rights even this matter of grace omalley there was a dull boom followed by several more and running to the window they saw a fleet of eight ships entering the harbor under full sail behind them grace omalleys vessel keeled slowly over and sank into the bay even at this distance they could see men in the water clinging to the rigging sweet jesu my ships been sunk then grace omalley swore a violent string of vulgar gaelic oaths that caused even brian to redden anne put a hand over her mouth to stifle her laughter as her eldest son said with pompous understatement my sister is come home at last now well settle this matter between us aye anne said softly skye will settle it ive not a doubt brian but i think mayhap twill not be to yer liking mother you must uphold my right brian ive warned ye that youve no rights in this matter yer father of sainted memory may god assoil his dear soul passed on his authority to your sister skye it is her right to hold that authority or pass it on to whomever she deems fit its not right that she hold the title if shes not here to physically hold the authority grace omalley said slyly skye has always taken care of innisfana and its people even from a distant shore anne defended her stepdaughter shes done a fine job building our wealth which my sons have squandered perhaps if one of them had shown any maturity she would have passed on her badge of office the woman is in englands hire grace said scornfully shes no better than an english landlord thats right brian agreed i wonder if you have the courage to say that to your sister my son anne murmured im not afraid of skye brian blustered well you damned well ought to be if youre the one responsible for trying to prevent me entry into my own harbor skye snapped striding into the hall of the omalley tower house her husband and her captains at her back she glanced about the room good day anne she said and then her glance flicked to the other woman who was sprawled insolently in a chair you sunk my ship grace drawled it got in my way came the reply could you not have asked it to move then grace said with some humor as she stood up skye looked at this woman who was her relative she had to be at least six feet tall she was bigboned like a man but handsome in appearance with sparkling deepblue eyes and short dark curls skye knew that grace was a good ten years older than she was but the woman didnt show it anyone sending a warning shot across my bow is looking for a fight skye said no one bars me entry to my own harbor my own holding do you think to add innisfana to your own lands cousin adam watched amused here were two wellmatched hellcats although he felt that skye and her eight ships held the advantage grace omalley caught his assessing look and gave him a slow smile as she calmly took him in from head to toes innisfanas too small for me to be bothered with cousin came her reply and then she said who is this big handsome stud if hes one of yer captains ive a mind to hire him away from ye grace omalleys appetite for attractive men was well known and her lovers were legion thats something else you cant have cousin this is my husband lord de marisco tis the second englishman yeve married skye omalley came the faintly insulting reply the first im told was a goldenhaired fop but as for this one again she raked him with a bold look her eyes deliberately lingering where they should not well dearie tis enough to make me curious to perhaps sample one not this one skye said in a cold even voice are ye englishmen then ruled by yer women lord de marisco only when theyre beautiful and hotblooded irish wenches madam adam said with an amused grin one omalley is more than enough for me grace laughed appreciating his humor and seeing with her shrewd eye that the man was in love her younger cousin had always had the divils own luck when it came to men she thought enviously ill have someone sail you up to clare cousin skye said and any of your pirates weve managed to fish out of the sea she turned macguire take her home man aye mlady came the reply then the old captain turned to grace omalley follow me he said shortly and departed the room grace picked up her fur cloak from where she had carelessly thrown it and with a wink at adam said farewell cousin de marisco well meet again ive not a doubt then without any pretense at hurry she sauntered after macguire skye turned on brian where are your brothers she demanded theyre about he answered sullenly we just didnt expect ye so quickly ill wager you didnt fetch them brian i want them here within the hour get out now brian omalley almost ran from the room when he had gone skye turned to her stepmother anne im sorry but im going to take their hides off tis bad enough what theyve wasted but you realize theyre within a hairs breadth of losing everything else i couldnt handle them skye i needed yer father for theyre his lads right enough michael bless him never gave me a moments grief but my own four needed a mans influence yer uncle seamus couldnt be around all the time and there was no one else i know anne tis just the way things turned out skye soothed her stepmother although she secretly thought that had anne been a stronger woman there would have been no problem she looked about the hall and was surprised at what she saw this place is filthy she noted ive never known you to keep a dirty house anne tis not my house any longer skye ever since brian married my niece maggie obrian shes been mistress here and shell accept neither help nor advice from me skye felt a bolt of irritation shoot through her she remembered how lovely the hall had been when it had been annes responsibility the tables had gleamed with beeswax and rubbing reflecting back the huge porcelain bowls of flowers either fresh or dried depending on the season that anne always filled the house with looking around she saw that the tabletops were smeared and dull the chair cushions dusty frayed and worn the giant andirons were black from lack of polish and the fireplace walls thick with greasy black soot there were dust balls in all the corners and rushes filled with bones covered the floors the corners of the ceilings were cobwebbed and the place stank to high heaven ill not have it skye roared furiously where in hell are the servants dammit anne get the servants in here at once she turned to her captains secure the harbor she commanded ill expect you all for dinner tomorrow i dont dare ask you tonight for fear there is no dinner in this badly run establishment skyes captains hurried from the room glad to be free of what promised to be a battle royal with their mistress taking on not only her halfbrothers but a sisterinlaw as well anne omalley had already fled the hall seeking the servants alone with her husband skye said its impossible adam the whole damn thing is impossible anne is a sweet woman but she is so easily overridden by not only my brothers but obviously brians wife also what am i to do i cannot stay here and control their lives always we have our own life to live and dammit i want that life he took her in his arms and held her tightly skye pressed herself against his velvet doublet while the familiar clean smell of the spicy clovescented soap he used soothed her turbulent emotions he knew how skye loved a calm and orderly house and to find that her childhood home which she had left well tended had become a slovenly disgrace was disturbing to her especially coupled with the fact she must regain control of her brothers it will be all right little girl lady anne knows what must be done delegate the authority back to her and with your support she will be able to function once more ummm skye murmured hearing him but suddenly wishing she were anyplace else with adam but the middle of the hall of omalley house she snuggled against him for a brief moment and feeling his own desire awakening adam scolded her gently dammit little girl this is neither the place nor the time dont you want me she rubbed teasingly against him suddenly feeling mischievous skye he tried to put her away from him but she clung tighter and to both his horror and his delight her questing hand slipped beneath his doublet and around to caress his buttock skye you vixen cease your torture or i swear ill take you right here and now no matter the consequences do you want me adam she repeated yes he groaned through gritted teeth and she released him to stand demurely back laughing softly at his discomfort i want you too she said for the life of me i dont know why we didnt take velvet back to belle fleur and leave the omalleys to hell because sweetheart you are your fathers daughter you accepted the responsibility for your family from him and you are not a woman to go back on your word i could pass the mantle on to brian she said knowing that hes not fit for it skye youve too much conscience im thinking aye worse luck she agreed adam chuckled youll feel better after youve knocked a few stubborn omalley heads around he promised her as into the hall straggled a group of shabbylooking women and several men led by anne and another younger woman this is my daughterinlaw maggie anne introduced the girl how old are you skye demanded too angry to even greet her unknown sisterinlaw civilly the girl was a little bit of a thing with sharp features and carrotred hair seventeen came the mumbled reply didnt your mother teach you how to manage a household skye demanded me mother died when i was four or five i was the eighth child mlady then what in the name of god gave you the idea you could run this house lass why did you remove lady anne from her position as chatelaine im the omalleys wife came the reply i couldnt allow another in me place my older sisters all said if i didnt make clear from the beginning that i was the lady of the house i wouldnt ever be i think wed best get several things straight skye said patiently although she was longing to smack this rather stupid girl my brother brian is not the omalley i am this is my house in which you live and youve turned it into a pigsty rushes on the floors sweet jesu this house hasnt seen rushes on the floors since my father was a boy where are the fine carpets we had now listen to me maggie omalley the lady anne will resume her duties as chatelaine of this house until she no longer desires that position you will learn from her so that when the day comes she believes you competent you may take over from her from the looks of this place twill take at least ten years for you to learn how many children do you have four any girls one when shes old enough then shell learn too and her sisters should she have any skye turned and looked with a hard eye at the servants diligence will be rewarded in this house and laziness will be punished im not averse to beating my servants when they dont perform she glared fiercely at them and the little group visibly quailed while adam sought to not laugh for skye had never been known to hit a servant i am the omalley dyou understand tis my orders that will be obeyed here and youre to obey as well lady anne unless i tell you not to is that understood wideeyed the group nodded the hall first anne please anne omalley her confidence suddenly restored began issuing quick orders you maeve get those rushes up mab bring the beeswax and lets get started on those tables paddy you and tam clean the fireplaces and the andirons the rest of you use yer eyes and yer brooms i want this hall shining by nightfall with a quick smile she turned to skye use my apartments until this place is clean ill send the boys to you as soon as they arrive skye kissed anne lightly on the cheek my thanks she said and with adam following her she led the way to her stepmothers rooms they had barely settled themselves when skyes brothers arrived banging noisily into the room without knocking and causing their elder sister to shriek outraged at them as they tracked mud across annes beautiful turkey carpet sheepishly they backed out again removing their footwear at her command before reentering the chamber annes rooms were the only haven of cleanliness right now in the entire house and skye had no intention of allowing her brothers to ruin it grinning they stood before her all big men as their father had been three had his startlingly bright blue eyes each sported a bushy black beard and all had black black hair which they wore longer than was currently fashionable well skye said quietly you all look like da but youre not one whit like him for our father wasnt stupid and the four of you certainly are between you youve not the brain of a chicken yere not being fair skye brian whined fairshe looked scornfully at them i spent my youth building up the wealth of this family for wealth my dear brothers is power i was forced into making a foreign marriage and so i left you brian in charge of the omalley wealth and what have you done with it youve squandered it money is to be spent brian reasoned spent intelligently not squandered you dolt what have you done to increase our wealth where did you think additional monies were going to come from da had monies da had little she replied he scavenged wrecks some of which i am certain he caused he preyed upon an occasional fat merchant vessel caught without protection he was more pirate than i care to admit he wanted better for you when he died died and left his authority to you skye brian said bitterly as his brothers shane shamus and conn nodded in agreement ah thats what rankles you isnt it brian da left the authority to me how you would love to be the omalley well my little brother you were barely six when da died and our brother michael only eight there was no one else that da chose to trust he knew that i would not fail him authority brian comes only to those who are willing to accept responsibility and so far i have seen nothing on the part of any of you to indicate to me that you are willing to grow up when i see maturity in any one of you brian i promise you that i will pass on my authority until then i will continue to keep my faith with our father may god assoil him adam sat back quietly in the shadows of a window seat to watch and listen as skye spoke with her four halfbrothers he understood the frustration the younger men must be feeling but he was forced to agree with his wife in her judgments the omalley brothers were not capable of handling responsibility dammit skye shamus omalley exclaimed its embarrassing having to answer to a woman tis all right for children but were grown men strange skye murmured you chafe under my very light authority over you but youre quick to throw in with grace omalley and her cutthroats dont tell me that our kinswoman doesnt issue orders to you for i know if you sail with her you answer to her shamus she looked piercingly at her four brothers who shuffled their feet nervously and then she sat down waving the men to chairs also tell me brian she said looking hard at him tell me what you would do if you were the omalley of innisfana a huge grin split his face and it was obvious that brian had thought often about being the head of his family why id go apirating with grace and id fight the damned english right back across the sea to their own puny island gods bones what fun wed have eh brothers shane and shamus omalley nodded at their elder sibling and each sported an identical foolish grin upon his broad face skye had the incredible urge to hit them for despite their ages they were terribly childish how would you feed your peoples while you were gone she demanded who would protect innisfana from our marauding friends and neighbors not to mention the vengeful english having nothing of your own brian what provisions could you make for your family and all the others for whom you would be responsible ive seen the results of giving you even small authority what in hell is that supposed to mean brian shouted it means you wasted all you had and now you have nothing you delivered the management of this house into the hands of your wife a nice enough girl ive not a doubt but a slattern when it comes to household matters youve no judgment brian you dont look at the long run youd run off with grace omalley leaving innisfana and its peoples unprotected and povertystricken while you fought the english your neighbors would be making up to them aiding them and taking your holding in payment for their treacherous service the first rule of survival is to stay out of politics the second is to avoid a situation in which you cannot win the english are just that brian ireland will never be free of them until they can unite beneath the banner of one leader and i see no hope of that therefore your first duty is to survive and to aid this family in its survival if you want to be the omalley then show me the qualities that make a good leader brian god knows ill be glad to pass on my authority im tired of being responsible for you all im tired of having to answer to an english queen for your behavior and i want to live my own life free of such encumbrances i cannot be quit of you however until i am satisfied that you can really be a leader until then youll obey me for i am the omalley she looked directly at them daring any of them to argue with her but they avoided her gaze she knew they resented her but she also knew that she was right about them suddenly shane asked what do we do then skye if we dont go pirating with grace omalley and fight the english what do we do for the first time that afternoon skye smiled her brothers plaintive question was what she had been waiting for she didnt want to have to order them about she wanted them to want her aid well shane i think that you and your brothers should do what you do best and obviously that is pirating however dont pirate the english for theyre not rich enough the spanish are the spanish aye you want adventure then get yourselves letters of marque from the queen and harry the dons along the spanish main youll rebuild your wealth and therefore your power base in no time we need no letters of marque from the english brian boasted we can go on our own thats up to you brian but go on your own and youre prey to anyone and everyone get caught and youll be hung for a common pirate carry letters of marque and youre protected by a powerful queen and youve powerful allies in every other ship sailing with bess tudors blessing should you get caught by the french or the dutch youre more apt to be ransomed than hung she smiled lazily at her eldest brother tis your decision of course brian now get out ive said all i am going to for now i will see you later for ive not come home to go away quickly little brothers the four men shuffled to their feet and clumped from the room pausing at the door to pull their boots back on before departing when the door had closed on them at last skye moved across the room to settle herself in adams lap kiss me she demanded and he was happy to comply covering her mouth with his in a fiery possession that left her breathless hmmmmm she purred at him slipping a hand around to caress the back of his neck do you really want to be quit of them he asked her as she sent wonderful little shivers down his spine and he moved a hand around to slip into her silk shirt yes she said and nuzzled him just below his ear his hand cupped her breast the thumb stretching up to tease at the nipple what if they dont take your suggestion skye gently bit on the lobe of adams ear and then blew softly into it they will she said with certainty loving the warmth of his hand as he cupped her and then what little girl adam could feel himself beginning to stir with desire as she nesded provocatively against him kissing his face and neck with wonderful little kisses then my lord we will be finished with the tudor queenand her court we shall go home wherever that may be and i shall spend my days being a dutiful chatelaine and my nights being your own personal wanton she turned his head with her fingers and kissed him passionately the beast within him leapt forth crushing her within the iron of his arms meeting her flaming challenge with a fire of his own that burned hot and fierce he turned her so that she lay helpless within the enchantment of his embrace her fair breasts half exposed their little nipples pushing arrogantly forth to taunt him with a groan of surrender he buried his face in the perfumed softness of her dammit skye i want you i cannot get enough of you and tis unkind of you to tempt me so now skye laughed and wiggled from his arms walking across the room she turned the key in the lock of the door and with an almost impish grin she sauntered back across the room to stand before him slowly she drew her silk shirt off and slipped from the halfchemise she wore beneath it letting them fall to the floor adam expelled his breath in a slow hiss of delight at the wonders she displayed to him so proudly she slid her legged skirt over her hips and removed the remaining undergarments and stockings rolling the latter down shapely legs that he had viewed a thousand times before and still found beautiful boldly she moved forward to face him and began undoing his silk shirt while with eager hands he yanked and pulled at the rest of his clothing anxious to join her in this natural state seating him skye removed his boots and pulled off his hose he was quickly as nude as she and made no resistance when she led him across the room to lie with her on a sheepskin rug before the warm fire they clung together their bodies touching the length of one another while they kissed their lips moving softly against each other he stroked her satiny flesh gently feeling the desire rise in him as it had the very first time he had touched her as it always did when they made love she hovered over him her breasts brushing his chest as she twined her fingers in and out of the dark mat upon his torso her touch incited his passion and he pulled her against him only to turn her so that now she lay underneath his lips traveled a tender pathway over her face pausing at her closed eyelids her nose her rose mouth he kissed a trail down her neck to the throbbing hollow in her throat and paused there to feel the very blood coursing wildly beneath his lips sweet skye how i love you he whispered against her fragrant skin and i love you my darling husband came back the breathless reply oh adam i love you so there had never been a moment in time like this she thought oh yes there had been others to whom she had given her heart and genuinely loved in their time but none had been like adam de marisco the others had loved her but there had always been a pride of possession of her in their love niall had been her first love and khalid the only safe harbor in a frightening and unremembered world geoffrey ah for geoffrey southwood the angel earl with his pride and his arrogance she had been the only woman he had ever really loved she had loved him too she thought with a touch of sadness in her heart nicolas st adrian her charming frenchman had caught her heart when she most needed him they had all been marvelous but adam was different adam de marisco had always treated her like his equal and perhaps that was why he was her friend as well as her husband and her lover he adored her with a mixture of love and amusement and wonder but he had always respected her intelligence as well it made him different from the others he was proud that she was his wife but his pride stemmed from the fact that he had been fortunate enough to win her to all the others she had been a possession to be proud of and to be envied to adam she was simply sweet skye his beloved wife as he slowly filled her with his pulsing manhood she opened her sapphire eyes and took his head in her two hands turning him so that their eyes met she held his gaze as he entered her her eyes growing ever more full of the love she felt for this wonderful man there were no words spoken between them for their beating hearts spoke silently for them with tender passion he moved upon her until finally she could bear the sweetness no longer and her eyes closed again as a soft cry welled up and burst from her throat adams own heart was so filled with love for skye at that moment that he could barely contain his own passions with wonder he watched her seeing all the turbulent emotions that played across her beautiful face gently he bent his leonine head to kiss her and tasted the salty tears on her cheeks that she wept from sheer happiness he understood yet it moved him just the same when moments later she opened her beautiful sapphire eyes again he smiled softly at her and she smiled back dazzling him with her love for him which shone so clearly in her face how very much i need you little girl he whispered to her how very much i need youmy husband she returned and then as he moved them so that they lay on their sides she touched his mouth with a delicate kiss they were still joined in conjugal embrace but he had wanted to spare her his weight while they loved for he was not yet ready to spend in this halffacing position skye had one leg between his and one of adams legs was between hers it was an intimate position that allowed them to stroke and caress each other freely adam enjoyed taking her sensitive little nipples in his mouth from this posture and sucking long and lovingly upon them she began to feel the flames flickering throughout her body once more as he did this and she ran her hand down his long back to fondle a taut buttock with teasing fingers witch he growled at her nipping playfully on her sentient flesh and beginning to feel his own hunger rising once more she bit at his earlobe and then ran her tongue about the shell of his ear whispering shamelessly to him how he made her feel at this moment oh my darling youre so very big why is it i cannot get enough of you adam i love it when you fuck me oh darling dont stop please dont stop my love ahh i could go on forever she was his wife and yet her bold words roused his lust to a furious pitch he shuddered with passion and ached with the pleasure possessing her gave him once more he towered over her his great manhood thrusting again and again and again into her excited flesh he vaguely felt her nails raking down his back heard her excited panting hot in his ear felt her body writhing beneath him beginning to slip from reality into the golden world of sensual rapture skye had a brief startling thought it was with adam as it had been with geoffrey each time it was better each time it was more passionate than the last time if this was her reward for all she had borne then it had been worth it for to be loved by such a man was worth anything then she was caught up in the whirlwind of passion and flying high was lost to everything except their love ah sweet skye youve unmanned me she heard him cry and collasped upon her breasts her arms tightened about him as he whimpered with his own pleasure and she could not help but kiss his tousled dark head they lay together for some minutes attempting to regain their composure he finally managed to roll off her and catching her hand in his they lay silently side by side beneath them the thick sheepskin was soft and the warm fire crackled merrily the only witness to their passion outside they could hear the soft roar of the rising wind about the stone tower house everything else was silence he spoke first i wish we could stay like this all winter she laughed softly so do i but i suspect that anne will want her rooms back this night i feel almost guilty thinking on how we have spent this afternoon while anne has overseen the servants at their cleaning chores if this sheepskin could talk he teased her poor anne would be shocked i imagine my father was not a particularly inventive lover stamina and vigor were his traits i have been told he was a simple man why didnt she remarry she was yet a girl when your father died aye she was twentytwo to his fiftyeight she says she didnt remarry because she had the boys to raise and no dowry i would have given her a dowry though and a good man seeking sons would have been happy to have her to wife for she was certainly a proven breeder no i think she chose not to remarry she had borne my father four sons in four years and i think she had no wish to place herself in another mans care it was far more convenient to deify my father and his memory not all women like the marriage bed i suspect anne is one of those women to my knowledge she has had no lovers since da died skye propped herself up on an elbow and lowering her head kissed her husband lingeringly i cant imagine not loving you she said he smiled back at her i dont ever intend you stop loving me little girl it would break my heart if you did and then his arm came up to draw her down against him when they finally heard the knocking on the door both felt silly and foolish they were behaving like young lovers instead of the adults that they were skye dear the hall is cleaned and sweetened and if you and adam would care to come forth the servants are waiting for your approval anne omalley called well be there in a moment anne skye said her voice quavering with amusement help me to dress you buffoon she hissed at adam who lay on his back waggling his black bushy eyebrows at her while she attempted to maintain her composure they both heard annes retreating footsteps gracious mlady yer gown is all rumbled and bless me is this a tear in yer bodice standing up to his full six feet six inches adam successfully mimicked daisy skye burst out laughing you devil she scolded him stop teasing me his warm laughter rumbled about the room very well little girl ill behave if youll tell me where were going to sleep tonight in this ancient pile of stones you call your ancestral home he picked up her undergarments from the floor and began handing them to her my old room is at the top of the tower skye told him i imagine anne will have it prepared this is actually the only decentsized apartment in the whole place and it was my fathers i am pleased to see anne did not give it to brian and his wife adam and skye redressed as quickly as they could and leaving anne omalleys rooms returned to the hall skye was delighted for the room once more looked like the one she remembered a smile split her face and seeing it the servants visibly relaxed anne youve worked a miracle no miracle only proper cleaning and the return of the pretties with which i once decorated this hall coming in for the evening meal skyes brothers were equally pleased and even maggie shyly admitted carpets upon the stone floors were nicer than rushes the meal was a simple one for anne did not set an elaborate table there were mussels boiled in white wine baby lamb roasted with rosemary and a bowl of cress there was fresh bread and a tub of sweet butter a hard cheese and a dish of apples the men ate heartily washing it all down with brown ale eibhlin omalley had come from her convent on innishturk to see her sister and after the meal the four women sat companionably talking about the fire while the men remained at the table drinking and from the sound of the ribald laughter telling stories a lady should not hear skye could not help but notice how well her brothers got on with adam and it gave her great pleasure the omalley brothers might not realize it but they were taking their first step along the road to tolerance they had accepted an englishman into their midst without any trouble at all skye was surprised when brian came to her amid the chatter of the women and drew her aside my brothers and i have been talking this afternoon about what you said do you really think the english queen would give us letters of marque yes but make no mistake brian tis for her good as well as yours ye mean shell be getting a share of the booty we capture aye but shell also be getting the omalleys of innisfana off of her royal neck if there is one thing elizabeth tudor believes in little brother it is peace she wants no wars for she knows that wars destroy a countrys economy there is one other tiling about the queen brian skye continued youll have to come with me to england if youre to get your letters of marque never brian shouted and everyone in the hall turned to look at him ill not leave blessed ireland to set foot in that accursed land dont be an ignorant and superstitious fool brian skye retorted as quickly youll come with me to england and present yourself before the queen you cant ask elizabeth tudor for a favor from afar id rather not ask her for anything brian grumbled youll be a rich man in no time brian skye wheedled him you can then afford to build a whole new wing onto the house just for yourself and maggie and the children wouldnt you like that maggie skye appealed to her young sisterinlaw aye i would maggie said bluntly youd all be rich skye promised her halfbrothers and then you could each build a wing onto the house and marry the lass of your choice for with gold in your pockets youd have a choice and be a desirable match to any fathers eye isnt that better than the cheap chances you take with grace omalley ill not go to england brian said firmly the queen wont give you the letters of marque sight unseen skye argued ill go they all turned to look at skyes youngest brother conn youll go she said aye conn replied ive a mind to see england and the redhaired virgin vixen who rules it will i do skye he grinned engagingly at his sister skye looked him over critically conn was the youngest but he was the biggest standing almost as tall as adam cleaned up his beard barbered decently elegant clothes upon his back and a quick course in manners he might very well do elizabeth did like clever and attractive young men and skye had to admit that conn was both aye she said youll do quite well she looked at brian and the others do you have any objections to conn going nay they replied with one voice all obviously relieved not to have to go themselves its settled then skye said when will you leave brian asked not for several days skye answered him i want to see ewan and gwyneth and our uncle the bishop ill send a message off tomorrow however to tell bess tudor that were corning to pay her a call the next morning skye arose early to write to the queen madame my brothers beg your indulgence for the overabundance of high spirits that caused them to foolishly join with our distant cousin grace omalley i have suggested that a proper channel for my brothers exuberance would be to carry letters of marque from your gracious majesty that would allow them to exercise their energies in foreign waters to both their own and your majestys great advantage i will shortly be arriving in england with my youngest brother conn omalley who will tender a request for your majestys favor on behalf of his brothers and himself i remain as always your majestys friend skye lady de marisco skye watched dispassionately as the thick green sealing wax dripped onto the folded letter and she pressed the omalley ring of office into the hot puddle before it hardened the letter was dispatched immediately aboard one of her ships captained by bran kelly she was relieved to have the letter off and the matter settled she walked back into the bedchamber crawled back beneath the down coverlet and sighed adam reached out and pulled her into his embrace his arm cradling her settling her head against his shoulder what is it little girl he asked kissing the top of her head i find im losing my taste for adventure she said he understood her completely youve borne a heavy burden all alone and for a very long time skye tis no wonder youre weary sweetheart but will you not rely on me now let me shoulder some of the load or at least help you with it oh adam how can i involve you in this youre english english irish he replied it matters not skye you are a woman i a man we love each other and because we do ones problems become the others its really that simple your brothers nationality has nothing to do with their being pigheaded ive known frenchmen and devonmen and other englishmen just as stubborn its simply their nature and together you and i will overcome that nature i am encouraged that conn desires to see the tudor court lets take him back to lynmouth first she said well have to clean him up and get him outfitted and teach him how to behave for ill not have the court laughing at him like as not conn would kill half a dozen men should he feel insulted im not introducing him into elizabeth tudors world to cause havoc and be sneered at as a typical irisher i want those letters of marque for the omalleys youll get them skye i wish i was as sure as you are adam adam chuckled if conn is half the charmer i suspect he is the queen will melt besides being a practical woman she will be relieved to have the omalleys of innisfana off harrying the spanish instead of the english skye smiled to herself realizing the simple truth of adams words and she snuggled harder against him then ill not worry my husband and instead i shall concentrate on indulging my baser appetites she murmured sliding her hand beneath his nightshirt with teasing hands she fondled him caressing and cupping him and feeling him grow hard beneath her touch adam lay very still only the sudden quickening of his breath indication at first of her success he loved the way she touched him with her hot and gentle little hands in his lifetime he could not remember any woman rousing him as completely and as quickly as skye could when she moved herself down to take him in her mouth he groaned with unashamed pleasure at her actions and fought to maintain his control for now he desperately desired to possess and be possessed ahh my celtic witch ride me he finally begged her and skye willingly obeyed her husbands request lifting her head from his manhood kissing its throbbing scarlet head and then mounting him to plunge downward so that he was enclosed by her eager sheath reaching up adam played gently with her beautiful breasts tormenting the little nipples so that they thrust and quivered with his touch watching her through halfclosed eyes he was amused to find her own eyes closed drawing her closer he raised his head up and took one of those little peaks into his mouth balanced on one elbow he cupped her breast in his other hand loving it thoroughly as he did so his tongue encircled the tautness warm and so so soft against her hardness he sucked and nibbled on her flesh and skye gasped with pleasure as small darts of liquid fire raced through her veins leaving her weak with a smile of triumph adam rolled her onto her back and began thrusting into her honeyed warmth skyes nails dug fiercely into his muscled shoulders but her rounded hips began to thrust back at him he pushed deeper and deeper into her until she thought he could go no further but the next thrust penetrated deeper still as she threw her legs up and wrapped them around liim now her nails raked down his back scoring the smooth skin with fine crimson lines skye felt she was soaring soaring higher than she had ever gone before she felt helpless beneath his strength and yet she felt stronger than she ever had the first wave of passion washed wildly over her and adam slowed his movement despite her whimpered protest he laughed softly a deep and sensuous sound oh no little girl not quite yet youre a hungry wench i can see but im of a mind to play with you a bit longer what you started sweetheart i shall finish all the while he spoke he moved slowly upon her again he increased the tempo of his erotic rhythm until she was sobbing with pleasure the whirling world was filled with a golden light that pulsed and throbbed all about her his possession filled her with unbelievable peace amidst the turbulence of their passion he gave so much and skye wanted to give back but the second wave overtook her and then in quick bursts the third and forth waves overcame her rendering her almost unconscious and she cried out to her surprise he cried out also and then she felt his seed filling her full and his head dropped to her breasts she could barely catch her breath but she kissed his head and caressed the back of his neck soothingly he rolled away from her and they lay side by side until at last the storm had passed and they drifted into a contented sleep when they awoke the morning was well along and skye scrambled guiltily from the warmth of their bed gods nightshirt she swore my family will think me a slugabed tis past nine im certain and i had planned to visit my uncle seamus today where in hell is daisy with my bath water she flung open the bedchamber door and peered into the day room so yere up daisy looked somewhat askance at her mistress and skye realized she was nude wheres my bath she demanded with an effort at nonchalance if id fetched it earlier daisy replied tartly twould be ice cold at this moment ill see to it now mlady and she busded out of the room youve the prettiest bottom ive ever seen adam teased her skye whirled about laughing oh tis a bold one you are my lord husband its a good hours ride to my uncles house and i did promise him id come whenever i arrived back on innisfana tis certain he knows im here and has ive not a doubt been waiting for me since dawn hes an old man adam and frail i would not disappoint him well not disappoint him little girl and i intend to ride with you for ive not met the good bishop does he hate the english too im not sure its all the english adam just the ones who happen to gain his disfavor by not agreeing with him she chuckled and adam laughed in other words he said a typical omalley she launched herself at him grabbing a large handful of his dark hair and yanking beast i can see i must teach you to be more respectful of the omalleys of innisfana he wrestled her to the mattress and then across the bed as they playfully fought and struggled until both collapsed in a fit of laughter mischievously he spanked her bottom eliciting a shriek of outrage from her twill teach you better manners toward your lord wench he scolded with mock ferocity my lord is a lopeared ass she threw back rubbing her injured flesh adam grabbed skye and drew her down into a passionate embrace my lady is a hotblooded little bitch who arouses me beyond mortal comprehension he murmured softly as he began to nibble at her lips is this bath to get cold too or will you wash came the scathing demand from daisy skye squirmed from her husbands arms but their eyes met in total understanding and love im coming she said to her tiring woman so am i adam said beginning to rise from the bed get thee hence daisy lass unless youre interested in my bottom and he waggled his eyebrows at her threateningly whos to wash my lady daisy demanded outraged i will came adams reply more than likely yell end up back in that tumbled bed daisy grumbled but who am i to say very well then ill give you both fifteen minutes and as fer being interested mlord theres nothing yeve got i aint seen before then with her nose in the air daisy flounced out skye giggled at adams look of outrage as much as daisys tart comment aye adam she further teased her husband daisys a married woman now and ive heard it said that bran kelly can hold his own with the best of them then sticking out her tongue at her husband skye scampered from their bedchamber to the dayroom where the tall oak tub had been placed before the fire wrinkling her nose with pleasure she breathed in the rose bath oil already perfuming the room in the tendrils of steam that came from the hot water quickly she pinned her hair atop her head adam caught up with her as she was about to climb up the three wooden steps that led to the tub and twirling her about he kissed her were never going to get bathed and off to my uncles she protested faintly against his mouth thinking how good it felt to be enclosed in his arms yes we will he said and lifted her into the tub before climbing in to join her good god im going to smell like a damned garden madam twas your idea to bathe with me she pointed out aye he grumbled but i can imagine what your brothers will think if they get a whiff of me our delay in getting up plus daisys gossiping should reassure them on all counts skye laughed come now mlord you promised to maid me she handed him her soap wash my back only if i can wash your front as well he countered adam he turned her around and began soaping her long back you were more fun when you were my sometime mistress he teased chuckling at her gasp of outrage aye he murmured kissing the tempting back of her neck being a wife has sobered you greatly little girl he turned her around kissed her on the nose and handing her the soap said now you wash my back madam only if i can wash the front too she mocked him if you dare little girl he said what will my uncle think of you adam de marisco she lamented the old bishop of midconnaught thought very well of his favorite nieces new husband they had never met face to face but seamus omalley felt he knew adam de marisco from all the things that skye had said of him over the years from his reputation as the lord of lundy isle and from the letters they had exchanged letters that usually had to do with skye and her wellbeing seamus omalley knew that adam loved his niece and the old man understood that love was what she needed most of all the love of a strong and good man a man who would stand tall and prevent skye from pursuing any future reckless course seamus omalley was in his middle seventies and he had not been a well man for two years now because of his destruction of burke castle there was a price on his head a price no one had dared to collect yet still the fact of it filled his life with a tension that had not been there before in the last six months his health had deteriorated greatly and he had not left innisfana island to care for the spiritual wellbeing of his people he lived in a big stone house on the cliffs overlooking the sea but despite his illnesses he yet said the early mass in the nearby village church each morning it was midday when skye and adam arrived to see him the door to the house was opened by maeve the wife of connor fitzburke niall burkes bastard brother when they had been driven from burke lands the fitzburkes had come with the elderly bishop to care for him the two women embraced warmly and maeve fitzburke stepped back to hold skye at arms length she was a small pretty woman with warm brown eyes and reddish hair how is it possible she said youre as beautiful as ever dye never age skye omalley look closely maeve and youll see the lines skye laughed then she drew adam forward this is my husband lord de marisco maeve maeve smiled warmly id heard ye were a big man she said come in then for hes been waiting impatiently for ye to arrive since after mass where is connor skye asked as they entered the house off seeing to the sheep and cattle that his grace keeps these days was the reply as maeve led them up a staircase dont be too shocked skye yer uncle is an old man and it broke his heart when the english queen took burke castle from little lord burke hes failed over the last few months and hes not strong he feels the cold greatly this autumn and i doubt hell live to see the spring skye felt unbidden tears pricking at her eyes and she stopped a moment to regain her control maeve seemed to know and paused before the paneled oak door her hand upon the latch im all right now skye said softly and adam reached for her hand and squeezed it reassuringly maeve swung the door wide saying as she entered the room well my lord bishop and here she is at last the old gentleman in the plaid woolen shawl by the fireplace looked up and skye ran toward him to kneel at his side and kiss his gnarled hand with its heavy gold ring of office so lass his body might be frail but seamus omalleys voice was as strong as ever get up skye and let me look at ye at least my eyes are still sharp yere as fair as ever lass i remember when ye were born and dubhdara was so disappointed ye werent a lad but ye were a beauty even then and immediately stole his heart he paused a moment even as ye stole mine too skye bent and kissed him on the forehead dearest uncle she murmured now dammit lass dont be going sentimental on me he grumbled introduce me to this giant i suspect is yer husband he thrust his hand forward for adam to kiss indeed uncle this is adam de marisco my husband skye said as adam made his obeisance to the bishop seamus omalley grinned and said aye hes just right for ye skye worships the ground ye walk on i can see and spoils ye shamelessly still i see enough strength in him that yed best beware of driving him too far lest he beat ye as ye no doubt deserve on occasion sit down nephew yere as tall as a tree and i prefer to speak to ye face to face not face to codpiece he cackled at his own wit then commanded maeve bring some whiskey for im fair chilled tis a bitter day a bitter day they drew up chairs and sat facing the old man almost at once he engaged adam in a lively conversation skye was content to sit back watching the men she loved and swirling the amber fire called whiskey around in her goblet her eyes devoured her uncle lovingly he had grown old in the several years since she had seen him his hair was now snow white though once it had been as black as hers his eyes however were still bright blue and lively with interest in the world about him he was thin and his bony hands trembled with the effort of holding his glass how he conducted the daily mass she did not understand except that he obviously put all his strength into it and then spent the rest of his time resting from the effort skye his voice penetrated her thoughts aye uncle im sorry about burke castle will the queen return padraics lands nay uncle she gave him lands in england she said hed be raised as a good englishman and twould be one less irish rebel for her to worry about seamus omalley nodded and smiled slightly although he saw the humor in it he also saw the wisdom in it yeve few ties left in ireland lass im still the omalley uncle for how long lass tis not fair ye retain the office now that dubhdaras sons are grown grown into selfish fools uncle skye snapped id be doing da a disservice to make brian the omalley right now all he wants to do is pirate with our cousin grace he cares nothing about building our wealth all he wants to do is waste it what will ye do then lass ive suggested if he wants to go pirating with his brothers that they obtain letters of marque from the queen and pirate the spanish main rather than english shipping that way they can keep on the good side of the queen without really serving her and fill their own coffers with good gold at the same time brian agreed and conn is to come to england with me to speak with the queen if brian and the others will keep out of trouble in the next year ill turn over my badge of office to him and consider my duty to the omalleys done tis fair the bishop agreed i dont want the power any longer uncle skye said ive had it all my life it seems and im tired my children have grown up barely knowing me but ill not let my youngest velvet be without me after this ive a home in france and the queen has promised us estates to make up for lundy the restlessness is gone then lass aye she said i seek peace now uncle and i know that it lies with adam and our daughter and my other children seamus omalley nodded yer father god assoil him was like that when he married anne he never wanted to go far after that yeve already found yer peace skye lass and ill not tell ye to be a good and faithful wife to adam for i can see that ye already are it makes me happy to see it for if things are right with ye then i can rest easy and face my brother with a clear conscience skye rose from her chair and bending down kissed her aged uncle hugging him hard seamus omalley i love you she said the old man smiled over her shoulder at adam and hugged her back whist lass next yell be weeping all over me he scolded her lovingly but his expression was one of pleased delight at her open show of affection they stayed the entire day and overnight as well it was a happy time for them all in the morning when they were ready to leave skye hurried to her uncles rooms to bid him farewell adam following seamus omalley sat by the fire once more his head upon his narrow chest his hands resting quietly in his lap the fire crackled noisily but it seemed not to disturb him skye smiled down on him and called softly uncle i must go now there was no answer uncle she reached out to gently shake him and he was cold to her touch skyes hand flew to her mouth adam adam de marisco knelt to inspect the old man when he rose there were tears in his eyes hes dead skye the lord of lundy told his wife and then gathered her into his arms while she wept stormily the bishop of midconnaught seamus omalley was buried on his favorite nieces thirtyfourth birthday he had been waked for five long days for it had taken that long to gather all of skyes brothers and sisters and their families on innisfana looking around at skyes sisters moire peigi bride and sine adam was startled by their plainness in comparison with his wifes beauty he had never noticed that plainness in eibhlin for the nun was so full of life and her work the others however were prim women who openly disapproved of their youngest sisters liaison with an englishman only the fact that adam de marisco shared their faith made him barely tolerable to them hearing their tales of their struggles with the english he could understand their bitterness they were old before their time with childbearing and the harshness of the land in which they lived none had attained either the wealth or the fine matches that their youngest sister had they had come with their husbands bluff redfaced men none of whom could speak the english tongue adam fortunately knew enough gaelic to converse briefly with them and it was decided among skyes brothersinlaw that if her english husband could speak the gaelic he mightnt be too bad a fellow it was also noted with approval that he could hold his whiskey and seemed to have firm control of his wife who was thought to be too forward for a woman michael omalley said the mass for his uncle and afterward the coffin was carried to the family burial ground by the bishops four younger nephews his greatnephew ewan oflaherty and connor fitzburke in the hall afterward moire said what they were all thinking twas our last link with the past and da now tis gone well always have the memories sine said hopefully pah peigi said sharply the age has ended and thats all there is to it uncle seamus was the one thing that kept this family close and together bride volunteered now i suppose well all go our own ways weve been doing that for years moire replied tis the way of it eibhlin said quietly all families scatter at one point in time especially the daughters and god knows da had his share of daughters weve made da proud moire said at least some of us have ive borne eighteen children thirteen of whom lived peigi has twelve living bride nine and sine eleven even you barren stock though you chose to be would have made him proud with yer medicines and piety moire looked around at her siblings aye da would be proud of some of us da would be proud of me also moire skye said quietly youve been most obvious in leaving me out but let me tell you that ive done just what he would have wanted me to over the years and ive borne eight children as well ive overseen three estates for my children as well as great wealth and ive done well moire by the omalleys ye lost the burke lands with yer carryings on moire snapped i lost the burke lands because i was married in france without the queens blessing skye retorted angrily the queen broke her word to me for we made a bargain and i kept my part of that bargain had i returned to england without a husband elizabeth tudor would have used me again and i will never be used again by anyone moire what in hell could you possibly know about it living in a backwater manor house in an outoftheway village in ireland brian tells me that yeve advised him and our brothers to go into service with the english queen nay ive advised them to obtain letters of marque from her and to go plundering along the spanish main twill keep them out of trouble here in ireland and fill our coffers as well moire should they keep on the way theyre going theyll lose everything and da wouldnt want that the spanish are our friends moire protested we share the same faith spare me your religious qualms moire skye replied impatiently the spanish use us the same way the french use the scots tis to their own advantage religion plays no part in it if the spanish occasionally give the irish arms tis only so theyll harry the english which is to spains interest and certainly not irelands do the english punish the spanish nay rather they come with a vengeance to us and tis irish blood that flows in the streets and irish women who weep tears of pain and shame and irish children who starve for lack of their fathers to feed and defend them our friends never suffer rather we the irish do and tis our own fault we will not unite beneath one banner and until we do there will be no peace or real freedom in ireland ye were always different moire countered and then she spoke no more on it the next morning skyes sisters and their families departed for their own homes bidding their youngest sister farewell with little warmth the years had treated them quite differently and sadly skye was as much a stranger to them as a woman taken in from the streets would have been she understood them all too well for her life experience had been broad they understood her not at all for their experience had been narrow still she kissed them and bid them god speed good riddance eibhlin muttered as the last of them rode off down the road and skye laughed tucking her hand through her favorite sisters arm as they walked back into the hall why is it that you understand and they dont she asked because they are more cloistered in their lives than i despite my religious calling have ever been my medicine has allowed me to see more of the human condition and the world than they have besides they have always been jealous of your beauty skye as well as your husbands think on it sister for thirtyone years moire has been humped by but one man and from her sour face i wager he scarce comes near her anymore and ive always suspected that she says the rosary while he is atop her ill wager you dont say yer rosary while adam makes love to you eibhlin skye blushed rosily and adam overhearing his sisterinlaws wry remarks roared with laughter nay eibhlin she says not her rosary for i keep her far too busy saying other things youre shameless skye cried and tis worse with you eibhlin for youre a nun true her older sister agreed but im also a woman then she changed the subject what think ye of mistress gwenyth that im overyoung to be a grandmother skye laughed isnt it wonderful eibhlin youll be with her when her time comes wont you aye skye i will and believe me ballyhennessey is a far better place today in which to have a child than it was when you birthed ewan and murrough ill not forget the snow drifting across the floor while i tried to keep you and the baby warm ewan is nothing like his father skye replied neither thank god is murrough theyre my sons and they are good boys tell me of my newest niece eibhlin said skye looked at adam and they smiled velvets an impossible baggage eibhlin but we love her dearly in other words eibhlin chuckled she is her parents child aye they both replied with one voice and then laughed when will you return to england for i imagine you are anxious to be with your child we sail tomorrow eibhlin brian has promised me he will immediately disassociate himself and the omalleys of innisfana from grace omalley and her pirates tis easily done right now for the winter is upon us and theyll be no more ships to chase until spring by then i hope to have the letters of marque for the omalleys and they can sail west to play havoc with the spanish in the new world eibhlin nodded with approval yeve saved those four dolts though they know it not if theyd continued on their merry course theyd have ended up on the gallows for sure and then yed never be free of the omalleys give brian the office as soon as you reasonably can skye tis past time ye had yer own fife adam silently agreed with eibhlin omalley and he was not sorry the following day to bid farewell to brian shane and shamus omalley and their mother anne of course was worried for her youngest conn who was to sail with them but adam saw that the young man was anxious to free himself of both his mother and his three older brothers secretly adam wondered if his youngest brotherinlaw would ever go privateering in the new world from conn omalleys questions about skyes trading business adam suspected hed not they reached devon several days later anchoring in the harbor of lynmouth castle and then rowing ashore daisy hurried to her cottage to see her small sons while skye sent out messengers to dame cecily at wren court and to the queen saying that she had returned and would be keeping christmas at greenwich with her majesty then she put her mind to the task of turning her brother into a gentleman worthy of the tudor court conn roared like a lion as his shaggy hair was shorn from his head and his thick bushy beard cropped neady he howled like a banshee to find himself in a steaming tub that smelt of lavender while his own sister her sleeves rolled above her elbow plied the scrubbing brush herself yere killing me he yelled in gaelic as she scrubbed his newly barbered hair speak english you clod she roared back at him youll be laughed right out of the damned english court unless you do to hell with the english my sentiments too skye laughed but you need the bastards conn besides the court is filled with pretty girls just dying to meet a big handsome man like yourself if you dont speak their language how will you communicate with them ive not done so bad to date sister he replied with the serving girls she mocked him havent you ever learned the difference between a lady and a wench little brother youd best if youre to be a success at court and youd better be a success at court conn your brothers need those letters of marque conn omalley put his mind to becoming a gentleman he was nineteen years old and stood several inches over six feet in height like his sister he was fair with midnightblack hair a recalcitrant lock tumbled over his brow giving him a look both innocent and rakish of all the omalleys he was the only one whose eyes were neither gray nor bright blue his instead were a grayish green he was an enormously handsome man with a straight nose high forehead and square chiseled jaw he looked marvelous in decently tailored clothing having long elegant legs narrow hips slim waist and a broad chest and shoulders seeing him suitably garbed a week after they had arrived adam swore softly saying by god the women will be throwing themselves at his feet well have to fight every father and husband at court skye conn grinned back engagingly with a flash of white white teeth i promise not to be too hard a man on all the little darlins adam he said god help us adam muttered conn was quick and he easily learned all that skye and adam could teach him dame cecily worked with him too drilling him in his speech so that by the time they were ready to depart for greenwich conn spoke english fluently albeit with a soft trace of a brogue it only added to his charm they departed for london several days before christmas and riding within the coach with skye and adam conn omalley could scarce be pulled away from the windows his young eyes devoured the passing countryside with its neat farms and orchards and houses the same eyes widened as they passed through the towns with their bustling shops and open markets and fourstory houses he had never in his young life seen the like of it and he was fascinated by it all he asked questions unceasingly and skye suddenly realized how different this last child of her fathers was from his siblings he was she decided more like herself and eibhlin than any of the others she could just imagine brian seated in conns place a dour face on him grumbling the entire way skye was rather happy to get to know conn better and she found that she liked him look conn leaning out the coach window skye pointed london conn omalleys jaw dropped in honest surprise as the city came into his view the churches were enormous with spires that soared skyward as high as the mountains in his homeland the houses were all jammed in together along with the shops and there were more people than hed ever seen in one place at one time the noise was ferocious but it was the stink of the streets that surprised him more than anything else tis worse than an unshoveled cow byre he said adam laughed in a sense thats exactly what it is conn the sanitation isnt the best in london youd best be careful when walking the streets lest you get the contents of a slop jar poured over you should you hear the cry of wareget out of the way lad where are we going conn asked his sister not realizing the size of london he hadnt thought of where they might stay assuming it would be another of the comfortable inns they had stopped at along the way now he wasnt quite so sure i have a house in a small village just bordering the city called chiswick on the strand the house is on the river and within easy barge ride of greenwich your nephew the earl of lynmouth has a house next door to mine his is very grand but mine is quite simple youll be comfortable there brother conn omalleys eyes widened again as the coach trotted smartly through the gates at greenwood a small man holding the gates open doffed his cap respectfully and an equally small lady with a smiling face curtseyed from the gatehouse door skye waved gaily at both of them tis bates and his wife she said to her brother conn sat still and silently the coach made its way through the beautifully landscaped park and up the curving drive to the house skyes brother took in the lovely house of mellowed pink brick partly covered in shiny green ivy before the house now stood several men in greenandwhite livery who hurried to open the carriage door take down the steps and help the occupants forth as they entered the house a slightly more elegant liveried man hurried forward saying welcome home mlady thank you walters skye replied this is my youngest brother master conn omalley hes come to court welcome sir was walterss reply then he turned back to skye and adam a message came for you from greenwich with lord burghleys man it was verbal and i was asked to repeat it to you you are to let lord burghley know as soon as you arrive in london he will inform her majesty and a date will be set for you to be received at greenwich send someone at once adam instructed ive not a doubt the queen is anxious to see us very good mlord skye moved up the main staircase of her house to the library her husband and her brother following behind them the baggage was being brought in and daisy busily directed the footmen with each piece velvet in the arms of her nurse nora a younger cousin of daisys was carried up to her nursery to be put to bed as nora hurried past conn he stopped her long enough to place a soft kiss upon his nieces head good night kitten he said softly have happy dreams you spoil her skye noted but she was pleased that conn had developed such a deep affection for her little daughter an affection that was quite mutual for velvet adored her handsome uncle velvet her mother thought liked all the gentlemen and lord knew the men were easily enamored of her child youre smiling adam said as he poured them each a goblet of red wine im thinking that velvet already knows her powers with regard to the gentlemen skye replied aye conn grinned shes a proper minx velvet is shes but nineteen months old but ive no doubt yed best find her a husband early with luck ye might turn her into a wellbroughtup little lady but i doubt it he chuckled and then he sat down by the fire opposite his sister we have more important things to think on now skye said ive turned you into the perfect courtier conn provided you dont lose your fine irish temper and spoil it there are plenty of irish at court who are civilized despite what some of the greater snobs will say dont let those idiots make you ruin your reputation brother the worst of them are the least among the english and they only naggle at us in order to bolster their own puny egos if you dont let them get to you they will soon grow tired of their silly game and devour each other dont they know that while their ancestors were still painting themselves blue for battle and living in tree shelters we irish had universities and great poets conn demanded irritably no conn darlin they dont know they believe that the sun rises and sets on england and nothing you can say will alter their ignorance dont even try conn you need only have faith in yourself to succeed if you do none of the stupid insults thrown at you will matter remember what da always taught me the survival of the family is paramount conn nothing else matters do you think the queen will see us fairly soon oh yes elizabeth tudor will be curious to meet you oh conn youve such an advantage youre young handsome clever well mannered and fairly well educated in short just the kind of young man the queen adores use that advantage pay her court flirt with her remember though that tis only a game with the queen you will be a success i promise you and then you will get the letters of marque that the omalleys need is she attractive i mean really i know that all the gossips praise her but what is she really like skye shell be forty this year conn shes old enough to be your mother but shes a handsome woman she has marvelous white white skin and golden red hair her eyes are a grayblack and they see everything she is very educated and enjoys quick repartee shes a brilliant and clever woman she likes to dance so there youll shine youll like her but beware little brother she can be stronger and harsher than any man ive ever met if the occasion warrants it you intrigue me sister conn replied i am more anxious than ever now to meet this paragon of womanhood conn omalley arrived at court two days before christmas of he wore dark green velvet and his trunk hose was striped in green velvet and gold silk his doublet was embroidered with gold threads pearls turquoises and small diamonds in a seascape pattern the buttons on the doublet were gold and at the wrists and neck of the garment the finest lace showed he wore a short spanish cape lined in beaver with a halferect collar lined in cloth of gold on his feet he wore tightfitting leather boots with cuffs that turned upward and about his neck was a heavy gold chain and a redgold medallion with the omalley sea dragon carved upon it its ruby eyes most real at the last moment skye had convinced her brother to shave his beard and mustache off entirely and as she had suspected beneath the black hair there was an outrageously handsome face gods blood adam swore looking at the younger man you could be your sisters twin considering im fifteen years older than he is thats quite a compliment my darling skye laughed but i knew there was a handsome devil lurking beneath all that growth dear lord conn the women will be throwing themselves at you youll have your pick of the entire court poor lasses conn mourned with a long face tis only bess tudor ill court both skye and adam laughed and then leading the way they left the house embarking upon their barge they moved downriver to greenwich adam sat silent watching the landscape go by as skye instructed her brother in lastminute details god how beautiful she was adam thought as he watched her she was dressed in crimson velvet her cloak lined and edged in ermine her jewels rubies and diamondssparkling in the torchlight she carried an ermine muff embroidered with diamonds and pearls and framed within the hood of the cloak her face was radiant she scented victory he thought and he was glad once this matter of the omalleys was settled he intended to take her away and never again share her with anyone but their large and loving family the towers of greenwich palace came into view and adam reached out to take his wifes small hand in his own big one she never turned her head but she squeezed him and he squeezed back the barge took its place in the line of barges heading for the royal landing skye oh skye a lovely redhaired woman in the barge ahead of them waved her lace handkerchief frantically skye nodded an acknowledgment as conn noted a prime piece of goods sister you will introduce me to lettice knollys shes the countess of essex conn and much too rich for your blood besides i suspect she is involved with lord dudley though if the queen knew it shed have her cousin lettices pretty head behind us conn said who is that overly fashionable gentleman edward de vere the earl of oxford hes burghleys soninlaw though hes a bad one im told their barge bumped the landing and the queens footmen made it fast so its occupants might disembark they stood a moment upon the quai landing skye shaking her skirts to be sure all the wrinkles were out when lettice knollys approached them skye darling youre back who are these two handsome gentlemen escorting you she demanded playfully lettice my husband adam lord de marisco adam smiled and kissed the countess of essexs beringed hand while she assessed him with frankly admiring eyes and my youngest brother conn omalley conn this is the countess of essex conn slowly lifted lettices hand up to his lips while his graygreen eyes caught her amber ones in a passionate gaze with equal slowness he pressed a long warm kiss upon the milkwhite back of her hand madam he said his eyes never leaving hers i have been told you are but a pale imitation of your cousin the queen but the beauty i see before me blinds me the countess of essex was stunned by this incredible compliment and for a moment she could not draw her breath she felt nearer to fainting than she had ever been in her entire life a slow smile lit conn omalleys face turning up the corners of his sensuous mouth and crinkling the corners of his eyes firmly he tucked lettice knollyss hand into his arm allow me to escort you into the palace madam he said smoothly and then moved off at a sedate pace taking the still stunned countess with him skye bit her lip to keep back the laughter and didnt even dare to look at her husband whom she guessed was in the same state of amusement as she quietly she took adams arm and allowed him to lead her away when she beheved she had regained her control she said softly conn has made an important first conquest i only pray that dudley doesnt see him hovering over lettice like a bee over a particularly fragrant flower dudley doesnt dare to publicly lust after lettice adam replied hell find himself in the tower again if he does no i think if conn manages to be discreet it will be all right they had no sooner entered the palace when lord burghleys secretary was at their side begging them to please follow him skye detached her brother from lettice knollys and drew him off with them so madam you have returned cecil greeted them as they entered his cabinet i hope the news you bring her majesty is good news it may be lord burghley skye replied may be come madam i will accept nothing but success you may have it my lord but only in exchange for something of equal value what maaam we have already given you lands for your son lord burke recognized your marriage to lord de marisco returned lundy isle to him and presented him with lands in worcestershire with a fine manor house the queen has graciously consented to the marriage of your daughter willow small with the earl of alcester what more could you possibly want everything you have said is true my lord burghley but please to note that all that the queen has given has been for others for my husband and my children but there is nothing for me what i want is very little but it is for the omalleys my lord allow me to present to you my youngest brother conn omalley conn this is william cecil lord burghley the queens secretary of state conn made a respectful bow to cecil instinctively understanding that this was a man he could not play with but must be totally honest toward the queens secretary looked the young man over carefully and then said he looks like an omalley that is for certain then he smiled a small sour smile well young master omalley what is it the omalleys desire from the queen letters of marque my lord we are the finest sailors alive we omalleys and tis only natural that we harass our natural enemies the english my sister lady de marisco however has assured me of our demise should we not cease our boyish activities and so she suggested we channel our energies into a little privateering in the new world we might simply go but we feel well be safer sailing under the queens flag and here he grinned broadly a great deal more successful too william cecils eyes never betrayed his thoughts but once more he was admiring of skye he had wondered how she would stop her now grown brothers from their rebellious activities against england once again she had been extremely clever if only she were a man he thought he could have used that intelligence of hers for englands good of course they would give the omalley brothers the letters of marque but twas best to keep them on tenterhooks for a bit i shall have to speak to the queen about this master omalley he said you are asking for something of great value from england i offer england something of equal value conn replied pleasantly but burghley saw the hard look that had come into his eyes the boy might be young but he was his sisters brother lord burghley had not a doubt we shall see we shall see he murmured and then turned back to adam and skye lord de marisco i have here from the queen the papers that will make you the new resident of queens malvern a royal estate outside of worcester her majesty understands that it will not make up for your beloved lundy but she knows you understand her reasons for forbidding you residence on your island adam nodded i understand but please tell her majesty that anyplace skye and i are together is home for me i will thank her majesty myself this evening for her generosity ah yes the christmas revels burghley said go and enjoy yourselves i am happy to tell you that your children do quite well here at court the queen is most pleased with mistress willow whom she is constantly holding up as a model of all the feminine virtues poor willow skye said without thinking how hard that must be on her on the contrary madam she is much envied by her peers yet at the same time both admired and loved by them a fine young woman madam a fine young woman meaning my lord that you wonder how i could have ever raised such a dutiful daughter skye gently teased cecil the secretary of state was not beyond humor and he chuckled with dry mirth quite so madam quite so be patient my lord i have two others one should hopefully prove to be more like her mother we can but wait madam he replied skye swept cecil a generous curtsey dipping low enough to offer him a fine view of her bosom which she noted he was not loath to admire for all his talk of virtue men she thought were ever thus i shall save a dance for you mlord she said mischievously and then taking her husbands arm skye adam and conn exited the room the queen was sitting down to dinner in the banqueting hall and though it was crowded they quickly found places with lettice knollys who couldnt wait to make room for conn omalley dyou think shell devour him whole skye whispered to adam nay lettice may be greedy but shes wise shell eat conn up in little bites he chuckled the hall was decorated with garlands of greenery the fireplaces banked above with masses of pine and holly that gave the room an unusually fragrant scent the tables were laid with white damask linen cloths and by each place was that rarity invented in florence only a few years before the fork it was gold as were the spoons and graceful knives with their sheffield blades the plates used to set her majestys table were silver as were the goblets each one engraved with elizabeth tudors own crest conn never batted an eye his sister had taught him to use forks explaining that the high nobility and royalty in particular no longer liked to see daggers at their tables there was always the chance that the dagger could be turned on ones own self or ones guests instead of the meat a servant hurried up to fill his goblet with a heady red wine conn raised the goblet sniffed appreciatively and took a healthy draught skye had warned him not to swill his wine lest his manners be considered boorish for the queen prized exquisite manners the food was bounteous including shellfish and every other kind of fish hed ever heard of poultry and game birds beef lamb boar ham venison pies with flaky crusts containing lark sparrow and rabbit bowls of carrots and cabbage artichokes in wine cress breads and tubs of butter he was unable to resist such delights but although he ate heartily he ate with delicacy i like a man who enjoys his food lettice murmured and her hand strayed beneath the cloth to squeeze his thigh one healthy appetite is merely indication of another he grinned lazily at her meet me after the banquet lettice suggested eagerly madam you tempt me sorely conn replied with honest regret in both his graygreen eyes and on his handsome face but you must remember that i need your royal cousins favor were we caught my fortunes would be destroyed surely you wouldnt want that lettice pouted you men newly come to court are all so serious in your intent to please bess she is the sun which rises and sets upon our world my beauty my god lettice said drily with a silver tongue like yours conn omalley youll have bess behaving like a schoolgirl i can only hope conn murmured softly and lettice knollys laughed in genuine amusement tell me conn omalley she asked do you make love as well as you talk better he grinned for it takes me less effort and thought lettice knollyss amber eyes narrowed in contemplation methinks you know well the ways of a man and woman conn omalley but i suspect that you need some schooling in the refinements come and see me when youve gotten what you want from my cousin the queen it would be my pleasure to instruct you thoroughly in les arts damour mlady will never have a more willing pupil i can assure you conn proclaimed and then he let his eyes drop to her bosom slowly he feasted himself upon the lush display of ripe flesh and then taking her hand he kissed the palm and the pulse lettice shivered with delight devil she hissed conn skye pulled her brother away from his amorous dalliance the queen has finished eating and tis time for us to present ourselves elizabeth tudor had indeed finished her meal and left the table to sit in a comfortable chair that gave her a full view of the room in the minstrels gallery above the musicians were beginning to tune their instruments and many of the guests had also left the tables to stroll about the floor greeting each other while the servants cleared the tables and moved them away lord and lady de marisco conn omalley safely in tow moved across the floor and stood before elizabeth tudor awaiting her acknowledgment the queen did not keep them standing long with a quick word to the courtier to whom she had been speaking she turned and smiled brilliantly at skye and adam her sharp gaze flicked to conn and obviously liking what she saw she favored him with a smile also majesty adam said may i present to you my wifes brother master conn omalley elizabeth nodded to conn pleasantly you are most welcome at our court master omalley she said conns look was one of intense admiration kneeling he caught at the hem of the queens skirt and kissed it in ireland he said in his soft lilting voice they say ye are the divils own daughter madam but having seen yer majesty i must disagree thou art gloriana herself and i worship willingly at yer feet elizabeths mouth twitched at the corners with suppressed mirth she was not so foolish as to believe his outrageous compliment was totally sincere and from the heart but nonetheless she was flattered rise conn omalley she said i want a better look at you he rose gracefully and the queen assessed him frankly a very handsome lad she thought pleased and quite eager to be in her good graces a sharp irish wit and tongue she had not a doubt ah how she loved such rogues do you dance conn omalley aye gloriana he answered her boldly then youll open the ball with me this night conn omalley elizabeth tudor said standing up and taking his quickly offered arm as at once the musicians began to play sir christopher hatton looked crestfallen for he had fully expected to dance the first dance with the queen the lad was no clod on his feet either he observed although he was not worried about losing his place to this young irish upstart they come and they go the dancing masters murmured a satisfied voice in his ear i wonder how long the bog trotter will last its been a while since shes confined all her attention to you also dudley sir christopher returned the queen being a woman of intellect and refinement likes choice and variety in those about her you bored her to death long ago theyre worse than jealous women adam said low to skye she plays them off against each other so none will ever gain ascendancy over her skye said softly an astute judgment madam said william cecil who without their knowing it had come up behind them dammit mlord you walk like a cat skye said irritably lord burghley gave a dry chuckle a talent that has stood me in good stead on many an occasion you need have no fear madam as long as your intentions toward england are honorable he gently took her arm will you both come with me he asked i have something to say to you that requires privacy they walked with him from the room where the revels were being held and out into the deserted corridor what is it you have to tell us my lord skye said william cecil stopped and looking around to ascertain that they would not be overheard he spoke the queen wishes you to know that should she find your brother worthy of her trust lady de marisco then the patents that he desires for your family will be forthcoming in a few months for now her majesty wishes conn omalley to remain with the court so she may judge his worth after twelfth night however you and lord de marisco arc to be excused from court to go to your new home at queens malvern you are forbidden for the next few months from traveling to france is that understood skye nodded may i tell my brother my lord no it is better he not know for now adam agreed aye my love if conn feels his goal is not yet attained he will continue to be on his best behavior it would not do he finished with meaning for conn to feel free of all restraints yes lord burghley replied her majesty should be most displeased should the young omalley divert his attentions from her to say ah the countess of essex is there anything you dont see my lord skye said amused again the dry chuckle very little madam very little indeed he took her hand and raised it to his lips i would be pleased madam if when we return to the revels you would honor me with your first dance honor you my lord i think it is you who honor me skye said lord burghley smiled his sour smile you omalleys have charm madam i am frankly relieved to find you safely within the keeping of a loyal englishman again we shall have to see what we can do to win over your young brother i tremble to think of any of you loose upon england again there was a day not long ago my lord when you had cause to tremble skye rejoined i shall keep the peace if england does the treachery has never been on my part and well you know it come madam william cecil said pretending to ignore her words both the night and i grow older by the minute then the queens secretary of state led skye back into the paneled chamber where the musicians were playing a sprightly tune the queen was still favoring young conn and he partnered her with grace and charming devotion but everyones attention was diverted from elizabeth tudor and her latest swain by the sight of william cecil dancing gaily with the beautiful lady de marisco it was very rare that the queens loyal and dour servant was seen to dance and no one in the room that night could remember him ever dancing with anyone other than his wife or the queen i think you have made me the envy of all in the room my lord burghley skye laughed nonsense cecil chuckled it is i who am to be envied madam you have caused an outrageous amount of gossip by your behavior my lord skye teased him they will spend days trying to decide why you have danced with me when everyone knows your habit is not to dance yes lord burghley murmured they will wonder wont they why you have done it on purpose skye said delighted by his unlikely attitude yes madam i have it is better that none even yourself madam be too sure of william cecil you have one constant my lord that all may be sure of indeed madam and what is that he cocked an eyebrow at her your loyalty to the queen my lord that will never change cecil nodded you are right skye omalley my loyalty to elizabeth tudor will never change nor will it cease and now madam i will return you to your devoted lord i thank you for the dance it has been a long time since i allowed myself such a frivolity with a gallant bow he handed her over to her husband and skye watched as he moved off back to the queens side adam smiled down on her from his great height you will be both envied and feared by almost everyone in this room for the rest of your stay at court he noted she smiled back at him there are few here i should care to call friends then i know it will not displease you that we are not to follow the court now that we are back in england no it does not displease me i would like at least one of my children to have a secure home with both parents she sighed home i wonder what it will be like adam is the midsection of england beautiful or is the queen punishing us i have only been in the midlands once skye but it is a fair green land of wellwatered valleys and rolling hills it is i think probably the most peaceful place in england i suspect the queen has been kind in her way skye remembered his words some three weeks later as they sat astride their horses looking down upon their new home it was a cold clear day in the middle of january the sky was smooth and bright blue the sun sharp and yellow the land lay brown and quiet in the sparse and frugal warmth of midday above them a small flock of pigeons whirled softly queens malvern was set like a small perfect jewel in a little valley that nesded in the malvern hills between the severn and the wye rivers the house built in the shape of an e had been constructed a hundred years earlier during the reign of edward iv and his wife elizabeth woodville it had been edwards gift to his wife hence its name queens malvern throughout all its years it had remained a royal property now it belonged temporarily to the de marisco family a gift from elizabeth tudor built of mellowed pink brick some of its walls ivy covered it sat silently awaiting its new owners as they rode down the hill to the house skye felt that the building had an almost expectant air about it and she thought to herself we are alike this house and i we both need each other it suddenly came to her that no family had ever really inhabited the place it had always been a royal residence to be visited during a progress if its owners happened to be in the neighborhood still as they approached it she could see with her critical eye that the house appeared to be in good repair the diamondpaned windows were dirty but unbroken as they reached the main entrance of the building it opened and a small man emerged be ye lord de marisco he asked politely i am adam de marisco came the reply im peter the bailiff mlord welcome to queens malvern yell find the house in good condition but there aint much in the way of furnishings being the royalty always carried their things with them theres a good cabinetmaker in the village should ye need him their horses had come to a halt and adam said we left our family and things in worcester while we came on to see the house peter though we have much i am sure my wife will make use of the cabinetmaker peter bobbed his head in acknowledgment of adams words then ill be on my way home mlord the wife and i occupy a little house on the edge of the property if you need anything well be there we will need servants skye spoke tell the village that anyone wishing to enter service should come tomorrow morning aye mlady theres many thatll be happy to hear that news he bobbed his head again and then shuffled off out of sight around the side of the house adam dismounted his horse and tied it to a nearby bush he then helped skye to dismount and secured her mount too for several long minutes they stood looking at the house and about them each caught up in their private thoughts as much as he had loved lundy adam had to admit to himself that this beautiful estate was a better and more fitting place for his wife and child he felt a great contentment as he looked about him skye gazed at the house and thought this is the first home that belongs to adam and me lundy and belle fleur are his greenwood mine lynmouth robins but this is ours and i am at last free of all my responsibilities to the omalleys she smiled thinking about how the queen had made a decision for her that skye hadnt thought she would be able to make herself before they had left london elizabeth tudor had suggested to skye that she appoint her full brother michael omalley to the office of the omalley head of the clan but hes a priest skye had protested i often think that one of the reasons he became a priest was to avoid being the omalley that was when he was a boy the queen replied i understand from the spanish ambassador that the pope intends to appoint your brother to the bishopric held by that old reprobate your late uncle the church doesnt appoint men who avoid responsibility to high places madam if the pope thinks highly of your brother you can think no less none of your other brothers will ever be fit to hold the office i suspect from what master conn has told me let the priest run the family and pass on the office to one of his nephews eventually hell not necessarily pick the eldest and theyll all have to scramble to gain his approval i had thought that perhaps conn would suit skye mused hah the queens bright eyes snapped with amusement conn omalley is an ambitious man madam he seeks to make his fortune here in england i will shortly appoint him to my gentlemen pensioners there is always room for another handsome young man skye was astounded conn she gasped a member of your personal guard aye elizabeth replied hes a rogue tis true madam but he has a good heart ive found be sensible my dear your brother is what is there for conn omalley in ireland not only is he the youngest son he is the youngest child of your father he has neither lands nor wealth to recommend him he must make his own fortune and what better place to make it than here in my service she had known that the queen was right with regard to her brother and after she had spoken with him skye decided to do as the queen suggested and make michael omalley the head of the family the queen had made it very clear that she would no longer tolerate skye in such a position of potential power power that could be used against her i do not mind your dabbling in trade madam but i will not give you shelter and then have you use your omalley ships against me there was a time when skye would have rebelled against such an edict but not now she was wonderfully content with adam and all her children and she wanted peace in her life at last she wrote to her brothers in ireland telling them of her decision to appoint michael the omalley to michael and to anne she wrote the reasons for her decision to her three younger brothers she explained her decision simply by saying that they had too much to do rebuilding their wealth to be bothered with the care of their people with her letters went the queens patents for privateering that the omalley brothers had desired several days after twelfth night skye and adam had left london with deirdre and velvet to travel to their new home bran kelly intended to sail in convoy with robbie to the far east a voyage that would keep them out of england for two to three years daisy therefore decided to stay with skye and packing up her two sons and her elderly motherinlaw she came along dame cecily also getting along in years though she vigorously denied it was persuaded to close up wren court and come to live with the de mariscos havent you always been mother to me and grandmother to my children since i arrived in england skye had demanded i would worry myself to death if you stayed alone down in devon i have stayed alone most of my life dearest skye the old woman protested weakly but i need you dame cecily skye replied and she smiled coaxingly well if you are sure you need me oh i do we both do adam had said putting an arm about dame cecily skye now smiled to herself as she remembered how the tears had filled dame cecilys eyes they were all so fortunate to have each other she stood before queens malvern and she knew with certainty that she had at last come home youre happy adam said quietly yes she answered taking his hand im happy adam my darling do you realize that this is our first real home we are home at long long last my adam yes he replied our home our home for now and for all the sweet tomorrows adam de marisco bent and kissed skye with a deep and passionate kiss then sweeping his wife up into his arms he carried

published in october of the overwhelming response to its heroine was nothing short of incredible no one was more surprised than i was for although i had created skye i had never expected her to assume such largerthanlife proportions the one question asked of me over and over again was will there be a sequel quite honestly at the time i did not think so four husbands five living children and all those passionate adventures seemed quite a feat for a sixteenthcentury irish lady who wasnt even thirty when the novel ended what i had not reckoned on was that although i was through with skye skye was most assuredly not through with me my characters do have a way of taking me over i hope you have enjoyed this sequel to skye omalley and i am pleased to tell you that a third book in this series the story of skye and adams beloved daughter velvet will be coming out eventually do write to me at po box southold ny and tell me if you have enjoyed all the sweet tomorrows as busy as i am i always find time to answer my mail ill be waiting to hear from you bertrice small
