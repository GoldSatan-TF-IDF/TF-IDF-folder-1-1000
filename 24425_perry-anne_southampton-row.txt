anne perry southampton row chapter one im sorry assistant commissioner cornwallis said quietly his face a mask of guilt and unhappiness i did everything i could made every argument moral and legal but i cant fight the inner circle pitt was stunned he stood in the middle of the office with the sunlight splashing across the floor and the noise of horses hooves wheels on the cobbles and the shouts of drivers barely muffled beyond the window pleasure boats plied up and down the thames on the hot june day after the whitechapel conspiracy he had been reinstated as superintendent of the bow street police station queen victoria herself had thanked him for his courage and loyalty now cornwallis was dismissing him again they cant pitt protested her majesty herself cornwalliss eyes did not waver but they were filled with misery they can they have more power than you or i will ever know the queen will hear what they want her to if we take it to her believe me you will have nothing left not even special branch narraway will be glad to have you back the words seemed forced from him harsh in his throat take it pitt for your own sake and your familys it is the best youll get and youre good at it no one could measure what you did for your country in beating voisey at whitechapel beating him pitt said bitterly hes knighted by the queen and the inner circle is still powerful enough to say who shall be superintendent of bow street and who shant cornwallis winced the skin drawn tight across the bones of his face i know but if you hadnt beaten him england would now be a republic in turmoil perhaps even civil war and voisey would be the first president thats what he wanted you beat him pitt never doubt it and never forget it either he wont pitts shoulders slumped he felt bruised and weary how would he tell charlotte she would be furious for him outraged at the unfairness of it she would want to fight but there was nothing to do he knew that he was only arguing with cornwallis because the shock had not passed the rage at the injustice of it he had really believed his position at least was safe after the queens acknowledgment of his worth youre due a holiday cornwallis said take it im im sorry i had to tell you before pitt could think of nothing to say he had not the heart to be gracious go somewhere nice right out of london cornwallis went on the country or the sea yes i suppose so it would be easier for charlotte for the children she would still be hurt but at least they would have time together it was years since they had taken more than a few days and just walked through woods or over fields eaten picnic sandwiches and watched the sky charlotte was horrified but after the first outburst she hid it perhaps largely for the childrens sake tenandahalfyearold jemima was instant to pick up any emotion and daniel two years younger was quick behind instead she made much of the chance for a holiday and began to plan when they should go and to think about how much they could afford to spend within days it was arranged they would take her sister emilys son with them as well he was the same age and was keen to escape the formality of the schoolroom and the responsibilities he was already learning as his fathers heir emilys first husband had been lord ashworth and his death had left the title and bulk of the inheritance to their only son edward they would stay in a cottage in the small village of harford on the edge of dartmoor for two and a half weeks by the time they returned the general election would be over and pitt would report again to narraway at special branch the infant service set up largely to battle the fenian bombers and the whole bedeviled irish question of home rule which gladstone was fighting all over again and with as little hope of success as ever i dont know how much to take for the children charlotte said as if it were a question how dirty will they get i wonder they were in the bedroom doing the last of the packing before going for the midday train south and west very i hope pitt replied with a grin it isnt healthy for a child to be clean not a boy anyway then you can do some of the laundry she replied instantly ill show you how to use a flatiron its very easyjust heavyand tedious he was about to retaliate when their maid gracie spoke from the doorway theres a cabbie ere with a message for yer mr pitt she said e give me this she offered him a piece of paper folded over he took it and opened it up pitt i need to see you immediately come with the bearer of this message narraway what is it charlotte asked a sharp edge to her voice as she watched his expression change whats happened i dont know he replied narraway wants to see me but it cant be much im not starting back with special branch for another three weeks naturally she knew who narraway was although she had never met him ever since her first encounter with pitt eleven years ago in she had played a lively part in every one of his cases that aroused her curiosity or her outrage or in which someone she cared about was involved in fact it was she who had befriended the widow of john adinetts victim in the whitechapel conspiracy and finally discovered the reason for his death she had a better idea than anyone else outside special branch of who narraway was well youd better tell him not to keep you long she said angrily you are on holiday and have a train to catch at noon i wish hed called tomorrow when wed have been gone i dont suppose its much he said lightly he smiled but the smile was a trifle downturned at the corners thereve been no bombings lately and with an election coming at any time there probably wont be for a while then why can it not wait until you come back she asked it probably can he shrugged ruefully but i cant afford to disobey him it was a hard reminder of his new situation he reported directly to narraway and he had no recourse beyond him no public knowledge no open court to appeal to as he had had when a policeman if narraway refused him there was nowhere else to turn yes she lowered her eyes i know just remind him about the train there isnt a later one to get there tonight i will he kissed her swiftly on the cheek and then turned and went out of the door and down the stairs to the pavement where the cabbie waited for him right sir the cabbie asked from the box yes pitt accepted he glanced up at him then climbed into the hansom and sat down as it started to move what could victor narraway want from him that could not as easily wait until he reported back in three weeks was it just an exercise of his power to establish again who was master it could hardly be for his opinion he was still a novice at special branch work he knew almost nothing about the fenians he had no expertise in dynamite or any other explosives he knew very little about conspiracies in quarrel nor in honesty did he want to he was a detective a policeman his skill was in solving crimes unraveling the details and the passions of individual murder not the machinations of spies anarchists and political revolutionaries he had succeeded brilliantly in whitechapel but that was over now all that they would ever know of the truth rested in silence darkness and bodies decently buried to hide the terrible things that had happened to them charles voisey was still alive and they could prove nothing against him but there had been a kind of justice he secret hero of the movement to overthrow the throne had been maneuvered into seeming to have risked his life to save it pitt smiled and felt his throat tighten with grief as he remembered standing beside charlotte and vespasia in buckingham palace as the queen had knighted voisey for his services to the crown voisey had risen from his knees too incensed with rage to speakwhich victoria had taken for awe and smiled indulgently the prince of wales had praised him and voisey had turned and walked back past pitt with a hatred in his eyes like the fires of hell even now pitt felt a cold knot tighten in his stomach remembering it yes dartmoor would be good great clean winddriven skies the smell of earth and grass on unpaved lanes they would walk and talk together or simply walk he would fly kites with daniel and edward climb some of the tors collect things watch the birds or animals charlotte and jemima could do whatever they wished visit people make new friends look at gardens or search for wildflowers the cab stopped ere yare sir the driver called go right in gentlemans expecting yer thank you pitt climbed out and walked across the pavement to the steps leading up to a plain wooden door it was not the shop in the back room of which he had found narraway in whitechapel perhaps he moved around as the need directed pitt opened the door without knocking and went in he found himself in a passage which led to a pleasant sitting room with windows onto a tiny garden which was mostly crowded with overgrown roses badly in need of pruning victor narraway was sitting in one of the two armchairs and he looked up at pitt without rising he was a slender man very neatly dressed of average height but nevertheless his appearance was striking because of the intelligence in his face even in repose there was an energy within him as if his mind never rested he had thick dark hair now liberally sprinkled with gray hooded eyes which were almost black and a long straight nose sit down he ordered as pitt remained on his feet i have no intention of staring up at you and you will grow tired in time and start to fidget which will annoy me pitt put his hands in his pockets i havent long im going to dartmoor on the noon train narraways heavy eyebrows rose with your family yes of course im sorry there is nothing to be sorry about pitt replied i shall enjoy it very much and after whitechapel i have earned it you have narraway agreed quietly nevertheless you are not going yes i am they had known each other only a few months worked very loosely together on just the one case it was not like pitts long relationship with cornwallis whom he liked profoundly and would have trusted more than any other man he could think of he was still unsure what he felt about narraway and certainly he did not trust him in spite of his conduct in whitechapel he believed narraway served the country and was a man of honor according to his own code of ethics but pitt did not yet understand what they were and there was no bond of friendship between them narraway sighed please sit down pitt i expect you to make this morally uncomfortable for me but be civil enough not to make it physically so as well i dislike craning my neck to stare up at you i am going to dartmoor today pitt repeated but he did sit down in the other chair this is the eighteenth of june parliament will rise on the twentyeighth narraway said wearily as if the knowledge was sad and indescribably exhausting there will be a general election immediately i daresay we shall have the first results by the fourth or fifth of july then i shall forfeit my vote pitt replied because i shall not be at home i daresay it will make no difference whatever narraway looked at him steadily is your constituency so corrupt pitt was slightly surprised i dont think so but it has been liberal for years and general opinion seems to be that gladstone will get in but with a narrow majority you havent called me here three weeks before i start in order to tell me that not precisely not even approximately pitt started to rise sit down narraway ordered with a suppressed rage making his voice cut like a blow pitt sat more out of surprise than obedience you handled the whitechapel business well narraway said in a calm quiet voice leaning back again and crossing his legs you have courage imagination and initiative you even have morality you defeated the inner circle in court although you might have thought twice had you known it was they you were against you are a good detective the best i have god help me he replied most of my men are more used to explosives and assassination attempts you did well to defeat voisey at all but your turning of the murder on its head to have him knighted for saving the throne was brilliant it was the perfect revenge his republican friends regard him as the archtraitor to the cause the merest smile touched narraways lips he was once their future president now they wouldnt allow him to lick stamps it should have been the highest praise yet looking at narraways steady shadowed eyes pitt felt only awareness of danger he will never forgive you for it narraway observed as casually as if he had done no more than remark the time pitts throat tightened so his answer was scratchy i know that i had never imagined he would but you also said at the end of the affair that it would be nothing so simple as physical violence his hands were stiff his body cold not for himself but for charlotte and the children it wont be narraway said gently for an instant there was a softness in his face then it was gone again but he has turned your stroke of genius to his own use that is his genius pitt cleared his throat i dont know what you mean he is a hero knighted by the queen for saving the throne narraway said uncrossing his legs and leaning forward a sudden passion of bitterness twisting his face he is going to stand for parliament pitt was stunned what you heard what i said he is standing for parliament and if he wins he will use the inner circle to rise very quickly to high office he has resigned his place on the appeal court bench and taken to politics the next government will be conservative and it will not be long in coming gladstone wont last apart from the fact that he is eightythree home rule will finish him his eyes did not move from pitts face then we will see voisey as lord chancellor head of the empires judiciary he will have the power to corrupt any court in the land which means in the end all of them it was appalling but pitt could already see how it was possible every argument died on his lips before he spoke it narraway relaxed fractionally an easing of the muscles so slight it was barely visible hes standing for the south lambeth seat pitt quickly thought of his london geography wouldnt that take in camberwell or brixton both narraways eyes were steady and yes its a liberal seat and hes conservative but that doesnt ease my mind and if it eases yours then youre a fool it doesnt pitt said coldly hell have a reason therell be somebody he can bribe or intimidate some place where the inner circle has its power he can use who is the liberal candidate narraway nodded very slowly still looking at pitt a new man one aubrey serracold pitt asked the obvious is he inner circle and will stand down at the last moment or throw the election in some other way no narraway said it with certainty but he did not explain how he knew if he had sources somewhere deep inside the inner circle he did not disclose them even to his own men pitt would have thought less of him if he had if i could see where it was coming from or how i wouldnt need you to stay in london and watch narraway continued throwing you out of bow street may prove to be one of their greatest mistakes it was a reminder of their power and the injustice against pitt precise knowledge of what he was saying sparkled hard and bright in his eyes and he made no pretense to hide it they both knew he did not need to i cant affect the vote pitt said bitterly it was no longer an argument against losing his holiday and his time with charlotte and the children it was helplessness in the face of an insoluble problem he could see nowhere even to begin let alone to achieve a victory no narraway agreed if i wanted something like that done i have more skilled men for it than you it would also make you little better than voisey pitt said with chill narraway sighed shifting his position to one more at ease you are naive pitt but i knew that i work with the tools i have and i dont try to saw wood with a screwdriver you will watch and listen you will learn who are voiseys tools and how he uses them you will learn serracolds weaknesses and where they may be exploited and if we are fortunate enough that voisey has any unguarded vulnerabilities then you will find them and inform me immediately he breathed in and out very slowly what i may choose to do about him is not your concern understand me in that pitt you are not exercising your conscience at the expense of the ordinary men and women of this country you know only a small part of the picture and you are not in a position to make grand moral judgments there was not a shred of any kind of humor in his eyes or his mouth the flippant answer died on pitts tongue what narraway was asking of him seemed all but impossible had he any idea of the real power of the inner circle it was a secret society of men sworn to support each other above all interests or loyalties apart they existed in cells no one man knowing the identities of more than a handful of others but obedient to the demands of the circle he knew of no instance in which one had betrayed another to the outside world internal justice was immediate and lethal it was the more deadly because one never knew who else was circle it could be your superior or some ordinary clerk of whom you took little notice it could be your doctor your bank manager or even your clergyman only one thing were you certain of it was not your wife no woman was allowed any part in it or knowledge of it whatever i know the seat is liberal narraway was going on but the political climate at the moment is turning extreme the socialists are not only noisy but making actual headway in some areas you said voisey was standing as a tory pitt pointed out why because there will be a conservative backlash narraway replied if the socialists go far enough and mistakes are made then it could sweep the tories into power for a long timequite long enough for voisey to become lord chancellor even prime minister one day the thought was cold and ugly and certainly too real to dismiss to turn away from it as farfetched was to hand voisey the ultimate weapon you said parliament rises in four days pitt asked thats right narraway agreed youll start this afternoon he took a deep breath im sorry pitt what charlotte said incredulously she was standing at the bottom of the stairs facing pitt as he had come in through the front door her face was flushed with exertion and now temper i have to stay because theres going to be a general election he repeated voiseys going to stand she stared at him for a moment all the memories of whitechapel came back and she understood then she closed it from her mind and what are you supposed to do about it she demanded you cant stop him from standing and you cant stop people from voting for him if they want to its monstrous but it is we who made him into a hero because it was the only way to stop him the republicans wont even speak to him now let alone elect him why cant you let them deal with him theyll be furious enough to shoot him just dont stop them arrive too late he tried to smile unfortunately i cant rely on their doing that efficiently enough to be of any use to us we have only about ten days you have three weeks holiday she bit back sudden tears of disappointment its not fair what can you do tell everybody hes a liar that he was behind the conspiracy to overthrow the throne she shook her head nobody even knows there was one hed have you sued for slander or more likely locked up as a lunatic we made sure everyone believed he practically singlehandedly did something wonderful for the queen she thinks hes marvelous the prince of wales and all his friends will be behind him she sniffed fiercely and no one will beat themnot with randolph churchill and lord salisbury as well he leaned against the newel post i know he admitted i wish i could tell the prince of wales how close voisey came to destroying him but we have no proof now he reached forward and touched her cheek im sorry i know i havent much chance but i have to try the tears brimmed over her cheeks ill unpack in the morning im too tired to do it now what on earth am i going to tell daniel and jemimaand edward theyve been looking forward to it so much dont unpack he interrupted you go alone her voice rose to a squeak take gracie ill manage he did not want to tell her how much it was for her safety at the moment she was angry and disappointed but in time she would realize he was challenging voisey again what will you eat what will you wear she protested mrs brody can cook something for me and do the linen he answered dont worry take the children enjoy it with them whether voisey wins or loses theres nothing i can do after the results are in ill come down then therell be no time left she said angrily results go on coming in for weeks hes standing for a london seat itll be one of the first it could still be days charlotte i cant help it her voice was barely controlled i know dont be so damnably reasonable dont you even mind doesnt it infuriate you she swung her hand violently fist tight it isnt fair they have loads of other people first they throw you out of bow street and send you to live in some wretched rooms in spitalfields then when you save the government and the throne and heaven knows what else they reinstate youthen throw you out again now theyre taking your only holiday she gasped for breath and it turned into a sob and for what nothing at all you cant stop voisey if people are stupid enough to believe him i hate special branch it seems they dont have to answer to anyone they do whatever they like and theres nobody to stop them a bit like voisey and the inner circle he replied trying to smile very slightly just like him for all i know she met his eyes squarely but there was a flash of light in hers in spite of her attempts to hide it but nobody can stop him i did once we did she corrected him sharply this time he did smile theres no murder now nothing for you to solve or you she countered immediately what you mean is its all about politics and elections and women dont even vote much less campaign and stand for parliament do you want to he said with surprise he was happy to talk about any subject even that one rather than tell her how he feared for her safety once voisey knew he was involved again certainly not she retorted but thats got nothing to do with it an excellent piece of logic she poked a stray piece of hair back into its pin if you were at home and spent more time with the children youd understand it perfectly what he said with total disbelief the fact that i dont want it doesnt mean i shouldnt be allowed itif i did ask any man he shook his head ask him what whether he would let me or anybody else decide whether he could or not she said in exasperation could or could not do what anything she said impatiently as if it had been obvious its one lot of people making rules for another lot of people to live by when they wouldnt accept them themselves for heavens sake thomas havent you ever told children to do something and theyve said to you well you dont you may tell them theyre impertinent and send them upstairs to bed but you know its unfair and you know they know it too he blushed hot at one or two memories he forbore from drawing any similarities between the publics attitude to women and parents towards children he did not want to quarrel with her he knew why she spoke as she did he felt the same anger and disappointment choking inside himself and there were better ways of showing it than temper youre right he said unequivocally her eyes opened wide for a moment in surprise then in spite of herself she started to laugh she put her arms around his neck and he took hold of her drawing her body to his caressing her shoulder the soft line of her neck and then kissing her pitt went to the station with charlotte gracie and the children it was a huge echoing place crowded with people hurrying in all directions it was the terminus for the london and south western line and the air was loud with the hiss of escaping steam clanging doors feet on the platform walking running shuffling wheels of luggage trolleys shouts of greeting and farewell an excitement of adventure it was full of beginnings and endings daniel jiggled up and down with impatience edward fairhaired like emily tried to remember the dignity of being lord ashworth and succeeded for a full five minutes before racing along the platform to see the fires roaring as a stoker poked more coal into the bottom of a vast engine the stoker looked up smiling at the boy before wiping his hand across his brow and beginning again boys jemima muttered under her breath with a glance at charlotte gracie still not much larger than when she had entered their employ as a thirteenyearold was dressed up for traveling it was the second time she had been away from london on holiday and she was managing to look very experienced and calm except for the brilliance of her eyes and the flush in her cheeksand the fact that she clung on to her softsided bag as if it were a life preserver pitt knew they must go it was for their safety and he wanted to be free of anxiety and certain he could face voisey with the knowledge they were where he could never find them but he still felt an ache of sadness inside himself as he called a porter over and instructed him to put their luggage into the van giving him threepence for his trouble the porter tipped his cap and piled the cases onto his trolley he whistled as he pushed it away but the sound was lost in the roar of a belch of steam the sliding of coal off the shovels into the furnaces the guards shrill whistle blast as an engine jolted forward and began to pick up speed pulling out daniel and edward raced each other along the platform looking for the least occupied compartment and came back waving their arms and whooping with triumph they put their hand baggage inside then came to the door to say goodbye look after each other pitt told them after he had hugged them all including gracie to her surprise and pleasure and enjoy yourselves have every bit of fun you can another door clanged shut and there was a jolt time to go pitt said and with a wave he stepped back as the carriage lurched and juddered the couplings locked and it moved forward he stood watching seeing them leaning out of the window charlotte holding them back her face suddenly bleak with loneliness as she was pulled away clouds of steam billowed upwards and drifted towards the vast manyarched roof there were smuts in the air and the smell of soot and iron and fire he waved until they were out of sight as the train curved around the track then he walked as fast as he could back along the platform and out into the street at the cab rank he climbed into the first hansom and told the driver to take him to the house of commons he sat back and composed his mind to what he would say when he got there he was south of the river now but it would not take him long even in the midmorning traffic the houses of parliament were on the north bank perhaps thirty minutes away he had always cared intensely about social injustice the pain of poverty and disease ignorance and prejudice but his opinion of politicians was not high and he doubted that they would address many of the issues that troubled him unless forced into it by individuals with a passion for reform now was a good time to reassess that rather hasty judgment and learn a great deal more about both the individuals and the process he would begin with his brotherinlaw jack radley emilys second husband and the father of her daughter evangeline when they had first met jack had been a charming man without either title or sufficient money to make any mark in society but with the wit and the good looks to be invited to so many houses that he enjoyed an elegant life of considerable comfort after marrying emily jack had felt an increasing emptiness in that way of existence until on an impulse he had stood for parliament and surprised everyone especially himself by winning it might have been the tide of political fortune or that his seat was in one of the many constituencies where corruption determined the outcome but he had since become a politician of some thought and more principle than his earlier years might have led anyone to foresee during the irish affair in ashworth hall he had shown both courage and an ability to act with dignity and good judgment at the least he would be able to give pitt information of a more detailed nature and perhaps more accurately than pitt could gain from a public source he reached the house of commons paid the cabdriver and went up the steps he did not expect to be able to walk straight in and was preparing to write a small note on one of his cards and have it taken to jack but the policeman at the door knew him from his days at bow street and his face lit with pleasure morning mr pitt sir nice to see you sir no trouble ere i ope none at all rogers pitt replied grateful he could recall the mans name i want to see mr radley if possible it is a matter of some importance right you are then sir rogers turned and called over his shoulder george take mr pitt up ter see mr radley will yer know im honorable member for chiswick he looked back at pitt you go with george ere sir ell take yer up because yer can get lost in ten minutes in this rabbit warren of a place thank you rogers pitt said with sincerity thats very good of you it was indeed a tangle of passages and stairways with offices at every turn and people coming and going all distracted with their own business he found jack alone in a room which was obviously shared with someone else a good deal of the time he thanked his guide and waited until he had left before closing the door and turning to speak jack radley was approaching forty but a man of very good looks and natural warmth which made him seem younger now he was surprised to see pitt but he set aside the newspapers he had been reading and faced him with curiosity sit down he invited him what brings you here i thought you were going to take a longoverdue holiday you have edward with you there was a shadow behind his eyes and pitt realized with a bitter humor that he was aware of the injustice of pitts present position with the special branch and afraid that pitt was going to ask for his help in reversing it it was something he could not do and pitt knew that even better than he did charlotte has taken the children pitt replied edward was full of excitement and ready to drive the train himself i have to stay here for a while as you know theres going to be an election in a few days he allowed a flash of humor in his face and then lost it again for reasons i cannot explain i need some information on the issues and some of the people jack drew in his breath special branch reasons pitt smiled at him not personal jack colored slightly he was not often wrongfooted by anyone least of all pitt who was unused to political debate and the thrust and cut of opposition perhaps jack had forgotten that the questioning of suspects held many of the same elements the obliqueness the study of face and gesture the anticipation and the ambush what issues jack asked theres home rule for ireland but then there has been for generations its no better than it ever was although gladstones sticking to it its brought him down once already and i think it will certainly cost him votes again but no one can pry him loose from it though god knows enough have tried he pulled a slightly rueful face but rather less often argued about is home rule for scotlandor wales pitt was startled home rule for wales he said incredulously what backing is there for that not a great deal jack admitted or scotland either but it is an issue surely it wont affect the london seats it might if you were arguing for it jack shrugged actually on the whole the people most against such things are those geographically the farthest from them londoners tend to think westminster should rule everything the more power you have the more you want home rule at least for ireland has been on the agenda for decades pitt set it aside temporarily what else the eighthour day jack replied grimly thats the biggest at least so far and i dont see anything else equaling it he looked at pitt with a slight frown what is it thomas a plot to overthrow the old man he was referring to gladstone there had already been attempts on his life no pitt said quickly nothing so overt he wished he could tell jack the whole truth but for jacks sake as much as his own he could not any betrayal must not be blamed on him corrupt constituences some dirty fighting since when did special branch care about that jack said skeptically leaning back a little in his chair his elbow inadvertently knocking over a pile of books and papers they are supposed to be stopping anarchists and dynamiters especially fenians he frowned dont lie to me thomas id rather you told me to mind my own business than fob me off with an evasion its not an evasion pitt replied its a particular seat and so far as i know it has no irish dimension nor any dynamiters why you jack said levelly is it anything to do with the adinett case he was referring to the murder which had so infuriated voisey and the inner circle they had taken their revenge on pitt by having him dismissed from bow street indirectly pitt admitted you are almost at the point where you would rather be told to mind your own business which seat jack said perfectly calmly i cant help you if i dont know you cant help me anyway pitt countered dryly except with information about the issues and the odd warning about tactics i wish i had paid more attention to politics in the past jack grinned suddenly but it was not without selfmockery when i think how narrow our majority is going to be so do i pitt wanted to ask about the safety of jacks own seat but it would be better to find out from someone else do you know aubrey serracold he asked instead jack looked surprised yes actually i know him moderately well his wife is a friend of emilys he frowned why thomas id stake a great deal hes a decent manhonest intelligent and going into politics to serve his country he has no need of money and no desire to wield power for itself pitt should have been comforted but instead he saw a man in danger from something he would never see until it was too late he might well not recognize an enemy even then because his nature was outside serracolds understanding was jack right and in not telling him the truth was pitt throwing away perhaps the only weapon he possessed narraway had given him a task that seemed impossible as it stood it was not detecting as he was used to it he was seeking not to solve a crime but to prevent a sin one which was against the moral law but probably not the law of the land it was not that voisey should have the powerhe had as much right as any other candidateit was what he would do with it in perhaps two or three years or even five or ten that was wrong and you cannot punish a man for what you believe he may do no matter how evil jack leaned forward across his desk thomas serracold is a friend of mine if he is in some kind of danger any kind let me know he made no threats and produced no arguments which was oddly more persuasive than if he had i would protect my friends just as you would yours personal loyalty means something and the day it doesnt i want no part of politics anymore even when pitt had feared jack courted emily for her moneyand he had feared ithe had still found him impossible to dislike there was a warmth in him an ability to mock himself and yet keep the directness which was the essence of his charm pitt had no chance of success without taking risks because there was no safe way even to begin let alone to conclude a fight against voisey not physical danger so far as i know he replied hoping he was right in his decision to defy narraway and confide at least some portion of the truth in jack please heaven it did not come back and betray them both danger of being cheated out of his seat jack waited as if he knew that was not all and perhaps of being ruined in reputation pitt added by whom if i knew that i would be in a far better position to guard against it you mean you cant tell me i mean i dont know then why you know something or you wouldnt be here for political gain of course then it is his opponent who else those behind him jack started to argue then stopped i suppose everybody has someone behind him the ones you can see are the least worry he stood up slowly he was almost the same height as pitt but as elegant as pitt was untidy he had natural grace and was still as meticulously dressed and groomed as in the days when he made his way on his charm ill be happy to continue this conversation but i have a meeting in an hour and i havent had a decent meal today will you join me ill be happy to pitt accepted immediately rising also be my guest in the members dining room jack suggested opening the door for pitt he hesitated a moment as if worrying over pitts clean collar but crooked tie and slightly bulging pockets he sighed and gave up pitt followed him and took his place at one of the tables he was fascinated he hardly tasted his food he was so busy trying to watch the other diners without appearing to do so he saw face after face he had seen in the newspapers many whose names he knew others familiar but he could not place them he kept hoping he might see gladstone himself jack sat smiling considerably entertained they were halfway through a dessert of hot treacle pudding and custard when a large man with thinning fair hair stopped by jack introduced him as finch the honorable member for one of the birmingham constituencies and pitt as his brotherinlaw without stating any occupation how do you do finch said civilly then looked at jack hey radley have you heard that this fellow hardie is actually going to stand and in west ham south not even in scotland hardie jack frowned keir hardie finch said impatiently ignoring pitt fellows been down the mines since he was ten years old god knows if he even can read or write and hes standing for parliament labor party he says whatever that is he spread his hands in a sharp gesture its no good radley thats our territory trades unions and all that he wont get in of coursenot a cats chance but we cant afford to lose any support this time he lowered his voice its going to be a tight thing too damned tight we cant give in on the working week wed be crippled it would ruin us in months but i wish to the devil the old man would forget home rule for a while hell bring us down a majoritys a majority jack replied twenty or thirty is still workable finch grunted no it isnt not for long we need fifty at least nice to have met you pitt pitt did you say good tory name not a tory are you pitt smiled shouldnt i be finch looked at him his light blue eyes suddenly very direct no sir you shouldnt you should look towards the future and steady wise reform no selfinterested conservatism that will alter nothing remain fixed in the past as if it were stone and no harebrained socialism that would alter everything good and bad alike as if it were all written in water and the past meant nothing this is the greatest nation on earth sir but we still need much wisdom at the helm if we are to keep it so in these changing times in that at least i can agree with you pitt replied keeping his voice light finch hesitated a moment then bade him goodbye and left walking briskly his shoulders hunched as if he were fighting his way through a crowd although in fact he passed only a waiter with a tray pitt was following jack out of the dining room when they all but bumped into the prime minister lord salisbury on his way in he was dressed in a pinstriped suit his long rather sad face fullbearded but almost bald to the crown of his head pitt was so fascinated that it was a moment before he looked fully at the man a step behind him but obviously in his company his features were strong intelligent his nose a trifle crooked his skin pale for an instant their eyes met and pitt was frozen by the power of hatred he saw looking back at him as if they were the only two in the room all the noise of talk laughter clink of glass and crockery vanished time was suspended there was nothing but the will to hurt to destroy then the present rolled back like a wave human busy argumentative selfabsorbed salisbury and his companion went in pitt and jack radley went out they were twenty yards down the corridor before jack spoke who was that with salisbury he asked you know him sir charles voisey pitt replied startled to hear how his voice rasped prospective parliamentary candidate for lambeth south jack stopped thats serracolds constituency yes pitt replied steadily yes i know that jack let out his breath very slowly understanding filled his face and the beginning of fear chapter two pitt found the house uniquely lonely without charlotte and the children he missed the warmth the sound of laughter excitement even the occasional quarreling there was no clatter of gracies heels on the floor or her wry comments only the two cats archie and angus curled up asleep in the patches of sun that came through the kitchen windows but when he remembered the hatred in voiseys eyes relief washed over him with an intensity that caught his breath that they were out of london far away where neither voisey nor any of the inner circle would find them a small cottage in a country hamlet on the edge of dartmoor was as safe as anywhere possible that knowledge left him free to do all he could to stop voisey from winning the seat and beginning the climb to a power which would corrupt the conscience of the land although as he sat at the kitchen table over breakfast of toast he had definitely scorched homemade marmalade and a large pot of tea he was daunted by a task so nebulous so uncertain there was no mystery to solve no explanation to unravel and too little specific to seek his only weapon was knowledge the seat voisey was contesting had been liberal for years whose vote did he hope to sway he was standing for the tories the only alternative to the liberals with any chance of forming a government even though the majority opinion was that this time mr gladstone would win even if his administration did not last long he took another piece of toast from the rack where he had set it and spread it with butter he spooned out a very good helping of marmalade he liked the pungent taste of it sharp enough to feel as if it filled his head did voisey intend somehow to win the middle ground and so enlarge his share of the vote or to disenchant the poorer men and drive them towards socialism and so split the leftwing support had he some weapon as yet undisclosed with which to damage aubrey serracold and so cripple his campaign he could not openly do all three but then with the inner circle behind him he did not need to be open no one outside the very top of its power perhaps no one but voisey himself knew the names or positions of all its members or even how many there were he finished the toast drank the last of the tea and left the dishes where they were mrs brody would wash up when she came and no doubt feed archie and angus again it was eight oclock in the morning and time he began to acquire more knowledge of voiseys platform the issues he was making the core of his appeal who his open supporters were and where he was going to speak pitt already knew from jack the bare outline of these things regarding serracold but it was not enough it was late june and the city was hot dusty and crammed with traffic of every sorttrade business and pleasure street peddlers cried their wares on almost every pavement corner open carriages held ladies who were out to see the sights keeping the sun from their faces with an array of parasols in pretty colors like enormous overblown flowers there were heavy wagons carrying bales of goods vegetable and milk carts omnibuses and the usual hordes of hansom cabs even the footpaths were crowded and pitt had to weave his way in and out the noise was an assault on the ears and the mind chatter street cries of vendors of a hundred different articles for sale the rattle of wheels on cobbles the jingle of harness shouts of frustrated drivers the sharp clip of horses hooves he would prefer voisey to be as little aware of him as possible although after their meeting in the house of commons it could no longer be secret that pitt was watching the campaign he regretted that but it could not be undone and perhaps it was inevitable it just would have been better delayed even a short while voisey might have been sufficiently absorbed in his political battles and the exhilaration of the campaign not to have noticed one more persons interest in him by five oclock pitt knew the names of those backing voiseys candidacy both publicly and privately at least those of record he also knew that the issues voisey had espoused were the traditional mainstream tory values of trade and empire it was obvious how these would appeal to the property owners the manufacturers and shipping barons but now the vote had extended to the ordinary man who possessed nothing more than his house or rented rooms worth above ten pounds a year and surely they were natural supporters of trades unions and so of the liberal party the fact that it seemed an impossible seat for voisey to win worried pitt far more than had he seen some opening some weakness that could be exploited it meant that the attack was coming from an angle he had no idea how to protect and he did not even know where the vulnerability lay he made his way south of the river towards the docks and factories in the shadow of the london bridge railway terminal with the intention of joining the crowd of workers at the first of voiseys public speeches he was intensely curious to see both how voisey behaved and what kind of reception he would receive he stopped at one of the public houses and had a pork pie and a glass of cider keeping his ear to the conversations at the tables around him there was a good deal of laughter but underneath it an unmistakably bitter note as well he heard only one reference to the irish or the vexed question of home rule and even that was treated half jokingly but the matter of hours to the working day aroused hot feelings and some considerable support for the socialists even though hardly anyone seemed to know the names of any of them certainly pitt did not hear sidney webb or william morris mentioned nor the eloquent and vociferous playwright shaw by seven oclock he was standing in the open outside one of the factory gates the gray flat sides of the buildings soaring up into the smokefilled air above him the clang of machinery beat a steady rhythm in the distance and the smell of coke fumes and acids caught his throat around him were five or six score men in uniform browns and grays color worn out of the fabric patched and repatched frayed at the cuffs worn at the elbows and knees many of them had cloth caps on even though the evening was mild and far more unusually there was no chill blowing up from the river the cap was habit almost a part of identity pitt passed unnoticed among them his natural scruffiness a perfect disguise he listened to their laughter their rowdy often cruel jokes and heard the note of despair underneath and the longer he listened the less could he imagine how voisey with his money his privilege his polished manner and now his title as well could win over a single one of them let alone the bulk voisey stood for everything that oppressed them and which they perceived correctly or not to be exploiting their labor and stealing their rewards it frightened him because he knew far better than to believe voisey was a dreamer trusting to any kind of luck the crowd was just beginning to get restive and speak of leaving when a hansom not a carriage came to a stop about twenty yards away and pitt saw the tall figure of voisey get out and walk towards them it gave pitt an odd shiver of apprehension as if even in all this crowd voisey could see him and the hatred could burn across the air and find him come after all ave yer a voice called out for a moment breaking the spell of course i have come voisey called back turning to face them his head high his expression half amused pitt invisible one anonymous face among the hundred or so men you have votes dont you half a dozen men laughed at least e int pretending as e gives a damn about us someone said a few yards to pitts left id rather ave a bastard wots onest than one wot aint voisey walked over to the wagon which had been left as a makeshift platform and with an easy movement climbed up into it there was a rustle of attention but it was hostile waiting for the opportunity to criticize challenge and abuse voisey seemed to be alone but pitt noticed the two or three policemen standing well back and half a dozen or more newly arrived men all watching the crowd burly men in quiet drab clothing but with a fluidity of movement and a restlessness quite unlike the weariness of the factory workers youve come to look at me voisey began because you are curious to see what i am going to say and if i can come up with anything at all to justify your voting for me and not for the liberal candidate mr serracold whose party has represented you as far back as you can remember and perhaps you expect a little entertainment at my expense there was a rumble of laughter and one or two catcalls well what do you want from government voisey asked and before he could answer himself he was shouted down less taxes someone yelled to accompanying jeers shorter hours a decent working week no longer than yours more laughter but sharpedged angry decent pay ouses wot dont leak drains good so do i voisey agreed his voice carrying well in spite of the fact he did not seem to be raising it i would also like a job for every man who wants to work and every woman too id like peace good foreign trade less crime more certain justice responsible police without corruption cheap food bread for everyone clothes and boots for everyone id like good weather as well but the rest of his words were lost in a roar of laughter but you wouldnt believe me if i told you i could do that he finished dont believe yer anyway a voice shouted back to more jeers and calls of agreement voisey smiled but the angle of his body was stiff but youre going to listen to me because thats what youve come for youre curious what im going to say and youre fair this time there were no catcalls pitt could feel the difference in the air as if a storm had passed by without breaking do most of you work in these factories voisey waved his arm and these docks there was a murmur of assent making goods to ship all over the world he went on again the assent and a slight impatience they did not understand the reason why he asked pitt did as if he had already heard the words clothes made from egyptian cotton voisey asked his voice lifting his eyes searching their faces the language of their bodies the boredom or the quickening of understanding brocades from persia and the old silk road east to china and india he continued linen from ireland timber from africa rubber from burma i could go on and on but you probably know the list as well as i do they are the products of the empire thats why we are the biggest trading nation in the world why britain rules the seas a quarter of the earth speaks our language and soldiers of the queen guard the peace over land and sea in every quarter of the globe this time the rising noise had a different note to it pride and anger and curiosity several men stood a little straighter shoulders square pitt shifted quickly out of voiseys line of sight voisey shouted above them it isnt just gloryits a roof over your heads and food on your table ow about a shorter working day a tall man with ginger hair called out if we lose the empire who are you going to work for voisey challenged him who are you going to buy from sell to nobodys going ter lose the empire the gingerhaired man replied with scorn even them socialists int that daft mr gladstones going to lose it voisey replied a piece at a time first ireland then maybe scotland and wales who knows what after thatindia perhaps no more hemp and jute no more mahogany and rubber from burma then africa egypt a piece at a time if he can lose ireland on his own doorstep why not everywhere there was a sudden silence then a loud laugh but there was no humor in it instead there was a sharp undercurrent of doubt perhaps even fear pitt glanced around at the men closest to him every one of them was facing voisey we have to have trade voisey went on but now he had no need to shout he pitched his voice to the back of the crowd and it was sufficient we need the rule of law and we need mastery of the seas in order to share our wealth more fairly we must first assure that we have it there was a murmur that sounded like agreement do what you do well no one on earth better voiseys tone held a ring of praise even triumph and choose freely to represent you men who know how to make and keep the laws at home and deal honorably and profitably with the other nations of the earth to preserve and add to what you have dont elect old men who think they speak for god but in truth only speak for the past men who carry out their own wishes and dont listen to yours now there was another roar from the crowd but in many quarters it actually sounded like a cheer to pitts ears voisey did not keep them much longer he knew they were tired and hungry and tomorrow morning would come all too soon he had enough sense to stop while they were still interested and more than that while there was still time to get a good dinner and a couple of hours at the public house to take a few pints of ale and talk it all over he told them a swift joke and another and left them laughing as he walked back to his hansom and rode away pitt was stiff from standing still and cold inside with bitter admiration for the way voisey had turned a crowd from hostile strangers into men who would remember his name remember that he had not betrayed them or made false promises that he had not assumed they would like him and that he had made them laugh they would not forget what he had said about losing the empire that provided their work it might make their employers rich but the truth was that if their employers were poor then they were even poorer it might or might not be unjust but many men there were realist enough to know that it was the way things were pitt waited until voisey had been out of sight for several minutes then he walked across the dusty cobbles into the shade of the factory walls and along a narrow alley back towards the main road voisey had shown at least some of his tactics but he had revealed no vulnerability at all aubrey serracold was going to have to be more than charming and honest to equal him it was early yet to go home especially to an empty house he had a good book to read but the silence would disturb him even the thought of it held a loneliness there must be something else he could do which might be useful perhaps more he could learn from jack radley maybe emily could tell him something about serracolds wife she was acutely observant and a realist in the ploys of power far more than charlotte she might have seen a weakness in voisey where a man with his mind more on political policies and less on the person might have missed it he leaned forward and redirected the driver of his hansom but when he arrived the butler told him with profound apologies that mr and mrs radley were out at a dinner party and could not reasonably be expected home before one in the morning at the earliest pitt thanked him and declined the offer to wait as the butler had known he would he returned to the cab and told the driver to take him instead to cornwalliss flat in piccadilly a manservant answered the door and without question conducted him through to cornwalliss small sitting room it was furnished in the elegant but spare style of a captains cabin at sea full of books polished brass and dark gleaming wood above the mantel shelf there was a painting of a squarerigged brigantine running before a gale mr pitt sir the manservant announced cornwallis dropped his book and rose to his feet in surprise and some alarm pitt what is it whats happened why are you not on dartmoor pitt did not answer cornwallis glanced at the manservant then back at pitt have you eaten he asked pitt was startled to realize that he had had nothing since the pie in the tavern near the factory no not for a while he sank down in the chair opposite cornwalliss bread and cheese would be fine or cake if you have it he missed gracies baking already and the tins at home were empty she had made nothing expecting them all to be away bring mr pitt bread and cheese cornwallis directed and cider and a slice of cake he looked back at pitt or would you prefer tea cider is excellent pitt replied easing himself into the softness of the chair the manservant departed closing the door behind him well cornwallis demanded resuming his own seat and the frown returning to his face he was not handsome but there was a strength and a symmetry in his features which pleased one the longer one looked at him when he moved it was with the grace and balance of his long years at sea when he had had only the quarterdeck in which to pace something has arisen in connection with one of the parliamentary seats which narraway wishes me to to watch he saw the flash of anger in cornwalliss face and knew it was because he saw injustice in narraways not honoring bow streets commitment to pitts leave it added to the outrage of the entire dismissal of pitts reposting to suit the vengeance of the inner circle all the old presumptions and certainties were gone for both of them but cornwallis did not probe he was accustomed to the solitary life of a captain at sea who must listen to his officers but share only practicalities with them not explain himself or indulge in emotions he must always remain apart maintain as much as possible of the fiction that he was never afraid never lonely never in doubt it was the discipline of a lifetime and he could not now breach it it had become part of his personality and he was no longer aware of it as a separate decision the manservant returned with the bread cheese cider and cake for which pitt thanked him you are welcome sir he bowed and withdrew what do you know of charles voisey pitt asked as he spread the crusty bread with butter and cut off a heavy slice of pale rich caerphilly cheese and felt it crumble beneath the knife he bit into it hungrily it was sharp and creamy in his mouth cornwalliss lips tightened but he did not ask why pitt wanted to know only what is public information he replied harrow and oxford then called to the bar was a brilliant lawyer who made a good deal of money but of more value in the long run a great many friends in the places that count and i dont doubt a few enemies as well elevated to the bench and then very quickly to the court of appeal he knows how to take chances and appear courageous and yet never slip badly enough to fall pitt had heard all this before but it still concentrated his mind to have it put so succinctly he is a man of intense pride cornwallis continued but in daytoday life he has the skill to conceal it or at least make it appear as something less offensive less vulnerable pitt said instantly cornwallis did not miss the meaning you are looking for a weakness pitt remembered with an effort that cornwallis knew nothing of the whitechapel affair except adinetts trial in the beginning and voiseys knighthood at the end he did not even know that voisey was the head of the inner circle and for his own safety it was better that he never learn it pitt owed him at least that much in loyalty for the past and he would have wished it in friendship now im looking for knowledge and that includes both strengths and weaknesses he replied he is standing for parliament as a tory in a strong liberal seat the question of home rule has already arisen cornwalliss eyebrows rose and that means narraway pitt did not answer cornwallis accepted his silence what do you want to know about voisey he asked what kind of weakness who does he care for pitt said softly who is he afraid of what moves him to laughter awe pain any emotion what does he want apart from power cornwallis smiled his eyes steady on pitts unblinking it sounds as if you are deploying for battle he said with a very slight lift of question i am searching to see if i have any weapons pitt replied without looking away have i i doubt it cornwallis answered if he cares for anything apart from power ive not heard of it not enough that the loss of it would hurt him he was watching pitts face trying to read in it what he needed he likes to live well but not ostentatiously he enjoys being admired which he is but hes not willing to curry favor to get it i daresay he doesnt need to he takes pleasure in his home good food good wine the theater music company but hed sacrifice any of them if he had to to reach the office he wants at least thats what ive heard do you want me to ask more no no not yet cornwallis nodded anyone he fears pitt asked without hope none that i know cornwallis said dryly has he cause is that what narraway is afraid of an attempt on his life again pitt could not answer the silence was worrying him even though he knew cornwallis understood anyone he cares about pitt asked doggedly he could not afford to give up cornwallis thought for a moment or two possibly he said at last although how deeply i dont know but i think there are ways in which he needs heras his hostess if nothing else but i think he does care for her as much as a man of his nature can her who is she pitt demanded hope quickening in him at last cornwallis dismissed the matter with a tiny rueful smile his sister is a widow of great charm and formidable social skills she appears at least on the surface to possess a gentleness and moral sensitivity he has never shown in spite of his recent knighthood of which you know more than i it was not a question he would never intrude where he knew he had no rights and a refusal would hurt he frowned very slightly it was just a shadow between the brows but i have met her only twice and i am no judge of women now there was a slight selfconsciousness in him someone more skilled might tell you quite differently certainly she is one of his greatest political assets among those in the party with the power and the will to support him with the voters he has little to rely on but his own oratory he sounded discouraged as if he feared that would be sufficient pitt feared it even more so he had seen voisey face the crowd it was a blow to discover that he had a social ally of such ability pitt had been hoping that perhaps being unmarried would be voiseys one weakness thank you he said aloud cornwallis smiled bleakly have some more cider emily radley enjoyed a good dinner party most especially when there was an edge of danger and excitement in the air struggles of power of words ambition hidden behind a mask of humor or of charm public duty or a passion for reform parliament had not been dissolved but it would be any day and they all knew it then the battle would be in the open it would be swift and sharp a matter of a week or so there was no time to hesitate reconsider a blow or moderate a defense it was all in hot blood she prepared as for a campaign of war she was a beautiful woman and she was very well aware of it but now that she was in her thirties and had two children it required a little more care than it used to in order to be her best she set aside the youthful pastels she had once favored for her delicate coloring and selected from the latest fashions from paris something bolder more sophisticated the basic skirt and bodice were midnightblue silk but with an overdress of light bluegray slashed diagonally to swathe up over the bosom and be caught at the left shoulder and again at the waist with another deep slash and ties falling from her hip it had the usual high rouched shoulders and of course she wore kid gloves to the elbows she chose diamonds rather than pearls the result was really very good she felt ready to take on any woman who might be in the room even her current closest friend the dashing and superbly stylish rose serracold she liked rose enormously and had since the day they met and she sincerely hoped that roses husband aubrey would gain his seat in parliament but she had no intention of being outshone by anyone jacks seat was pretty safe he had served with distinction and made several valuable friends in power who would no doubt stand by him now but nothing should be taken for granted political power was a highly fickle mistress and must be courted on every possible occasion their carriage drew up outside the trenchards magnificent house on park lane and she and jack alighted they were welcomed by the footman at the door and crossed the hall and were announced she entered the withdrawing room on his arm with her head high and an air of confidence they were greeted by colonel and mrs trenchard at exactly quarter to nine fifteen minutes after the hour stated on the invitation that in turn had been received five weeks earlier it was precisely the correct moment to arrive they had judged it to perfection to be on time would be vulgarly eager whereas it was rude to be late and since dinner was announced approximately twenty minutes after the first guest arrived long after that one might easily find oneself shown in when everyone else was already going into the dining room etiquette which was of immovable rigidity dictated who should go in with whom and in what order or the whole procedure would be thrown into chaos to be noticed for beauty was always admirable for wit was usually so although there were risks attached to make a spectacle of oneself would be disastrous no drinks were served in the brief time before the butler announced dinner it was customary merely to sit and exchange a few pleasantries with whomever one might know until the procession to the dining room commenced the host would lead the way with the senior ranking lady on his arm followed by the remainder of the guests in order of the ladies rank followed at the last by the hostess on the arm of the senior male guest emily had time only to speak for a moment with rose serracold easy to see with her ashblond hair and sharp straight profile even before she turned her pale aquamarine eyes to regard the latest arrivals her face lit with pleasure and she moved swiftly to emilys side twitching her fleshpink taffeta dress the gown plunged to the waist at the front over claretred embroidered brocade which was echoed in midhip panels and an underskirt it made her slender hips look richly curved and her waist a mere handspan only a woman of supreme confidence could have looked so dazzling in such a gown emily how delightful to see you she said with enthusiasm her glance swept up and down emilys dress in immediate appreciation but with a flash of amusement she deliberately avoided saying anything about it what a pleasure you could come emily smiled back as if you had not known i should she raised her eyebrows they both knew rose would have been familiar with the guest list or she would not have accepted well i did have just the slightest idea rose admitted she leaned a little closer it feels a trifle like the ball the night before waterloo doesnt it not an occasion i recall emily murmured in mock spite rose made a very slight face at her tomorrow we ride into battle she responded with exaggerated patience my dear we have been at war for months emily replied as jack was drawn into a group of men close by if not years she added dont shoot until you see the whites of their eyes rose warned or in lady garsons case the yellow that woman drinks enough to drown a horse you should have seen her mother emily shrugged delicately she could have drowned a giraffe rose threw back her head and laughed a rich infectious sound that caused half a dozen of the men to look at her with pleasure and their wives to stare with disapproval before deliberately turning away the dining room was blazing with light from the chandeliers and reflected from a thousand facets of crystal on the table and the sheen of silver on snowwhite linen roses spilled out of silver bowls and long vines of honeysuckle trailed down the center of the cloth sending up a rich perfume at each place setting there was a menu cardwritten in french naturally the guests name was on the front to indicate where each person should sit the footmen began to serve soup according to each guests preference the choice being oxtail or bisque emily was placed between a liberal elder statesman on her left and a generous banker on her right she declined the soup knowing there were a further eight courses to come but the banker took the oxtail and began to eat immediately it being correct to do so emily glanced across the table at jack but he was busy conversing with a liberal member who would also be defending his seat against a vigorous attack she caught the odd word indicating that they were concerned with the factions among the irish members which would almost certainly make the difference if the main parties were close in number the ability to form a government might depend upon winning the support of either the parnellites or antiparnellites emily was tired of the issues of home rule simply because they had been argued over for as long as she could remember and seemed no closer to a solution than when she had first had them explained to her in the schoolroom she bent her attention to charming the rather grand elder statesman to her left who had also declined a first course the second course was a choice of salmon or smelts she chose salmon and for a little while refrained from conversation she declined the entrees not wishing for curried eggs or sweetbreads with mushrooms and listened to what she could catch of the discussion across the table i think we should take him very seriously aubrey serracold was saying bending forward a little the light caught his fair head his long face filled with seriousness all laughter gone even his usual selfdeprecating charm for once invisible for heavens sake the senior statesman protested his cheeks pink the man left school at ten years old and went down the mines even other miners have more sense than to imagine he can do anything for them in parliament except make a fool of himself he lost in his native scotland he hasnt a chance here in london of course not said a blufffaced man opposite who turned around indignantly reaching for his wine and holding it for a moment before drinking we are the natural party for the workingman not some newfangled creation of wildeyed fanatics with picks and shovels in their hands that is just the kind of blindness that will lose us the future aubrey returned with utmost seriousness keir hardie should not be dismissed lightly a lot of men will see his courage and determination and know how he has bettered his situation they will think that if he can achieve so much for himself he can do the same for them take them out of the mines and put them in parliament a woman in poppyred said incredulously oh dear rose twisted her glass in her fingers then what on earth shall we burn on our fires i doubt the present incumbents would be the slightest practical use there was a burst of laughter but it was highpitched and too loud jack smiled very funny as a dinner table jokenot so amusing if the miners listen to him and vote for more like him who are full of passion to reform but havent any idea of the cost of iti mean the real cost in trade and dependent livelihoods they wont listen to him a whitewhiskered man said with a gesture to courtesy but his voice was dismissive of the seriousness jack invested in the subject most men have more sense he saw jacks expression of doubt for heavens sake radley only half the men in the land vote how many miners own their own houses or pay more than ten pounds a year in rent so by definitionaubrey serracold turned to face him his eyes widethose who can vote are those who prosper under the system as it is now that rather invalidates the argument doesnt it there was a quick exchange of glances across the table this remark was unexpected and to judge from several of them also unwelcome what are you saying serracold the whitewhiskered man asked carefully if a thing works change it no aubrey replied equally carefully if it works for one section of the people it is not that section who should have the right to decide whether to keep it or not because we all have the tendency to see things from our own view and to preserve what is in our own interest the footman removed the used plates and almost unnoticed served iced asparagus you have a very poor opinion of your fellows in government a redhaired man said a trifle sourly im surprised you want to join us aubrey smiled with extraordinary charm looking down for a moment before turning to the speaker not at all i think we are wise and just enough to use power only as it is honestly given but i have no such confidence in our opponents he was met with a shout of laughter but emily saw that it did not entirely dispel the anxietyin jack at least she knew him well enough to see and understand the tension in his hands as he held his knife and fork and with dexterity cut the tips off the asparagus spears he did not speak again for several minutes the conversation turned to other aspects of politics the used dishes were taken and replaced with gamequail grouse or partridge emily still did not accept any young ladies were always advised not to as it might make their breath strong she had always wondered why it was acceptable for men to she had once asked her father and received a look of blank amazement the inequity of it had never occurred to him she declined still not considering herself old enough to be disqualified from it mattering she hoped she never would be after game there were sweets the menu offered ice pudding confiture of nectarines iced meringues or strawberry jelly which she accepted she ate the jelly with her fork as required by etiquette an art necessitating a certain degree of concentration after the cheese there was a choice of ices neapolitan cream or raspberry water and lastly pineapples from the glass house presumably strawberries apricots or melons she glanced with amusement at the varieties of skill displayed on the requirement to peel and eat each of these with a knife and fork more than one person had cause to regret their choice especially of apricots the conversation resumed it was her job to be charming to flatter with attention to amuse or more often to appear amused it was the greatest compliment to a man to find him interesting and she knew few who could resist it it was amazing how much of himself a man would reveal if one simply allowed him to talk beneath the plans the assurances and the bravado emily heard a deep unease and it was borne in on her with increasing certainty that those men who had been in government before and knew its subtleties and pitfalls did not wish to lose this election but neither did they wholeheartedly desire to win it was a curious situation and because she did not understand it therefore it troubled her she listened for some time until she perceived that each for his own passion and ambition wished to win his own particular battle but not the war to the victor went spoils they were uncertain how to handle the laughter around her was brittle and the voices charged with emotion the lights glittered on jewels and wineglasses and the unused silver the rich odors of food lingered amid the heavy perfume of the honeysuckle it required long experience a colossal courage any amount of cool selfpossession and a great skill to attack and dispose of it without harm to yourself or your neighbor he told me rose was saying intensely her eyes glistening then my dear lady you should leave such dangerous quarry to a hunter of courage and strength a quick eye and a brave heart the man next to her replied decisively i suggest you content yourself with following the pheasant shoot or some other such sport my dear colonel bertrand rose answered with shining innocence those are the etiquette instructions for eating an orange the colonel blushed scarlet amid the uncontrollable burst of laughter i do apologize rose said as soon as she could be heard i fear i did not make myself plain life is full of dangers of so many kinds one steps aside from one pitfall only to plunge into another no one argued with her there was more than one other present who had felt the colonels condescension and no one rushed to his defense lady warden giggled on and off for the rest of the evening when the meal was at last finished the ladies withdrew so the gentlemen might enjoy their port and emily knew perfectly well have the serious political discussion of tactics money and trading favor for favor which was the purpose of the evening to begin with she found herself sitting with half a dozen other wives of men who either were members of parliament already or hoped to become so or who had money and profound interests in the election outcome i wish they would take the new socialists more seriously lady molloy said as soon as they were seated you mean mr morris and the webbs mrs lancaster asked with wide eyes and a smile verging on laughter honestly my dear have you ever seen mr webb they say he is undersized undernourished and underendowed there was a slight titter around the group as much nervous as amused but she isnt someone else put in quickly she comes from a very good family and writes childrens fairy tales about hedgehogs and rabbits mrs lancaster finished for her how appropriate if you ask me the whole socialist idea belongs with peter rabbit and mrs tiggiwinkle lady warden said with a giggle no it doesnt rose contradicted her deep feeling unconcealed the fact that a persons appearance may be a trifle quaint should not blind us to the worth of that persons ideas or more importantly to appreciate the danger those ideas may present to our real power we should draw such people in to ally with us not ignore them they arent going to ally with us my dear mrs lancaster pointed out reasonably their ideas are impractically extreme they want an actual labor party the discussion moved to specific reforms and the speed at which they might be achieved or even should be attempted emily joined in but it was rose serracold who made the most outrageous suggestions and provoked the most laughter no one especially emily was entirely certain how much rose meant beneath the wit and the keen observation of emotion and foible you think im joking dont you rose said when the group divided and she and emily were able to speak alone no i dont emily replied keeping her back to those nearest them suddenly she was quite certain of it but i think youll be very well advised to let other people think so we are at precisely that stage in our understanding of the fabians where we will think they are funny but have begun to have the first suspicion that in the end the joke may be more against us than with us rose leaned forward her fair face intense all lightness gone from it that is precisely why we must listen to them emily and adopt at least the best of their ideas in fact most of them reform will come and we must be in the forefront of it the franchise must include all adults poor as well as rich and in time women as well her eyebrows arched dont look so horrified it must as the empire must gobut that is another issue and no matter what mr gladstone says we must make it law that the working day is no more than eight hours across all manner of trades and no employer can force a man to do more or woman emily asked curiously of course roses answer was immediate a reflex to an unnecessary question emily affected innocence and if you call for your ladys maid to fetch you a cup of tea at half past eight will you accept the answer that she has worked eight hours and is off dutyand you should get it yourself touche rose bent her head in acknowledgment a flush of mortification on her cheeks perhaps we only mean factory work at least to begin with then she lifted her eyes quickly but it doesnt alter the fact that we have to go forward if we are to survive let alone if we are to obtain any kind of social justice we all want social justice emily answered wryly its just that everyone has a different idea as to what it is and how to achieve it and when tomorrow rose shrugged her shoulders as far as the tories are concerned any time as long as it isnt today they were joined again briefly by lady molloy speaking largely to rose and obviously still turning over in her mind what had been said previously i had better be careful hadnt i rose said ruefully when lady molloy had gone the poor soul is quite flummoxed dont underestimate her emily warned she may have little imagination but she is very astute when it comes to practical judgment how tedious rose sighed elaborately that is one of the greatest disadvantages of running for public office one has to please the public not that i dont desire to of course but making oneself understood is the greatest challenge dont you think emily smiled in spite of herself i know exactly what you mean although i admit i dont even attempt it most of the time if people dont understand you they may think you are speaking nonsense but if you do it with enough confidence they will give you the benefit of the doubt which doesnt always happen when they do understand the art is not so much in being intelligent as in being kind i really do mean that rose believe me rose looked for a moment as if she were going to make some witty response then the lightness drained out of her do you believe in life after death emily she asked emily was so startled she spoke only to give herself time to think i beg your pardon do you believe in life after death rose repeated earnestly i mean real life not some sort of general holy existence as part of god or whatever i suppose i do not to would be too awful why rose gave an elegant shrug her face noncommittal again as if she had retreated from the edge of some greater honesty i just thought id shock you out of your political practicality for a moment but her voice held no laughter nor did her eyes do you believe in it emily asked smiling a little to make the question seem more casual than it was rose hesitated obviously uncertain now how she was going to answer emily could see the emotion in the angle of her bodyher dramatic gown with its rich wine and flesh colors and the tension in her arms where her thin hands gripped the edge of the chair do you think there isnt emily said quietly no i dont roses voice was steady with total conviction i am quite sure there is then just as suddenly she relaxed emily was certain it had cost her a very deliberate effort rose looked at her then away again have you ever been to a seance not a real one only pretend ones at parties emily watched her why have you rose did not answer directly whats real she said with a tiny edge to her voice daniel dunglass home was supposed to be brilliant nobody ever caught him out and many tried to then she swiveled to look directly at emily a challenge in her eyes as if now she were on firmer ground and there was no hurt waiting under the surface were she to misstep did you ever see him emily asked avoiding the direct issue which she was quite certain was not dunglass home although she was not sure what it was no but they say he could levitate himself several inches off the floor or elongate himself especially his hands she was watching emilys response although she made light of it that must have been remarkable to see emily replied unsure why anyone would wish to do such a thing but i thought the purpose of a seance was to get in touch with the spirits of those you knew who had gone on before it is that was just a manifestation of his powers rose explained or the spirits power emily elaborated although i doubt any of my ancestors had tricks like that up their sleeves unless you want to go back to the witch trials in puritan times rose smiled but it went no further than her lips her body was still stiff her neck and shoulders rigid and suddenly emily was convinced that the whole subject mattered intensely to her the trivial manner was to shield her vulnerability and more than the pain of being laughed at something deeper perhaps having a belief snatched from her and broken emily answered with total seriousness she did not have to feign i really dont know how the spirits from the past could contact us if they wanted to tell us something important i cannot say that it wouldnt come with all kinds of strange sights or sounds for that matter i would judge it on the content of the message not on how it was delivered now she was not sure whether to go on with what she had intended to say or if it were intrusive rose broke the suspense of the moment without the effects how would i know it was real not just the medium telling me what she thought i wanted to hear she made a casual little gesture of dismissal it isnt what you would consider entertainment without all the sighs and groans and the apparitions the bumps and glowing ectoplasm and so on she laughed a brittle sound dont look so serious my dear its hardly church is it its only ghosts rattling their chains what is life if we cant be frightened now and then at least of things like that which dont matter at all takes ones mind off what is really awful she swept one hand into the air diamonds glittering on her fingers have you heard what labouchere is going to do with buckingham palace if he ever has his way no emily took a moment to adjust from the profoundly emotional to the utterly absurd turn it into a refuge for fallen women rose said in a ringing voice isnt that the best joke youve heard in years emily was incredulous has he actually said so rose giggled i dont know but if he hasnt yet he soon will when the old queen dies i dont doubt the prince of wales will do that anyway for heavens sake rose emily urged glancing around them to see who might have overheard keep a still tongue in your head some people wouldnt know sarcasm if it got up and bit them rose tried to look taken aback but her pale brilliant eyes were shining and she was too close to hilarity to carry it off whos being sarcastic darling i mean it if they havent fallen yet hed be just the man to help them i know but for heavens sake dont say so emily hissed back at her and then they both burst into laughter just as they were joined by mrs lancaster and two others who were aching to know what they might have missed the ride home in the carriage from park lane was entirely another matter it was after one in the morning but the street lamps lit the summer night making the way clear and the air was warm and still emily could see only the side of jacks face closest to the carriage lamp but it was sufficient to show a seriousness he had hidden all evening what is it she asked quietly as they turned out of park lane and moved west what happened in the dining room after we left a lot of discussion and planning he replied turning to look at her perhaps not realizing it cast his face into shadow i i rather wish aubrey hadnt spoken so much i like him enormously and i think hell be an honest representative of the people and perhaps more importantly an honest man in the house but she challenged what hell get in wont he its been a liberal seat for as long as anyone can remember she wanted every liberal to win who could so as to put the party back in power but just at this moment she was thinking of rose and how crushed she would be if aubrey failed it would be humiliating to lose a safe seat a personal rejection not a difference of ideas as much as anything is certain yes he agreed and well form a government even if the majority isnt as large as wed like then whats wrong and dont tell me nothing she insisted jack bit his lip i wish he would keep some of his more radical ideas to himself hes hes closer to socialism than i realized he spoke slowly considering his words he admires sidney webb for heavens sake we cant take reform at that pace the people wont have it and the tories will crucify us whether we should have an empire or not isnt the point we do have and you cant cut it loose as if it didnt exist and expect to have the trade the work the status in the world the treaties or anything else we do without the reason and the purpose behind it ideals are wonderful but without an understanding of reality they can ruin us all its like fire a great servant yet totally destructive when its master did you tell aubrey that she asked i didnt have the chance but i will she said nothing for a few moments riding in silence thinking over roses sudden strange questions about seances and the tension within her she was uncertain whether to worry jack with it or not but it hung heavily with her an unease she could not dismiss the carriage turned a corner sharply into a quieter street where the lamps were farther apart shining up with ghostly gleam into the branches above rose was talking about spiritualists she said abruptly i think you should suggest that aubrey tell her to be discreet about that too it could be misinterpreted by enemies and once the election is called in earnest therell be plenty of those i i think perhaps aubrey isnt used to being attacked hes such a charming man almost everyone likes him he was startled he jerked around in the carriage seat to face her spiritualists you mean mediums like maude lamont there was an edge of anxiety in his voice sharp enough that she did not need to see his expression to know what it would be she didnt mention maude lamont although everybodys talking about her actually she talked about daniel dunglass home but i suppose its much the same she spoke of levitation and ectoplasm and things i never know whether rose is joking or not was she it was not a question but a demand im not sure she admitted but i dont think so i had the feeling that under the surface she cared very much about something he shifted uncomfortably only half because of the carriages rattling over uneven cobbles ill have to speak to aubrey about that too what is a social game when you are a private person becomes the rope for journalists to hang you with when you stand for parliament i can see the cartoons now he winced so acutely that she saw the movement in his cheek in the pool of light as they passed under a street lamp and back into darkness again ask mrs serracold whos going to win the election damn it better than that whos going to win the derby he said in a mimicking voice lets ask napoleons ghost what the czar of russias going to do next he cant ever have forgiven him for moscow and even if he knew he wouldnt be likely to tell us she pointed out he is even less likely to have forgiven us for waterloo if we couldnt ask anyone with whom weve ever had a war that would rule out just about everybody on earth except the portuguese and the norwegians he retorted their knowledge about our future might be rather limited they probably dont give a farthing he took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh emily do you think shes really seeing a medium other than just for fun at a house party yes emily spoke with a chill conviction yes im afraid i do the following morning brought news of a different and disturbing kind pitt was looking through the newspapers over breakfast of poached kippers and bread and butterone of the few things he was quite good at cookingwhen he came across the letter to the editor it was the first one on the page and given particular prominence dear sir i write in some distress and as a lifelong supporter of the liberal party and all that it has achieved for the people of this nation and thus indirectly of the world i have admired and endorsed the reforms it has initiated and passed into law however i live in the constituency of south lambeth and have listened with growing alarm to the opinions of mr aubrey serracold the liberal candidate for that seat he does not represent the old liberal values of sane and enlightened reform but rather a hysterical socialism which would sweep away all the great achievements of the past in a frenzy of illthoughtout changes possibly wellmeaning but inevitably benefiting the few for a short while at the expense of the many and to the eventual destruction of our economy i urge all others who normally support the liberal party to pay the closest attention to what mr serracold has to say and consider albeit with regret whether they can indeed support him and if they do what path of ruin they may be setting us upon social reform is the ideal of every honest man but it must be done with wisdom and knowledge and at the pace at which we can absorb it into the fabric of our society if it is done hastily to answer the emotional selfindulgence of a man who has no experience and it would seem little practical sense then it will be to the cost and the misery of the vast majority of our people who deserve better of us i write with the greatest sadness roland kingsley major general retired pitt let his tea go cold staring at the printed sheet in front of him this was the first open blow against serracold and it was hard and deep it would damage him was this the inner circle mobilizing the beginning of the real battle chapter three pitt went out and bought five other newspapers and took them home to see if major general kingsley had written to any more of them in similar vein almost the same letter was in three of them there was only a variation of phrase here and there pitt folded the papers closed and sat still for several minutes wondering what weight to attach to it who was kingsley was he a man whose opinion would influence others more importantly than that was his writing coincidence or the beginning of a campaign he had reached no conclusion as to whether there was a necessity for learning more about kingsley when the doorbell rang he glanced up at the kitchen clock and realized it was after nine mrs brody must have forgotten her keys he stood up resentful of the intrusion although he was grateful enough for her work and went to answer the increasingly insistent jangle of the bell but it was not mrs brody on the step it was a young man in a brown suit his hair slicked back and his face eager good morning sir he said crisply standing to attention sergeant grenville sir if narraway wants to tell me about the letter in the times ive read it pitt said rather sharply and in the spectator the mail and the illustrated london news no sir the man replied with a frown its about the murder what pitt thought at first that he had misheard the murder sir the man repeated in southampton row pitt felt a stab of regret so sharp it was almost a physical pain then a surge of hatred for voisey and all the inner circle for driving him from bow street where he had dealt with crimes he understood however terrible and for which he had the skill and the experience in almost all cases to find some resolution it was his profession and he was good at it in special branch he was floundering knowing what was coming and powerless to prevent it youve made a mistake he said flatly i dont deal with murders anymore go back and tell your commander that i cant help report to superintendent wetron at bow street the sergeant did not move sorry sir i didnt say it properly its mr narraway as wants you to take over they wont like it at bow street but they just got to put up with it mr tellmans in charge in southampton row just made up recent like but i expect you know that seeing as you was used to working with im all the time begging your pardon sir but it would be a good thing if you went there right away seein as they discovered the body about seven an its coming up alf past nine now we just got to ear of it and mr narraway sent me right over why it made no sense ive already got a case e said this is part of it sir grenville glanced over his shoulder ive got a cab waiting if youd just like to lock the door sir well be on our way the manner in which he said it his whole bearing made it apparent he was not a sergeant suggesting something to a senior officer he was a man who was very sure of his position passing on the order of a superior whose word could not be disobeyed it was as if narraway himself had spoken slightly irked and unwilling to intrude on tellmans first murder case as commander pitt did as he was bidden and followed grenville to the hansom they rode the short distance along keppel street around russell square and a couple of hundred yards down southampton row who is the victim he asked as soon as they were moving maude lamont grenville replied shes supposed to be a spirit medium sir one of them what says she gets in touch with the dead his tone and the expressionless look on his face conveyed his opinion of such things and the fact that he felt it inappropriate to put it into words and why does mr narraway think it has anything to do with my case pitt asked grenville stared straight ahead dont know that sir mr narraway never tells nobody things as they dont need to know right sergeant grenville what can you tell me other than that i am late i am going to walk in on my erstwhile sergeant and take away his first case and i have no idea what its about i dont know either sir grenville said glancing sideways at pitt and then forward again except that miss lamont was a spiritualist like i said and er maid found er dead this morning choked it seems except the doctor says it wasnt an accident so it looks like one of er clients from last night must ave done it i suppose e needs you to find out which one and maybe why and you have no idea what that has to do with my present case i dont even know what your case is sir pitt said nothing and a moment later they pulled up just beyond cosmo place pitt climbed out closely followed by grenville who led the way to the front door of a very pleasant house which was obviously that of someone in most comfortable circumstances a short flight of steps led to a carved front door and there was deep white gravel along the frontage to either side a constable answered the bell and was about to turn them away until he looked beyond grenville to pitt youre back at bow street sir he said with surprise and what seemed to be pleasure before pitt could reply grenville stepped in not for the moment but mr pitt is taking over this case orders from the ome office he said in a tone which cut off further discussion of the subject wheres inspector tellman the constable looked puzzled and interested but he knew how to read a hint in the parlor sir with the body if youll come wi me and without waiting for an answer he led them inside across a very comfortable hallway decorated in mock chinese style with lacquer side tables and a bambooandsilk screen and into the parlor this too was of oriental style with a red lacquer cabinet by the wall a dark wooden table with carved abstract designs on it a series of lines and rectangles in the center of the room was a larger table oval and around it were seven chairs double french doors with elaborate curtains looked out into a walled garden filled with flowering shrubbery a path curved away around the corner presumably to the front of the house or to a side gate or a door to cosmo place pitts attention was drawn inevitably to the motionless body of a woman half reclined in one of the two upholstered chairs on either side of the fireplace she seemed in her middle to late thirties tall and with a fine delicately curved figure her face had probably been handsome in life with good bones and framed by thick dark hair but at the moment it was disfigured by a terrible gasping contortion her eyes were wide and staring her complexion mottled and a strange white substance had bubbled out of her mouth and down over her chin tellman dour as always his hair slicked back from his brow was standing in the middle of the room to his left was another man older thickerset with a strong intelligent face from the leather bag at his feet pitt took him to be the police surgeon sorry sir grenville produced his card and held it out to tellman this is a special branch case mr pitt will be taking over but to keep it discreet like it would be better if you were to remain ere to work with im it was said as a statement not a question tellman stared at pitt he tried hard to mask his feelings and the fact that he was taken by surprise but his chagrin was clear in the rigidity of his body his hands held tightly at his sides the hesitation before he was able to master himself sufficiently to think what to say there was no enmity in his eyesat least pitt thought notbut there was anger and disappointment he had worked hard for his promotion several years of that work in pitts shadow and now faced with the very first murder of which he was in charge with no explanation pitt was brought back and given command of it pitt turned to grenville if theres nothing else sergeant you can leave us to get on with it inspector tellman will have all the facts we know so far except why narraway considered this anything whatever to do with voisey pitt could not imagine anything less likely to interest charles voisey than spiritual seances surely his sister mrs cavendish could not have been so credulous as to have attended such a gathering at so sensitive a time and if she had and had been compromised by her presence here was that a good thing or bad he felt cold at the thought that narraway expected him to use it to their advantage the idea of becoming part of the crime of using it to coerce was repellent he introduced himself to the doctor whose name was snow then turned to tellman what do you know so far he asked politely and as noncommittally as he could he must not allow his own anger to reflect in his attitude now none of this was tellmans fault and to antagonize him further would make it more difficult to succeed in the end the maid lena forrest found her this morning shes the only servant living in tellman replied glancing around the room to indicate his surprise that in a house of this obvious material comfort there was no resident cook or manservant made her mistresss morning tea and took it up to her room he continued when she found no one there and the bed not slept in she was alarmed she came down here to the last place she had seen her when was that pitt interrupted before the start of last nights doings tellman avoided the word seance and his opinion of it all was evident in his very slightly curled lip otherwise his lanternjawed face was carefully devoid of expression pitt was surprised she didnt see her afterwards she says not i pressed her about that no last cup of tea no going up drawing a bath for her or helping her undress but she says not his voice allowed no argument it seems miss lamont liked to stay up as long as she wanted with certain clients and they all preferred the privacy of no servants around no one to bump into accidentally or interrupt when he tailed off his lips pursed so she came in here and found her pitt inclined his head towards the figure in the chair thats right about ten minutes after seven tellman responded pitt was surprised early for a lady to get up isnt it especially one who didnt begin work until the evening and frequently stayed late with clients i asked her that too tellman glared she said miss lamont always got up early and took a nap in the afternoons his expression suggested the pointlessness of trying to make sense of any of the habits of someone who thought she spoke to ghosts did she touch anything she says not and i cant see any evidence that she did she said that she could see straight away that miss lamont was dead she wasnt breathing she had this bluish look and when the maid put a finger on her neck it was quite cold pitt turned enquiringly towards the doctor snow pursed his lips died sometime yesterday evening he said staring at pitt with sharp questioning eyes pitt looked towards the body again then took a step closer and peered at the face and the strange sticky mess spilling out of her mouth and down over the side of her chin at first he had thought it vomit from some ingested poison on closer examination there was a texture to it a thickness that looked almost like a very fine gauze he straightened up and turned to the doctor poison he said his imagination racing what is it can you tell her face looks as if shes been strangled or suffocated asphyxia snow inclined his head in a very slight nod i cant be sure until i get to my laboratory but i think thats white of egg what pitt was incredulous why would she swallow white of egg and what is thethe some sort of muslin or cheesecloth snows mouth twisted wryly as if he were on the brink of some deeper knowledge of human nature and afraid of what he would find she choked on it inhaled it into her lungs but it wasnt an accident he moved past pitt and pulled open the lace front of the bodice to the dead womans gown it came away in his hand where it had obviously been torn before in the need to examine her and closed over again for decencys sake on the flesh between the swell of her breasts was the beginning of a wide bruise only just darkening when death had cut off the flow of blood pitt met snows eyes force to make her swallow it snow nodded id say a knee he agreed someone put that stuff down her throat and held her nose you can see the very slight scratch of a fingernail on her cheek they pinned her down with considerable weight until she couldnt help breathing in and choking are you certain pitt tried to rid his mind of the picture the sense of the thick liquid gagging in her throat the woman fighting for air as certain as we can be snow answered unless on autopsy i find something completely different but she died of asphyxia can tell that from her expression and from the tiny blood clots in her eyes he did not show them and pitt was glad he had seen it before and was content to accept snows word instead he picked up one of the cold hands and turned it slightly looking at the wrist he found the slight bruises as he had expected someone had held her perhaps only briefly but with force i see he said softly youd better tell me if it is egg white but ill assume it is why would anyone choose such a bizarre unnecessary way of killing someone thats your job snow said dryly i can tell you what happened to her but not why or who did it pitt turned to tellman you said the maid found her yes did she say anything else not much only that she did not see or hear anything after she left miss lamont when her clients were due but then she says she took care not to one of the reasons they liked miss lamont was the privacy she offered them as well as her whatever you call it he frowned searching pitts face what is it he had steadfastly refused to call him sir right from the first difficult days when pitt himself was newly promoted tellman had resented him because he considered him as a gamekeepers son not to be suitable for command of a station that was for gentlemen or returned military or naval men such as cornwallis what do you call ita skill an act a trick probably all three pitt replied then he went on thinking aloud i suppose if its for entertainment its harmless enough but how do you know if someone takes it seriously whether you mean them to or not you dont tellman snorted i like my conjuring to be strictly a deck of cards or rabbits out of a hat that way nobody gets taken in do you know who yesterday evenings clients were and if they came one at a time or all together the maid doesnt know tellman answered or at least thats what she says and ive no reason to disbelieve her where is she is she in a fit state to answer questions oh yes tellman said with assurance a little shaken of course but seems like a sensible woman i dont suppose shes realized yet what it will mean for her but once weve searched the house completely and maybe locked off this room theres no reason why she cant stay here for a while is there till she finds another position anyway no pitt agreed better she does well know where to find her if we have more to ask ill go and see her in the kitchen cant expect her to come in here he glanced at the corpse as he crossed the room to the door tellman did not follow him he would have his own men to send on errands searches perhaps questions of people in the neighborhood although it was reasonable to suppose that the crime would have taken place after dark and the chances that anyone had observed anything of use were slight pitt followed the passage towards the back of the house past several other doors to the one at the end which was open with a pattern of sunlight on a scrubbed wooden floor he stopped in the entrance it was a wellkept kitchen clean and warm there was a kettle steaming very slightly on the black cooking stove a tall woman a little thin stood at the sink with her sleeves rolled up above her elbows and her hands in soapy water she was motionless as if she had forgotten what she was there for miss forrest pitt asked she turned slowly she seemed in her late forties her brown hair graying at the temples was pinned back off her brow her face was unusual with beautiful bones around her eyes and cheeks her nose straight but not quite prominent enough her mouth wide and wellshaped she was not beautiful in fact in a way she was almost ugly yes are you another policeman she spoke with a very slight lisp although it was not quite an impediment slowly she lifted her hands out of the water yes i am pitt replied im sorry to ask you more questions when you must be distressed but we cannot afford to wait for a better time he felt a trifle foolish as he said it she looked completely in control of herself but he knew that shock affected people in different ways sometimes when it was very profound there were no outward signs at all my name is pitt would you sit down please miss forrest slowly she obeyed automatically drying her hands on a towel left over a brass rail in front of the stove she sat down on one of the hardbacked chairs near the table and he sat on one of the others what is it you want to know she asked staring not at him but at some space over his right shoulder the kitchen was orderly there was clean plain china stacked on the dresser and a pile of ironed linen on one of the broad sills no doubt waiting to be put away more hung from the airing rail winched up near the ceiling the coke scuttle was full on the floor by the back door the stove was polished black light winked softly over the sides of the copper pans hanging from the cross beam and there was a faint aroma of spices the only thing missing was any sight or smell of food it was a house no longer with any purpose was miss lamont expecting her clients separately or together he asked they came one at a time she replied and left that way for all i know but they would all be together for the seance her voice was expressionless as if she were trying to mask her feelings was that to protect herself or her mistress perhaps from ridicule did you see them no so they could have come together miss lamont had me lift the crossbar on the side door to cosmo place which she did for some people she replied so i took it that one of the discreet ones came last night people who dont want anyone else to recognize them you mean yes are there many like that four or five so you made arrangements for them to come in from cosmo place instead of the front door on southampton row tell me exactly how that worked she looked up at him meeting his eyes theres a door in the wall that leads into the place it has a lock on it a big iron one and they lock it behind them when they leave what is the bar you spoke of that falls across on the inside it means even with a key you cant get in we keep it barred except when there is a special client coming and she sees such clients alone no usually with one or two others are there many like that i dont think so mostly she went to clients houses or parties she only had special ones here once a week or so pitt tried to picture it in his mind a handful of nervous excited people sitting in the halflight around a table all filled with their own terrors and dreams hoping to hear the voice of someone they had loved transfigured by death telling them what that they still existed that they were happy some secrets of passion or money taken with them to the grave or perhaps some forgiveness needed for a wrong now beyond recall so these people were special last night he said aloud they must have been she replied with a very slight movement of her shoulders but you saw none of them no as i said they keep it very private anyway yesterday was my evening off i left the house just after they came where did you go he asked to see a friend a mrs lightfoot down in newington over the river her address number lion street off the new kent road she replied without hesitation thank you he returned to the issue of the visitors someone would check her story just as a matter of routine but miss lamonts visitors must have seen each other so they were acquainted at least i dont know she answered the room was always dimly lit i know how that works from setting up before they come and putting the chairs right they sat around the table its perfectly easy to stay in the shadows if you want to i always set the candles at one end only red candles and leave the gas off unless you knew someone already you wouldnt see who they were and there was one of these discreet people last night i think so otherwise she wouldnt have asked me to lift the bar on the gate was it back on this morning her eyes widened a little grasping his meaning immediately i dont know i never looked ill do it but first tell me more about yesterday evening anything you can remember for example was miss lamont nervous anxious about anything do you know if she has ever received threats or had to deal with a client who was angry or unhappy about the seances if she did she didnt tell me lena replied but then she never talked about these things she mustve known hundreds of secrets about people for a moment her expression changed a profound emotion filled her and she struggled to hide it it could have been fear or loss or the horror of sudden and violent death or something else he could not even guess at did she believe in spirits perhaps vengeful or disturbed ones she treated it confidential she said aloud and her face was blank again merely concerned to answer his questions he wondered how much she knew of her mistresss trade she was resident in the house had she no curiosity at all do you clean the parlor where the seances are held he asked her hand jerked a tiny fraction it was not much more than the stiffening of muscles yes the daily woman does the rest but miss lamont always had me do that the thought of apparitions of the supernatural doesnt frighten you a flash of contempt burned in her eyes then vanished when she answered her voice was soft again leave such things alone and theyll leave you did you believe in miss lamonts gift she hesitated her face unreadable was it a habit of loyalty fighting with the truth what can you tell me about it suddenly that was urgent the manner of maude lamonts death surely sprang from her art real or sham it was no chance killing by a burglar surprised in the act or even the greed of a relative it was acutely personal driven by a passion of rage or envy a will to destroy not only the woman but something of the skills she professed as well i i dont really know lena said awkwardly im a servant here i wasnt part of her life i knew there were people who really believed there were more than the ones she had here she once said that here was where she did her best work the things at other peoples houses was more like entertainment so the people who came here last night were seeking some real contact with the dead for some urgent personal reason it was more a statement than a question i dont know but thats the way she said it was she was tense her body straightbacked away from the chair her hands clenched on the table in front of her have you ever attended a seance miss forrest no the answer was instant and vehement there was harsh emotion in her then she looked down away from him her voice dropped even lower let the dead rest in peace with sudden overwhelming pity he saw the tears fill her eyes and slide down her cheeks she made no apology nor did her face move it was as if for a few moments she were oblivious of him locked in her own loss surely it was for someone dear to her not for maude lamont lying stiff and grotesque in the next room he wanted someone who could comfort her reach across the grief of unfamiliarity and touch her have you family miss forrest someone we could notify for you she shook her head i had only one sister and nells long dead god rest her she answered taking a deep breath and straightening up she made an intense effort to control herself and succeeded youll be wanting to know who they were that came last night i cant tell you cos i dont know but she kept a book with all that sort of thing in it its in her desk and no doubt itll be locked but she wears the key on a chain around her neck or if you dont want to get that a knifell break it but thatd be a shame its a handsome piece all inlaid and the like ill get the key he stood up ill need to talk to you again miss forrest but for the meanwhile tell me where the desk is and then perhaps make a cup of tea for yourself at least maybe inspector tellman and his men would appreciate it too yes sir she hesitated thank you the desk he reminded her oh yes its in the small study second door on the left she gestured with her hand to indicate where it was he thanked her then went back to the parlor where the body was and tellman standing staring out of the window the police surgeon had left but there was a constable standing in the small garden banked around by camellia and a longlegged yellow rose in full bloom was the garden door barred on the inside pitt asked tellman nodded and you cant get from the french doors to the street it had to be one of them already in here he said miserably must have left through the front door which closes itself and the maid said she had no idea when i first asked her no but she said maude lamont kept an engagement diary and its in the desk in the small study and the key is around her neck pitt nodded towards the dead woman that might tell us quite a bit even why they came here presumably she knew tellman frowned poor devils he said savagely what kind of need draws someone to come to a woman like this and look for the kind of answers you should get from your church or common sense i mean what do they ask he frowned making his long face look forbidding where are you what is it like there she could tell them anything and how would they know its wicked to take money to play on peoples grief he turned away and its daft of them to give it it took pitt a moment to adjust from one subject to the other but he realized that tellman was struggling with an inner anger and confusion and had been trying to evade the conclusion that one of those he pitied against his will had to have killed the woman sitting silently in the chair only a few feet away having put a knee in her chest as she struggled to breathe choking on the strange substance clogging her throat he was trying to imagine the fury that had driven the murderer to it he was a single man unused to women in other than a formal police setting he was waiting for pitt to touch the body reach for the key where he would be clumsy and embarrassed to look pitt walked over and gently lifted up the lace front of the gown and felt under the sides of the plunging fabric of the bodice he found the fine gold chain and pulled it until he had the key in his fingers he lifted the chain over her head carefully trying not to disarrange her hair which was absurd what could it matter now but only a few hours ago she had been alive lit by intelligence and emotion then it would have been unthinkable to have touched her throat and her bosom in such a way he moved her hand out of his way not that crushing it mattered it was an automatic gesture it was then that he noticed the long hair caught around the button on her sleeve quite unlike the rich color of her own she was dark and this shone pale for a moment like a thread of spun glass then as he moved it became invisible again what has this got to do with special branch tellman demanded suddenly his frustration hard in his voice i have no idea pitt replied straightening up and moving the dead womans head back to the exact position it had been before tellman stared at him are you going to let me see it he challenged that was a decision he had not considered now he replied without thinking stung by the absurdity of it of course i am i want a great deal more out of it than just the names of the people who were here last night short of a miracle well need to learn all we can about this woman speak to the rest of her clients learn all you can what sort of people came to her and why what do they pay her does it account for this house automatically he glanced around at the room with its elaborate wallpaper and intricately carved oriental furniture he knew enough to estimate the cost of at least some of it tellman frowned how does she know what to tell those people he said biting his lip what is it a mixture of finding out first then building on good guesses probably she might pick her clients very carefully only those she already knows something about or is certain she can research with success ive looked all round the room tellman stared at the walls the gas brackets the tall lacquer cabinet i cant see how she did any tricks what was she supposed to do make ghosts appear voices people floating in the air what what made anyone believe it was spirits not just someone telling them whatever they wanted to hear i dont know pitt replied ask her other clients but tread softly tellman dont mock another persons faith however ridiculous you think it is most of us need more than the moment we have dreams that wont come true here and we need eternity without adding anything or waiting for any answer he went out leaving tellman to go on searching the room for something without knowing what it was pitt went to the small study and opened the door the desk was immediately inside a beautiful thing as lena forrest had said golden brown wood inlaid in exquisite marquetry of darker and lighter shades he slipped the key into the lock and turned it it opened easily to form a flat writing surface inlaid with leather there were two drawers and half a dozen or so pigeonholes in one of the drawers he found an engagement book and opened it at the page for the previous days date he saw two names both of which he recognized immediately and with a coldness in the bottom of his stomach roland kingsley and rose serracold now he understood precisely why narraway had sent him he stood still absorbing the information and all it could mean could it be rose serracolds long pale hair on the dead womans cuff he had no idea and he had never seen her but he would have to find out should he show the hair to tellman or wait to see if he found it for himself or if the surgeon found it when he removed the clothes for the autopsy it might mean anythingor nothing it was several seconds before he realized that the third line contained not a name at all but a sort of design like the small drawings the ancient egyptians had used to signify a word a name he had heard them called cartouches this one was a circle with a semicircle inside it arched over the top of a figure like a small f but backwards it was very simple and to him at least had no meaning whatsoever why would someone be so secretive that even maude lamont herself did this odd drawing rather than write his or her name there was nothing illegal in consulting a spirit medium it was not even scandalous or for that matter a subject of ridicule except for those who had portrayed themselves as otherwise and were thus branded as hypocrites people of every walk of life had indulged in it some as serious investigations others purely as entertainment and there were always the lonely the insecure the grieving who needed the assurance that those they had loved still existed somewhere and cared about them even beyond the grave perhaps christianity at least as the church preached it now no longer did that for them he riffled through the pages to see if there were any more cartouches but he saw none only the same one half a dozen times previously over the months of may and june the person appeared to have come every ten days or so irregularly looking again pitt saw also that roland kingsley had been seven times before and rose serracold ten times only three times had they all come to the same session he looked at the other names and saw many of them repeated over the months others were there once or twice or perhaps for three or four weeks in a row and then not again were they satisfied or disillusioned tellman would have to find them and ask learn what it was that maude lamont gave them what it had to do with the strange substance found in her mouth and throat why had a sophisticated woman like rose serracold come here to seek for voices apparitionsanswers to what surely there was some connection between her presence and that of roland kingsley he felt rather than saw tellman just beyond the doorway he turned towards him the question was in tellmans face pitt passed him the book and saw him look down at it then up again what does it mean tellman asked pointing to the cartouche ive no idea pitt admitted someone so desperate to remain unidentified that maude lamont would not write their name even in her own diary perhaps she didnt know it tellman said he took a deep breath maybe thats why she was killed she found out and tried to blackmail him over what whatever made him keep coming here a secret tellman replied maybe he wasnt a client perhaps he was a lover that could be worth killing over his mouth twisted maybe thats your special branch interest hes some politician who cant afford to be found in an affair at election time his eyes were challenging angry to be included in the case against his will and yet told nothing used but not informed pitt had been waiting for the hurt to show he felt the stab of it yet it was almost a relief to have it open between them at last possibly but i doubt it he said bluntly at least not that i know i havent any idea why special branch is involved but as far as i am aware mrs serracold is my only interest and if she turns out to have killed maude lamont then i shall have to pursue her as i would anyone else tellman relaxed a trifle but he did his best to hide the fact from pitt he straightened his shoulders a little what are we trying to protect mrs serracold from if he was aware of having used the plural to include himself he gave no sign of it political betrayal pitt replied her husband is standing for parliament his opponent may use corrupt or illegal means to discredit him you mean through his wife tellman looked startled is that what this is a political ambush probably not i expect it has nothing to do with her except chance tellman did not believe him and it showed in his face actually pitt did not really believe it himself he had tasted voiseys power too fully to credit any stroke in his favor to luck what is she like this mrs serracold tellman asked a slight furrow between his brows ive no idea pitt admitted i am only just beginning to learn something about her husband and more importantly his opponent serracold is very well off second son of an old family he studied art and history at cambridge traveled considerably he has great interest in reform and is a member of the liberal party standing for the seat in south lambeth tellmans face mirrored all his emotions although he would have been furious to know it hes privileged rich never worked a day in his life and now thinks hed like to get into government and tell the rest of us what to do and how to do it or more likely what not to do he retaliated pitt did not bother to argue from tellmans point of view that was probably close enough to the truth more or less tellman breathed out slowly not having got the argument he had hoped for he felt no sense of triumph what kind of a person comes to see a woman who says she speaks to ghosts he demanded dont they know its all rubbish people looking for something pitt replied vulnerable lonely left behind in the past because the future is unbearable for them without whomever they loved i dont know people who can be used and exploited by those who think they have power or know how to create a good illusion or both tellmans face was a mask of disgust pity struggling inside him it ought to be illegal he said between stiff lips its like a mixture of prostitution and the tricks of a fairground shark but at least they dont use your griefs to get rich on we cant stop people believing whatever they want to or need to pitt replied or exploring whatever truth they like truth tellman said derisively why cant they just go to the chapel on sundays but it was a question to which he did not expect an answer he knew there was none he had none himself he chose not to ask questions where answers lay in the very private realms of belief well weve got to find out who did it he said sharply i suppose shes got a right not to be murdered just like anyone else even if maybe she looked into things shed no business to i wouldnt want my dead disturbed he looked away from pitt how do they do the tricks tellman asked i searched that room from floor to ceiling and i didnt find anything no levers or pedals or wires anything and the maid swears she had nothing to do with it but then i suppose she would tellman paused how do you make people think you are rising up into the air for heavens sake or stretching out and getting longer and longer pitt chewed his lip more important to us how do you know what they want to hear so you can tell it to them tellman stared at him wonder in his face then slowly comprehension you find out about them he breathed the maid told us that this morning said she was very choosy about her clients you only accept those you can learn about you pick someone you know then you listen you ask questions you add up what you hear maybe you have someone go through their pockets or their bags he warmed to the subject and his eyes glittered with anger maybe you have someone talk to their servants maybe you burgle their houses and read letters papers look at their clothes ask around the tradespeople see what they spend who they owe pitt sighed and when you have enough about one or two perhaps try a little carefully chosen blackmail he added we might have a very ugly case here tellman very ugly indeed a flicker of pity softened tellmans mouth and deliberately he pulled his lips tight to hide it which of those three people did she push too far he said quietly and over what i hope it isnt your mrs serracold he lifted his chin a trifle as if his collar were too tight but if it is im not looking the other way to please special branch it wouldnt make any difference if you did pitt replied because i wont very slowly tellman relaxed he nodded fractionally and for the first time he smiled chapter four isadora underhill sat at the opulently laid out dinner table and toyed with her food pushing it around her plate with practiced elegance occasionally eating a mouthful it was not that it was unpleasant simply bland and almost exactly what she had eaten the last time she had been here in this magnificent mirrored chamber with its louis quinze sideboards and enormous gilded chandeliers indeed as far as she could recall it was also the same people as nearly as made no difference at the head of the table was her husband the bishop he looked slightly dyspeptic she thought a little puffy around the eyes pale as if he had slept badly and eaten too much and yet she saw his plate was still largely untouched perhaps he was convinced he was unwell again or more likely he was as usual too busy talking he and the archdeacon were extolling the virtues of some longdead saint she had never heard of how could anyone speak of true goodness even holiness the conquering of fear and of excuses for the petty vanities and deceits of daily life the generosity of spirit to forgive the offenses of spite and judgment kindly laughter and the love of all things living and yet still manage to make it sound so dull it should have been wonderful did she ever laugh she said suddenly there was silence around the table everyone all fifteen of them turned and stared at her as if she had knocked over her wineglass or made a rude noise did she she repeated she was a saint the archdeacons wife said patiently how can you possibly manage to be a saint with no sense of humor isadora asked sanctity is a very serious matter the archdeacon tried to explain staring at her earnestly he was a large man with a very pink face she was a woman close to god one cannot be close to god without loving ones fellow men isadora said stubbornly her eyes wide and how could one possibly love other people without an acute sense of the absurd the archdeacon blinked i dont know what you mean she looked at his small brown eyes and careful mouth no she agreed quite sure that he knew very little but then she was far from holy by her own estimation she could not imagine how anyone even a saint could love the archdeacon she wondered absently what his wife really felt why had she married him had he been different then or was it a matter of convenience or even desperation poor woman isadora looked at the bishop she tried to remember why she had married him and if they had both really been so different thirty years ago she had wanted children and it had not happened he had been an honest young man with a good future ahead of him he treated her with courtesy and respect but what was it she had imagined she saw in him his face his hands that she should let him touch her his speech that she was prepared to listen to him for the rest of her life what were his dreams that she had wanted to share them if she had ever known she had forgotten they were talking about politics now rambling on and on the strengths of this one the weaknesses of that how home rule for ireland would be the beginning of the rot which would finally split the empire and with that stop the missionary effort to bring the light of christian virtue to the rest of the world she looked around at them and wondered how many of the women were actually listening to the words they were all dressed in full dinner gowns puffshouldered tightwaisted highnecked as was the fashion surely at least some of them were staring at the white linen tablecloth the plates the cruet sets the orderly bunches of glasshouse flowers and seeing moonlight on breaking surf tumultuous seas with white water racing in and curling under with a ceaseless roar or the pale sands of some burning desert where horsemen moved black against the horizon their robes billowing in the wind the plates were removed and a fresh course brought she did not even look to see what it was how much of her life had she spent dreaming of somewhere else even wishing she were there the bishop had declined the course he must have indigestion again but it did not stop him from declaiming on the weaknesses specifically the lack of religious faith in the liberal partys parliamentary candidate for lambeth south it seemed the unfortunate mans wife met with his particular disfavor although he admitted freely that so far as he was aware he had never met her but reports had it that she admired a most regrettable kind of person some of those extraordinary socialists who called themselves the bloomsbury set and had radical and absurd notions of reform isnt sidney webb one of that group the archdeacon enquired with a twitch of distaste indeed he is if not the leading member another man replied hunching his shoulders a little he was the man who encouraged those wretched women to go on strike and the candidate for lambeth south admires this the archdeacons wife asked incredulously but it is the beginning of civil disorder and complete chaos he is inviting disaster actually i believe it was mrs serracold who expressed the opinion the bishop corrected but of course were he a man of substance and judgment he would not have permitted it quite absolutely the archdeacon nodded with vigor listening to them seeing their faces isadora warmed to mrs serracold instinctively although she had never met her either if she had had a vote she would have cast it for the womans husband who apparently was standing for lambeth south it was no sillier reason than most men had for voting as they did it was usually based upon whatever their fathers had done before them now the bishop was talking about the sanctity of womens role as protectors of the home keepers of a special place of peace and innocence where the men who fought the worlds battles could retreat to heal their souls and restore their minds ready to rejoin the fray the following morning you make us sound like a cross between a hot bath and a glass of warm milk she said into a moments silence while the archdeacon drew in his breath to answer the bishop stared at her excellently put my dear he said both cleansing and refreshing a balm to the inner man and to the outer how could he so misunderstand her he had known her for more than a quarter of a century and he thought she was agreeing with him did he not recognize sarcasm when he heard it or was he clever enough to turn it against her disarm her by seeming to take it at face value she met his eyes across the table almost hoping that he was mocking her it would at least be a communication an intelligence but he was not he looked back at her blankly and turned to the archdeacons wife and began wittering on about memories of his blessed mother who as isadora remembered her had been actually quite fun and certainly not the characterless creature he was painting with his words but how many people she knew tended not to see their parents as the rest of the world did but rather as stereotypes of mother and father as they held them to be good or bad perhaps she had not known her own parents so very well the women at the table said very little it would be considered rude for them to speak across the mens conversation and they were not equipped to join in they believed women to be good by natureat least the best of them the worst were at the very roots of damnation there were not so many in between but being good and knowing anything about goodness were not the same thing it was for women to do it and men to talk about it and when necessary to tell women how it should be done since she was neither required nor permitted to contribute to the discussion other than by a pleasant and interested expression she allowed her mind to wander curious how many of her mental images involved faraway places especially over the sea she thought of the vast spaces of the ocean with a level horizon on every side trying to imagine what it would feel like to have only a deck beneath your feet constantly moving the wind and sun on your face to know that you must have in the tiny wholeness of that ship all that you needed to survive and to find your way across the trackless waste which could rise up in terrible storms to batter you even to hold and crush you like a mighty hand or it could lie so still there was not enough breath across its face to fill your sails what lived beneath it beautiful things fearful things unimaginable things and the only guidance was in the stars above or of course the sun and a perfect clock if you had the skill really have to speak to someone about it a woman in tan and tobaccobrown lace was saying we look to you bishop of course mrs howarth he nodded sagely touching his napkin to his lips of course isadora averted her eyes she did not want to be drawn into the conversation why didnt they talk about the ocean it was the ideal analogy of how alone each person is on the voyage of life how you have to carry within you everything you need and only by the understanding of the heavens could you ever know in which direction to steer captain cornwallis would have understood then she blushed at how easily his name had come to her mind and with what a lurch of pleasure she felt as if she were transparent had anyone else seen her face of course she and cornwallis had never spoken of such things not directly but she knew he felt it more completely than any speech he could say so much in a sentence or two whereas these men around her were drowning the evening in words and saying almost nothing the bishop was still talking and she looked at his complacent unlistening face and realized with a horror that rippled right through her like insects crawling that she actually disliked him how long had she felt like that since meeting john cornwallis or before what had her whole life been spent in the daily presenceshe could not say companyof a man she did not even truly like much less love a duty a discipline of the spirit a waste what would it have been like if she could only have met cornwallis thirtyone years ago she might not have loved him then or he her they had both been such different people the lessons of time and loneliness unlearned anyway it was pointless to think of it no past can ever be undone but she could not dismiss the future in the same way what if she escaped this charade just walked away would it be possible go to cornwallis of course they had neither of them ever said as muchit would be unthinkablebut she knew he loved her as she had slowly realized she loved him he had the honesty the courage the simplicity of mind that was like clear water to her inner thirst she had to search for his humor wait for it but it was there and without unkindness it hurt to think of him it made this ridiculous evening and her presence in it even more painful had any of them even the remotest idea of where her imagination was her face flamed at the thought they were still talking about politics the same subject of how dangerous the extreme liberal ideas were already they undermined the values of christianity they threatened sobriety church attendance the keeping of the sabbath the general obedience and respect appropriate even the very sanctity of the home safeguarded by the modesty of women what would she and cornwallis have been talking about certainly not what other people ought to be doing saying or thinking they would speak of wonderful places ancient cities on the shores of other seas cities like istanbul athens alexandria places of ancient legend and adventure in her mind the sun shone on warm stones the sky was blue too bright to look at for more than a moment and the air was warm it would be enough even to talk about it with him she would not ever have to go there just listen and dream even to sit in silence knowing his thoughts were the same would be good enough what would happen if she left here and went to him what would she lose her reputation of course the condemnation would be deafening men would be scandalized and of course terrified their own wives might be given the idea and the example to do the same thing women would be even more furious because they would envy her and hate her for it those who stayed at the call of duty which would be almost all of them would positively bristle with virtue she would never be able to speak to any of them again they would cut her dead in the street she would become invisible funny how a scarlet woman was not seen you would think she would be the most highly visible of all isadora smiled at the thought and saw a look of puzzlement in the face of the woman across the table from her the conversation was hardly humorous reality came back it was only a daydream a sweet and painful way of escaping a tedious evening even if she were wild enough to go to cornwallis he would never accept her offer it would be utterly dishonorable to take another mans wife would he even be tempted perhaps not he would be embarrassed by her ashamed of her forwardness or that she should even think that he might accept such an offer would that hurt intolerably no if he were a man who would have accepted then she would not have wanted him the conversation babbled on around her getting heated over some difference of theological opinion now but if cornwallis would have accepted her would she have gone the answer hovered only a moment on her mind undecided then she was afraid that at this instant hearing the suffocating pomposity around her at this stiff unhappy table yes yes she would have seized the chance and escaped but it would not happen she knew that absolutely it was more real than the lights of the chandeliers or the hard edge of the table under her hands the voices ebbed and flowed around her nobody noticed that she had said nothing for a while not even the polite murmuring of agreement going to cornwallis was a daydream she would never follow through but suddenly it was intensely important that she know if he would have wished her to were it possible if in some way it could have been all right nothing else mattered quite as much she needed to see him again just to talk about anything or nothing but to know that he still cared he would not say so he never had maybe she would never hear him say the words i love you she would have to make do with silence awkwardness the look in his eyes and the sudden color in his face where could they meet that would cause no comment it must be a place where both of them customarily went so it would look to be chance an exhibition of some sort of paintings or artifacts she had no idea what was showing at the moment she had not until this moment felt like looking the national gallery always had something she would write to cornwallis send him a message casually worded an invitation to see whatever it was it would be simple enough to find out she would do it in the morning first thing she could say something about its being interesting and wondering if he might find it enjoyable also if it were seascapes no excuse would be needed if something else then it hardly mattered whether he believed her or not what counted was if he came it was immodest the very thing the archdeacon had been railing against but what was there to lose what had she anyway but this empty game words without communication closeness without intimacy passion laughter or tenderness her mind was made up suddenly she was hungry and the creme caramel in front of her seemed hardly more than a couple of mouthfuls she should not have ignored the preceding courses but it was too late now actually the national gallery was showing an exhibition of hogarths paintingsportraits not his political cartoons and commentaries in his lifetime some hundred and odd years ago he had been dismissed by the critics as a miserable colorist but now his standing had risen considerably it was something she could quite easily suggest was worth seeing to make ones own judgment and either confirm the critics or confound them she wrote quickly without giving herself time to become selfconscious and lose her courage dear captain cornwallis i became aware this morning that the national gallery has mounted an exhibition of the portraits painted by hogarth which were much derided in his lifetime but now have gained far more favorable attention it is remarkable how opinion can swing so wildly upon a single talent i should now like to see them for myself and form my own judgment knowing your interest in art and your own ability i thought you might also find them thoughtprovoking i appreciate that you have little time for such things but in the hope that duty might allow you half an hour or so i thought to inform you i have determined to take at least that long for myself perhaps towards the end of this afternoon when i am not required at home my curiosity is awakened is he as bad as they first said or as good as they say now i hope i have not intruded upon your time sincerely isadora underhill no matter how many times she went over it it would always be clumsier than she wished she must post it before she read it through again and felt too abashed to send it a quick walk to the letterbox on the corner and it was irretrievable at four oclock she dressed in her most flattering summer costume of old rose with falls of white lace over both sleeves as far as the elbow and setting her hat on at a more rakish angle than usual left her home it was only when her cab turned into trafalgar square that suddenly she felt she was being ridiculous she leaned forward to tell the driver that she had changed her mind then said nothing if she did not now go and cornwallis was there he would feel it a deliberate rejection she would have taken an irrevocable step she did not mean she could never afterwards withdraw it he was not a man to whom one could explain he would simply not open himself up to such hurt again she sat back in the seat and waited until the cab stopped near the wide steps up to the immense pillars and the imposing front of the gallery she alighted and paid her fare then she stood in the sun amid the pigeons and the sightseers the flower sellers the distant impressive stone lions the noise of traffic she must have let the boredom addle her wits last night by writing to cornwallis she had placed herself in a position where she had either to go back or forward she could no longer remain where she was lonely uncommitted dreaming but afraid it was like standing at a gambling table and having cast the dice waiting for them to stop rolling and decide her fate that was overstating it she had simply written to a friend advising him of an interesting exhibition which she was going to see herself then why were her legs trembling as she walked up the steps and across the stones to the entrance good afternoon she said to the man at the door good afternoon madam he replied politely touching his cap where is the hogarth exhibition she asked to the left madam he said inclining his head towards a huge notice she blushed hotly and almost choked on the words as she thanked him he must think her blind how would anyone unable to see a notice a yard high be able to appreciate paintings she swept past him and into the first room there were at least a dozen people in it at a glance she saw two with whom she was acquainted should she speak to them and draw attention to herself or not and perhaps be thought to snub them that would cause comment and certainly be repeated before she could reach a decision years of training overtook her and she spoke then instantly thought she might have ruined her chance of speaking to cornwallis other than meaninglessly in passing she could hardly say or hear anything she wanted to in company but it was too late the acknowledgment was made she asked after their health commented on the weather and prayed they would leave she had not the slightest desire to discuss the pictures with them in the end she lied claiming to see in the next room some elderly lady she knew and urgently wished to speak with there were another dozen people there also but not cornwallis her heart sank why had she supposed he would come as if he were at her beck and call with nothing to do but go to art galleries on a whim she had no doubt whatever that he had been attracted to her but attraction was not love not the profound and abiding emotion she felt the women were coming in from the previous room she could not escape a further half hours desperate conversation ensued what did it matter the whole idea had been ridiculous she wished more than anything on earth that she had never written to him if only the post had swallowed her letter lost it forever then she saw him he had come his stance the set of his shoulders she would recognize anywhere in a moment he would turn and see her then she would have to go forward between now and that instant she must control the thumping of her heart hope to heaven her face did not betray her and think what to say that opened the way for him to speak and yet was not too forward too eager that would make her look gauche and it would repel him he turned as if he felt her stare she saw the pleasure light his face and then his effort to cover it for his ease she forgot herself and went forward good afternoon captain cornwallis i am delighted you were able to spare the time to see this for yourself she gestured delicately towards one of the largest paintings that of six heads all facing out of the canvas looking over the left shoulder of the viewer it was titled hogarths servants i think they were mistaken she said firmly those are real people and excellently drawn look at the anxiety of the one in the middle poor man and the calm of the woman on the left the one at the top looks scarcely more than a child he agreed but the moment after he had glanced at the picture his eyes were searching her face im glad we chanced to meet he said then hesitated as if he had been too elaborately casual it it has been a long time at least it seems so how are you she could not possibly answer with the truth and yet she longed to say so lonely i escape into daydreams i have discovered that my husband not only bores me but i actually dislike him instead she said what she always did very well thank you and you she looked away from the picture and at him there was a very slight color in his cheeks oh very well he answered then he too turned away he took a step or two to the right and stopped in front of the next picture it was another portrait but this time a single person it must have been fashion he said thoughtfully one critic mimicking what the others had said how could anyone with an open mind consider this poor the face lives it is highly individual what more does one wish of a portrait i dont know she admitted perhaps they wanted it to tell them something they already believed sometimes people wish to hear only what supports the position they would like to maintain she thought of the bishop as she said it and the endless evenings when she had listened to men decrying ideas without looking at them maybe the ideas were bad but then again maybe not without consideration they would never know it is so much easier to blame she said aloud he looked at her quickly his eyes full of questions but he did not ask her of course he didnt that would be intrusive and improper she must not let the conversation die she had come here to see him to learn if his feelings were still the same there was nothing to do almost certainly but she still needed to know if he longed for her as much as she did for him there is so much in faces dont you think she remarked as they approached another portrait things that can never be said and yet are there if you search for them yes indeed he looked down at the floor for a moment then up again at the portrait when one has experienced something one recognizes it in others i i remember a bosun i had once phillips his name was i couldnt abide the man he hesitated but did not look at her then one early morning we were off the azores terrible weather gales whipping up out of the west waves twenty thirty feet high any sane man would be frightened but there was a beauty in it as well troughs of the waves were dark still but early light caught the spume on the tips i saw the recognition of beauty in his face just for an instant before he turned away cant even remember what he was going to do his eyes were far away but in a moment of realization in the past the magic of understanding she smiled sharing it with him picturing it in his imagination she liked to think of him on the deck of a ship it seemed the right place for him his element far more than a police desk and yet she would never have met him were he still there and if he returned to the sea she would be forever watching the weather every time the wind blew fearing for him every time she heard of a ship in trouble wondering if it were his he looked at her catching her gaze and the warmth in it sorry he apologized quickly blushing and turning away his neck stiff daydreaming i do a lot of it she said quickly do you he swiveled back to her looking surprised where do you go i mean i mean where would you like to go anywhere with you would have been the truth somewhere i havent been before she answered perhaps the mediterranean what about alexandria or greece somewhere i think youd like it he said softly the light is like nothing anywhere else so brilliant the sea so blue and of course there are the indies west i mean as long as you dont go too far south the danger of fevers is not high jamaica or the bahamas do you wish you were still at sea she was afraid of the answer perhaps that was where his heart really lay he looked at her for a moment without discretion or guard in his face no it was only one word but the passion in his voice filled it with all she was waiting to hear she felt the color burn up inside her the relief dizzying he had not changed he had said nothing just answered a simple question about travel one word but the meaning was like a huge wave buoying her up lifting her as if into the air she smiled back allowing her other feelings to be unconcealed for an instant then she turned back to the portrait she said something meaningless a remark about color or texture of paint she was not listening to herself and she knew he was not either she put off going home for as long as possible it would be the end of a dream the return to the daily reality from which she had escaped and the inevitable guilt because her heart was not where it ought to be even if her body was eventually at nearly seven oclock she went in through the front door and as soon as she was inside felt imprisoned in the grayness of it that was ridiculous it was really a very pleasant house full of soft color and most agreeably furnished the lack of light was inside her she walked across the floor to the foot of the stairs and reached the bottom just as the bishops study door opened and he came out his hair a little tousled as if he had run his hand through it his face was pale his eyes darkringed where have you been he demanded querulously do you know what time it is five minutes before seven she replied glancing at the long case clock against the farther wall the question was rhetorical isadora he snapped i can read a dial as well as you can and that does not answer where you have been to see the exhibition of hogarths paintings at the national gallery she replied blandly he raised his eyebrows until this hour i met some acquaintances and fell into conversation she explained that was true literally if not in implication she resented the fact that she had justified herself to him she turned away to go up the stairs and remove her hat and change into an appropriate gown for supper that is most unsuitable he said sharply he painted the sort of person you should have no interest in rakes progress indeed sometimes i think you have lost all sense of responsibility isadora it is time you took your position a great deal more seriously it was an exhibition of his portraits she said tartly turning back to look at him there was nothing unsuitable about them at all there were several of domestic servants with very agreeable faces and dressed right up to the ears they even had hats on there is no need to be flippant he criticized and wearing a hat does not make one virtuous as you should know she was stunned why on earth should i know that because you are as aware as i am of the laxity and spiteful tongues of many of the women who attend church every sunday he replied with hats on this conversation is absurd she said exasperated what is the matter with you are you unwell she did not mean it in any literal way he bordered on hypochondria and she no longer had patience with it then she realized the remarkable change in him the little color he had bleached out of his skin do i look ill he demanded yes certainly you do she answered honestly what did you have for luncheon his eyes widened as if a sudden thought had come to him a bright and uplifting one then anger swept over him color making his cheeks pink grilled sole he snapped i prefer to dine alone this evening i have a sermon to prepare and without saying anything further or even glancing up at her he turned on his heel and went back to his study closing the door with a sharp snap however at dinnertime he changed his mind isadora did not particularly wish to eat but the cook had prepared a meal and she felt it ungracious not to partake so she was seated alone at the table when the bishop appeared she wondered whether to make any remark on his feeling better and decided not to he might construe it as sarcasm or criticismor worse he might tell her in far more detail than she wished to know exactly how he was for the entire soup course they ate in silence when the parlormaid brought in the salmon and vegetables the bishop at last spoke things are looking dark i dont expect you to understand politics but new forces are gaining power and influence over certain parts of society those easily enamored of new ideas simply because they are new he stopped apparently having forgotten his train of thought she waited more out of courtesy than interest i am afraid for the future he said quietly looking down at his plate she was used to pompous statements so it startled her that she really believed him she heard fear in his voice not pious concern for mankind but real sharp anxiety the sort that wakens you in the night with sweat on your body and your heart knocking in your chest what could he possibly know that would shock him out of his habitual complacency certitude that he was right was a way of life with him a shield against all the arrows of doubt that afflict most people could it be anything that mattered she really did not want to know it was probably some miserable issue of insult or quarrel within the church hierarchy or more tragic someone he cared for fallen from grace she should have asked him but tonight she had no patience to listen to some variation on old themes she had heard over and over in one form or another all her married life you can only do your best she said calmly i daresay when you tackle it a day at a time it will not be so bad she picked up her fork and began to eat again they both continued in silence for a while then she looked up at him and saw panic in his eyes he was staring at her as if he peered far beyond to something unendurable his hand holding the fish fork was trembling and there were beads of sweat on his lip reginald what has happened she said with alarm in spite of herself she was concerned for him it angered her she did not want to have any involvement with his feelings at all but she could not escape the fact that he was profoundly and mortally afraid of something reginald he gulped you are quite right he said licking his dry lips a day at a time he looked down at his plate its nothing i should not have disturbed your dinner of course its nothing i am seeinghe took a deep shuddering breathmuch too far ahead trust the divine divine he pushed himself back from the table and stood up i have had sufficient please excuse me she half rose herself reginald dont disturb yourself he snapped walking away but he glared at her dont make an issue of it i am going to do some work reading i need to study i need to know more and he closed the door with a bang leaving her alone in the dining room confused and just as angry as he was but with a growing feeling of unease the cottage on the edge of dartmoor was beautiful exactly what charlotte had hoped for but without pitt it lacked its heart and for her its purpose she had found the whitechapel affair very hard to bear more than pitt himself she had burned at the injustice of it she accepted that it was pointless to fight but it did not ease the anger inside her it had seemed in buckingham palace as if at a terrible price for greataunt vespasia it was all going to be all right for pitt voisey was robbed of his chance ever to be president of a republic of britain and pitt was back in charge at bow street now inexplicably it was all gone again the inner circle had not collapsed as they had hoped in spite of the queen it had had the power to remove pitt again and send him back to special branch where he was junior unskilled in whatever arts they required and responsible to victor narraway who had no loyalty to him and it seemed no sense of honor to keep his promises regarding a holiday which had been more than earned but again they were not in a position to fight or even to complain pitt needed the job in special branch it was almost as well paid as bow street had been and they had no resources other than his salary for the first time in her life she was aware not just of having to be very careful with money but of the real danger that they might cease to have any to be careful with so she held her peace and pretended to the children and to gracie that being here in this wild sun and winddrenched countryside was what she wanted and the fact that they were alone was only temporary it was for the excitement and the adventure of it not because pitt felt they were safer out of london where voisey did not know how to find them i never seen so much air in all me life gracie said in amazement as they walked up a long steep incline to the top of the track and stared out across the vast panorama of the moors stretching into the distance in hazy greens and sorrels splashed with gold here and there cloudshadowed to people in the distance are we the only ones wots ere she said in awe just now nobody else lives ere there are farmers charlotte answered gazing around to the dark rise of the moor itself to the north and the softer more vivid slopes of the hills and valleys to the south and the villages are mostly on the lee sides of the slopes look you can see smoke over there she pointed to a slim column of gray smoke so faint one had to peer to make it out ere gracie shouted suddenly you look out your lordship edward grinned at her then hared over the grass with daniel after him they tumbled together in the green bracken and went rolling over and over in a tangle of arms and legs the sound of laughter quick and happy boys jemima said in disgust then suddenly she changed her mind and went running and jumping easily after them in spite of herself charlotte smiled even without pitt it could be good here the cottage was only half a mile from the center of the village a pleasant walk people seemed friendly and willing to be helpful away from the city the roads were narrow and winding the views from the upstairs windows seemed to stretch forever the silence at night was unfamiliar and once they had blown the candles out the darkness was total but they were safe and even if that was not what seemed most important to her it was to pitt he had felt the possibility of danger and to bring the children here was the only way now in which she could help she heard a noise behind her and turned to see a pony and trap coming up the winding track just below them there was a man driving it face windburned eyes narrowed against the brilliance of the light as if searching for something he saw them and as he drew level he looked at her more closely arternoon he said pleasantly enough youll be the lady as as come to rent the garths cottage over yon he nodded but it was a statement that seemed to require an answer yes charlotte agreed thats wot i told em he said with satisfaction picking up the reins again and urging the pony forward charlotte looked at gracie gracie took a step after the man then stopped mebbe its just interest like she said quietly there cant be much appens round ere yes of course charlotte agreed all the same dont let the children go out of sight and well lock the doors at night safer even out here yeah o course gracie said firmly dont want no wild animals wanderin in foxes and the like or wotever i dunno wot they ave ere she stared into the distance int it beautiful dyer think mebbe i should keep a diary or summink i might never see anyfink like this again thats a very good idea charlotte said instantly we all will children where are you she was absurdly relieved when she heard their answer and all three of them came chasing back over the tussocky grass she must not allow herself to spoil their happiness with fears for which there was no reason chapter five the day after the murder of maude lamont the newspapers gave it sufficient importance to place it on the front page along with election news and foreign events there was no question that it had been a crime rather than an accident or natural causes the police presence confirmed as much but there had been no statement issued beyond the fact that the housekeeper miss lena forrest had summoned them she had refused to speak and inspector tellman had said only that the matter was being investigated standing by the kitchen table pitt poured himself a second cup of tea and offered to do the same for tellman who was moving impatiently from one foot to the other he declined weve seen half a dozen of the other clients he said frowning they all swear by her say she was the most gifted medium theyd ever known whatever that means he threw it out almost as a challenge as if he wanted pitt to explain it he was deeply unhappy with the whole subject and yet obviously whatever he had been told since pitt had last seen him had disturbed the simple contempt he had had before what did she tell them and how pitt asked tellman glared at him spirits coming out of her mouth he said waiting for the derision he was certain would follow wavering and sort of fuzzy but they were quite sure it was the head and face of someone they knew and where was maude lamont while this was going on pitt asked sitting in her chair at the head of the table or in a special sort of cabinet they had built so her hands couldnt escape she suggested that herself for their belief what did she charge for this he sipped his tea one said two guineas another said five tellman answered biting his lip thing is if shes just saying its entertainment and they wont bring a charge against her there wouldnt have been anything we could do anyway cant arrest a conjurer and they paid willingly i suppose its a bit of comfort isnt it it probably comes in the same category as patent medicines pitt thought aloud if you believe it will cure a nervous headache or make you sleep better maybe it will and whos to say you have no right to try it because its nonsense tellman responded with vehemence shes making a living out of people who dont know any better she tells them what they want to hear anybody could do that could they pitt said quickly send your men back to ask more carefully we need to know if she was getting real information that wasnt public knowledge and we cant account for how she heard it tellmans eyes opened wide in disbelief and then a shadow of real alarm if shes got an informant i want to know about it pitt snapped and i mean a fleshandblood one tellmans face was comical with relief then he blushed hot dull red pitt grinned it was the first time he had found anything to laugh at since cornwallis had told him he was back in special branch i assume you have already made enquiries about anyone seen in the street near cosmo place he went on that evening or any other who might be our anonymous client of course i have thats what i have sergeants and constables for tellman said tartly you cant have forgotten that so soon im coming with you to see this major general kingsley im sure your judgment of him will be very perceptive but i want to make my own as well his jaw tightened and hes one of the only two witnesses we have who were there at the seance he invested the word with all the anger and frustration he felt in dealing with people who exercised their rights to make fools of themselves and involve him in the results he did not want to be sorry for them still less to understand and the struggle to maintain his dispassion was clear in his face and that he had already lost pitt searched for fear or superstition and saw not even a shadow he put down his empty cup what is it tellman said sharply pitt smiled at him not in humor but in an affection which surprised him nothing he replied lets go and speak to kingsley and ask him why he went to miss lamont and what she was able to do for him most especially on the night she died he turned and walked along the passage to the front door and allowing tellman to pass him closed it and locked it behind him morning sir the postman said cheerfully lovely day again yes pitt agreed not recognizing the man good morning are you new on this street yes sir just two weeks the postman replied getting to know people like met your missus a few days ago lovely lady his eyes widened avent seen her since though not poorly i ope colds can be wicked to get rid of this time o year which dont seem fair bein so warm an all pitt was about to reply that she was on holiday but he realized with a sudden chill that the man could be anyone or pass on gathered information anywhere no thank you he responded briskly she is quite well good day good day sir and whistling through his teeth the postman moved on ill get a cab tellman offered looking up and down keppel street and seeing none available why not walk pitt asked dismissing the postman from his mind and swinging into a long easy stride eastward towards russell square its not more than half a mile or so harrison street just the other side of the foundling hospital tellman grunted and did a couple of double steps to catch up with him pitt smiled to himself he knew tellman was wondering exactly how he had discovered where kingsley lived without the assistance of the police station which he would know pitt had not sought he would be wondering if special branch already had an interest in kingsley they walked in silence around russell square across the traffic of woburn place and along berner street towards brunswick square and the huge oldfashioned mass of the hospital they turned right instinctively avoiding the childrens burial ground pitt was touched by sadness as he always was and glanced sideways to see the same lowered eyes and twist of the lips in tellman he realized with a jolt that for all the years they had worked together he knew very little of tellmans past except the anger at poverty which showed naked so often he almost took it for granted now not even wondering what real pain lay behind it gracie probably knew more of the man within the rigid exterior than pitt did but then gracie was a child of the same narrow alleys and the fight for survival she would not need to be told anything she might see it differently but she understood pitt had grown up the son of the gamekeeper on sir arthur desmonds country estate his parents were servants his father had been accused and found guilty of poaching and deported wrongly pitt believed the passion of that conviction had never changed but he had not been hungry for more than a day nor walked in danger of attack except by the boys his own age a few bruises were his worst affliction and the odd very sore backside from the head gardener richly deserved in silence they passed the infants burial place there was too much to say and nothing at all he has a telephone he said at last as they turned into harrison street what tellman had been lost in his own thoughts kingsley has a telephone pitt repeated you called him tellman was startled no i looked him up pitt explained tellman blushed hotly he had never thought of a private persons owning one although he knew pitt did perhaps one day he could afford it and maybe even have to but not yet promotion was still fresh and raw to him uncomfortable as a new collar it did not fitmost especially with pitt dogging his footsteps every day and taking his first case from him it abraded the tender skin they continued side by side until they reached kingsleys house and were admitted they were shown through a rather dark oakpaneled hall hung with pictures of battles on three of the walls there was no time to look at the brass plates beneath them to see which ones they were at a glance most of them looked roughly napoleonic one appeared to be a burial it had more emotion than the others and better interest of light and shadow a sense of tragedy in the huddled outline of the bodies perhaps it was moore after corunna the morning room was rigidly masculine also greens and browns lots of leather and bookcases with heavy uniform volumes on the farther wall hung a variety of african weapons assegais and spears they were dented and scarred with use there was a fine but rather stylized bronze of a hussar on the central table the horse was beautifully wrought when the butler had gone tellman gazed around with interest but no sense of comfort the room belonged to a man of a social class and a discipline alien to him and representing all he had been brought up to resent one experience in particular had forced him to see a retired army officer as human vulnerable even to be deeply admired but he still regarded that as an exception the man who owned this room and whose life was mirrored in the pictures and furnishings was eccentric to say the least almost a contradiction in conceptions how could anyone who had done that most hideously practical of things leading men in war have so lost his grasp on reality as to be consulting a woman who claimed she spoke to ghosts the door opened and a tall rather gaunt man came in his face had an ashen look as if he were ill his hair was clipped short and his mustache was little more than a dark smudge over his upper lip he stood straight but it was the habit of a lifetime which kept him so not any inner vitality good morning gentlemen my butler tells me you are from the police what may i do for you there was no surprise in his voice possibly he had read of maude lamonts death in the newspapers pitt had already decided not to mention his connection with special branch if he said nothing of it kingsley would assume he was with tellman good morning general kingsley he replied i am superintendent pitt and this is my colleague inspector tellman i am sorry to tell you that miss maude lamont died two nights ago she was found yesterday morning in her home because of the circumstances we are obliged to investigate the matter very thoroughly i believe you were there at her last seance tellman stiffened at pitts bluntness kingsley took in a deep breath he looked distinctly shaken he invited pitt and tellman to be seated and then sank into one of the large leather chairs himself he offered nothing waiting for them to begin will you tell us what happened sir from the time of your arrival at southampton row pitt asked kingsley cleared his throat it seemed to cost him an effort pitt thought it odd that a military man who must surely be accustomed to violent death should be so disturbed by murder was not war murder on a grand scale surely men went into battle with the express intention of killing as many of the enemy as possible it could hardly be that this time the dead person was a woman women were all too often the victims of the violence looting and destruction that went with war i arrived at a few minutes after half past nine kingsley began we were due to begin at a quarter to ten were the arrangements longstanding pitt interrupted they were made the previous week kingsley answered it was my fourth visit with the same three people pitt said quickly kingsley hesitated only a moment no it was only the third with exactly the same who were they this time there was no hesitation at all i dont know but you were there together we were there at the same time kingsley corrected in no sense were we together except that that it helps to have the force of several personalities present he added no explanation as to what he meant can you describe them if you know i was there superintendent my name and where to find me do you not also know the same of them a flash of interest crossed tellmans face pitt saw it in the corner of his vision kingsley was at last behaving like the leader of men he was supposed to be pitt wondered what shattering thing had happened to him that he had ever thought of turning to a spiritualist it was painful and repellent intruding into the wounds of peoples lives but the motives of murder were too often hidden within terrible events in the past and to understand the core of it he had to read it all i know the name of the woman he replied to the question not the third person miss lamont designated him in her diary only by a little diagram a cartouche kingsley frowned slightly i have no idea why i cant help you can you describe him to me or her not with any accuracy kingsley replied we did not go there as a social event i had no desire to be more than civil to anyone else present it was a man of average height as far as i recall he wore an outdoor coat in spite of the season so i dont know his build his hair seemed light rather than dark possibly gray he remained in the shadows towards the back of the room and the lamps were red so the light distorted i imagine i might know him if we were to meet again but i am not certain who was the first to arrive tellman cut across i was kingsley replied then the woman can you describe the woman pitt interrupted thinking of the long pale hair around maude lamonts sleeve button i thought you knew who she was kingsley retorted i have a name pitt explained i would like your impression of her appearance also kingsley resigned himself she was tall taller than most women very elegant with pale blond hair dressed in a sort of he gave up pitt felt a knot tighten almost to suffocation inside himself thank you he murmured please continue the other man was the last to come kingsley resumed obediently as far as i can recall he was last on the other occasions as well he came in through the garden doors and left before we did who left last pitt asked him the woman kingsley said she was still there when i went he looked unhappy as if the answer gave him no satisfaction or sense of escape the other man went out of the garden doors tellman asked for confirmation yes did miss lamont go with him and lock the gate to cosmo place after him no she remained with us the maid she left shortly after we arrived went out of the kitchen door i suppose saw her walk across the garden just about dusk she was carrying a lantern which she left outside the front door pitt visualized the garden path from the back of the house on southampton row it led only to the door in the wall and cosmo place she went out of the side door he said aloud yes kingsley agreed probably why she took the lantern left it on the front step heard her footsteps on the gravel and saw the light tellman finished the meaning for him so either the woman killed miss lamont or you or the other man came back through the side gate and killed her or someone we know nothing about came for a later meeting of some sort and miss lamont herself let them in through the front door but that was unlikely and according to the maid miss lamont was usually tired after a seance and retired to her bed when her guests left there was no one else in the diary no one else has been seen or heard what time did you leave general kingsley about quarter to midnight late to have a further client pitt remarked kingsley rubbed his hand over his brow as if his head pained him he looked weary and beaten i really have no idea what happened after i left he said gently she seemed perfectly well then and not in any state of anxiety or distress certainly not as if she were afraid of anyone or indeed expected anyone she was tired very tired calling upon the spirits of those gone before was always a very exhausting experience it usually left her with barely the strength to wish us goodnight and to see us to the door he stopped staring miserably into emptiness stretching ahead of him tellman glanced at pitt and away again the depth of emotion in kingsley and the bizarre subject of the discussion embarrassed him it was plain in the rigidity of his body and the way his hands fidgeted on his lap can you describe the evening for us please general kingsley pitt prompted what happened after you arrived and were all assembled was there a conversation no we we were all there for our own reasons i had no desire to share mine with others and i believe they felt the same kingsley did not look at him as he said this as if the matter were still private we sat around the table and waited while miss lamont concentrated upon summoning the spirits he spoke hesitantly he must have been aware at least of tellmans disbelief and a hovering between pity and contempt he seemed almost to breathe it in the air pitt was uncertain what he felt not contempt so much as unease a kind of oppression he could not have said why but he believed it was not right to be attempting to reach the spirits of the dead whether it was possible or not where did you sit he said aloud miss lamont at the head of the table in the tallbacked chair he replied the woman opposite her the man to her left with his back to the windows i to her right we held hands naturally tellman fidgeted slightly in his seat is that usual pitt asked yes to prevent suspicion of fraud some mediums will even sit inside a cabinet to be doubly restrained and i believe miss lamont did that on occasion but i have not seen her do it why not tellman asked abruptly there was no need kingsley replied with a swift angry glance at him we were all believers we would not have insulted her with such a a piece of physical nonsense we were seeking knowledge a greater truth not cheap sensations i see pitt said quietly without looking at tellman then what happened as far as i can recall miss lamont went into a trance kingsley replied she seemed to rise in the air several inches above her chair and after some moments she spoke in a totally different voice i he looked down at the floor i believe it was her spirit guide speaking to us through her the words were so quiet pitt had to strain to hear them he wished to know what we had come to find out he was a young russian boy who had died in terrible cold in the far north up near the arctic circle this time tellman made no movement at all and what did any of you reply pitt asked he needed to know what rose serracold had attended for but he was afraid that if kingsley gave that answer first and saw or sensed tellmans response he would then conceal his own reasons and perhaps they too were relevant after all he had written the virulent political attack on aubrey serracold albeit without knowing he was the husband of the woman who sat beside him at maude lamonts table or had he kingsley was silent for a moment general kingsley pitt pressed what did you wish to learn through miss lamont with great difficulty kingsley answered still staring at the floor my son robert served in africa in the zulu wars he was killed in action there i his voice cracked i wanted to assure myself that his death was that his spirit was at rest there have been different accounts of the action i needed to know he did not look up at pitt as if he did not want to see what was in his face or reveal the raw need inside him pitt felt some acknowledgment at least was required i see he said softly and were you able to obtain such a thing he knew even as he asked that kingsley had not the fear in him was tangible in the room and now too the grief was explained in maude lamonts death he had lost his contact with the only world he believed could give him an answer surely he would not willingly have destroyed it not yet kingsley replied his words so swallowed in his throat pitt was not sure for a moment if he had heard them at all he was aware of tellman beside him and his acute discomfort ordinary grief he was accustomed to but this confounded and disturbed him he was unsure of his own responses he ought to feel ridicule and impatience that was what all his experience of life had taught him looking for a moment at tellmans face it was compassion that pitt saw what did the woman want pitt asked kingsley was jerked out of his own thoughts he glanced up his eyes puzzled im not sure she was very eager to contact her mother but i was not certain why it must have been a very private matter because all her questions were too oblique for me to understand and the answers pitt found himself tense afraid of what kingsley might tell him why was rose serracold risking the expense and possible ridicule at this extraordinarily sensitive time had she no perception at all of what it meant or was her search so important to her that all other things were subject to it what could that possibly be her mother pitt said aloud yes and did miss lamont contact her apparently what did she ask to know nothing specific kingsley looked puzzled as he recalled it just general family information other relatives who had gone over her grandmother her father were they well when was that pitt pressed the night of miss lamonts death before that if you can remember exactly what was said it would be most helpful kingsley frowned i find it very difficult to imagine that she would have hurt miss lamont he said earnestly she seemed an eccentric woman highly individual but i saw no anger in her no unkindness or ill feeling rather he stopped tellman leaned forward yes pitt prompted fear kingsley said quietly as if it were an emotion with which he had long intimacy but there is no point in your asking me of what because i have no idea she seemed concerned if her father were happy if he were restored to health it was an odd question i thought as if disability could be carried beyond the grave but perhaps when one has loved somebody such concerns are understandable love does not always go by the rules of reason still he kept his eyes averted as if it were his only privacy and the other man who was he seeking pitt asked i dont recall anyone in particular kingsley frowned as he said it as if realizing only now how it puzzled him but he came at least three times that you know of pitt insisted yes he was deeply in earnest kingsley assured him looking up now no more emotion to guard the man had stirred nothing in him no specific compassion he asked some very telling questions and would not rest until they were answered he explained i did ask miss lamont on one occasion if she thought he were a skeptic a doubter but she appeared to know his reasons and was quite undisturbed by them i i find that he stopped odd tellman supplied i was going to say comforting kingsley answered he did not explain himself but pitt understood maude lamont must have been very confident in her skill whatever its nature to be unthreatened by the presence of a skeptic at her seances but then she had apparently not been aware of the hatred which had ended in her death this man did not ask to contact anyone by name he persisted several kingsley contradicted him but none with particular eagerness it seemed almost as if he were picking names at random any subject that he sought pitt would not give up so easily none that i was aware pitt looked at him gravely we dont know who he is general kingsley he may be the one who murdered maude lamont he saw kingsley wince and the lost look return to his eyes what did you gather from his voice his manner anything at all his clothes his deportment was he a welleducated man what were his beliefs in anything or his opinions what would you guess his background to be his income his place in society if he has an occupation what is it did he ever mention any family wife or where he lives did he come far to attend the seances anything at all again kingsley waited for so long in thought that pitt was afraid he was not going to reply then he began to speak slowly his accent suggested an excellent education the little he said inclined more towards the humanities than any science his clothes so much as i could see them or thought to look were discreet dark his manner was nervous but i attributed that to the occasion i cannot remember any specific opinions but i had the feeling that he was more conservative than i pitt thought of the newspaper article are you not conservative general kingsley no sir now kingsley looked up directly at pitt meeting his eyes i have served in the army with all manner of men and i would dearly like to see a fairer treatment of the ranks than exists at the present moment i think when one has faced hardship and even death side by side with a man one sees the worth of him far more clearly than his worldly opportunities may make apparent from the candor in his face disbelief was impossible and yet what he said was deeply at odds with what he had written to four separate newspapers pitt was more convinced than ever that kingsley was involved with voisey and the election but whether willingly or not he had no idea nor did he know if with sufficient pressure he might have contributed to maude lamonts death he considered mentioning the articles against serracold and telling him that the woman at the seances was serracolds wife but he could think of nothing to gain by it now and once told he could never achieve that possible advantage of surprise so he thanked kingsley and rose to take his leave with tellman behind him morose and unsatisfied what do you make of that tellman demanded as soon as they were out on the footpath in the sun what makes a man like that go to a a he shook his head i dont know how she did it but its got to be a trick how does anybody with education not see through it in moments if the leaders of our army believe in that sort of of fairy tale education doesnt stop loneliness or grief pitt replied there was still a certain innocence in tellman in spite of the harsh realism of so many of his views it irritated pitt and yet perversely he liked tellman the better for it he was not unwilling to learn we all find our own way of easing those wounds he went on we do what we can if i lost someone and tried that way of comforting myself tellman said thoughtfully glancing down at the pavement and if i found someone had tricked me i cant say i wouldnt lose my head and try to choke them if if someone thought that white stuff was part of a ghost or whatever its supposed to be and they pushed it back into her mouth is that murder or would it be accident pitt smiled in spite of himself if that had happened there were three of them there and at least two of them would have called a doctor or the police if all three of them were party to it then it would be a conspiracy intended or not tellman grunted and kicked at a small stone in front of him sending it into the gutter i suppose were going to see mrs serracold now yes if shes in if not well wait for her i suppose you want to conduct that interview yourself too no but i will her husband is standing for parliament are the irish bombers after him there was a touch of sarcasm in tellmans voice but it was still a question not so far as i know pitt said dryly i should doubt it hes for home rule tellman grunted again and muttered something under his breath pitt did not bother to ask him what it was they had to wait nearly an hour for rose serracold to come in they were left in a deep red morning room with a crystal bowl of pink roses on the table in the center pitt smiled to himself as he saw tellman wince it was an unusual room almost overpowering at first with its lush delicate paintings on the walls and its simple white fireplace but as he was in the room over a space of time he found it increasingly pleasing he looked at the scrapbooks set out on the low table they were beautifully made put there to while away the time of callers the first was of botanical specimens and beside each in neat rather eccentric handwriting was a short history of the plant its native habitat when it was introduced into britain and by whom and the meaning of its name fond of his own garden when he had the time pitt found it totally absorbing his imagination was fired by the extraordinary courage of the men who had scaled mountains in india and nepal china and tibet in search of yet one more perfect bloom and lovingly brought them back to england tellman paced the floor he dipped into the other scrapbook of watercolors of various seaside towns in britain very pretty but less interesting to him perhaps if it had included the hamlet in dartmoor where gracie and charlotte were staying it would have been a different matter but pitt had not told him the name of it anyway he let his mind wander trying to picture what they might be doing now as he was standing here in this alien room would gracie be having to work much or would she be free to enjoy herself walk over the hills in the sun in his minds eye he saw her small very straight her hair pulled back from her sharp bright little face gazing at everything with interest she would never have seen such a place before a hundred miles from the narrow city streets in which she had grown up crowded noisy smelling of old cooking drains wood rot smoke he imagined the countryside around the hamlet would be wide open almost like a nakedness of the land come to think of it he had never been in a place like that himself except in dreams and while looking at pictures like this would she even think of him while she was there probably not or not often he was still not certain what she felt about him during the whitechapel affair it had seemed as if at last she had softened they still disagreed about a hundred things important things like justice and society and what it was appropriate for a man or a woman to do all his teaching and his experience said she was wrong but he could not put into words any specific instance of precisely in what way he certainly could not explain it to her she just looked at him with that withering impatient air as if he were an obstreperous child and went on with whatever she was doing cooking or ironing immensely practicalas if women kept the world going while men just argued about it should he write to her while she was away that was a difficult question charlotte had taught her to read but only fairly recently might the necessity of replying be an embarrassment to her worse if there were something she could not read might she show his letter to charlotte the thought made him cringe with embarrassment no definitely he would not write better not to take the risk and perhaps better not to have her address written anywherejust in case he still had the scrapbook open when rose serracold came in at last and both he and pitt stood to attention tellman did not know what kind of a person he had been expecting but not the striking woman who stood in the doorway dressed in lilac and navy stripes with huge sleeves and a tiny waist her ashfair hair was dressed in an unusually straight style swirled around on her head rather than piled in curls her azureblue eyes very pale staring at them both in surprise good morning mrs serracold pitt said after the first moments silence i am sorry to intrude upon you without notice but the tragic circumstances of miss maude lamonts death didnt allow me the time to seek an appointment i realize you must be very busy during the parliamentary election but this will not wait there was a steel in his tone which cut off argument she stood strangely motionless not even turning to notice tellman although she could not have been unaware of him only a few feet from her she stared at pitt it was impossible to tell if she had already known of maude lamonts death when she spoke at last it was very softly indeed and exactly what is it you think i can say that will help mr pitt she was obviously remembering his name from what the butler had told her but with an effort it was not intended as rudeness simply that he was not part of her world you were one of the last people to see her alive mrs serracold pitt replied and you also saw the others who were present at the seance and must know what took place if she wondered how pitt was aware of that she did not say so tellman was curious to see how pitt was going to speak to this woman to draw everything of use from her they had not discussed it and he knew it was because pitt was uncertain himself she was part of his new role in special branch her husband was standing for parliament pitt would not share with tellman exactly what his task was but tellman guessed it was to keep her out of scandal or if that proved to be impossible then to deal with it discreetly and perhaps rapidly he did not envy him solving a murder was simple by comparison she raised elegant eyebrows very slightly i dont know how she died mr pitt or if anyone was responsible or could have acted to prevent it her voice was perfectly level but she was very pale and so still that the mastery of emotion in her could be judged simply by the absence of any sign she dared not allow it to be seen tellman was aware of a very slight air of perfume from her and that were she to move he would hear the rustle of silks as he had when she came in she was a kind of woman who alarmed and disturbed him he was acutely conscious of her presence and he understood nothing of her life at all her feelings or her beliefs someone was responsible pitts voice cut across his thoughts she made no gesture to indicate that they should be seated she was murdered pitt finished she took a very long slow breath and let it out in a barely audible sigh did someone break in she hesitated a second perhaps she forgot to lock the side door to cosmo place the last person to arrive came in that way not through the front door she was not robbed pitt replied no one had broken anything he was watching her intently his eyes never moved from hers and the manner in which she was killed seemed to be peculiarly personal she brushed past him and sank into one of the dark red chairs her skirts billowing around her in a soft swish of silk on silk she was so white tellman thought that she had at last realized the meaning of what pitt had told her did it startle her or was it that she already knew and this was remembrance and the moment of grasping the fact that others knew also specifically the police or could it be that the knowledge that it had been personal betrayed to her who was responsible i dont think i wish to know about it mr pitt she said quickly she seemed to be completely in command of herself again i can tell you only what i observed it appeared to me a perfectly ordinary evening there were no quarrels no ill feeling of any kind that i saw and i believe i would have seen it had it been there in spite of what you say i cant believe it was one of us it was certainly not i now her voice cracked a little i i was most indebted to her skill and i liked her she seemed about to add something then changed her mind and stared at pitt waiting for him to continue he did not wait any longer to be invited but sat down opposite her leaving tellman free to do the same can you describe the evening for me mrs serracold i suppose so i arrived a short while before ten the soldier was already in the room i know nothing about him you understand but he is most concerned about battles all his questions are about africa and war so i assume he is a soldier or was her face registered momentary pity i formed the opinion that he had lost someone he loved and the third person pitt prompted oh she shrugged the grave robber he came last pitt looked startled i beg your pardon she pulled a little face an expression of dislike i call him that in my mind because i think he is a skeptic trying to take from us the belief in a resurrection of the spirit his questions were academic in a cruel way as if he were probing a wound she searched pitts eyes trying to gauge with what exactness he understood if he were capable of grasping at least an idea of what she was describing or if she were laying herself open to unnecessary embarrassment tellman felt a sudden stab of knowledge as if he saw her in an ordinary dress such as his mother or gracie would wear the rustling silks obscured by a clearer sight she needed to believe in maude lamonts powers there was something she was seeking that had driven her there compelled her and now that maude was dead she was lost behind those bright pale eyes there was desperation then she spoke again and shattered the moment he heard her perfect diction and the brittleness of it and they were a world apart once more or perhaps it was my imagination she said with a smile i really hardly saw his face he might have been afraid of the truth mightnt he her lips curved as if it were only the inappropriateness of the situation which kept her from actually laughing he came and went through the garden door perhaps he is a highly important personage who committed a terrible crime and wants to know if the dead will betray him her voice lifted at the fancy theres an idea for you mr pitt she looked at pitt steadily ignoring tellman her face calm vivid almost challenging it had occurred to me mrs serracold pitt replied his own face expressionless but i am interested that it also came to your mind was maude lamont a person who was likely to have used such knowledge her eyelids flickered the muscles in her throat and jaw tightened pitt waited used it her voice was a little rough do you mean some sort of of blackmail there was surprise in her face perhaps a little too much pitt smiled very slightly still polite as if he thought far more than he could say she was murdered mrs serracold she had made at least one desperate and very personal enemy the blood drained out of her skin tellman thought she might even faint he knew with absolute certainty now that she was the one pitt was concerned with it was her presence at the seance which had brought special branch into the case and taken it from the police from him did pitt have some secret reason for believing her guilty tellman looked at him but in spite of all the time they had worked together the passion and the tragedies they had been involved with he could not read pitts emotions now rose moved her position in the chair in the silence of the room even a faint creak of whalebone and taut fabric in her bodice was audible i appreciate that it is terrible mr pitt she said quietly but i cannot think of anything which will help you i was aware that one of the men cared intensely about his son and needed to know something of the manner of his death which occurred in a battle somewhere in africa she swallowed lifting her chin a trifle as if her throat were constricted although her gown was not high the other man i cannot say except that he gave the impression that he had come to mock or disprove i dont know why such people bother her delicate eyebrows rose if you disbelieve why not simply leave it alone and allow those who care to pursue knowledge do so in peace it is surely a decency a compassion one should allow only a complete boor would disturb someone elses religious rites it is an unnecessary intrusion a piece of gratuitous cruelty can you describe what in his manner or his words gave you that impression pitt asked leaning forward a little as much as you can remember please mrs serracold she sat without answering for several moments as if clarifying it in her mind before beginning i have a feeling he was trying to catch her in a trick she said at last he moved his head from side to side always watching just on the edge of his vision as if not to miss anything he would not allow his attention to be directed she smiled but there was never anything i could feel his emotion but i dont know what it was i only looked at him now and then because i was naturally far more concerned with miss lamont what was there to watch pitt asked his face perfectly serious she seemed uncertain how to reply or perhaps whether to trust him her hands she said slowly when the spirits spoke through her she would look quite different sometimes she seemed to change shape her features her hair there was a light in her face her expression dared him to mock there was irony in her as if she would rob his charge of its power by making it first herself yet her body was rigid and her hands on the edge of the chair were whiteknuckled a glowing breath came from her mouth and her voice was utterly unlike her own he felt an odd sensation well up inside him a mixture of fear almost a desire to believe and at the same time an impulse to laugh it was terribly human and vulnerable so transparent and yet so easy to understand what did he ask her as clearly as you can remember he said to describe the afterlife to tell us what there was to see to do how it looked and felt she replied he asked if certain people were there and what they were like now if if his aunt georgina were there or not but i felt as if it were a question intended as a trick i thought perhaps he didnt even have such an aunt and what was the answer she smiled no how did he react that was the odd thing she shrugged i think he was pleased it was after that he asked all the questions as to what it was like what people did especially if there were any kind of penance pitt was puzzled what were the answers there was a flash of humor in her eyes that he was asking things that it was not yet his time to know that is what i would have answered him had i been the spirit you disliked him he asked she was sharp in her observation critical opinionated and yet there was a vitality in her that was extraordinarily attractive and her humor appealed to him frankly yes she looked down at the rich silk of her skirt he was a frightened man but we are all frightened of something if you have any imagination at all or anything you care about she raised her eyes and met his that does not give you a reason or an excuse to mock the needs of others a shadow crossed her eyes as if instantly she had regretted being too candid with him she stood up and in a graceful movement turned away keeping her back half towards pitt and completely towards tellman it obliged them both to stand also unfortunately i cannot tell you who he was or where to find him she said quietly i regret very much now that i ever went there it seemed harmless at the time an exploration of knowledge a little daring i believe passionately in freedom of the mind mr pitt i despise censorship the curtailment of learning for anyone at all her voice had a completely different tone there was no banter in it now no guard i would have absolute freedom of religion built into the law if i could we have to behave in a civilized fashion respect each others safetyand property too i suppose but no one should set bounds to the mind above all to the spirit she swiveled around staring at pitt with color back in her face at last her chin high and her marvelous eyes blazing and was this third man trying to do that mrs serracold pitt asked dont be naive she said tartly we spend half the energy in our lives trying to dictate what other people will think that is mostly what the church is about dont you listen pitt smiled are you trying to destroy my belief in it mrs serracold he enquired innocently the color glowed up her cheeks im sorry he apologized it is just that one persons freedom so easily tramples upon anothers why did you go to miss lamont whom did you wish to contact why is it your business mr pitt she gestured for him to sit down again because she was murdered either while you were there or shortly after you left he answered relaxing back into the chair and seeing tellman do the same her body stiffened i have no idea who was responsible for that she said almost under her breath except that it was not i i have been told that you wanted to contact your mother is that not true who told you she demanded the soldier why should he not you told me he wished to contact his son to learn how he died yes she conceded what was it you wished to learn from your mother nothing she said instantly i simply wanted to speak with her surely that is natural enough tellman did not believe her and he knew by the way pitts hands stayed motionless and stiff on his knees that he did not either but he did not challenge her yes of course it is pitt agreed have you visited other spirit mediums she waited so long that her hesitation was obvious and she gave a slight gesture of capitulation no i admit that mr pitt i didnt trust anyone until i met miss lamont how did you meet her mrs serracold she was recommended to me she said as if surprised that he should ask his interest quickened he hoped it did not show in his face by whom do you imagine it matters she parried will you tell me mrs serracold or do i have to enquire would you yes that would be embarrassing and unnecessary she was angry there were two spots of color high on her smooth cheekbones as far as i can recall it was eleanor mountford i dont remember how she heard of her she was really very famous you knowmiss lamont i mean she had a lot of clients from society pitts voice was expressionless surely you know that she raised her brows slightly i know what her appointment book says he agreed thank you for your time mrs serracold he rose to his feet again mr pitt mr pitt my husband is standing for parliament i i know that he said softly and i am aware of what capital the tory press may make of your visits to miss lamont if they become known she blushed but her face was defiant and she made no immediate answer was mr serracold aware you were seeing miss lamont he asked her look wavered no it was little more than a murmur i went in the evenings he spent at his club they were regular it was quite easy you took a very great risk he pointed out did you go alone of course it is a personal thing she spoke with great difficulty it cost her a very visible effort to ask him mr pitt if you could i shall be discreet for as long as possible he promised but anything you remember may be of help yes of course i wish i could think of something apart from the question of justice i shall miss her good day mr pitt inspector she hesitated only an instant forgetting tellmans name but it was not of importance she did not bother to wait for him to supply it but sailed out of the room leaving the maid to show them out neither pitt nor tellman commented on leaving the serracold house pitt could sense tellmans confusion and it matched his own she was nothing that he could have foreseen in the wife of a man who was running for potentially one of the highest public offices in the country she was eccentric arrogant enough to be offensive and yet there was an honesty about her he admired her views were naive but they were idealistic born of a desire for a tolerance she herself could not achieve above all she was vulnerable because there was something she had wanted from maude lamont so intensely that she had gone to her seances time after time even though she was aware of the potential political cost if it became known and her hair was long and pale silvergold he could not forget the hair on maudes sleeve which might mean anything or nothing find out more about how maude lamont acquires her clients he said to tellman as they lengthened their pace down the footpath what does she charge is it the same for all clients and does it account for her income blackmail tellman said with his disgust unconcealed its pathetic to be taken in by that that nonsense but plenty of people are is it worth paying to keep silent about that depends what shes found out pitt replied stepping off the curb and dodging a pile of horse manure most of us have something wed prefer to keep private it doesnt have to be a crime just an indiscretion or a weakness we fear having exploited no one likes to look a fool tellman stared straight ahead of him anyone who goes to a woman who spits up egg white and says its a message from the spirit world and believes it is a fool he said with a viciousness that sprang from a pity he did not want to feel but ill find out everything about her that i can mostly id like to know how she did it they stepped up onto the pavement at the far side of the street just as a fourwheeled growler passed by within a yard of them mixtures of mechanical trickery sleight of hand and power of suggestion i should think pitt answered stopping at the curb to allow a coach and four to pass by i assume you know it was egg white from the autopsy he said a little caustically tellman grunted and cheesecloth he elaborated she choked on it it was in her throat and lungs poor creature anything else you didnt mention tellman glanced at him with venom no she was a healthy woman of about thirtyseven or eight she died of asphyxia you already saw the bruises thats all there is he grunted and i meant find out the things people dont want known was she clever enough to guess from the bits and pieces people asked like where did greatuncle ernie hide his will or did my father really have an affair with the girl in the house opposite or anything at all i expect with a lot of listening at parties pitt replied watching people asking a few questions exerting a little pressure now and then she could piece together enough to make some very good guesses and peoples own conclusions for what she gave them probably supplied the rest guilt runs from imaginary threats as well as real ones how many times have you seen people betray themselves because they thought we knew when we didnt lots tellman said dodging around a costermongers cart of vegetables but what if she pushed too hard and somebody turned on her thatd be the end of it all for her seems as if it was pitt shot him a sideways glance then whats it to do with special branch tellman demanded anger quick in his voice just because serracolds running for parliament does special branch play party politics is that it no thats not it pitt snapped wounded and angry that tellman should think it a possibility i dont care that muchhe snapped his fingerswho gets in i care that the fight is fair i think most of the ideas ive heard from aubrey serracold are totally daft he hasnt got the faintest idea of reality but if hes beaten i want it done by people who disagree with him not people who think his wife committed a crime if she didnt tellman walked in silence he did not apologize although he opened his mouth and drew in his breath as if to speak a couple of times when they came to the main thoroughfare he said goodbye and strode off in the opposite direction back stiff head high while pitt went to find a hansom to report to victor narraway well narraway demanded leaning back in his chair and staring up at pitt unblinkingly pitt sat down without being asked so far it seems to have been one of her three clients that evening he answered major general roland kingsley mrs serracold or a man whose identity none of them knew except possibly maude lamont herself what do you mean none you mean neither no i dont apparently the maid also didnt know who he was she says she never even saw him he came in and left through the french doors and the door in the garden wall why was the door in the wall left open then anyone could have come or gone the door in the garden wall to cosmo place was locked but not barred pitt explained other clients had keys we dont know who theres no record of it the french doors were selfclosing so theres no way of knowing if anyone left that way after she was dead as to why thats obvioushe didnt wish anyone at all to know he was there why was he there i dont know mrs serracold thinks he was a skeptic trying to prove maude lamont a fraud why academic interest or personal find out pitt i intend to pitt retorted but first id like to know who he is narraway frowned you said roland kingsley is he the same man who wrote that damning piece about serracold yes yes what narraways clear dark eyes bored into pitts theres something more hes afraid pitt said tentatively some pain to do with his sons death find out about it pitt had been going to say that kingsleys personal opinions did not seem as virulent as those he had expressed in his letter to the newspapers but he was not sure enough of it he had nothing but an impression and he did not trust narraway did not know him well enough to venture something so nebulous he was uncomfortable working for a man of whom he knew so little he had no sense of narraways personal beliefs his passions or needs his weaknesses even his background before their first meeting were all shrouded in mystery to him what about mrs serracold narraway went on i dont like serracolds socialism but anything is better than voisey with his foot on the ladder i need answers pitt he sat forward suddenly this is the inner circle we are fighting if you doubt what they can do think back to whitechapel think of the sugar factory remember fetters lying dead on his own library floor think how close they came to winning think of your family pitt was cold i am doing that he said between his teeth it cost him an effort precisely because he was thinking of charlotte and the children and he hated narraway for reminding him of it but if rose serracold murdered maude lamont im not hiding it if we do that then were no better than voisey is and hell know that as well as we do narraways face was dark dont lecture me pitt he spat you are not a constable on the beat blowing his whistle if somebody picks a pocket theres more than a silk handkerchief or a gold watch at stake theres the government of the nation if you want simple answers go back to arresting cutpurses and precisely what did you say was the difference between us and the inner circle sir pitt exaggerated the last word and his voice was sharp and brittle as ice narraways lips tightened and there was anger deep in his face but there was a flash of admiration also i havent asked you to protect rose serracold if shes guilty pitt dont be so damned pompous although it sounds as if you think she might be what did she go to this wretched woman for anyway i dont know yet pitt relaxed into the chair again to contact her mother she admits that and kingsley said that was the reason she gave maude lamont but she hasnt told me why or how it can matter so much shes prepared to deceive her husband and risk his career if some tory journalist wants to make a fool of her and did she contact her mother narraway asked pitt looked at him with a sudden tingle of shock narraways eyes were clear without irony for an instant it was as if he had believed either answer were possible not to her satisfaction pitt replied with certainty she is still searching for something an answer she needs and fears she believed in maude lamonts powers that was a statement yes narraway breathed in and out silently very slowly did she describe what happened apparently maude lamonts appearance changed her face shone and her breath seemed luminous she spoke with a different voice he swallowed she also seemed to rise in the air and her hands to elongate the tension eased out of narraways body hardly conclusive many of them do that vocal tricks oil of phosphorus still i suppose we believe what we want to believe or what we dread to he looked away and some of us feel compelled to find out however much it hurts others leave it forever hanging unknown cant bear to take away the last hope he straightened up sharply dont underestimate voisey pitt he wont let desire for revenge get in the way of his ambition you arent that important to him but he wont ever forget it was you who beat him in whitechapel he wont forget and he certainly wont forgive he will wait for his time and it will be when you cant defend yourself he wont be precipitated but one day hell strike ill watch your back for you as i can but im not infallible i met him in the house of commons three days ago pitt replied shivering inside in spite of himself i know he hasnt forgotten but if i walk in fear then hes won already my family is out of london but i cant stop him i admit if i thought there were any escape i might be tempted to take it but there isnt youre more of a realist than i gave you credit for narraway said and there was a grudging respect in his voice i resented cornwallis for wishing you onto me took you as a favor to him but perhaps it wasnt after all why do you owe cornwallis any favors the words slipped out before he thought about it none of your business pitt narraway said tartly go and find out what the devil that woman was doing and prove it yes sir it was only when he was outside again in the street in the late sunlight and the roar and rattle of traffic that pitt stopped to wonder whether narraway had meant rose serracoldor maude lamont chapter six when emily opened the newspaper the day after the discovery of the murder in southampton row her immediate interest was in the political reports an excellent picture of mr gladstone caught her eye but for the time being she was more concerned with the london constituencies there was less than a week to go before voting would begin she felt a sharp tingle of excitement more than for the previous election because now she had tasted the possibilities of office and her ambition for jack was correspondingly higher he had proved his ability and perhaps more importantly his loyalty this time he might be rewarded with a position of greater importance and so more power to do good he had made an excellent speech yesterday the crowd had been appreciative she scanned the pages looking for a report of it instead she saw aubrey serracolds name and below it an article which began quite well until she was halfway through it she did not read between the lines the sarcasm the veiled suggestion of the foolishness of his ideas and that though wellintentioned they were formed in ignorance a rich man playing at politics indescribably condescending in his ambition to change others to his own idea of what was good for them emily was furious she dropped the paper and stared across the breakfast table at jack have you seen this she demanded jabbing her finger at it no he held out his hand and she picked up the fallen sheets and passed them to him she watched as he read it the frown deepening between his brows will it hurt him she asked when he looked up i am sure it will hurt his feelings but i mean his chances of being elected she added quickly a flicker of amusement lit his eyes for a moment and then gentleness you want him to win dont you for roses sake she had not realized she was so transparent it was uncharacteristic of her she was usually good at revealing only what she wished totally unlike charlotte who could be read by almost anyone yet it was not always satisfying to feel so alone yes i do she agreed i thought it was more or less a certainty its been a liberal seat for decades why should it be different now its only one article emily if you say anything at all theres bound to be someone who disagrees with you you disagree with him she said very seriously jack cant you defend him anyway theyre making him sound far more extreme than he is they would listen to you she saw him hesitate the shadow in his face what is it she demanded have you lost confidence in him or is it rose of course shes eccentric shes always been that way what on earth does it matter do our politicians have to be gray to be any good there was laughter in his face for a moment and then it was gone not gray but toned down a little dont take anything for granted emily dont take it as certain that ill win there are too many issues at stake that could change the way people vote gladstones always on about home rule but i think its the working day thats going to decide it but the tories wouldnt grant that she protested theyre even less likely to than we are tell them so i have but what they say about not granting home rule makes sense at least to the workingman here in london where our docks and warehouses serve the world his face tightened ive heard what voisey is saying and people are listening to him hes very popular just now the queen knighted him for courage and loyalty to the crown nobody knows exactly what he did but apparently it saved the throne from a very serious threat hes half won the audience even before he speaks i thought the queen wasnt very popular she said dubiously remembering some of the ugly remarks she had heard both in society and among more ordinary people victoria had been too long absent from public life still mourning albert although he had been thirty years dead she spent her time in her beloved osbourne on the isle of wight or at balmoral in the scottish highlands people hardly ever saw her there were no state occasions no pomp no excitement or color no sense of unity that only she could have provided we still dont want her taken from us jack pointed out we are just as perverse in general as we are individually he folded his paper and set it on the table rising to his feet but of course ill support serracold he leaned forward and gave her a quick kiss on the brow i dont know when ill be back probably for dinner she watched him to the door then poured herself another cup of tea and opened the newspaper again it was then that she saw the report of maude lamonts death and the fact that the police had no doubt that it was murder the bow street station was mentioned and apparently inspector tellman was in charge he had made no statement but speculation was rife the journalists had invented what they did not know who were her clients who had been there that night who had she claimed to call up from the past and what had they revealed that had ended in murder whose secrets were so hideous they would kill to hide them the whisper of scandal violence and assault was irresistible she read it a second time but there was no need she could remember every word and all the ugly implications and she could remember very clearly rose serracolds saying that she had consulted maude lamont somehow ragged ends were coming loose in what had seemed to be a simple way ahead anxiety gnawed at the back of her mind over rose a sense of vulnerability in her a fear that threatened to escalate and endanger her and aubrey and possibly even jack it was time emily did something she went straight upstairs to the nursery to spend the morning with her small daughter evangeline who as always was full of questions about everything her favorite word was why wheres edward evangeline sat on the floor her face puckered into a frown why isnt he here hes gone for a holiday with daniel and jemima emily answered offering evie her favorite doll why because we promised it to him why there was no challenge in her wide eyes he and daniel are special friends thinking on it now emily was concerned that thomas had been prevented from going with them and at almost the same time his reinstatement to bow street had been unaccountably withdrawn charlotte had suddenly and without explanation been reluctant to take edward whereas before she had been more than willing she had said something halfhearted about thomas not being there and hinted at there being possible unpleasantness but she had not been specific im special friends evie said turning the phrase over in her mind of course you are darling you are my special friend emily assured her shall we draw a picture ill do this part and you can do the house over there evie began enthusiastically grasping the crayon in her left hand emily thought of changing it to the right and decided not to she was concerned over charlotte it was going to be very difficult for her to adapt to having pitt no longer in a senior police position it was not exactly a job to be proud of but it was moderately respectable now he did something she could barely mention and his cases could not be discussed of course the money was another matter altogether and not as good the thing that affected emily the most was the inability to share in any of it herself she had in the past helped charlotte when she was involved in pitts cases the more colorful and dramatic of them where people of the higher social strata were implicated she and charlotte had access to the withdrawing rooms of society that pitt would never have they had almost solved some of the more bizarre and dreadful murders themselves lately that had happened less and less and emily was beginning to realize how she missed not only charlottes company and the challenge and excitement of it but the intrusion into her life of the passions of triumph and despair danger judgment guilt and innocence which had forced her to think more deeply than the comfortable issues of politics which seemed always to do with masses and not individuals theories and laws rather than the lives of men and women of flesh dreams real ability for joy or pain if she were to help charlotte and thomas again it would be a hard reminder of the urgencies of life and the realities it would force her to test her beliefs in a way merely thinking never could she was afraid of it and for that very reason she also was impelled towards it charlotte was away somewhere in dartmoor emily did not have the exact address thomas had been very vague but she would go and see rose serracold herself and learn a great deal more about the death of this spirit medium she had been involved withmaude lamont she dressed in an outdoor costume in the latest fashion from paris it was shell pink with broad diagonal stripes of lavender across the skirt and a white ruff high at the throat the soft colors were unusual and remarkably flattering to her she made all her duty calls to wives of men with whom it was important to maintain a steady close connection she talked about the weather the trivial news exchanging compliments and meaningless chatter all afternoon knowing that the message beneath the words was what mattered then she was free to pursue the questions that had been at the back of her mind since breakfast she finally gave her coachman instructions to go to the serracolds home received by the footman she was shown into the sunfilled conservatory heavy with the smell of wet earth and leaves and falling water she found rose sitting alone staring at the lily pool she too was dressed as if for calling in dramatic olive green and white lace which with her flaxen hair and extraordinarily slender body made her look as if she were some exotic water flower herself but as emily came closer and rose looked up emily saw the tension in rose stretching the silk of her gown until it hung without her usual extravagant elegance emily im so pleased to see you she said with relief spreading across her face i would not have let anyone else in i swear it her expression crumpled into one of bewilderment maude lamont has been killed i suppose you know that it was in the newspapers it happened two days ago i was there at least i was in the house that evening emily ive had the police here this afternoon i dont know how to tell aubrey what am i going to say this was a time for practicality not gentleness if she were to learn anything of value she could not afford to allow rose to dominate the conversation she went straight to the first subject which really mattered did aubrey not know you were seeing a spiritualist rose shook her head fractionally the light gleaming on the polished sheen of her hair why didnt you tell him because he wouldnt have liked it rose said immediately he doesnt believe emily thought about it for a moment there was a lie in it a concealment she was not sure what it was but she was quite certain it had to do with roses reason for going he would find it a little embarrassing rose explained unnecessarily looking down at the floor but with a very slight smile on her lips but you went anyway emily pointed out even now just before the election which means you had a reason for going that was so strong it outweighed aubreys wishes and any damage it might do him or he would think it might are you really so sure of his winning she tried to sound sympathetic and to keep out of her voice the impatience she felt at such naive arrogance roses eyebrows lifted suddenly she was about to answer then the words died on her lips i thought i was she said instead then her voice became urgent do do you think this could make any difference i didnt kill her please heaveni needed her alive emily knew she was intruding but there was no time for delicacy why did you need her rose what could she possibly give you that matters so much right now she was my contact with the other side of course rose said impatiently now i have to find someone else and start all over again there isnt time she bit back the words knowing she had already said too much time before what emily pressed the election is it something to do with the election questions as to why thomas was still here in london crowded into her mind roses expression was closed before aubrey wins his seat and takes up a place in parliament she answered and i have much less privacy she was still lying or at least telling a halftruth but emily could not prove it why was it a political secret or a personal one how could she find out the man who was here from the police what did you tell him she urged about the other two clients who were there that evening of course rose stood up and walked over to the bowl of peonies and delphiniums on the wroughtiron table she poked absentmindedly at the stems rearranging them to no advantage the man from bow street seemed to think one of them had done it she gave a shiver and tried to disguise it with a shrug he was not as i would expect a policeman to be she continued he was very quiet and polite but he made me uncomfortable i would like to think he wouldnt come again but i expect he will unless of course they find very quickly who it was it must be the man who didnt believe i should think it wouldnt be the soldier who wished to speak to his son he cares just as much as i do emily was confused she had no idea what rose was talking about but this was not the time to admit it and if he found something he didnt like she said softly what then rose stopped with a delphinium in her hand still lifted in the air her face pinched eyes miserable then he would be crushed she answered her voice husky he would go away in despair and and try to heal himself i suppose i dont know how what does one do when when you hear the unbearable some people would retaliate emily answered watching roses stiff back the silk twisted as she stood half turned if nothing else at least to make sure no one else heard the unendurable thing her imagination raced in spite of the pity she felt for roses very obvious distress who were the men what reason could they have had for killing the medium what secret had rose stumbled into thats what the policeman suggested rose said after a second emily knew that tellman had been promoted now that pitt was gone from bow street tellman she asked no pitt his name was emily breathed out slowly now a great deal of it made ugly and frightening sense there was no doubt anymore that the murder of the spiritualist was a political matter or pitt would not have been called special branch could surely not have foreseen it could they charlotte had told her little of what his new duties were but emily knew enough of current affairs to be well aware that special branch dealt only with violence anarchy threats to the government and the throne and the ensuing danger to the peace of the nation rose still had her back to emily she had seen nothing now emily was torn between one loyalty and another she had asked jack to support aubrey serracold and he had been reluctant even though he would not admit it now she understood that he was right she had taken it for granted that jack would win his seat again with all the opportunities and the benefits that it afforded maybe she had been hasty in that there were forces she had not appreciated or pitt would not be bothering with one unfortunate crime of passion or fraud in southampton row one obvious thought crossed her mind if rose had unwittingly told this woman of some incident in her past some indiscretion a stupid act that would now look ugly then the possibilities for political blackmail were only too clear and such a woman could incite motive for murder so easily she stared at rose now at the wry eccentric elegance of her the passion in her face so easy to read behind the thin veneer of sophistication she pretended she had everything but there was some wound there raw and easy to see even if its nature was not why did you go to maude lamont emily said bluntly youre going to have to tell pitt one day hell go on looking until he finds out and in the process uncover all sorts of other things you might very much rather were kept discreet roses eyebrows arched really you sound as if you know him he hasnt been investigating you has he it was said mockingly a joke to divert the attention and with an edge of challenge in it sharp enough to make emily respondat least that was what was intended it would be a waste of his time and hardly necessary emily said with a smile hes my brotherinlaw he already knows everything about me that he wishes to it was momentary amusement to watch the shock in roses face the hesitation as she struggled to decide whether emily was making fun of her or not and then a surge of anger when she realized it was true that dashed policeman is some kind of a relative of yours she said with disgust i think in the circumstances you might have mentioned it she made a quick little gesture of dismissal although i suppose if i were related to a policeman i wouldnt tell anyone either not that i would be it was said as an insult and meant as such emily felt the anger rise up inside her hot and harsh she rose to her feet with a retort already formed just as the door opened and aubrey serracold came in his long fair face had its usual air of wry good humor and the slight twist to his mouth as if he would smile were he certain quite when and to whom it was appropriate his pale hair fell a little forward lopsidedly over his brow as always he was immaculately dressed today in a black jacket and faintly striped trousers his cravat perfectly tied his valet probably regarded it as an art form the chill was glaringly apparent in the positions and the stiffness of both women the distance between them and the way they were half turned but good manners directed that he affect not to have noticed emily how nice to see you he said with such natural pleasure it was possible to believe for a moment that he was oblivious of the atmosphere he came towards her touching rose on the arm in a gesture of affection as he passed her you are standing he observed to emily i hope that means you have just arrived not that you are just leaving i am feeling a trifle bruised around the edges like an overripe dessert peach that too many people have picked up and then decided against he smiled ruefully i had no idea how terribly tedious it would be arguing with people who are really not listening to a word you say and have long since decided what you mean and that it is nonsense have you had tea he looked around for signs of a tray or any other evidence of recent refreshment perhaps its too late i think ill have a whiskey he reached for the bell cord to fetch the butler a flash in his eye betrayed that he knew he was talking too much to cover the silence but he went on anyway jack did warn me that most people have already made up their minds what they believe which will be either the same as their fathers before themand grandfathers tooor in a few instances the direct opposite and that argument of any sort is so much wind in the trees i admit i thought he was being cynical he shrugged give him my apologies emily he is a man of infinite sagacity emily forced herself to smile back at him she disagreed with aubrey over a score of things mostly political but she could not help herself from liking him and none of this was his fault his company was sharp immediate and very seldom unkind just experience she answered him he says people vote with their hearts not their heads actually he meant their bellies laughter lit aubreys eyes and then vanished how can we ever improve the world if we think no further than tomorrows dinner he glanced at rose but she remained grimly silent still half turned away from emily as if refusing to acknowledge her presence anymore well if we dont have tomorrows dinner we wont survive into this wonderful future emily pointed out nor our children she added more soberly indeed aubrey said quietly suddenly all levity vanished they were talking about things for which they all cared intensely only rose stood still rigid her inner fear not swept away more justice would bring more food emily aubrey said with passionate gravity but men hunger for vision as well as bread people need to believe in themselves that what they do is better than simply toil in return for enough to survive and barely that for many in her heart emily wanted to agree with him but her brain told her he was dreaming too far ahead it was bright even beautiful it was also impractical she glanced at rose and saw the softness in her eyes the tenderness in her mouth and how very pale she was emily could smell lilies and steam rising from the watered earth and feel the heat of the sunlight on the stone floor but she could sense fear as if it overrode all else knowing how fiercely rose shared aubreys beliefs perhaps was even ahead of them emily wondered what did rose need to know so much that she would now seek another spirit medium even after what had happened to maude lamont and what had happened to maude lamont had she tried political blackmail one time too many one secret too dangerous or was it a domestic tragedy a lover betrayed a jealousy over some mans attention stolen or misdirected had she promised to relay a command from the next world perhaps about money and then reneged on it there were a hundred possibilities it did not have to have anything to do with roseexcept that thomas was there not from bow street but from special branch could the unknown man have been some politician a lover or wished to be perhaps he had conceived a passion for her which she had rejected and in his humiliation he had turned on her and killed her surely pitt would have thought of that wouldnt he she looked across at aubrey now his expression seemed at a glance to be earnest but the ghost of humor always hovered in his eyes as if he could see some enormous comic joke and knew himself a bit player no more or less important than anyone else no matter how intensely he might feel perhaps that was the greatest reason she liked him rose was still half turned away she had been listening to aubrey but the rigidity of her shoulders made it clear she had not forgotten her quarrel with emily she hid it because she would not explain it to him emily gave her light warm social smile and said how nice it was to see them both she wished aubrey success and reaffirmed her support for him and jacks also even though she was less certain of it and then took her leave rose went as far as the hall with her she was polite her voice cheerful her eyes cold on the ride home sitting in her carriage as it fought its way through the crush of hansoms coaches landaus and a dozen other kinds of vehicles emily wondered what she should tell pitt or if she should speak to him at all rose expected her to and that in itself made her angry as if she had deceived already at least in intent it was untrue and unfair and yet she did instinctively think to tell pitt all that might be of use to him all that would explain what had happened as much for roses own sake as anyone elses no it wasnt it was for truth and for jack as she sat and puzzled over the mediums death it was jacks face that was in her mind all the time his presence with her as if he were at her shoulder barely out of sight she liked aubrey she wanted him to win not only for the good he could do but intensely for himself but it was the fear that he would drag jack down which drove her to pursue the truth she had never seriously considered before that jack might lose she had thought only of the opportunities ahead the privileges and the pleasures now she realized with a chill as the carriage lurched forward again and the shouting of irate drivers cut the warm air that if he lost there would be a bitter change to get used to just as harsh as that which charlotte faced now invitations would be different parties immeasurably more tedious how would she go back to the idleness of society after the thrill in the blood of politics the heady dream of power and sharp and very real how could she hide her own humiliation that she no longer had anything worthwhile to do the resolve that jack must win tightened in her she was perfectly aware of her own motives and it made no difference whatever reason did not touch emotion any more than sunlight touches the deepsea currents she must do all that was within her ability to help she needed someone else to talk to charlotte was in dartmoor she did not even know precisely where her mother caroline was on tour with her second husband joshua an actor presently playing the lead in one of mr wildes plays in liverpool but even had they been at home her first choice for confidante would have been lady vespasia cumminggould a greataunt of her first husband who had remained one of her dearest friends therefore she now leaned forward and commanded her coachman to take her to vespasias house even though she had never written or left a card which was a complete break of etiquette but then vespasia had never allowed rules to prevent her from doing what she believed to be right and would almost certainly forgive emily for doing the same emily was fortunate in that vespasia was in and had half an hour since said goodbye to her last visitor my dear emily what a pleasure to see you vespasia said without rising from her seat by the window of the sitting room it was all pale colors and full of sunlight the more especially at this extraordinary hour she added since it must be something of great interest or urgency which brings you do sit down and tell me what it is she waved impassively at the chair opposite her own and then regarded emilys costume with a critical eye she was stiffbacked silverhaired and still had the marvelous eyes and bones which had made her the greatest beauty of her generation she had never followed fashion she had always led it very becoming she gave her approval you have been calling upon someone you wish to impress a woman who takes her clothes very seriously i imagine emily smiled with a sharp sense of pleasure and relief at being in the company of someone she liked without shadow or equivocation yes she agreed rose serracold do you know of her vespasia would not be socially acquainted with rose since there were the best part of two generations a gulf of social status and a considerable degree of wealth even though aubrey was more than comfortable between them emily had no idea whether vespasia would approve of roses political opinions vespasia could be very extreme herself on occasions and had fought like a tigress for the reforms in which she believed but she was also a realist and fiercely practical she could very easily see the socialist ideals as illbased in the realities of human nature and what in mrs serracolds visit brought you here rather than home to change for dinner vespasia asked is she related to aubrey serracold who is standing for lambeth south and according to the newspapers has expressed some rather foolish ideals yes she is his wife emily i am not a dentist to be extracting information from you like teeth im sorry emily said contritely it all seems so absurd now i come to put it into words many things do vespasia observed that does not mean they are not real is it to do with thomas there was a sharp note of concern in her voice and her eyes were shadowed yes and no emily said quietly suddenly it was not ridiculous at all if vespasia were afraid too then the cause of it was real thomas and charlotte were going on holiday to dartmoor but thomass leave was canceled by whom vespasia interrupted emily swallowed with a jolt of pain and embarrassment she realized thomas had not told vespasia of his dismissal from bow street the second time but she would have to know silence was only delaying what was inevitable by special branch she said huskily her voice choked with anger and now fear as well she saw the surprise and then the hardening in vespasias face he was dismissed from bow street again she went on charlotte told me when she came to pick up edward to take him with her to dartmoor pitt had been sent back to special branch and his leave rescinded vespasia nodded so fractionally it was barely visible charles voisey is standing for parliament he is head of the inner circle she did not bother to explain any further she must have seen in emilys face that she understood the enormity of it oh god emily said involuntarily are you sure yes my dear i am perfectly sure and thomas knows it yes that will be why victor narraway has canceled his leave and no doubt ordered him to do all he can to block voiseys path although i doubt he will be able to only once has anyone ever beaten voisey before who was that hope flowed up inside emily making her heart pound in her chest vespasia smiled a friend of mine named mario corena but it cost him his life and he had a little assistance from thomas and myself mario is beyond voiseys reach but voisey will not have forgiven thomas and perhaps not me either i think it would be wise my dear if you did not write to charlotte while she is away is the danger really so emily found her mouth dry her lips stiff not as long as he does not know where she is but she cannot stay in dartmoor forever of course not vespasia agreed but by the time she returns the election will be over and perhaps we will have found a way to tie voiseys hands he wont win will he its a safe liberal seat emily protested why is he fighting for that and not for a tory seat it doesnt make sense you are wrong vespasia said very quietly it is simply sense that we have not yet understood everything voisey does makes sense i dont know how he will defeat the liberal candidate but i believe he will emily was cold in spite of the sun pouring through the windows into the quiet room the liberal candidate is a friend of mine i came because of his wife she was one of the last clients of maude lamont the spirit medium who was murdered in southampton row she was there that night thomas is investigating it and i think i may know something then you must tell him there was no hesitation in vespasias voice no doubt at all but rose is my friend and i learned those things only because she trusted me if i betray a friend what have i left this time vespasia did not answer straightaway emily waited if you have to choose between friends vespasia said at last and both rose and thomas are such then you must choose neither but follow your own conscience you cannot place one set of obligations or loyalties before another with regard to people their closeness to you the depth of their hurt their innocence or their vulnerability or the degree of their trust in you you must do what your own conscience dictates to be right serve your own truth she had not said so but emily had no doubt in her mind that vespasia meant that she should tell thomas all she knew yes she said aloud perhaps i knew that it was just hard to acknowledge it because then i have to do it do you believe rose may have killed this woman i dont know i suppose i do they sat without speaking for several minutes then finally discussed other things jacks campaign mr gladstone and lord salisbury the extraordinary phenomenon of keir hardie and the possibility that one day he might actually succeed in reaching parliament then emily thanked vespasia again kissed her lightly on the cheek and bade her goodbye she reached home and went upstairs to change into a suitable gown for dinner even though she was not going out she was in her own sitting room when jack came in his face was tired and there was a pale film of dust around the bottoms of his trousers as if he had walked outside on the pavements for some distance she stood up to greet him with unaccustomed haste as if he brought news although she did not expect anything but the trivia of the campaign much of which she could gain from the daily papers had she considered it of sufficient importance how is it progressing she asked him searching his eyes which were wide and gray with the remarkable lashes she had always admired she saw in them pleasure at the sight of her a warmth she had long known and held so dear it still startled her but too close beneath it for safety she saw anxiety deeper than before she said quickly whats happened he was reluctant to answer the words did not come readily to him and usually they did so easily that in itself chilled her aubrey she whispered thinking of vespasias warning he might lose mightnt he are you going to care very much he smiled but it was deliberate a gesture to reassure her i like him he said honestly sitting down in the chair opposite her relaxing with his legs out and i think with a little more practicality hed be a fine member anyway we need a few dreamers he gave a slight shrug it would balance out the journeymen who want office only for what it can profit them she knew he was hiding the real hurt it would be if aubrey failed it was jack who had encouraged him in the beginning even opened up much of the pathway for his nomination and supported him after it he had made it seem casual as he did so many things still keeping that instinctive manner of a man who took things lightly who dabbled more than he worked to whom nothing mattered so much as comfort popularity good food and good wine and graciousness around him he had always appreciated beauty and to flirt was as natural to him as drawing breath the finality of marriage to a woman who would never turn the other way or refuse to see what was uncomfortable to her was the hardest decision he had ever made and at times he also knew it was the best emily had been careful never to tell him that she was very adept at seeing only what was prudent she had done it with her first husband george ashworth and when she had thought he had betrayed her not simply physically but with love of the heart it had wounded her more deeply than all her sophistication had led her to expect she had no intention of allowing jack to think he could do the same she knew the strength in him and the hunger for a purpose as consuming as that which drove pitt it was the fear he would not match up to it which made him appear to treat it so lightly she realized now with a startling pain that she would do anything in her power to protect him from failure rose was at the house of the spirit medium the night she was murdered she said guardedly thomas went to question her shes terrified jack his face darkened this time he could not hide the tension tightening inside him he straightened up in the chair the ease gone thomas why thomas hes not in bow street anymore it was not the response she had expected but now that she heard it it was the one she feared the rest the questions the criticism for lack of thought for selfishness would come later emily his voice was harsher afraid she knew something she was not telling him and for once she did not i dont know she said meeting his eyes squarely charlotte wont tell me i have to suppose its political otherwise thomas wouldnt be there jack put his hands up over his face then ran his fingers through his hair blinking slowly emily waited her throat tight rose was hiding something could it hurt aubrey and through aubreyjack she stared at him afraid to prompt he looked paler even more tired it was as if the bloom of youth had gone from him and suddenly she saw how he might look in ten even twenty years time he stood up turning away from her and took a step or two towards the window davenport advised me today to distance myself a little from aubrey for my own good he said very quietly she could hear the silence as if it were tangible the evening light outside was golden on the trees and what did you say she asked she would hate either answer if he had refused then his name would continue to be linked with aubrey serracold and of course rose if aubrey remained as extreme as he seemed at the moment if he said more and more what was idealistic but naive then his opponent would capitalize on it and make him appear an extremist who would at best be useless at worst a danger and jack would be tarred with the same brush dragged down by association ideas and principles he could never be charged with so he could refute them but by which he would be judged just the same and just as fatally and if rose were in any way involved in the mediums death then that would damage them all also never mind what the truth of it was people would remember only that she was part of it yet if jack had agreed to davenports suggestion and already stepped aside to save himself leaving aubrey to fight alone what would she think of that there was a price at which safety cost too much and loyalty was part of it maybe that was even true politically if you abandoned your friends so easily on whom could you count when you needed them yourself and one day you would she looked at his broad shoulders his perfectly tailored coat the back of his head so familiar she knew every curl of his hair the way it grew in the nape of his neck and she realized how little she was certain of what he thought what would he do to save his seat if the temptation arose for a blinding moment she envied charlotte because she had seen pitt face so many decisions that drove him to the end of his selfknowledge his compassion and judgment she knew already what lay beyond the tested because it was the pattern of his nature jack was charming and funny gentle with her and as far as she knew loyal he certainly had an honesty she admired and resolution in a cause but beyond thatwhen faced with real loss what then what did you say to him she repeated i told him i cant abandon anyone without a reason he replied with an edge to his voice i think there may be one but by the time i know it it will be too late he looked back at her why in gods name did she go to a medium now she isnt a fool she must know what interpretation people will put in it he groaned i can imagine the cartoons and knowing aubrey he might well tell her privately that shes irresponsible and hes furious with her but hell not do it in public even by implication no matter what it costs him hell be seen to defend her he turned back to her for that matter why did she go to a medium at all i can understand a public entertainmenthundreds of people gobut a private seance i dont know i asked her and she lost her temper with me she dropped her voice whatever it is its not entertainment jack its not lighthearted i think shes trying to find out something and it terrifies her his eyes widened from a spirit medium has she taken leave of her senses possibly he stood still you mean that i dont know what i mean she said impatiently weve only a few days to go before they begin voting every days newspaper matters theres no time to correct mistakes and win people over again i know he moved back towards her putting an arm around her lightly but she could feel an anger inside him wound up and aching to burst out but with no direction in which to strike after a few more minutes he excused himself and went upstairs to change then returned within half an hour and dinner was served they sat at opposite sides of the table rather than at the ends the light glittered on the cutlery and glass and beyond the long windows the fading sun still glinted gold on the windows of the houses opposite the footman removed the plates and brought the next course will you hate it if i lose jack said suddenly she stopped with her fork in the air she swallowed hard as if there were an obstruction in her throat do you think you might is that what davenport says will happen if you wont abandon aubrey i dont know he said frankly im not sure if im prepared to pay the price in friendship that power costs i resent being placed where i have to choose i resent the hypocrisy of it the cutting and trimming until youve paid so much you hang on to your prize because youve given up everything else in order to get it where is the point at which you say i wont do itill let it all go rather than pay this one thing more he looked at her as if he expected an answer when you have to say something you dont believe she offered he gave a sharp laugh bitteredged and am i going to be honest enough with myself to know when that is am i going to look at what i dont want to see she said nothing what about silence he went on his voice rising his plate forgotten what about compromised abstention judicious blindness passing by on the other side or perhaps pilate washing his hands would be the right image aubrey serracold is not christ emily pointed out my own honor is the point he said sharply what do i have to become to win office and then what to keep it if it werent aubrey would it be someone else or something he looked at her challengingly as if he wanted an answer from her and what if rose did kill this woman she asked and if thomas finds out he said nothing he looked so wretched for an instant she wished she had not spoken but the question beat at her mind echoing all the other things it brought with it how much should she tell thomas and when should she make more effort to find out herself above all how could she protect jack what was the greatest danger loyalty to a damaged cause and the risk to his own seat or disloyalty and an office perhaps bought at the cost of part of himself did he owe it to anyone to go down with him suddenly she was overwhelmingly angry that charlotte was in some country cottage in dartmoor with nothing to do but domestic chores simple physical things no decisions to make and where emily could not ask her opinion and share all this with her but had aubrey any idea of what was really going on she saw his face sharp and clear in her mind with its quizzical innocence the feeling she had that he was so open to pain it was not her job to protect him it was roses and why was she not doing it instead of going on some wild pursuit of voices from the dead what could she possibly need to know that mattered a damn now warn him she said aloud jack was startled about rose doesnt he know i dont know no how can i tell who ever knows what really happens between two people i meant warn him about the political realities tell him you cant support him if he goes too far with his socialism his face tightened i tried to i dont think he believed me he hears what he wants to he was interrupted by the butler coming in discreetly what is it morton jack asked with a frown morton was standing very straight his face grave mr gladstone would like to see you sir he is at the gentlemens club in pall mall i have taken the liberty of sending albert for the carriage i hope i did the right thing that was not really a question morton was an ardent admirer of the grand old man and the thought of not obeying such a summons instantly was inconceivable to him emily saw jack stiffen the muscles in his neck pull taut and the silent intake of breath was this the warning about aubrey from the liberal party leader already or worsewas it an offer of higher office of real power after the election if gladstone won suddenly she knew that was what she was really afraid of she felt sick to realize it gladstone might be going to offer jack the chance to achieve what so far he had only cherished in his mind as a dream but at what price even if that was not what gladstone wanted at all she had still feared that jack could be tempted misled why did she not trust him to see the snare before it closed was it his skill she doubted or his strength to see the prize in his grasp and turn away from it would he rationalize justify wasnt that what politics was all aboutthe art of the possible she had once been the ultimate pragmatist herself why was this any different how had she changed from the brittle ambitious young woman she used to be even as she asked she knew that the answer had to do with the tragedies the weakness and the victims of the spirit she had seen in some of the cases thomas had worked on and on which she and charlotte had helped she had seen ambition bent to evil the blindness of a vision confuse the ends and the means it was not as easy as it had once looked even those who meant only to do good could so easily be beguiled jack kissed her gently and went to the door wishing her goodnight he knew he could not say when he would be back she nodded agreeing not to wait up for him knowing that she would what point was there in trying to sleep while she did not know what gladstone wanted and how jack had answered him she heard his footsteps cross the hall and the front door open and close the footman asked her if she wished to be served the rest of the meal he had to repeat it before she declined apologize to cook for me she said i cannot eat until i know what news there is she wanted to be civil but not explain herself she had long ago learned a little courtesy could be returned tenfold she decided to wait in the withdrawing room she had brought a copy of nada the lily the very latest book by h rider haggard it was lying on the table where she had left it nearly a week ago perhaps if she read it it would absorb her attention and the time would pass less painfully in snatches it did for half an hour she would be caught in the passions and the pain of life in zulu africa then her own fear resurfaced and she rose to her feet and paced up and down her mind darting from one thing to another nothing resolved what was the funny brave rose serracold so determined to know that she pursued the services of a spiritualist even to destruction she was obviously afraid was it for herself or aubrey or someone else why could it not wait until after the election was she so sure aubrey would win that she believed she could not find it after that or would it then be too late it was easier to think of that than to worry about jack and why gladstone had sent for him she sat down and opened the book again and read the same page twice and still knew nothing of the sense of it she must have looked at the clock two dozen times before at last she heard the front door close and jacks familiar footsteps cross the hall she picked up her book so that he should see her lay it aside as he came into the room she smiled up at him would you like morton to fetch you something she asked half stretching her hand towards the bell how was the meeting he hesitated for a moment then he smiled thank you for waiting up she blinked feeling the color warm in her cheeks his smile widened it was the same charm the slight annoyance mixed with laughter that she had loved in him in the beginning even when she had thought him trivial no more than entertaining im not waiting up for you she retorted trying not to let her lips answer the smile and knowing it was in her eyes im waiting to hear what mr gladstone had to say i have a lively interest in politics then i suppose i had better tell you he conceded with a sweep of generosity waving his hand in the air he turned on his heel and strode back to the door then suddenly his body altered not exactly bending but lowering one shoulder a trifle forward as if he were very reluctantly leaning on a stick he peered towards her blinking a little the grand old man was very civil to me he said conversationally mr radley isnt it although he knew perfectly well it was he had sent for me who else would dare come he blinked again and put his hand to his ear as if listening carefully for her reply making the effort to catch every word i shall be happy to assist you mr radley in any way that i can your good efforts have not gone unnoticed in spite of himself there was a touch of pride in his voice a lift that cut across the mimicry of age go on emily said impatiently what did you say i thanked him of course but did you accept dont you dare say you didnt a shadow crossed his eyes and then was gone again of course i accepted even if he doesnt actually help me at all it would be discourteous and very foolish not to allow him to believe he has jack what will he do the surprise was sharp inside her you wont let he cut across her aping gladstone again he straightened his already immaculate shirtfront and narrow bow tie then fixing an imaginary pincenez on his nose he stared at her unblinkingly he held his right hand up in a fist almost closed but as if arthritis prevented him from tightening the swollen joints we must win he said fervently in all my sixty years in public office there has never been more to fight for he coughed cleared his throat and continued even more magnificently let us go forward in the good work we have to hand and let us put our trust not in squires and peers he stopped you are supposed to cheer he told emily sharply how can i continue if you dont play your part properly you are a public meeting behave like one i thought it was only you there she said quickly disappointment leaping inside her although she tried to hide it from him why had she hoped so much it was startling how sharply it mattered after all i was he agreed adjusting the imaginary eyeglasses again and peering at her everyone mr gladstone addresses is a public meeting you are simply a meeting of one jack she said with a slight giggle and not in titles or acres he added pulling his shoulders back then wincing as if the stiffness of joints had caught him again i will go further and say not in men as such but in almighty god who is the god of justice and who has ordained the principles of right of equity and of freedom to be the guides and the masters of our lives he frowned drawing his brows together which means of course that his first priority is home rule for ireland and if we dont grant it immediately we shall all be stricken with the seven deadly plagues of toryismor maybe its socialism she started to laugh in spite of herself the anxiety slipping away like a discarded overcoat now that she was in the warmth he didnt say that he grinned at her well not exactly but he has said it in the past what he actually said was that we must win the election because if we dont get home rule for ireland into law then the bloodshed and the loss will follow us down the ages everything else we want a fair working week in all jobs to prevent at all costs lord salisburys proposed plans for a closer alliance with the court of rome the court of rome she said in confusion the pope he explained mr gladstone is a staunch supporter of the kirk for all that they are rapidly failing more and more to return the favor she was startled she had always visualized gladstone as the epitome of religious rectitude he was known for his evangelism and in his younger years for attempting to reform women of the streets and his wife had given food and assistance to many i thought she began and then tailed off the reasons were not important he is going to win isnt he yes he said gently his body returning into its natural grace people laugh at him sometimes and his political enemies harp on his age how old is he eightythree but he still has the passion and the energy to go around the country campaigning and hes the best speaker in front of a crowd that weve ever had i listened to him a couple of days ago they cheered him to the echo there were people who brought their tiny children carried on their shoulders just so they could tell them one day that they actually saw gladstone almost unconsciously he put his hand up to his eye and there are those who hate him as well a woman in chester threw a piece of gingerbread at him im glad shes not my cook it was so hard it actually injured him it was his better eye too but it hasnt slowed him hes still planning to go up to scotland and campaign for his own seat and help everyone else he can there was admiration in his voice half reluctant but he wont give in on the working week home rule before everything is there any chance of it he gave a little grunt none you didnt argue with him did you jack he glanced away from her no but it will cost us dearly this is an election every man wants to win and neither party the burdens are too great and issues we cant succeed in she was momentarily puzzled you mean theyd rather be in opposition he shrugged the parliament wont last long its all to play for next time and that could be very soon even within the year she caught an edge in his voice something he was not saying he turned away and looked towards the fireplace staring at the painting over the mantel as if seeing through it someone invited me to join the inner circle this evening she froze like settling ice she remembered what vespasia had said and the clashes pitt had had with the invisible force of secrecy the power that had no accountability because no one knew who it was it was they who had cost pitt his job in bow street and sent him almost fugitive into the alleys of whitechapel that he had emerged with a desperately hardwon victory bought with the price of blood had earned their unrelenting enmity you cant she said aloud her voice harsh with fear i know he answered keeping his back to her the lamplight shone on the black cloth of his jacket stretching the weave with the tension in his shoulders why did he not face her why did he not dismiss it with the same anger she felt for a moment she was not even sure if she had said no again but she did not move and the silence in the room was unbroken jack it was almost a whisper of course he turned slowly making himself smile it all comes at a high price doesnt it the power to do anything useful make any real changes the friendship of those you care about and integrity to yourself without the right influence you can play at the edges of politics all your life and not realize until the end and maybe not even then that you havent actually changed a thing because the real power has eluded you it was always in the hands of someone else someone anonymous she said very quietly someone who is not what or who you think they are whose reasons you dont know or understand who may be the reality behind faces you think are innocent you think are your friends she stood up you cant make bargains with the devil im not sure you can make political bargains with anyone he said ruefully putting one hand on her shoulder and running it lightly down her arm so she could feel it through the silk of her gown i think politics is about judgment as to what is possible and what isnt and having the skill to see as far as you can where each road leads well the inner circle road leads to giving up your right to act for yourself she answered power in government is not about acting for yourself he kissed her softly and she stiffened for a moment then pulled away and stared at him its about achieving some real good in making things better for the people who trust you who elected you he went on that is what honor iskeeping your promises acting for those who have not the power to do so themselves not for posturing feeling comfortable or indulging your own conscience she looked down uncertain what to say she did not know how to put her feelings into words even to herself an argument that would make clear the path between helplessness on one hand and compromise on the other no one gained anything without a price how high a price was acceptable how high was necessary emily he said a lift of alarm in his voice it was very slight but the laughter was false now a mask i refused i know she answered shivering uncertain he would refuse next time when the persuasion was stronger the arguments more passionate more tilted the prize greater and she was ashamed that she was afraid had it been pitt she would not have been but then pitt had tasted their power himself and felt the wounds chapter seven charlotte and gracie worked together in the cottage kitchen gracie was cleaning the cooking range after having scrubbed the stone floor charlotte was kneading bread and the butter churn stood on the marbletopped table in the cool of the scullery sunlight streamed through the open door the slight breeze from the moors rising in the distance was sweet and sharp with the aroma of tussock and herbs and the lush grasses of the bogs the children were playing on the apple tree and every so often they shouted with laughter if that boy rips is trousers one more time sliding out o that tree i don know wot youre goin ter tell is mother gracie said exasperatedly referring to edward who was having the time of his life and had torn every piece of clothing he had brought with him charlotte had spent time each evening doing her best to repair them one pair of daniels trousers had been sacrificed to make patches for both boys even jemima had rebelled against the restrictions of skirts and tucked them up as she had scrambled over stone walls and loudly declared that there was no natural or moral law that girls should not have just as much fun as boys they ate bread and cheese and fruit raspberries wild strawberries and plums till they were fortunate not to be sick and fresh sausages from the butcher in the village it would have been perfect if only pitt could have been with them charlotte understood that it was impossible even if not the details of why and although voisey could not know where they were she was aware all the time of listening to make sure she could hear the childrens voices and every ten minutes or so she went to the door and looked out to see them gracie said nothing about it not once did she remark on the fact that they were alone here but charlotte heard her going around the windows and doors at night checking after her that they were locked neither did gracie mention tellmans name but charlotte knew she must be thinking of him after their closeness during the whitechapel affair her silence was in some ways more telling than words perhaps at last her feelings for him were greater than friendship charlotte finished the bread and set it in its tins to rise then went out to the garden to wash her hands under the pump she looked up at the apple tree and saw daniel on the highest branch strong enough to take his weight and jemima clinging to the one immediately below she waited a moment for the stirring of leaves that would tell her where edward was and it did not come edward she called it could only have been minutes edward silence then daniel looked over to her edward she shouted running towards the tree daniel slid down hand over hand scrambling into the fork of the branches and then dropped to the ground jemima started to come down a great deal more carefully hampered by inexperience and the fabric of skirts we can see over the garden wall from up there daniel said reasonably and theres a patch of wild strawberries that way he pointed smiling is he there she demanded her voice high and sharp beyond her control even as she heard it she knew she was being ridiculous and yet she could not help it he had only gone to pick fruit as any child would there was no need even to be worried let alone panic she was allowing imagination to take over her reason is he she repeated only a fraction more calmly i dont know daniel was looking at her anxiously now do you want me to go up again and look yes yes please jemima landed on the grass and straightened up regarding a small tear in her dress with irritation she saw charlotte looking at her and shrugged skirts are stupid sometimes she said in disgust daniel went back up the tree nimbly hand over hand he knew exactly the way to go now no he called from the top he must have found another one maybe better i cant see him charlotte felt her heart lurch and the beating of the blood in her ears was deafening her vision blurred what if voisey had taken revenge on pitt by hurting emilys child or maybe he didnt even know who was who what should she do gracie she yelled gracie wot gracie flung open the back door and came running out fear wide in her eyes wots appened charlotte swallowed trying to steady herself she should not panic and frighten gracie it was stupid and unfair she knew she was doing it and still could not help herself edward has gone gone to pick strawberries she gulped but hes not there anymore her mind raced to find a reasonable excuse for the terror which gracie must see and hear in her im afraid of the bogs out there even the wild animals get caught in them sometimes i gracie did not wait you stay ere wi them she waved at daniel and jemima ill go look for im and without waiting to see if charlotte agreed or not she picked up her skirts and ran with amazing speed across the grass and out of the gate leaving it swinging behind her daniel turned to charlotte his face pale he wouldnt go into a bog mama you showed us what they look like all green and bright he knows that no of course not she agreed staring at the gate should she take daniel and jemima with her and go too or were they safer here she should not leave gracie alone to look for edward what was she thinking of dont separate come on she darted and grasped daniels hand almost pulling him off balance as she started towards the gate jemima come with me well all go and look for edward but stay together we must stay together they were only a hundred yards along the lane the small straightbacked figure of gracie another hundred yards ahead of them when the dogcart came over the rise and with a flood of relief that brought tears to her eyes charlotte saw edward sitting beside the driver balancing precariously and grinning with satisfaction now she was so furious with him for the fear she had felt that she would happily have spanked him until he had to eat supper off the mantelpieceand breakfast too but it would be totally unfair he had not meant harm looking at his pleasure she forced back her emotions called out to gracie then picked her way over the ruts in the track to speak to the driver who had pulled up in seeing them gracie came back and for a moment her eyes met charlottes and she blinked hard to mask the depth of her own relief in that instant charlotte realized just how much they had been hiding from each other trying to protect pretend it was not there and she was filled with gratitude and a startling depth of love for the girl with whom she had so little in common on the surface and so much in reality pitts house in keppel street was exactly as always not an ornament or a book out of place there were even flowers in the vase on the mantel shelf in the parlor and early sunlight poured through the windows onto the kitchen bench and splashed warm across the floor archie and angus lay curled up together in the clothes basket purring gently and yet everything was so different in its emptiness that it seemed more like a painting than a reality the kettle was beginning to boil on the stove but it only served to elaborate the silence there were no footsteps on the stairs no rattle and clatter of gracie in the larder or the scullery no one called out asking where a lost shoe or sock was or a schoolbook there was no answer from charlotte no reminder of the time the ticking of the kitchen clock seemed to echo but pitt was at ease that they were away from london safely anonymous in devon he had told himself that he did not think anyone in the inner circle would revenge themselves on him by hurting his family at voiseys command voisey would not hire someone he did not trust he could not afford the risk to himself and pitts turning of the events in whitechapel had made voisey appear to betray not only his allies and friends but his cause as well it should have divided the circle along lines of personal loyalties and selfinterest but pitt had no way of knowing if it had he could not clear from his mind the look of hatred in voiseys eyes as he had passed him in buckingham palace the moment after the knighthood which he and vespasia had contrived using mario corenas sacrifice it had ended forever voiseys ambitions to be republican president of britain and that same hatred had been there in his eyes again when they had met in the house of commons passion like that did not die pitt could sit here at his own kitchen table with some measure of calmness only because he knew his family was hidden and safe miles away no matter how much he missed the mere knowledge of their presence in the house the loneliness was a small price to pay for that was the murder of maude lamont connected with voiseys bid for a parliamentary seat there were at least two possible connections the fact that rose serracold had been at the seance that night and the fact that roland kingsley who was also there had written to the newspapers so vehemently against aubrey serracold pitt had found nothing in kingsleys previous political views to lead anyone to expect such an opinion now but then elections brought out extreme views the threat of losing exposed some ugly sides of nature just as some were surprisingly brash in victory where one had expected grace even generosity or was the connection the man whose name was concealed by a cartouche and who might have had a far more personal relationship with maude lamont was the connection with voisey even a real one or was it narraways attempt to use any means possible to block his path to power if narraway had been cornwallis pitt would have known every attack he made would be clever but fair cornwallis was a man trained by the rigor of the sea who went into battle with his face forward and fought to the end pitt did not know narraways beliefs the motives which drove him or the experience the triumphs and the losses which had formed his character he did not even know whether narraway would lie to the men under his command in order to make them do whatever would achieve his own ends pitt was moving step by step in the dark for his safety so he was not manipulated to serve a purpose he did not believe in he must learn a great deal more about narraway but for the present he needed to discover why roland kingsley had proclaimed himself so virulently against serracold it was not the opinion he had expressed when pitt had spoken to him had maude lamont been manipulating him with the threat of disclosure of something she had learned from his questions to the dead what made a man of the successful practical nature he seemed to possess go to a spirit medium tragically many people lost sons and daughters most of them found a fortitude based in the love they shared in the past and an inner belief in some religion formal or not that there was a divine power that would reunite them one day they continued with life the best way they could with work the comfort of others they loved perhaps a retreat into great music or literature or the solitude of nature or even exhausting oneself in the care of those less fortunate they did not turn to notions of ouija boards and ectoplasm what was there in his sons death that had driven kingsley so far and if the answer were blackmail was it by maude lamont herself or had she only supplied the information to someone else someone still alive and who would continue to use it such as a member of the inner circleeven charles voisey himself that was what narraway would like it to be and it had nothing to do with whether it was the truth or not perhaps pitt was seeing voisey where he had no part fear itself could be an element of his revenge maybe better even than the actuality of the blow he stood up leaving his dishes on the table where mrs brody would find them and clear them away he went outside he was hot by the time he had walked as far as tottenham court road and stopped on the pavement to hail a hansom he spent the morning with the official military records tracing the career of roland kingsley no doubt narraway would have searched them if he did not already know the facts but pitt wanted to see for himself in case his interpretation of the records was different there was little personal comment he read through it all quickly roland james walford kingsley had joined the army at eighteen like his father and grandfather before him his career spanned over forty years from his early discipline and training his first foreign posting in the sikh wars of the late s the horror of the crimean war of the mids where he had been mentioned several times in dispatches and the immediately following bloodbath of the indian mutiny later he had turned to africa the ashanti campaign of the mids and the zulu war at the end of the decade where he had been decorated for extraordinary valor after that he had returned to england seriously injured and seemingly also wounded in spirit he never again left the country although still honoring all his commitments and retiring in at the age of sixty pitt then looked up kingsleys son seeking his death in those same zulu wars and found it recorded on july during the fiasco crossing the white mfolozi it was the action in which captain lord william beresford had won a victoria cross the highest honor given for supreme gallantry on the field of battle two other men had also been killed and several wounded in a superbly executed zulu ambush but then isandlwana had proved the zulu as warriors of not only courage but exceptional military skill at rorkes drift they had brought out the best in british discipline and honor that action lived in history and fired the imagination of men and boys as they heard the story of how eight officers and a hundred and thirtyone men thirtyfive of whom were sick had withstood the siege of nearly four thousand zulu warriors seventeen british had been killed and eleven victoria crosses awarded pitt stood in the middle of the floor and closed the book holding the records the bare words which made little attempt to describe the burning dusty countryside of another continent and the mengood and bad cowardly and bravewho had gone there out of service or adventure obedience to an inner voice or an outer necessity and lived and died in the conflicts but as he thanked the clerk and walked down the steps and into the clearing air the pavement cloud and sunshine patterned he felt emotion constricting his chest pride and shame and a desperate desire to preserve all that was good in a land and a people he loved the men who had faced the enemy at rorkes drift stood for something far simpler and cleaner than the secrecy of the inner circle and political betrayal for ambitions sake he took a cab as far as narraways office and then paced the floor with mounting anger as he was obliged to wait for him when narraway arrived nearly an hour later he was mildly amused to find pitt glaring at him he closed the door i assume from your expression that you have found something of interest he made it a question for heavens sake pitt sit down and make a proper report is rose serracold guilty of something selfindulgence pitt answered obeying the instruction nothing else so far as i know but i have not stopped looking good narraway said dryly that is what her majesty pays you for i think her majesty like god would be horrified at much of what is done in her name pitt snapped back if she knew about it then before narraway could interrupt he went on actually ive been looking at major general kingsley to see why he went to maude lamont and why his letters to the newspapers condemning serracold are so at odds with the opinions in his ordinary speech have you indeed narraways eyes were very sharp and still and what have you found only his military record pitt replied guardedly and that he lost his son in a skirmish in africa in the same zulu wars in which he himself was highly distinguished it was a bereavement from which he doesnt seem to have recovered it was his only son narraway said only child actually his wife died young pitt searched his face trying to read the mans feelings behind the repeating of simple and terrible facts he saw nothing he was sure of did narraway deal in death so often in other peoples grief that it no longer marked him or could he not afford to feel in case it swayed judgments that had to be made in the interest of all not simply those for whom he cared the closest look at narraways clever lineseamed face told him nothing there was passion there but was it of the heart or only the mind how did he die pitt asked aloud narraway raised his eyebrows in surprise that pitt should want to know he was one of the three who was killed during the reconnaissance at white mfolozi they ran straight into a rather welllaid zulu ambush yes i saw that in the records but why is kingsley pursuing it through a woman like maude lamont pitt asked and why now mfolozi was thirteen years ago anger flashed in narraways eyes then pain if you had lost anyone pitt you would know that the hurt doesnt go away people learn to live with it to hide it most of the time but you never know what is going to wake it again and suddenly for a space it is out of control his voice was very quiet ive seen it many times who knows what it was the sight of a young man whose face reminded him of his son another man who has the grandchildren he doesnt an old tune anything the dead dont go away they just fall silent for a while pitt was aware of something intensely personal in the room these words were not practical they were from the passion of the moment but the shadow in the eyes the set of narraways lips forbade the intrusion of any words that touched them pitt affected not to have noticed is there any connection between kingsley and charles voisey he asked narraways dark eyes widened suddenly for gods sake pitt dont you think id tell you that if i knew you might prefer me to find it for myself narraway jerked forward the muscles of his body locked we havent time for games he said between his teeth i cant afford to give a damn what you think of me if charles voisey gets into parliament therell be no stopping him until he has the power to corrupt the highest office in the land hes still head of the inner circle a shadow crossed his face at least i think he is there is another power there i dont know who it is yet he held up his hand finger and thumb an inch apart he came that close to losing it we did that pitt and he wont forget it but we didnt finish him he will have a new number two and three and i havent the faintest idea who they are it is a disease eating at the bowels of the true government of the land whichever party sits in westminster we cant deal without powerand we cant deal with it its a balancing act if we stay one step ahead keep changing often enough weed out the infection of madness as soon as we recognize it the delusion that you can do anything and get away with it that youre infallible untouchable then we winuntil next time then we start all over again with new players and a new game he threw himself back in the chair suddenly find the connection between kingsley and charles voisey yourself whether it has to do with that womans death or not and be careful pitt you were a detective before for cornwallis a watcher a judge for me youre a player you too will winor lose dont forget that and you pitt asked a little huskily narraway flashed him a sudden smile that lit his face but his eyes were hard as coal oh i intend to win he did not say he would die before letting loose his hold like an animal whose jaws do not unlock even in death he did not need to pitt rose to his feet muttered a few words of acknowledgment and went outside his mind whirling with unanswered questions not about kingsley or charles voisey but about narraway himself he returned home briefly and on the footpath at the end of keppel street heard a voice addressing him afternoon mr pitt he turned around startled it was the postman again smiling holding out a letter for him good afternoon he replied hastily a sudden excitement inside him hope surging that it was from charlotte from mrs pitt is it the postman asked cheerfully somewhere nice is she pitt looked down at the letter in his hand the writing was so like charlottes and yet it was not and the postmark was london no he said unable to keep the disappointment out of his voice shes only been gone a day or two the postman comforted him takes a while from farther off you tell me where shes gone ill tell you ow long itll take for er letter ter get ome pitt drew in his breath to say dartmoor and then looked at the mans smiling face and sharp eyes and felt the coldness well up inside him he forced himself to remain calm and it took such an effort that it was a moment before he could reply the postman waited thank you pitt said then answered with the first place that came to his mind whitby yorkshire the man looked extraordinarily pleased with himself oh that shouldnt be more than two days at the most this time of year maybe only one youll ear soon sir maybe theyre aving too much fun ter get down ter writing good day sir good day pitt swallowed and found his hands shaking as he tore open the letter it was from emily dated the previous afternoon dear thomas rose serracold is a friend of mine and after visiting her yesterday i feel that i know certain things which may be of some meaning to you please call upon me when you have the opportunity emily he folded it up and slipped it back into the envelope it was the middle of the afternoon a time when she would normally be out visiting or receiving calls but there would be no better opportunity and perhaps what she had to say would help he could not afford to decline any chance at all he turned around and walked back towards tottenham court road again half an hour later he was in emilys sitting room and she was telling him with awkward phrases and some selfconsciousness of her quarrel with rose serracold she spoke of her growing conviction that rose was so deeply afraid of something that she was impelled to visit maude lamont in spite of the danger of ridicule and that she had if not deceived him at least omitted to tell aubrey anything about it emilys warning had produced anger in her to the point of endangering their friendship when she finished she stared at him her eyes filled with guilt thank you he said quietly thomas she began no he answered before she could ask any further i dont know whether she killed her or not but i cannot look the other way no matter who gets hurt all i can promise is that i will cause no more pain than i have to and i hope you knew that already yes she nodded her body stiff her face pale of course i did she took a breath as if to say something more then changed her mind and offered him tea which he did not accept he would have liked to accepthe was tired and thirsty hungry also if he thought about itbut there was too much emotion between them too much knowledge for it to be comfortable he thanked her again and took his leave that evening pitt telephoned jacks political offices to find out where he was going to speak and on being informed of the place he set out to join him first to listen feel the political temper of the crowd then maybe to judge from it more accurately what aubrey serracold faced and he admitted he was also increasingly concerned for jack himself it was going to be a far closer election than last time many liberals could lose their seats he arrived as some two or three hundred people were gathering mostly men from the nearby factories but also a good number of women dressed in drab skirts and blouses grained with the sweat and dirt of hard work some were even as young as fourteen or fifteen others with skins so tired and gaunt bodies so shapeless that it was hard to tell how old they were they might have been the sixty that they looked but pitt knew very well it was more likely they were still under forty just exhausted and poorly fed many of them would have borne too many children and the best would have been given to them and to the men there was a low murmur of impatience a couple of catcalls more people drifted in half a dozen left grumbling loudly pitt shifted his weight from one foot to the other he tried to overhear conversations what did these people think what did they want did anything make any difference to the way they voted except to a handful of them jack had been a good constituency member but did they realize that his majority was not large on a wave of liberal success he would have had no cause to worry but this was an election even gladstone did not wholly desire to win he fought it from passion and instinct and because he had always fought but his reasoning mind was not in it there was a sudden flurry of attention and pitt looked up jack had arrived and was walking through the crowd clasping people by the hand men and women alike even one or two of the children then he climbed onto the tail of a cart which had been drawn up to form a makeshift platform for him and began to speak almost immediately he was heckled a semibald man in a brown coat waved his arm and demanded to know how many hours a day he worked there was a roar of laughter and more catcalls well if i dont get returned to the house ill be out of work jack called back at him and the answer will be none now the laughter was directed the other wayhumor not jeering there followed immediately an argument about the working week voices grew harsher and the underlying anger had an ugly edge someone threw a stone but it went yards wide and clattered off the warehouse wall and rolled away looking at jacks face handsome and easynatured as it seemed to be pitt could see he was holding his temper with an effort a few years ago he might not even have tried vote for the tories jack offered with an expansive gesture if you think theyll give it to you there were curses and hoots and whistles of derision none of yers any good a scrawny woman yelled her lips drawn back from broken teeth all yer do is bleed us fer taxes and tie us up in laws no one understands and so it continued for another half hour slowly jacks patience and occasional banter began to win over more of them but pitt could see in the growing tension in his face and the tiredness of his body the effort it cost him an hour later dusty exhausted and hot from the press of the crowd and the stale clinging air of the dockside he climbed down from the cart and pitt caught up with him as he walked towards the open street where he would be able to find a hansom like voisey he had had the tactical sense not to bring his own carriage he turned to pitt with surprise pitt smiled at him an accomplished performance he said sincerely he did not add any facile words about winning as close to jack as he was he could see the exhaustion in his eyes and the grime in the fine lines of his skin it was dusk and the street lamps were glowing they must have passed the lamplighter without noticing him are you here for moral support jack asked dubiously no pitt admitted i need to know more about mrs serracold jack looked at him in surprise have you eaten pitt asked not yet do you think rose could be involved in this wretched murder he stopped turning to face pitt ive known her for a couple of years thomas shes eccentric certainly and has some idealistic beliefs which are highly impractical but thats a very different thing from killing anyone he pushed his hands into his pockets which was uncharacteristic in him he cared too much about the cut of his suits to so misuse them i dont know what on earth possessed her to go to this medium now of all times he winced i can imagine how the press would ridicule it but honestly voiseys making pretty heavy inroads into the liberal position i started off believing aubrey would get in as long as he didnt do anything totally stupid now im afraid voiseys winning is not as impossible as it seemed even a couple of days ago he continued walking looking straight ahead of him they were both dimly aware of supporters out of uniform twenty yards behind rose serracold pitt reminded him her family her mother was a society beauty as far as i know jack replied her father was from a good family i did know who but i forget i think he died quite young but it was illness nothing suspicious if thats what youre thinking pitt was reaching after every possibility a lot of money they crossed the alley and turned left feet echoing on the cobbles i dont think so jack answered no aubrey has the money any connection with voisey pitt asked trying to keep his voice light free from the emotion that surged up in him at even the mention of his name jack glanced at him then away again rose you mean if she has then shes lying at least by implication she wants aubrey to win surely if she knew anything about him at all she would say so and general kingsley jack was puzzled general kingsley you mean the fellow who wrote that harsh piece in the newspaper about aubrey several harsh pieces pitt corrected yes has he any personal enmity against serracold none that aubrey knows of unless hes concealing something as well and id swear he isnt hes actually quite transparent he was pretty shaken by it hes not used to personal attack could rose know him they were halfway along a stretch of narrow pavement outside a warehouse wall the single street lamp lit only a few yards on either side cobbles and a dry gutter jack stopped again his brows drawn together his eyes narrow i presume that is a euphemism for having an affair probably but i mean any kind of knowing pitt said with rising urgency jack i have to find out who killed maude lamont preferably show beyond any doubt at all that it was not rose mocking her for attending seances will be nothing compared with what voisey will see that the newspapers do to her if any secret emerges which suggests she committed murder to hide it they were still under the light pitt saw jack wince and he seemed almost to shrink into himself his shoulders drooped and the color ebbed from his face its a hell of a mess thomas he said wearily the more i know of it the less i understand and i can explain almost nothing at all to people like those he jerked a hand backwards to indicate the crowd near the dockside now out of sight beyond the jutting mass of the warehouse pitt did not ask him to explain he knew he was going to i used to imagine the election rested on some kind of argument jack went on starting to walk again ahead of them the goat and compasses public house was glowing invitingly in the rapidly thickening dusk its all emotion he went on feeling not thought i dont even know if i want us to win as a party i mean of course i want power without it we cant do anything we might as well pack up and leave the field to the opposition he glanced at pitt quickly we were the first country in the world to be industrialized we manufacture millions of pounds worth of goods every year and the money that earns pays most of our population pitt waited for the rest of it after they entered the goat and compasses found a table and jack sank into a chair and requested a large ale pitt fetched his usual cider and returned with both tankards jack drank for several moments before continuing more and more goods all the time if we are to survive then we need to sell all those goods to someone pitt had a sudden perception where jack was reaching the empire he said quietly are we back to home rule again more than that jack replied were on the whole moral subject of should we have an empire at all bit late for that isnt it pitt asked dryly several hundred years as i said it isnt based on thought if we divest ourselves of the empire now who do we sell all our goods to france and germany and the rest of europe not to mention america are all manufacturing now as well he bit his lip the goods are growing more and the markets less its a wonderful ideal to give it all back but if we lose our markets untold numbers of our own people will starve if the countrys economy is ruined therell be no one with the power to help them for all the good intentions in the world a wet glass slipped from someones hand and splintered on the floor they cursed fluently a woman laughed too loudly at a joke jack gave an abrupt angry little gesture and try campaigning by telling people vote for me and ill free you of the empire you are so against of course unfortunately it will cost you your jobs your homes even your town the factories will go out of business because therell be too few customers being courted to buy too many goods the shops will close and the factories and the mills but its a highminded thing to do and must surely be morally right are our manufactured goods not competitive against the rest of the world pitt asked the world doesnt need them jack picked up the second half of his beer theyre making their own can you see anybody voting you in on that he raised his eyebrows his eyes wide or do you think we should tell them we wont and then do it anyway lie to them all in the name of moral righteousness isnt it up to them whether they want to save their souls at that price pitt said nothing jack did not expect an answer its all in the uses and balances of power isnt it he went on softly staring into the distance of the crowded tavern can you pick up the sword without cutting yourself someone must but do you know how to use it any better than the next man dont you believe anything enough to fight for it and what are you worth if you dont he looked at pitt again imagine not caring for anything sufficiently to take a risk for it youd lose even what you had i can imagine what emily thinks of that he stared down at the mug in his hand smiling a trifle twistedly then suddenly he looked up at pitt mind id sooner face emily than charlotte pitt winced a new set of images in his mind racing away one melting into another for an instant he missed charlotte so much it was a physical ache he had sent her away to be safe but he was not stepping forward to fight some noble battle by choice looking at it now with hindsight if he could have evaded voisey perhaps he would have are you thinking of what will happen if you are given office he said suddenly a swift color stained jacks cheeks making a lie impossible not exactly they asked me to join the inner circle of course i wont he spoke a little too quickly his eyes fixed on pitts but it was very clearly pointed out to me if i were not with them then my opponents would be you cant step outside it all pitt felt as if someone had opened the doors onto a winter night who was it that asked you he said softly jack shook his head only a tiny movement i cant tell you it was on the edge of pitts tongue to demand if it had been charles voisey but he remembered at the last moment that jack did not know what had happened in whitechapel and for his own safety it was better it should remain so or was it he looked at jack now sitting at the other side of the table with the beer tankard between his hands his expression still carrying some of the charm and a kind of innocence he had had when they had first met he had been so worldly wise in the manners and rules of society but naive of the truly darker alleys of life the violence of the mind the facile betrayals of country house parties the selfishness of the idle was an uncomplicated thing compared with the evil pitt had seen would knowledge be a greater protection or a greater danger if voisey guessed jack was aware of his position as leader of the inner circle it might mark jack as another he had to destroy and yet if jack did not know was pitt leaving him without shield against the seduction of twisted reason was jack more than just another liberal candidate disarmed was he also another way to wound pitt corruption would be infinitely more satisfying than mere defeat or perhaps it was coincidental and pitt was creating his own demons he pushed his chair back and stood up drinking the last of his cider and setting the glass down come on weve both got a long way to go home and therell be all sorts of traffic on the bridges at this time of night dont forget rose serracold do you think she killed that woman thomas jack climbed to his feet also ignoring the dregs of his ale pitt did not answer until they had pushed their way through the crowd and were outside in the street which was almost completely dark it was she general kingsley or the third person who kept his identity secret pitt replied then it was the third person jack said instantly why would any honest man hide his identity over what is an eccentric pursuit perhaps a trifle absurd even pathetic but quite respectable and far from any kind of crime his voice picked up enthusiasm there was obviously more to it he was probably slipping back after the others left and having an affair with her perhaps she blackmailed him and he killed her to keep her quiet what better way to conceal his visits than in the open going to a seance with other people hes looking for his greatgrandfather or whoever foolish but innocent apparently he wasnt looking for anyone in particular he appeared to be a skeptic better still hes trying to discredit her prove her a fraud that shouldnt be difficult the very fact that he didnt expose her suggests another motive perhaps pitt agreed as they passed under the street lamp again the wind was rising a little blowing up from the river carrying loose sheets of old newspapers drifting over the cobbles and settling again there were beggars in the doorways it was too early to huddle down for the night a street woman already kept an eye hopeful for custom the air was sour in the throat as they walked abreast towards the bridge pitt slept badly the silence in the house was oppressive an emptiness not a peace he woke late with a headache and was sitting at the kitchen table when the doorbell rang he stood up and went in his stocking feet to answer it tellman stood on the step looking cold although the morning was mild and the high clouds were already thinning by midday it would be bright and hot what is it pitt asked stepping back in tacit invitation judging by your face nothing good tellman stepped in frowning his lantern jaw set tight and hard he glanced around as if for a moment he had forgotten that gracie would not be there he looked forlorn as if he too had been abandoned pitt followed him back to the kitchen what is it he repeated as tellman went to the far side of the table and sat down ignoring the kettle and not even looking for cake or biscuits we might have found the man written in the diary as a picture what did you say a cartouche he replied his voice flat struggling to keep all expression out of it leaving pitt to make all his own judgments oh the silence in the room was heavy a dog was barking somewhere in the distance and pitt could hear the slithering sound of a bag of coal being emptied into a cellar chute next door he felt a curious sinking sensation there was a premonition of tragedy in tellmans face as if already a weight of darkness had settled inside him tellman looked up he fits the description he said quietly height age build hair even voice so the informant says i suppose he would or superintendent wetron wouldnt have passed it on to us what makes him think its this man rather than any of a thousand others who also fit the description pitt asked all we have is middle height probably in his sixties neither thin nor fat gray hair there must be thousands of men like that tens of thousands within train distance of southampton row he leaned forward across the table what is the rest tellman why this man tellman did not blink because hes a retired professor apparently who just lost his wife after a long illness all their children died young he has nobody else and hes taken it very hard sort of started behaving oddly wandering around talking to young women trying to recapture the past his dead children i suppose he looked wretched as if he had been caught intruding on someones acute private embarrassment like a voyeur hes got himself talked about a bit where does he live pitt asked unhappily why on earth did wetron think this unfortunate man had anything to do with maude lamonts death is it near southampton row no tellman said quickly teddington pitt thought he had misheard teddington was a village miles up the thames beyond kew beyond even richmond where did you say teddington tellman repeated he could come in on the train quite easily why on earth should he pitt asked incredulously arent spirit mediums common enough why maude lamont shes rather expensive for a retired teacher isnt she thats it tellman was totally miserable hes still noted as a deep thinker and very highly respected writes the definitive textbooks on some things obscure but then it would be to most of us but his own people think the world of him having the means doesnt explain coming all the way into the city to consult a spirit medium whose sessions go on till nearly midnight pitt argued tellman took in a deep breath it might if you were a senior sort of clergyman whose reputation rested on your insight into the christian faith again the pity and contempt struggled in his face if you took to looking for answers from women who spit up eggs and cheesecloth and tell you its ghosts i should think youd be looking to go as far away from home as possible personally id want it to be another country im not surprised he came and went by the garden door and wouldnt even tell miss lamont his name suddenly it was tragically clear to pitt it answered all the anomalies of secrecy evasion and why he was so frightened of anyone guessing his identity that he would not even name those spirits he wanted to find it was tragic yet so fallible and with a little imagination easily understood he was an old man left bereaved of all things he had loved the final blow of his wifes death had been too much for his balance even the strongest have a dark night of the soul somewhere in the long journey of life tellman was watching him waiting for his response ill go to see him pitt said unhappily whats his name and where in teddington does he live udney road just a few hundred yards from the railway station london and south west line that is and his name francis wray tellman replied watching pitts eyes pitt thought of the cartouche with its bent letter inside the circle like a reversed f now he understood more of tellmans unhappiness and why he could not cast it aside much as he would prefer to i see he acknowledged tellman opened his mouth to speak then closed it again there really was nothing to say that they did not both know already what have your men found on the other clients pitt asked after a moment or two nothing very much tellman replied dourly all kinds of people about the only thing they have in common is enough money and time to spend chasing after signs of those already dead some of them are lonely some confused and needing to feel their husband or father still knows whats going on and loves them his voice was getting lower and lower a lot of them are just interested looking for a bit of excitement want to be entertained nobody has a grudge worth doing something about did you learn anything about the other ones who came through the garden door from cosmo place no there was a flicker of resentment in his eyes dont know any way of finding them where would we begin about how much did maude lamont earn for this tellmans eyes were wide about four times as much as i do even with promotion pitt knew exactly what tellman would earn he could imagine the volume of business maude lamont could take if she worked four or five days a week that is still rather less than running that house must have cost her and maintaining a wardrobe like hers blackmail tellman said without hesitation his face tightened to a mask of disgust it isnt enough she dupes them she has to make them pay for silence over their secrets he was not looking for any answer he simply needed to find words for his bitterness there are some people who look to be murdered so hard it makes you wonder how they escaped it before it doesnt make any difference to the fact that we must find out who killed her pitt said quietly the fact of murder cannot go unanswered i wish i could say that justice would always visit every act fairly and apportion punishment or mercy as it was deserved i know it wont it will be mistaken in both directions but allowing private vengeance or escape from anything except threat to life would be the gateway to anarchy i know tellman said curtly angry with pitt for pointing out to him the helplessness he already understood quite clearly as if he could not have found the words so easily to express it anything more from the maid pitt ignored his tone nothing helpful seems a sensible sort of woman on the whole but i think she may know more about those seances and how they were rigged than shes telling us had to she was the only one close all the other staff cook and laundress and gardener all came in by the day and were gone before the private sessions ever began unless she was equally deceived pitt suggested shes a sensible woman tellman argued his voice sharper as he repeated himself she wouldnt be taken in by tricks like pedals and mirrors and oil of phosphorous all that kind of thing most of us have a tendency to believe what we want to pitt replied especially if it matters very much sometimes the need is so great we dont dare disbelieve or it would break our dreams and without them we die sense has little to do with it it is survival tellman stared at him he seemed on the point of arguing again then he changed his mind and remained silent it obviously had not occurred to him that lena forrest might also have doubts and loves people now dead who were woven into the meaning of her life he flushed very faintly at his omission and pitt liked him the better for it pitt stood up slowly ill go and see this mr wray he said teddington i suppose maude lamont was good enough to bring someone all the way from teddington to southampton row tellman did not answer pitt wasted no time thinking about how to approach the reverend francis wray when he should find him it was going to be wretched no matter what he said it was best to do it before apprehension made him clumsier and even more artificial he made his way to the railway station and enquired about the best route to teddington and was told that he would have to change trains but that the next train to begin his journey was due to leave in eleven minutes he purchased a through ticket thanked the man and went to get a newspaper from the vendor at the entrance most of the space was taken up with election issues and the usual virulent cartoons he did notice an advertisement for the upcoming exhibition of costermongers ponies and donkeys to be held at the peoples palace in mileend road in a couple of weeks time on the platform with him were two elderly women and a family obviously on a day out the children were excited hopping up and down and unable to stop chattering he wondered how daniel jemima and edward were enjoying devon if they liked the country or if they found it strange if they missed their usual friends did they miss him or was it all too full of adventure and of course charlotte was with them he had been away from them too often lately first in whitechapel and now this he had hardly spoken to either daniel or jemima in a couple of months not with time to reach towards the more difficult subjects to listen to what was unsaid as well as the surface words when this matter of voisey was over whether they knew who had killed maude lamont or not he must make sure he took a day or two every so often just to spend with them narraway owed him at least that much and he could not live the rest of his life running away from voisey that would be giving him victory without even the effort of a fight he dared not even think too closely of charlotte missing her left an ache in him too big to fill with thought or action even dreams left an ache that hurt too much the train came in in a roar of steam and the clatter of iron wheels on iron rails with flying smuts the smell and heat of power and the moment of parting with her was as sharp as if she had left barely a moment ago he had to force himself into the present to open the carriage door and hold it for two elderly women then follow them up the step and inside and find a seat it was not a long journey forty minutes and he was in teddington as tellman had told him udney road was only a block away from the station and a few minutes walk took him to the neat gate of number four he stared at it in the sun for several moments breathing in the scents of a dozen flowers and the sweet clean odor of hot earth newly watered it was so full of memory so domestic that for an instant it overwhelmed him at a glance the garden looked random almost overgrown but he knew the years of care that had gone into its nurture and upkeep there were no dead heads nothing out of place no weeds it was a blaze of color new with long familiar exotic and indigenous side by side simply staring at it told him much of the man who had planted it was it francis wray himself or an outdoor servant paid for the task if it were the latter whatever he earned his real reward was in his art pitt unfastened the gate and went in closing it behind him and walked up the path a black cat lay stretched on the windowsill in the sun a tortoiseshell strolled through the dappled shade of late crimson snapdragons pitt prayed he was here on a fools errand he knocked on the front door and was admitted by a girl in a maids uniform but who could not have been more than fifteen years old is this the home of mr francis wray pitt enquired yes sir she was obviously concerned because he was someone she did not know perhaps wray was usually visited only by fellow clergymen or members of the local community sir if youd wait there ill go an see if es at ome she stepped back then did not know whether to ask him in leave him on the step or even close the door in case he might have designs on the gleaming horse brasses hanging behind her in the hall may i wait in the garden he asked glancing back at the flowers her face flooded with relief yes sir course yer can e keeps it a real treat dont e she blinked suddenly as tears came to her eyes pitt gathered that wray had thrown himself into its care since his bereavement perhaps it was a physical labor that eased some of the emotion inside flowers were a kind of company that absorbed all your ministrations yet gave back only beauty asking no questions and intruding nowhere he had not long to stand in the sun watching the tortoiseshell cat before wray himself came out of the front door and along the short path he was of average height at least four inches shorter than pitt although in his youth he might have been less so now his shoulders sank his back was a little bent but it was his face that carried the indelible marks of inner pain there were shadows around his eyes deep lines from nose to mouth and more than one razor nick on his papery skin good afternoon sir he said quietly in a voice of remarkable beauty mary ann tells me you wish to see me i am francis wray what may i do for you for a moment pitt even thought of lying what he was about to do could only be painful and grossly intrusive the thought vanished again this man could be cartouche and if nothing more he could supply another recollection not only of the evening but of the other occasions on which he had been at maude lamonts with rose serracold and general kingsley with a lifetime spent in the church surely he was a profound observer of human nature good afternoon mr wray he replied my name is thomas pitt he hated approaching the subject of maude lamonts death but he had no other reason for taking wrays time or intruding into his home but not all the truth was necessary yet i am endeavoring to be of some assistance in a recent tragedy which has occurred in the city a death in most unpleasant circumstances wrays face tightened momentarily but the sympathy in his eyes was unfeigned then you had better come in mr pitt if you have come from london perhaps you have not had luncheon yet im sure mary ann could find enough for both of us if simple fare would suffice for you pitt had no choice but to accept he needed to speak with wray to have gone in but refused the hospitality would have been churlish and hurt the mans feelings for no reason but to ease his own conscience and quite artificially putting distance between them would not make his act any less intrusive or his suspicions less ugly thank you he accepted following wray back up the path and in through the front door hoping he would not be placing more pressure on young mary ann he glanced at the hall as he passed through it towards the study waiting a moment while wray spoke to mary ann other than the horse brasses there was an elaborate brass stick and umbrella stand a carved wooden settle that looked at a glance to be tudor and several very lovely drawings of bare trees mary ann scurried off to the kitchen and wray returned seeing the direction pitt was looking you like them he said gently his voice charged with emotion yes very much pitt answered the beauty of a bare trunk is quite as great as that of a tree in full leaf you can see that for an instant wrays face lit with a smile like a shaft of sunlight on a spring day then it vanished again my late wife did them she had a gift for seeing a thing as it really is and a gift to translate that beauty for others pitt responded then wished he had not he was here to find out if this man had gone to a spirit medium in a bid to recapture something of those he had loved but in contradiction of all that his life and faith had taught him pitt might even have to entertain the idea that wray had murdered the confidence artist who had betrayed that trust thank you wray murmured turning quickly aside to give himself a moments privacy as he led the way to his study a small room with too many books a plaster bust of dante on a plinth a watercolor painting of a young woman with brown hair smiling out shyly at the viewer there was a silver vase of roses of all colors mingled together balanced on the desk rather too near the edge pitt would have liked to read the titles of a score or so of the books to see what they were but he had time to notice only three flavius josephuss histories thomas a kempis and a commentary on saint augustine please sit down and tell me how i can help wray offered i have plenty of time and nothing in the world more useful to do with it he attempted a smile but it was more of warmth than any happiness within him it was no longer possible to evade the issue entirely are you by any chance acquainted with major general roland kingsley pitt began wray thought for a moment i seem to recall the name a tall gentleman returned from military service largely in africa pitt elaborated wray relaxed ah yes of course zulu wars wasnt it served with great distinction as i recall no ive never met him but i have heard him referred to i am very sorry to hear he has had another tragedy he lost his only son i do know that his eyes were bright and seemed almost blind for a moment but he controlled his voice and his attention was set entirely upon what he could do to assist pitt this is not about his bereavement pitt said quickly before thinking as to whether he was contradicting himself or not he was present shortly before someone died someone to whom he had been going in an effort to find solace for his sons death or the manner of it he swallowed watching wrays face a spirit medium had he read of it in the newspapers they were mostly overrun by coverage of the election wray frowned his expression darkening you mean one of those people who claim to be in touch with the spirits of the dead and take money from the vulnerable in order to produce voices and signs he could hardly have more clearly worded his contempt for them did it spring from his religious views or his own betrayal there was real anger in his eyes the gentle courteous man of a few moments ago was temporarily gone perhaps noticing pitts attention he went on it is a very dangerous thing to do mr pitt i would wish no one harm but it is better that such activities cease although i would not have had it by violent means pitt was puzzled dangerous mr wray perhaps i misled you she was killed by entirely human means there was nothing occult about it it was your possible knowledge of the other people who were present that i wanted not of the divine wray sighed you are a man of your time mr pitt science is the idol we worship now and mr darwin not god the begetter of our race but the power of good and evil is still there whatever the mask of the day we set over them you assume that this medium had no powers to touch beyond the grave and you are probably right but that does not mean to say that they do not exist pitt felt a chill in the warmth of the room and knew it was inside himself he had been too quick to like wray he was old charming gentle and generous in manner and he was lonely and he had invited pitt in to luncheon he loved his garden and his cats he also believed in the possibilities of calling up the spirits of the dead and was deeply and profoundly angry with those who attempted to do so pitt must at the very least find out why it was the sin of saul wray continued earnestly as if pitt had spoken his thoughts aloud pitt was completely blank nothing returned from schoolroom memories king saul of the bible wray said with sudden gentleness almost apology he sought the ghost of the prophet samuel through the witch of endor oh it was the intensity in wrays face the fixity of his eyes that held pitt there was an almost uncontrollable emotion in the man pitt was compelled to ask him the next question and did he find him oh yes of course wray replied but it was the beginning of that seed of defiance in his nature the pride against god which in the end was rage and envy and sin unto death his face was intensely earnest a tiny muscle in his temple flickering uncontrollably never underestimate the danger of seeking to know what should not be known mr pitt it carries with it a monstrous evil shun it as you would a plague pit i have no desire whatever to enquire into such things pitt said honestly and then realized with a rush of gratitude and guilt how easy it was to say that when he had no insupportable grief no loneliness that wrapped around him as this man had no real temptation he could not bear even to think of it to believe that the threat in voiseys eyes was anything but emotion the rage at his defeat in whitechapel blind incapable of action i hope that if i lost someone profoundly dear to me i would seek my comfort in the faith of a resurrection according to the promises of god he said to wray embarrassed to find his voice trembling a sudden shivering cold seized hold of him as thoughts of charlotte and his children forced themselves into his mind without him and in a place he had never even seen were they safe he had not heard from them yet was he protecting them the best way and was it good enough what if it wasnt what if voisey did take that way to exact his vengeance it might be crass obvious unrefined and too quick in its execution dangerous for himbut it would also be the most exquisitely painful for pitt and final if they were dead what would there be left of value in life he looked at the elderly broken man in front of him so filled with his loss it seemed to bleed out of him into the air of the room and pitt could feel the ache of it himself in such a situation would he be different was it not foolish and unbelievably arrogant the sign of complacent stupidity to be so sure that he would never turn to mediums tarot cards tea leaves anything at all that would fill the void in which he dwelt alone in a universe crowded with strangers he could touch in no way of the heart at least i hope so he said again but of course i dont know wrays eyes filled with tears which spilled down his cheeks without his blinking do you have family mr pitt yes i have a wife and two children was it compounding the pain to tell him that you are fortunate say to them all that you mean while there is time for you never let a day go by without thanking god for what he has given you pitt struggled to bring his mind back to his reason for being here he should satisfy himself once and for all that wray could not have been the man represented by the cartouche in maude lamonts diary i will try he promised unfortunately i still need to do what i can to understand the death of maude lamont and prevent the wrong person from being blamed for having killed her wray looked at him with incomprehension if it was unlawful surely that is a matter for the police distressing as that is i understand perfectly that you may not wish to have them involved but i am afraid you have no moral choice pitt felt a stab of shame at willfully misleading this man they are already involved mr wray but one of the people present on that last evening is the wife of a man standing for a seat in parliament and a third is someone who wishes to keep his identity a secret and so far has succeeded and you wish to know who he is wray said in a moment of startling clarity even if i knew mr pitt if it were told me as a matter of confidence i could not pass on that secret to you the best i could do would be to counsel him with all my strength to be honest with you but then i would already have counseled him with every argument and plea within my power to have nothing to do with such an evil and dangerous practice as meddling with knowledge of the dead the only righteous knowledge of such things is gained through prayer he shook his head a little why is it you were led to believe that i might be of service to you i do not understand that pitt improvised with a flash of invention you have a name for knowledge on the subject and for your powerful feelings against it i thought you might have some information on the nature of mediums particularly miss lamont which would help she has a very wide reputation wray sighed i am afraid my knowledge such as it is is general and not particular and lately my memory is not as keen as it used to be i forget things and i regret to say i have a tendency to repeat myself i tell the jokes that i like rather too many times people are very kind and i would almost prefer that they were not now i never know if i have already said before what i am saying now or if i havent pitt smiled you have said nothing twice to me i have not told you any jokes wray said sadly nor have we had luncheon yet and no doubt i will show you every flower at least twice a flower is worth looking at at least twice pitt replied a few moments later mary ann came in to tell them somewhat nervously that the meal was ready and they removed to the small dining room where she had obviously gone to some trouble to make it look even more attractive there was a china jug of flowers in the center of the table and a carefully ironed cloth set with blueringed china and old wellpolished silver she served a thick vegetable soup with crusty bread butter and a soft crumbling white country cheese and a homemade pickle that pitt guessed to be rhubarb it all made him realize how much he missed the domestic touches in his own home with charlotte and gracie both away pudding was plum pie with clotted cream he refrained only with the greatest difficulty from actually asking for more wray seemed to be happy to eat in silence perhaps simply to have someone opposite him at the table was sufficient afterwards they rose to go and admire the garden it was only then that pitt saw on the side table a folder advertising the powers of maude lamont in which she offered to bring back to the bereaved the spirits of loved ones departed and to give them the opportunity to say all those precious and important things that untimely death had taken from them wray was ahead of him walking out into the sun dazzling as it was reflected off the blaze of flowers and the clean white of the painted fence almost stumbling on the sill of the french doors pitt went after him chapter eight bishop underhill did not spend a great deal of time in speaking with individual parishioners when he did it was largely on formal occasions weddings confirmations now and then baptisms however it was part of his calling to be available to counsel the clergy within the boundaries of his see and when they had spiritual burdens of any sort it was right that it was to him they came for help and comfort isadora was used to seeing anxious men of all ages from curates overwhelmed by their responsibilities or their ambitions to acquire more to senior clergy who found administration and the care of those in their charge sometimes more than they felt equipped to handle the ones she dreaded most were the bereaved those who had lost a wife or child and came seeking a greater comfort and strength to their faith than their daily rituals could offer them they could give so much support to others and yet their own grief sometimes overwhelmed them today it was the reverend patterson who had lost his daughter in childbirth he sat in the bishops study an elderly man with gaunt body his head bent his face half covered by his hands isadora brought in the tray of tea and set it on the small table she did not speak to either of them but silently filled both cups she knew patterson well enough not to need to ask him if he wished for milk or sugar i thought i would understand patterson said desperately ive been a minister in the church for almost forty years god knows how many people ive comforted in their loss and now all those words ive said so carefully mean nothing to me he peered up at the bishop why why dont i believe them when i say them to myself isadora waited for the bishop to reply that it was shock anger at pain and he must give himself time to heal even expected death is a huge and strange thing and takes courage to face no less by a man dedicated to gods service than by any other faith is not certainty and belief does not take away the hurt the bishop seemed to be floundering for words he drew in his breath and then let it out again in a sigh my dear man we will all experience great trials of faith during our lives i am sure you will rise to this with all your usual fortitude you are a good man rest in the knowledge of that patterson stared up at him the agony in his face as naked as if he were oblivious of isadoras presence if i am a good man why has this happened to me he begged and why do i feel nothing but confusion and pain why can i see no hand of god in it no whisper of the divine anywhere the divine is an infinite mystery the bishop answered staring across pattersons head at the far wall his face intensely troubled his eyes fixed he looked as if he saw no more comfort than patterson did himself it is beyond us to comprehend perhaps we are not meant to anguish contorted pattersons features and it seemed to isadora afraid to move in case she drew attention to herself that he was on the edge of screaming with the sheer frustration that boiled up inside him unanswered by anything he could ever reach towards theres no sense in it all he cried out his voice strangled in his throat one day she was alive so alive her child within her she glowed with the joy of her time coming and then nothing but suffering and death how could it be how its senseless its cruel and wasteful and stupid as if there is no meaning in the universe he drew in a great sob why have i spent my life telling people there is a just and loving god that it all makes a perfect pattern that we will see one day and then when i need to know that myself theres nothing but darkness and silence why his voice grew more demanding angrier why was my whole life a farce tell me the bishop hesitated shifting his weight to the other foot his body awkward tell me patterson shouted my dear man the bishop sputtered my dear man these are dark times we all have them times when it seems the world is monstrous fear covers everything like a descending night and no dawn is is imaginable isadora could not bear it mr patterson of course your sense of loss is terrible she said urgently if you truly love anyone then their death has to hurt but most especially if they are young she moved forward a step ignoring the bishops startled expression but to lose is part of our human experience as god intended it to be the fact that it hurts to the very limit of our ability to bear is the whole point in the end it comes down to one question do you trust god or not if you do then you endure the pain until you can come through to the other side of it if you dont then you had better begin to think exactly what you do believe and exercise yourself to your very soul she lowered her voice very gently i think you will find that your life experience tells you that your faith is there not all the time but most of it and most of it is enough patterson looked up at her in amazement the anguish eased out of him as he began to consider what she had said the bishop turned towards her incredulity slackening his face until it held exactly the same expression he had when he was asleep an uncanny vacancy waiting to be filled by thought really isadora he started then stopped again it was desperately apparent that he was at a loss to know how to deal with her or with patterson but above either was some emotion deep within himself which overpowered even his anger or his embarrassment his usual complacency had vanished the polished certainty in his own power to answer everything which she was so accustomed to and its absence was like a raw wound she turned to patterson people do not die because they are good or bad she said firmly and it is certainly not to punish anyone else that thought is monstrous and would destroy all reality of good or evil there are scores of reasons but many of them are simply mischance the only thing we know to cling to all the time is that god is in control of the greater destiny and we do not need to know what that is indeed we could not understand it if we were told what we need to do is trust him patterson blinked you make it sound as if it were simple mrs underhill perhaps she smiled with a sudden bleakness at the force of the knowledge inside her of her own prayers unanswered the loneliness which at times was almost unbearable but that is not the same thing as saying it is easy that is what should be done i do not say that i can do it any more than you or anyone else you are very wise mrs underhill he looked up at her gravely trying to read in her face what experience it was that had taught her such things she turned away it was too vulnerable to share and if he understood anything at all it would betray reginald completely no woman who was happy in her marriage had such a desolation inside her do drink your tea while it is still hot she advised it doesnt solve problems but it makes us better able to attempt them and without waiting for any response she left the room closing the door softly behind her out in the hall she was overcome with a profound sense of having intruded never in all her married life had she usurped her husbands role in such a way hers was to support sustain to be loyal and discreet she had just violated almost every rule there was she had made him look hopelessly inadequate in front of one of his own juniors no that was unfair he had been inadequate she had not caused that he had dithered when he should have been decisive full of quiet confidence an anchor when patterson was tossed by storms at least temporarily beyond his control why what on earth was wrong with reginald why could he not have stated with passion and certainty that god loved every man woman and child and when understanding failed then trust must take over that is what faith means most of us can cling to our faith or at least seem to cling to it when we have all we want nothing is measured until faith is tested she walked back to the kitchen to speak to the cook about dinner the following day tonight she and the bishop were going to another one of the interminable political receptions still it was only days till the election now and then at least this part of it would be over what lay ahead only variations of the same stretching on into loneliness infinite she was in the sitting room again when she heard patterson leave and knew that within minutes the bishop would be through to face her for her intrusion and she waited wondering what she would say would it be simplest in the long run merely to apologize nothing would justify what she had done she had undermined him by offering the comfort that he should have given she was still waiting a quarter of an hour later when at last he came into the room he looked pale and she expected the explosion of outrage any moment but the apology still stuck in her throat you look exhausted she observed with less sympathy than she knew she ought to feel of which she was truly ashamed she should have cared in fact he sank into a chair as if he felt really quite ill what have you done to your shoulder she tried to make up for her indifference noticing that he winced and rubbed his arm as he shifted position a trifle a touch of rheumatism he replied its most painful he smiled a forced gesture which disappeared almost instantly you must speak to cook she has allowed her standards to slip lately i have never had so much indigestion in my life perhaps a little milk and arrowroot she suggested i cant live on milk and arrowroot for the rest of my days he snapped i need a household that is properly run with a kitchen that serves edible food if you paid attention to your own duties instead of interfering in mine then we would not have the problem you are responsible for my health and you should concern yourself with it not attempting to console someone like poor patterson who is crumbling before the vicissitudes of life death she corrected what his hand jerked up and he glared at her he really was very pale and there was a sheen of sweat on his lip it is death that he is finding impossible to accept she pointed out she was his daughter it must be the most terrible thing to lose a child although heaven knows it happens to enough people she buried the empty ache inside herself because it could never happen to her she had dealt with most of that years ago only now and then did it return unexpectedly and surprise her she was not a child he replied she was twentythree for heavens sake reginald what on earth has her age got to do with it she was finding it more and more difficult to keep her temper anyway it really makes no difference what was the cause of his distress it is our task to try to comfort him or at least offer him the assurance of our support and remind him that in time faith will ease his grief she drew in her breath deeply even if the time in question is beyond this life surely that is one of the main purposes of the church to offer the strength for those losses and afflictions that the world cannot ease he rose suddenly to his feet coughing and putting his hand to his chest it is the churchs task isadora to point the moral pathway so that those who are faithful may reach the he stopped reginald are you ill she asked now prepared to believe that he really was no of course im not ill he said angrily i am simply tired and have indigestion and a spot of rheumatism i wish you would keep the windows either open or closed not this ajar manner which causes so many drafts his voice was sharp and she caught something she thought with amazement was an edge of fear was it because he had so signally failed to help patterson was he afraid of a weakness in himself of being seen to fall short she tried to think back to any other time when she had heard him comfort the bereaved or indeed the dying surely he had been stronger than this the words had come to him fluently quotations from scriptures past sermons the words of other great churchmen his voice was beautiful it was the one physical characteristic that had never failed to please her even now are you sure you are she was not certain what she meant to say was she about to press for an answer she did not want what he demanded turning in the doorway ill why do you ask ive already told you it is indigestion and a touch of stiffness why do you think it is more something worse no of course not she said quickly you are quite right i apologize for making a fuss i shall see that cook is more careful with spices and pastries and goosegoose is very rich we havent had goose in years he said in disgust and went out of the door we had it last week she said to herself at the randolphs it didnt agree with you then isadora prepared for the reception with great care is it something special maam her ladys maid asked with interest and just an edge of curiosity as she wound isadoras hair up to show off the white streak from the brow just to the right of her widows peak it was startling and she did not try to disguise it i am not expecting it to be isadora replied with a touch of selfmockery but i would dearly like something remarkable to happen it promises to be unutterably tedious martha was not quite sure what to say but she caught the idea very well isadora was not the first lady she had worked for who hid a deep restlessness under a mask of good behavior yes maam she said obediently and proceeded to make the hairstyle a little more extreme and really very flattering the bishop made no comment upon isadoras appearance either the dramatic hair or the oceangreen gown with its daringly swathed bodice crossed very low over the bosom and filled in with exquisite white lace the same as that shown where the skirt was slashed so the silk fell to a point at the floor in front and then in wide sweeping folds all around the back he looked at her and then away again as he helped her up into the carriage and bade the coachman be on his way she sat beside him in the dim light and wondered what it would be like to dress for a man who looked at her with pleasure enjoying the color the line of what she wore seeing how it flattered her above all finding her beautiful there is something of loveliness in most women be it no more than a grace of moment a tone of voice but to find someone who delighted in it was like spreading your wings and feeling the sun on your face the fact that he never spoke with intimacy or joy shriveled her up inside so it was an effort to hold her head high to smile to walk as if she believed in herself again she allowed herself to daydream would cornwallis have liked this gown had it been he she was dressing for would he have stood at the bottom of the stairs and watched her come down with amazement in his eyes even a little awe at how beautiful a woman could look at silks and lace and perfume all things with which he was so unfamiliar stop it she must control her imagination she blushed hot at her own thoughts and deliberately turned towards the bishop to say something anything to break the spell but all through the journey he sat uncharacteristically silent as if he were unaware of her beside him usually he would speak about who was to be present at a function and rehearse to her their virtues and their weaknesses and what might be expected of them in terms of their contribution to the welfare of the church in general and his see in particular what do you think we can do to help poor mr patterson she said at last when they were almost at their destination he seems in very great distress nothing he replied without turning the woman is dead isadora there is nothing anyone can do about death it is there inescapable before us and around us whatever we say in the light of day come the night we dont know where we come from and we have no idea where we goif anywhere at all dont condescend to patterson by telling him otherwise if he finds faith he will do it himself you cannot give him yours assuming you have it and are not merely saying what you yourself wish to hear like most people now you had better prepare yourself we are about to arrive the carriage pulled up and they alighted and climbed the steps as the front door opened and they were welcomed as usual they were formally announced once isadora had been excited hearing reginald spoken of as his grace the bishop it had seemed a title with infinite possibilities more worthy than a peerage because it was not inherited but rather bestowed by god now she stared at the sea of noise and color in front of her as she came into the room on his arm it seemed no more than an accolade given by men to someone who had fitted most closely the pattern they desired who had pleased the right people and avoided offending anyone he was not the finest in a bold and courageous way to change lives but merely the least likely to endanger the existing way the known and comfortable he was the ultimate conserver of what was already here good and bad they were introduced and she followed a step behind him acknowledging people with a smile and a polite response she tried to be interested in them mr aubrey serracold she was told by lady warboys he is standing for the south lambeth seat mrs underhill bishop underhill how do you do mr serracold isadora replied dutifully then suddenly found that after all there was something in him that caught her attention he responded to her with a smile and his eyes met hers with a secret amusement as if they were both privy to the same rather absurd joke which honor obliged them to play out in front of this audience the bishop passed on to the next person and she found herself smiling back at aubrey serracold he had a long face and fair hair which flopped forward over one side of his brow she remembered now that she had heard somewhere he was the second son of a marquis or some such and could have used a courtesy title of lord but preferred not to she wondered what his political beliefs were she hoped he had them and was not merely looking for a new pastime to fill his boredom indeed mr serracold she said with interest she did not have to feign and which party are you representing i am not entirely sure that either is willing to take responsibility for me mrs underhill he replied with a slight grimace i have been candid enough to express a few of my own opinions which have not been universally popular in spite of herself she was interested and it must have shown in her face because he immediately elaborated in explanation for a start i have committed the unpardonable sin of preferring the eighthour bill in urgency before home rule for ireland i see no reason why we cannot commit to them both and by so doing be far more likely to win the support of the greater mass of the people and a base of power from which to accomplish other muchneeded reform beginning with yielding up the empire to its natural citizens i am not certain about the empire but the rest sounds eminently reasonable she agreed far too much so to become law you are a cynic he said with mock despair my husband is a bishop she replied ah of course he was prevented from saying more by the need to acknowledge being joined by three further people including serracolds wife whom isadora had not met although she had heard her spoken of with both alarm and admiration how do you do mrs underhill rose returned the introduction with barely feigned interest isadora was not involved with politics nor was she truly fashionable in spite of the oceangreen gown she was a woman of conservative grace and that kind of beauty which does not change rose serracold on the other hand was outrageously avantgarde her gown was a mixture of burgundy satin and guipure lace which in combination with her startlingly fair coloring was all the more dramatic like blood and snow her brilliant aquacolored eyes seemed to survey everyone in the room with something like hunger as if looking for a particular person she did not find mr serracold has been telling me of the reforms he desires to effect isadora said conversationally rose flashed her a dazzling smile i am sure you must have your own knowledge of such needs she responded no doubt in your husbands ministry he becomes painfully aware of the poverty and injustice there is which could be eased with more equitable laws she said it as a challenge daring isadora to claim ignorance and so brand herself a hypocrite in the christianity which through the bishop she professed isadora responded without stopping to measure her words of course it is not the changes i find trouble in imagining but how we can effect them for a law to be any good it must be enforceable and there must be a punishment we are willing and able to inflict if it is broken as it assuredly will be even if only to test us rose was delighted you have actually thought about it her surprise was palpable i apologize for slighting your sincerity she lowered her voice so it was audible only to those closest to them and then went on speaking in spite of the sudden hush as others strained to hear what she was going to say we must talk together mrs underhill she put out an elegant hand longfingered jeweled with rings and drew isadora away from the group in which they had found themselves more or less by chance time is terribly short she went on we must go far beyond the core of the party if we are to do any real good abolishing fees for elementary schooling last year has already had wonderful effects but it is only a beginning we must do much more education for all is the only lasting answer to poverty she drew in her breath and then plunged on we must make a way for women to be able to restrict their families poverty and exhaustion both physical and mental are the unavoidable outcomes of having child after child whom you have not strength to care for nor money to feed and clothe she regarded isadora with candid challenge in her eyes again and i am sorry if that is against your religious convictions but being a bishops wife with a residence provided for you is a far cry from being in one or two rooms with no water and little fire and trying to keep a dozen children clean and fed would an eighthour day help or hurt that isadora asked willing herself not to take offense at things which were after all irrelevant to the real issue roses arched eyebrows rose how could it possibly make it worse every laborer man or woman should be protected against exploitation the anger flared up in her face pink color across her white skin isadora was intending to ask roses opinion rather than express any of her own but was prevented in either by their being joined by a friend of rose who greeted her with affection she was introduced to isadora as mrs swann and in return presented her companion a woman of perhaps forty with the confidence of maturity and still sufficient of the bloom of youth to attract the eye of most men there was a grace in the way she held her dark head and her deportment was that of someone who is quite certain of herself yet interested in others mrs octavia cavendish mrs swann said with a touch of pride isadora realized only just before speaking that the newcomer must be a widow to be so addressed are you interested in politics mrs cavendish she asked since the evening was to that end it was a natural assumption only so far as it changes laws i hope to the benefit of all mrs cavendish replied it takes great wisdom to see ahead what will be the results of our actions sometimes the most nobly inspired paths are disastrous in their unforeseen ends rose opened her remarkable eyes very wide mrs underhill was about to tell us how the eighthour day could be ill she said staring at mrs cavendish i fear perhaps she is a conservative at heart really rose mrs swann cautioned her with a quick glance of apology towards isadora no rose said impatiently it is time we were less mealymouthed and said what we really mean is honesty too much to askindeed to demand have we not the duty to pose questions and challenge the answers rose eccentricity is one thing but you risk going too far mrs swann said with a nervous hiccup she placed a hand on roses arm but it was impatiently shaken off mrs underhill may not dont you rose asked her flashing smile returning briefly before isadora could answer mrs cavendish stepped in it is very hard to be overworked and quite unjust she said smoothly but it is still better than having no work at all that is extortion rose said with a wild anger cutting in her voice mrs cavendish kept her temper admirably if it is done deliberately then of course it is but if an employer is facing falling profits and more intense competition then he cannot afford to increase his costs and if he does then he will lose his business altogether and his employees will lose their places we need to keep an empire now that we have one whether we want it or not she smiled to rid her words of sting but none of their power of conviction politics is what is possible not always what we wish she added i think that is part of the responsibility isadora looked from mrs cavendish to rose and saw the sudden amazement in rose she had encountered someone of equal and opposite conviction and her own power could not override the logic of the argument in spite of herself she was temporarily beaten it was a new experience isadora looked at aubrey serracold and saw the tenderness in his eyes and a kind of sadness a knowledge that precious things can be broken isadora might have felt like that about john cornwallis there was a heart and mind in him a hunger for honor a revulsion from the tawdry that she would have suffered any wound to protect it was of infinite value not just to her but in and of itself there was nothing in reginald underhill which awoke that fierce ache in her that was half pain half joy the moment was broken by the arrival of another man the familiarity of his glance at mrs cavendish making it apparent that he was with her isadora was not surprised that she should have at least one admirer she was a remarkable woman in far more than mere physical beauty there was character intelligence and a clarity of mind in her which was most unusual may i introduce my brother mrs cavendish said quickly sir charles voisey mrs underhill mr and mrs serracold she added the last two with a slight grimace and isadora remembered with a jolt that of course voisey and serracold were contesting the same seat for parliament one of them had to lose she looked at voisey with quickened interest he did not resemble his sister that she could see his coloring was slightly auburn while her skin was clear and her hair dark shining brown his face was long his nose a little crooked as if at some time it had been broken and badly set the only thing they had in common was their agile intelligence and a sense of inner power in him it was so intense she almost expected to feel a heat in the air she murmured something polite and sensible she was acutely aware that aubrey serracold was now hiding his feelings the knowledge that his opponent was a different kind of man that there could be no holds or blows barred in the battle this courteous exchange now was a matter of form and not intended to deceive anyone there was anger in roses stiff elegant body with her long back and slender hips encased in bright taffeta her fingers glittering as she moved her hands the skin of her neck and throat looked almost bluewhite in the light from the chandeliers above them as if peering a little closer one might see the veins there was also fear of something isadora could sense it as if it were a perfume in the air amongst the lavender jasmine and the numerous scents from the bowls of lilies on the tables did it matter to her so much to win or was it something else they were shown in to dinner all in the correct order of precedence as a bishops wife isadora went in early after the most senior of the nobility long before such ordinary men as mere parliamentary candidates the tables were laden with crystal and porcelain ranks of knives forks and spoons gleamed by every setting the ladies took their seats and then the gentlemen the first course was served immediately and the business of the evening continued the conversation the weighing and judging the bright chatter disguising the bargains made the weaknesses tested and when found exploited this was where future alliances were born and future enmities isadora only half listened she had heard most of the arguments before the economics the moral issues the finances the religious difficulties and justifications the political necessities she was startled and her attention was drawn her mind suddenly clear when she heard the bishop mention voiseys name and his tone altered to one of enthusiasm innocence does not protect us from the errors of wellmeaning men whose knowledge of human nature is far less than their desire to do good he said earnestly he did not look at aubrey serracold but isadora saw at least three others around the table who did rose stiffened her hand on her wineglass motionless i have begun to appreciate lately what a complex study it is to govern wisely the bishop went on his face set as if determined to follow his train of thought to the end it is not a job for the amateur gentleman no matter how noble his intent we simply cannot afford the cost of error one unfortunate experiment with the forces of trade and finance the abandonment of laws we have obeyed for centuries and thousands will suffer before we can reverse the moment and regain the balance we have lost he shook his head sagely this is a far deeper issue than ever before in our history for the sake of those we lead and serve we cannot afford to be selfindulgent or sentimental his eyes flickered and he glanced at aubrey and away again that is our duty above all or else we have nothing aubrey serracold looked pale his eyes glittering he didnt bother to argue he realized the folly of it and remained silent his hands clenched on his knife and fork for a moment no one answered then half a dozen people spoke at once apologized and then started again but looking at them one by one isadora could see that what reginald had said had made a mark on them suddenly charm and ideals were less bright less effective a very unselfish vision my lord voisey said turning to look at the bishop if all spiritual leaders had your courage we should know where to turn for our moral leadership the bishop glanced at him his face white his chest rising and falling as if he found breathing unaccountably difficult he has indigestion again isadora thought he has taken too much of the celery soup he should have left it he knows it does not agree with him one would think from his speech it had been laced with wine the evening dragged on promises were made others abandoned shortly after midnight the first guests left the bishop and isadora were among them outside as they stepped up into their carriage and drew away she turned to him what on earth possessed you to speak against mr serracold like that and in front of the poor man if his ideas are extreme no one will accept them into law are you suggesting i should wait until they are presented in parliament before i speak against them he asked with a touch of asperity perhaps you would like me to wait until the commons have passed them and they are before the lords where i can debate the issue i have no doubt the lords temporal will override most of them but i have no such faith in my brother lords spiritual they confuse the ideal with the practical he coughed time is short isadora no one can afford to put off the day of his actions tomorrow may not be given him in which to make amends she was taken aback it was a completely uncharacteristic remark she had never known him so driven to leap to words to committing himself to anything at all without leaving a way to extricate himself if circumstances should change are you feeling quite well reginald she asked then instantly wished she had not she did not want to hear a catalog of what was wrong with the dinner the service other peoples opinions or expressions of them she wished she had bitten her tongue and simply made some unemotional murmur of agreement now it was too late no he said rather loudly his voice rising to a note of distress i do not feel well at all they must have put me in a draft my rheumatism is most powerful and i have severe pain in my chest i think the celery soup was not a wise choice she said trying to sound sympathetic and knowing she was failing she heard the indifference in her own voice i fear it is more serious than that now there was definite panic in him barely concealed if she could have seen him in the darkness inside the carriage she was certain his face would have betrayed a real fear running close to losing control she was glad she could not she did not want to be drawn into his emotions that had happened too many times before indigestion can be very unpleasant she said quietly anyone who makes light of it has never suffered but it does pass and leaves no harm behind but the tiredness of being unable to sleep please dont worry do you think so he asked he did not turn his head towards her but she heard the eagerness in him of course she responded soothingly they rode in silence the rest of the way home but she was acutely aware of his discomfort it sat like a third entity between them she woke in the night to find him sitting on the edge of the bed his face ashen his body bent forward his left arm hanging loose as if he had no power in it she closed her eyes again willing herself to sink back into the dream it had been something to do with wide seas and the gentle rush of water past the hull of a boat she pictured john cornwallis there his face set towards the wind a smile of pleasure on his lips every now and then he would turn to her and meet her eyes perhaps he would say something but probably not the silence between them was one of total peace a joy shared too deeply to need the intrusion of words but her conscience would not allow her to remain with the sea and sky she knew reginald was sitting a few feet from her in pain she opened her eyes again and sat up slowly ill get you a little boiled water she said pushing back the covers and getting out of bed her fine linen nightgown came to the floor and in the summer night she needed no more for warmth or for modesty there would be no servants about at this hour no the cry was almost strangled in his throat dont leave me if you sip the water it will help she said sorry for him in spite of herself he looked wretched his skin pallid and beaded with sweat his body locked in a huddle of pain she knelt down in front of him do you feel sick perhaps something in the meal was not fresh or not well cooked he said nothing staring at the floor it will pass you know she said gently it is fearful for a while but it always goes perhaps in future you should think less of your hostesss feelings and decline all but the simplest dishes some people dont realize how often you are obliged to eat as others guest and it can become excessive after a while he raised dark frightened eyes to hers pleading without words for some kind of help would you like me to send harold for the doctor it was an offer simply for something to say all the doctor would give him would be peppermint water as he had in the past it would be an indignity to send for him for a case of wind no matter how fierce the bishop had always refused before feeling it robbed him of the gravity of his high office how can one look with awe up to a man who cannot control his digestive organs i dont want him he said with desperation then he caught his breath in a sob do you think it is something in the dinner there was a wild note of hope in him as if he were begging her to assure him that it was she realized he was terrified that it was not merely indigestion that after all the years of petty complaints at last he really was ill was it pain he was so deeply frightened of or distress and the embarrassment of vomiting losing control of his bodily functions and having to be cared for cleaned up after suddenly she was truly sorry for him surely that was a secret dread of everyone but especially a man to whom power and selfimportance were everything in his heart he must suspect how desperately fragile was his hold on respect he did not really imagine she loved him not with the passion and tenderness that would bind her to him through such a time duty would hold her but that would almost be worse than the ministration of strangers except to the outside world who would see only a wife at her husbands side where she should be what really passed between them anything or nothing at all would never be known to anyone else he was still staring at her waiting for her to assure him that his fear was unnecessary that it would all go away she could not even had he been a child not a man older than herself she could not have given him that illness was real it could not always be warded off ill do all i can to help she whispered tentatively she reached out her hand and put it over his where it lay gripping his knee she felt the terror in him as if it had flooded through his skin and into hers then like fire she recognized what it was he was afraid of dying he had spent his life preaching the love of god the obedience to commands that permitted no question or explanation the acceptance of affliction on earth with the absolute trust in an eternity of heaven and his own belief in it was only word deep when he faced the abyss of death there was no light no god at the end of it for him he was as alone as a child in the night she heard herself with amazement letting go of her own dreams ill be with you dont worry her grip tightened on his hand and she took hold of his other arm there is nothing to fear it is the path of all mankind only a gateway this is the time for faith you are not alone reginald every living thing is with you this is just one step in eternity youve seen so many people do it well with courage and grace you can too you will he remained sitting on the edge of the bed but gradually his body eased the pain must have subsided because at last he allowed her to help him back into bed and within moments he fell asleep leaving her to get up and go around to her own side and climb in also she was tired but the blessing of oblivion escaped her until it was almost morning he rose as usual he was a little pale but otherwise apparently quite normal he made no reference to the episode he did not actually meet her eyes she was overwhelmingly angry with him it was a meanness of heart not at least to have thanked her acknowledged her even if only by a smile she did not have to have words but he was furious that she had seen his abandonment of dignity his naked fear she understood that but she still despised him for his poverty of spirit he was ill she accepted that now even if he chose to forget it today it was the reality he needed her whether it was affection pity respect or simply duty that held her she was imprisoned with him for as long as it lasted and that might be years she could see it like a road stretching to the horizon across a flat gray plain she would have to paint her own dreams on it but never reach for them perhaps they had never been more than dreams anyway nothing had changed except in her knowledge chapter nine i dont believe it jack radley exploded holding the newspaper up at the breakfast table his face pale his hands shaking what is it emily demanded her first thoughts flying to the murder of maude lamont now just a week ago had thomas found something damning that incriminated rose only now did she realize how much she had been dreading it guilt overwhelmed her what have you seen her voice was sharp with fear aubrey jack said laying the paper down so he could see her hes written to the editor i suppose its in rebuttal of what general kingsley said about him but its very ill thought ill thought you mean carelessly written thats not like aubrey she could recall his beautiful voice not just a matter of diction but his choice of words also what does he say jack drew in a deep breath and bit his lip reluctant to answer as if reading it aloud would give it a greater reality is it so very bad she asked with a chill of anxiety biting deep into her will it matter i think it might well either read it to me or pass it she directed for heavens sake dont tell me its bad and then keep it he looked down at the page and began his voice low and almost expressionless i have in this newspaper recently been accused by major general roland kingsley of being an idealist with little grasp upon reality a man who would discard the glories of our nations past and with it the men who fought and died to protect us and extend the rule of law and liberty to other lands normally i would be content to allow time to prove him mistaken i would trust my friends to know me better and strangers to be honest in their judgment however i am standing for the seat of south lambeth in the present parliamentary election and the date of that does not permit me the luxury of time our past has many glorious events i cannot and would not change but the future is ours to mold as we will let us by all means write great poetry about military disasters like the charge of the light brigade at sebastopol where brave men died uselessly at the command of incompetent generals let us pity the survivors of such desperate actions when they hobble past us in the streets blind or maimed or lie in hospital beds let us lay flowers on their graves but let us also act to see that their sons and grandsons do not fall the same way this we have not only the power but the obligation to change thats not ill thought emily argued as far as i can see it is true a perfectly fair and honorable assessment im not finished yet jack said grimly well what else does he say he looked down at the page again we need an army to fight in time of war should we be threatened by a foreign nation we do not need adventurers who are tarred with the brush of imperialism and believe that as englishmen we have the right to attack and conquer any other land we choose to either because we believe profoundly that our way of life is superior to theirs and they would benefit from our laws and our institutions imposed upon their own by force of arms or because they have land minerals or any other natural resources that we may exploit oh jack emily was appalled theres more of the same he said bitterly he doesnt exactly accuse kingsley of being a selfinterested glory seeker at the expense of the ordinary man but the implication is clear enough why she said with a sinking feeling deepening in her i thought he had more more sense of reality even if that were all true it wont win any friends he needs those who agree will be on his side anyway and those who dont will hate him for it she put her hands up to her face how could he be so naive because kingsley must have rattled him jack replied i think aubreys always hated opportunism the idea that the strongest have the right to take what they want and he sees imperialism that way thats a little narrow isnt it she asked not really as a question she did not defer to jack or anyone else in her beliefs actual knowledge was another thing but this was emotion and the understanding of people i am coming to think more and more that political fighting is only a good understanding of human nature and the sense to keep your mouth closed when speaking would not help tell no lies in which you will be caught and never ever lose your temper or promise something you may be seen not to have given he smiled but there was no pleasure in it at all i wish you had told aubrey that a couple of days ago do you think it will really make a difference she was clinging on to hope that is the times isnt it yes how many of the voters in lambeth south will read it do you suppose i dont know but ill wager you anything you like that charles voisey will he responded she thought for a moment of making the wager and asking for a new parasol if she won then realized how futile it was of course voisey would see itand use it aubrey talks about the military as if the generals were fools jack went on with a note of despair in his voice heaven knows weve had enough of them who were but planning the tactics of battle is harder than you think you can have clever enemies inadequate arms supply lines cut a change in the weather or just plain bad luck when napoleon got a new marshal he didnt ask if he was clever he asked if he was lucky what did wellington ask she returned i dont know he admitted rising to his feet but he wouldnt have had aubrey this is not dishonesty or even bad politics at heart but it is the most appalling tactic against a man like charles voisey emily went with jack to listen to voisey speak to a large crowd in the early afternoon it was in kennington and the park was full of people walking in the hot sun eating ice creams and peppermint sticks and toffee apples drinking lemonade and eager for a little heckling and entertainment to begin with nobody cared greatly what voisey had come to say it was a good way to spend an hour or so and far more interesting than the halfhearted game of cricket a score of boys were playing at the farther end if he wanted their attention he would have to say something to amuse them and if he did not know that now he would soon learn of course only some of the listeners had the right to vote but everyones future was affected so they crowded around the empty bandstand voisey climbed onto with supreme confidence and began to talk to them emily stood in the sun with her hat shading her face looking first at the crowd then at voisey then sideways at jack she was not really listening to the words she knew it was about patriotism and pride it was very subtle but he was praising them in a very general sense making them feel part of the accomplishment of empire although he never gave it that name she watched as they stood a little straighter unconsciously smiling shoulders squared and chins a trifle higher he was making them feel as if they belonged they were part of the victory among the elite she looked at jack and saw the corners of his mouth pinch his face was tight with dislike but there was admiration in him also no matter how reluctant he could not hold it back voisey went on he never mentioned serracolds name serracold might not have existed voisey did not put the choice before them vote for me or for the other candidate vote tory or liberal he just spoke to them as if the decision had already been made they were of one mind because they were of one race one people one shared destiny of course that would not persuade everyone she saw stubbornness in the set of many faces disagreement anger indifference but then he did not need all of them only enough to make a majority along with those who were natural tory voters anyway hes winning isnt he she said quietly searching jacks face and seeing the answer in his expression he was angry helpless frustrated and yet acutely aware that if he spoke to defend aubrey serracold as he wished to he would achieve nothing but demonstrate the loyalty of a friend and he would jeopardize his own seat nothing was as certain as he had imagined it to be only a week ago she watched him as voisey went on and the crowd listened they were with him now but she knew what a fickle thing popularity was give people laughter praise hope of benefit a shared belief and they were yours a breath of fear a perceived insult even boredom and they were lost again what would jack do part of her wanted him to honor friendship say what he could to right the inequity between aubrey and this man who was manipulating the situation with such skill aubreys letter to the editor had played right into voiseys hands why had aubrey been so foolish she felt a sinking weight inside her as the answer came unbidden to her mind because he was idealistic but naive he was a good man with an honest dream but he was no politician yet and circumstances would give him no time to become one there were no rehearsals only reality she looked at jack again and saw the indecision still in him she said nothing she was not yet ready for the answer whatever it was he was right there were some prices that were very high to pay for power and yet without power one could achieve little perhaps nothing battles were costly that was the nature of fighting for any principle any victory at all and if you retreated from the struggle because it hurt then the prize went to someone else someone like voisey and what was the price of that if good men did not take up the sword literal and figurative then the victory would go to whoever would where did the right lie if it were easy to see maybe more people would find it and fewer be beguiled along the way she moved a step closer to jack and linked her arm in his then he turned to her but she did not meet his eyes there was a reception that evening which emily had considered earlier would promise a certain enjoyment it was less formal than a dinner and offered much more opportunity to speak with a greater variety of people of ones choice simply because one was not seated around a table as usual at such events there would be some form of entertainment either a small orchestra with a soloist to sing or possibly a string quartet or an exceptional pianist however she already knew that rose and aubrey serracold would also be there and word of this afternoons speech would have reached at least some of the guests so in a matter of an hour or so all would be aware not only of aubreys extraordinary breach of sense in the newspapers but of the superb response to voiseys speech the evening now promised to be awkward even embarrassing and whatever jack was going to do about it time would not allow him any more latitude in which to make up his mind it was unfair but she was angry with charlotte for not being here to discuss it with there was no one else in whom she could have confided exactly the same feelings the doubts and the questions as always she dressed carefully impressions mattered a great deal and she had long known that a pretty woman can charm a mans attention when a plainer one cannot she had also learned more recently that careful grooming a shade and line of gown that flattered a direct smile with an air of confidence could make others believe one was far more beautiful than was the bare fact accordingly she wore a tightwaisted flaring gown of naturalcolored sheer printed in green a shade which had always become her the effect was so dramatic that even jack in a wretched mood over voisey widened his eyes and was obliged to compliment her thank you she said with satisfaction she was dressed for battle but he was still the conquest which mattered the most they arrived sixty minutes after the hour stated on the invitation which was about as early as was decently acceptable a score of other people arrived either immediately before or after them and for a few moments the hall was a crush of guests all exchanging greetings the ladies divested themselves of capes though the evening was mild they would not be leaving until after midnight when it would be chilly emily saw several social acquaintances and political wives it was wise to befriend and a few she actually liked she knew that jack had his own duties for the evening which he could not afford to ignore this was not an occasion purely for pleasure she set about listening with charm and attention passing the appropriate wellthought compliment exchanging a word or two of gossip which if repeated would not come back to haunt her it was two hours later after the musical entertainment had begunthe soloist was one of the plainest women emily had ever seen but had the effortless soaring voice of a true operatic divathat emily saw rose serracold she must only just have arrived since she was so strikingly dressed no one could possibly have missed her her gown was vermilion and black stripes richly draped over the sleeves and bust in black lace which flattered her extreme slenderness there was a vermilion flower on the skirt to match the ones at bosom and shoulder she was sitting on one of the chairs at the edge of the group her back stiff the light gleaming on her pale hair like the sun on corn silk emily looked for aubrey beside her or beyond and did not see him the singer was so very excellent she commanded the mind and the senses her voice so lovely it would have been vandalism of the ear to speak through her performance but as soon as it was over emily stood up and went to rose there was a small group already gathered around and before anyone stood a little to one side to allow her to join she heard the conversation she knew instantly with a cold sinking in her stomach exactly what they were referring to even though no names had been mentioned he is far cleverer than i thought i admit a woman in gold was saying ruefully i fear we have underestimated him i think you overestimate his morality rose said sharply perhaps that was our error emily opened her mouth to intervene but someone else spoke first of course he must have done something remarkable to have been knighted by the queen i suppose we should have taken that into better account im so sorry my dear perhaps it was the condescension in the voice but it was to rose a goad she could not ignore im sure he did something very special indeed she retorted probably to the tune of several thousand poundsand contrived to do it while there was still a tory prime minister to recommend him emily froze her throat was tight and the room glittered and swam around her the lights in the chandeliers multiplying in her vision as if she were going to faint everyone knew that wealthy men had donated massively to both political parties and been given knighthoods or even peerages for it it was one of the ugliest scandals and yet it was the way both parties funded themselves but to say specifically that anyone had been rewarded in such a way was inexcusable and wildly dangerous unless one was both able and willing to prove it emily knew rose was lashing out in every direction she could because she was afraid aubrey was not going to win after all she wished it for all the good she knew he could do and believed in passionately but also for him because she loved him and it was what he had set his heart on perhaps also she was afraid of the guilt that would consume her for her own part in the loss if it should happen whether the newspapers ever heard of her connection with maude lamont or not or whether they used it she would always know that she had cared more for her own necessity than for aubreys career but the urgency now was to stop her before she made it any worse really my dear that is a very extreme thing to say the woman in gold warned with a frown roses fair eyebrows shot up if the battle to win a place in the government of our country is not extreme then what prize is it we are waiting for before we really say what we mean emilys mind raced for something anything to rescue the situation nothing came to her rose what a marvelous gown it sounded inane forced even to her own ears how idiotic it must sound to the others good evening emily rose replied coolly emily had not forgotten a word of their previous clash all the warmth of friendship was gone and perhaps she was already realizing that jack was not going to defend aubrey if it looked like doing so would jeopardize his own seat and even if it did not cost that price it might well mean any offer of position that gladstone was considering making him would be reconsidered in the light of his unwise friendship aubrey would be marked as an unreliable man like a cannon loose on the deck of a pitching ship if she could not save his seat for this election at least she could save his honor and reputation for the next which by all accounts would not be too far away emily forced a smile to her face which she feared might look as ghastly as it felt how discreet of you not to say what it was he did she heard her voice high and a trifle shrill but certainly drawing the complete attention of the others in the circle but i fear that in so doing you have created the misimpression that it was a donation of money rather than a service of great worth to equal such an amount conservatively she tried to scrape together in her mind the pieces of information charlotte or gracie had let slip of the whitechapel affair and voiseys part in it they had for once been remarkably discreet damnation she widened her smile and stared around at the other women all startled and fascinated to know what else she was going to say rose breathed in sharply emily must be quick before rose spoke and ruined it of course i dont know it all myself she hurried on i know something but please dont ask me it was most certainly an act of great physical courage and violence i cannot say what i should not like to misrepresent anyone perhaps malign them she left that suggestion lingering in the air but it was of great worth to her majesty and to the tory government it is very natural that he should be rewarded for it and quite right she shot a jaggedly warning glance at rose i am sure that is what you meant he is an opportunist rose snapped back a man seeking office for himself not to pass laws that will bring social justice for more people for the poor and ignorant and dispossessed who should be our greatest charge i would have thought a little time listening to what he says with thought rather than simply emotion would have made that abundantly clear it was an accusation and directed at all of them emily began to panic rose seemed bent on selfdestruction and of course that meant taking aubrey with her which would cause endless guilt and pain afterwards could she not see what she was doing all politicians are tempted to say whatever they think will get them elected emily answered a little too loudly and it is so easy to respond to a crowd and to try to please them roses eyes were wild and hard as if she felt emily were deliberately attacking her and it was yet another betrayal of friendship it is not only politicians who have succumbed to the temptation to play to the gallery like a cheap actress she retaliated emily lost her temper indeed your simile escapes me but then apparently you know more about cheap actresses than i do one woman gave a nervous giggle then another several looked acutely uncomfortable the quarrel had reached the pitch where they were no longer happy to be witnessing it and were desperate to find any excuse to withdraw and join some other group one by one they left murmuring unintelligible excuses emily took rose by the arm feeling her resist with rigid body what on earth is the matter with you she hissed are you mad roses face lost the shred of color it had had as if every drop of blood had drained out of her emily clasped roses arm afraid she was going to fall come and sit down she ordered quickly this chair before you faint she dragged her the few yards to the nearest seat and forced her onto it against her will pushing her until her head was forward almost to her knees and shielding her from the rest of the room with her own body she would have liked to fetch her something to drink but she dared not leave her rose remained motionless emily waited no one approached them you cant sit like that forever emily said at last quite gently i cant help you if i dont know what is wrong this calls for sense not tantrums why is aubrey behaving like such a fool is it something to do with you rose jerked up two spots of furious color in her cheeks her eyes brilliant like blue glass aubrey is not a fool she said very quietly but with an intensity of feeling that was almost shocking i know he isnt emily said more gently but he is behaving like one and you are even more so havent you any idea how ugly it looks to attack voisey as you are doing even if everything you say is true and you could prove it which you cant it would still not gain you any votes people dont like having their heroes torn down or their dreams burst they hate the people who deluded them but they hate the ones who made them realize it just as much if they want to believe hes a hero then they will all you look is desperate and spiteful the fact that you may be right has nothing to do with anything thats monstrous rose protested of course it is emily agreed but it is idiotic to play the game by the rules you would like there to be you will lose every time you must play within the rules there are better if you like but never worse rose said nothing emily went back to her first question in the whole miserable affair which she still thought might be at the heart of it why did you go to the spirit medium and dont tell me it was simply to contact your mother for a comforting talk you would never do that at election time or deceive aubrey about it youre tormented with guilt over it and yet you kept on going why rose what do you need to resolve from the past at that price it has nothing to do with you rose said miserably of course it has emily contradicted her its going to affect aubreyin fact it already has and that will affect jack if you expect him to try and help to support aubrey at the election and you do dont you his backing away now would be pretty obvious rose looked for a moment as if she were going to argue her eyes hot and angry then she said nothing after all as if the words were useless even as she thought of them emily pulled another chair closer opposite rose and sat down leaning forward a little her skirts around her was the medium blackmailing you because you went to her she saw rose wince or over whatever it was you found out from your mother she pressed no she wasnt it was not a lie but emily knew it was not entirely the truth either rose stop running away she begged the woman was murdered somebody hated her enough to kill her it wasnt a chance lunatic who wandered in off the street it was someone who was there at the seance that night and you know that she hesitated then plunged on was it you did she threaten you with something so terrible that you stayed behind and rammed that stuff down her throat was it to protect aubrey rose was ashen her eyes almost black no then why something in your family i didnt kill her dear god i wanted her alive i swear why what did she do for you that matters so much she did not believe it but she wished to jolt rose into telling the truth at last did she share the secrets about other people with you was it power rose was appalled there was anguish fury and shame in her face emily how can you think such things of me you are vile am i it was a challenge a demand for the truth nothing i did harmed anyone else she dropped her eyes except aubrey and have you the courage to face it emily refused to give up she could see that rose was shivering and close to the breakdown of her selfcontrol she reached out and took roses hands in hers still shielding them both from the rest of the room all busy talking gossiping flirting making and breaking alliances what did you need to know if my father died insane rose whispered i do wild things sometimes you asked me just now if i were mad am i am i going to end up mad as he was to die alone somewhere in an asylum her voice cracked is aubrey going to have to spend the rest of his life worrying about what im going to do am i going to be an embarrassment to him someone he has to watch and continually apologize for terrified of what awful thing i shall say or do next she gulped he wouldnt have me put away hes not like that not able to save himself by hurting someone else hed wait until i ruined him and i couldnt bear that emily was overwhelmed with a pity that rendered her speechless she wanted to put her arms around rose and hold her so tightly she could force warmth and comfort into her which was impossible and in this crowded room it would have caused even these busy absorbed people to turn and stare anything she offered could only be words they must be the right ones it is fear thats making you behave wildly rose not inherited madness what you have done is no more stupid than the things any of us do at one time or another if you need to know what your father died from there must be ways of finding out from the doctor who attended him then everyone else would know rose said with panic rising in her voice her hands gripping emilys i cant bear that no they dont have to but aubrey ill come with you emily promised well say it is a day out together and well go and ask the doctor who attended him hell not only tell you whether your father was mad or not but if he was whether it is something that happened to him alone because of an accident or a disease or if it is something you might inherit there are lots of different kinds of madness not just one and if the newspapers find out believe me emily learning that i went to a seance will be nothing compared with that then wait until after the election i need to know before if aubrey becomes a member if hes called into some office in the government the foreign office i am she tailed away unable to say the words then it will be terrible emily said for her and if you are not but are driven mad by fear then you will have sacrificed all your chances for good for nothing at all and not knowing wont change it anyway will you rose asked come with me i mean then her face changed and the hope died out of it and it became bleak and full of pain again then i suppose you will go and tell your policeman brotherinlaw it was an accusation born out of despair not a question no emily replied i will not come in with you and i will have no idea what answer you receive from the doctor and it is certainly no business of the police what manner of illness your father died fromunless it caused you to kill maude lamont because she knew i didnt i i never got to asking the spirit of my mother she sank her head into her hands again lost in misery fear and embarrassment the exquisite voice of the singer floated through from the other room again and emily realized they were alone except for a dozen or so men all talking earnestly together in the farther corner near the doors to the hallway come she said firmly a little cold water on your face a hot cup of tea which they are serving in the dining room and we shall rejoin the others let them assume we are planning a garden party or some such but we had better tell the same story a fete to raise money for a charity come slowly rose climbed to her feet straightened her shoulders and obeyed chapter ten pitt and tellman returned to the house in southampton row pitt was increasingly certain that he was being observed each time he came and went in keppel street although he had never actually seen anyone but the postman and the man who sold milk from the cart which usually stood at the corner of the mews leading through to montague place he had received two brief letters from charlotte saying that all was well they were missing him profoundly but other than that having an excellent time there was no return address on either of them he had written to her but made sure that he dropped the letters in boxes far from keppel street where the inquisitive postman would never see them the house in southampton row looked peaceful even idyllic in the hot still summer morning there were errand boys in the street as usual whistling as they carried messages fish and poultry or other small grocery items one of them called out a cheeky compliment to a housemaid shooing a cat up the area steps and she giggled and told him off soundly get on wi yer yer daft aporth flowers indeed violets he shouted after her waving his arm once inside the house it was a different matter the curtains were half drawn as was appropriate for a death but then many people did that anyway simply to protect the rooms from the strong light or to offer a greater privacy the parlor where maude lamont had died was undisturbed lena forrest received them civilly enough although she still looked tired and there was a greater air of strain about her perhaps the reality of maudes death had become apparent to her and in a short while the necessity of finding another position it cannot have been easy to live alone in the house where a woman whom you knew saw every day in the most intimate circumstances had been murdered only a week ago it said a great deal for her fortitude that she had managed to remain in control of herself except that no doubt she had seen death many times before and the fact that she served maude lamont did not in itself mean that she had any personal affection for her she might have been a hard mistress demanding critical or inconsiderate some women thought their maids should be on duty at any hour of the day or night that they might be sent for whether it was really necessary or not good morning miss forrest pitt said courteously good morning sir she replied is there something further i can do for you she included tellman in her glance they were standing in the parlor now uneasily each of them aware of what had happened there if not why pitt had been thinking profoundly about that and had discussed it briefly on the way over please sit down he invited her then he and tellman did also miss forrest pitt began her attention was unwavering since the front door was closed and locked the french doors to the gardenhe glanced at themwere closed but not locked and the only way out from the garden is through the door into cosmo place which was locked but unbarred it is the inevitable conclusion that miss lamont was killed by one of the people in the house during the seance the only alternative is that it was all three in some collusion and that does not seem even remotely likely she nodded silently in agreement there was no surprise in her face presumably she had already realized as much herself she had had a week in which to think of it and it must have crowded almost everything else out of her mind have you had any further thought as to why anyone should wish miss lamont any harm she hesitated doubt in her face it was clear some deep emotion worked within her please miss forrest he urged she was a woman who had opportunity to discover some of the most profound and vulnerable secrets in peoples lives things that they may well have been desperately ashamed of past sins and tragedies too raw to forget he saw the instant compassion in her face as if her imagination reached out to such people and saw the horror of their memories in all their terrible detail perhaps she had served other mistresses with griefs children dead unhappy marriages love affairs that tormented them people did not always realize just how much a ladys maid was privy to and sometimes how much she knew of a womans most intimate life some might like to think of her as a silent confidante others might be appalled that anyone else saw their most private moments and understood too much just as no man was a hero to his valet so no woman was a mystery to her maid yes lena said very quietly there are not many secrets from a good medium and she was very good pitt looked at her trying to read in her face her eyes whether she knew more than the bare words she was offering it would have been difficult for maude lamont to have hidden from her maid any regular accomplice either to fake manifestations or to gain personal information about prospective clients a lover would also have given himself away sooner or later even if only in maudes demeanor was lena forrest keeping such secrets out of loyalty to a dead woman or selfpreservation because if she betrayed them then who would employ her in such a sensitive position in the future and she had to think very carefully about that maude lamont was not here to give her a good reference as to her character or skills lena was coming from a house where a murder had been committed her outlook was if not desperate at the least extremely poor did she have regular callers who were not to do with seances tellman asked were looking for those who gave her the information about people that she told them things they wanted to hear lena looked down as if embarrassed you dont need a lot people give themselves away and she was very good at reading faces understanding the things people dont say she was a terribly quick guesser i cant count the number of times i was thinking something and shed know what it was before i said it weve searched the house for diaries tellman said to pitt we found nothing other than lists of appointments she must have committed everything to memory what did you think of her gifts miss forrest pitt said suddenly do you believe in the power to contact the spirits of the dead he watched her closely she had denied helping maude lamont but surely there had been some assistance and there was no one else here lena took in a long very deep breath and let it out in a sigh i dont know seeing as ive lost my mother and my sister id like to think they were somewhere i could speak to them again her face was blurred with the depth of her emotion which she kept only barely in control it was profoundly obvious that her loss still racked her and pitt loathed having to reawaken it and in front of others such grief should be afforded privacy have you ever seen manifestations yourself he asked the answer to maude lamonts murder lay at least in part in this house and he had to find it whether it affected voisey or the election or anything else he could not let murder go whoever the victim and whatever the reason i used to think so she said hesitantly long ago but when you want something bad enough like these people did she glanced sideways at the chairs where maudes clients sat at the seances then perhaps you see it anyway dont you yes you can he agreed but you had no interest in the spirits these people wanted to contact think back to all you heard all you know of what miss lamont was able to create weve heard from other clients of voices music but the levitation seems to have happened only here she looked puzzled rising up in the air pitt explained he saw a sudden flash of understanding in her eyes tellman take another look at the table he ordered he turned back to lena forrest do you ever remember seeing something different on the mornings after a seance anything misplaced a different smell dust or powder anything at all she was silent for so long he was not sure if she was concentrating on something or if she simply did not intend to answer tellman was sitting in the chair where maude sat lenas eyes were steady on him did you ever move the table pitt asked suddenly no its fixed to the floor tellman replied i tried to move it before pitt stood up what about the chair as he said it he walked over and tellman rose and picked it up he saw with surprise that there were four slight indentations on the floorboards where the feet had rested surely even the most continual use could not have made them he moved to one of the other chairs and lifted it there were no marks he looked up quickly at lena forrest and caught the knowledge in her face wheres the lever he said grimly your position is a very precarious one miss forrest dont jeopardize your future by lying to the police he hated making the threat but he had no time to waste in trying to dismantle the woodwork to find the mechanism and he needed to know how far she was involved it might be crucial later she stood up whitefaced and came around to the opposite side of the chair she leaned over and touched the center of one of the carved flowers on the table edge press it he ordered she did and nothing happened do it again he ordered she stood perfectly still very gradually the chair began to rise and glancing down pitt saw that the floorboards immediately under it rose also just those actually supporting the four feet the rest remained where they were there was no sound whatever the machinery was so perfectly oiled it happened easily when the chair was about eight inches above the rest of the floor it stopped pitt stared at lena forrest so you knew that at least this much was trickery i only just found out she said with a quiver in her voice when after she was dead i started to look i didnt tell you because it seemed she looked down then quickly up again well shes gone i suppose she cant be hurt she doesnt know anything now i think youd better tell us what else you learned miss forrest i dont know anything else just the chair i i heard of the things she did from someone who came by with flowers to say how sorry they were so i looked i never sat in on a seance i was never there pitt could not draw anything more from her minute examination of the chair and the table and a journey to the cellar exposed a very fine mechanism kept in perfect repair also several bulbs for electric light with which the house was fitted and which worked from a generator also in the cellar why so many bulbs pitt said thoughtfully electric isnt even in most of the house only the parlor and the dining room all the rest is gas and coal for heat no idea tellman confessed looks like she used the electricity for the tricks more than anything else in fact come to think of it there are only three electric lights altogether maybe she meant to get more and got the bulbs first pitt raised his eyebrows tellman shrugged his square thin shoulders what we need to find out is what she knew about those three people that made one of them kill her they all had secrets of one sort and she was blackmailing them id lay odds on that well kingsley came because of his sons death pitt replied mrs serracold wanted to contact her mother so presumably hers is a family matter lying in the past we have to be certain who cartouche is and why he came and why he wouldnt even tell her his name tellman said angrily for my money that means hes someone wed recognize and his secret is so bad he wont risk that he grunted what if she recognized him and that was why he had to kill her pitt thought about it for a few moments but according to both mrs serracold and general kingsley he didnt want to speak to anyone in particular not yet perhaps he would have once hed really believed she could do it tellman said with rising certainty or perhaps when he was convinced she was genuine he would have asked for someone what if he was still testing her from both witnesses it sounds as if that was what he was trying to do tellman was right pitt acknowledged it but he had no answer the suggestion that it had been francis wray was not one that he believed not if it included the possibility that it was he who had deliberately knelt on maude lamonts chest and forced the egg white and cheesecloth down her throat then held her until she choked to death gasping and gagging as it filled her lungs fighting for life tellman was watching him weve got to find him he said grimly mr wetron insists its this man in teddington he says the evidence will be there if we look for it he half suggested i send a squad of men over there and no pitt cut across him sharply if anyone goes i will then youd better go today tellman warned otherwise wetron may special branch is in charge of this case again pitt interrupted him tellman stiffened his resentment still clear in his eyes and the hard set of his face his jaw was tight and there was a tiny muscle ticking in his temple dont have a lot to show for it though do we pitt felt himself flush the criticism was fair but it still hurt and the fact that in special branch he was out of his depth and aware of it and someone else had his position in bow street made it worse he did not dare to think of failure but it was always at the back of his mind waiting for an unguarded moment when he was at home in the empty house weary and without any clear idea where to look next it was a black hole at his feet and falling into it was a possibility all too real ill go he said curtly youd better do more to find out how she got her blackmail material was it all watching and listening or did she do some active research it may help to know tellman appeared undecided one emotion conflicting with another in his face it looked like anger and guilt perhaps regret for having said aloud what was in his mind ill see you tomorrow he muttered and turned to leave sitting in the train to teddington pitt turned over in his mind all the possible lines of enquiry about francis wray always at the forefront was the leaflet he had seen on the table advertising maude lamont and the fury in wrays face at mention of spirit mediums he denied to himself that the old man was so emotionally disturbed by the death of his wife he had lost mental balance and perhaps he had in the first depth of his grief abandoned a lifetimes faith and gone to a medium he certainly would not be unique in that not even unusual and with the vehemence of his conviction that it was sin he would then have equated the medium with the offense and have tried to rid himself of his selfloathing by destroying her and the more that thought intruded into pitts mind the more fiercely he tried to deny it when he reached teddington he got off the train but this time he avoided udney road and went to high street he loathed asking the villagers about francis wray but there was no choice left to him if he did not then wetron would send others who would be even clumsier and cause more pain he had to use an invention he could hardly say outright do you think mr wray has lost the hold of his sanity he framed instead questions as to things having been lost lapses of memory other peoples concern that wray was unwell it was not as difficult as he had expected simply to find the words but forcing himself to pry into the way the old mans grief had affected him was one of the most offensive things he had ever done not to the people he spoke to but to himself the answers all carried the same elements francis wray was deeply liked and admired perhaps loved would not have been too strong a word but those who answered pitt were also anxious for wray aware that his loss had left him more vulnerable than they were sure he could deal with friends had been uncertain whether to call in to see him or not was it intrusive disturbing a private emotion or was it a muchneeded respite from the utter loneliness of the house with no one to speak to but young mary ann who was devoted to his welfare but hardly a companion to him pitt did manage to draw something from one of these friends another man roughly wrays age and also a widower pitt found him in his garden tying up the most magnificent pink hollyhocks well above the height of his own head its only a matter of concern pitt explained himself there is no complaint no of course mr duncan answered pulling off a length of string from the ball and cutting it awkwardly with his secateurs i am afraid when we get old and lonely we tend to make nuisances of ourselves without realizing it he smiled a little ruefully i daresay i did so myself the first year or two after my wife died sometimes we cant bear to speak to people and others we cant leave them alone im glad you see no need to do more than ascertain that there was no offense intended he cut off another length of string and looked apologetically at pitt young ladies can misunderstand the desire for their company no doubt with cause now and again reluctantly pitt introduced the subject of seances oh dear how unfortunate mr duncans face filled with alarm i am afraid he feels very strongly against that kind of thing he was here when we had a local tragedy quite a number of years ago now he chewed his lip ignoring the hollyhocks a young woman had a childout of wedlock you know penelope her name was the child died almost immediately poor little thing penelope was distraught with grief and went to a spirit medium who promised to put her in touch with her dead child he sighed of course the woman was a complete fraud and when she discovered it poor penelope went quite wild with grief it seems she thought she had spoken with the child and that it had gone on to a far better place she was comforted the muscles in his face tightened and then the deception drove her right out of her senses i am afraid she took her own life it was very dreadful and poor francis saw it all and was helpless to prevent any of it he argued to have the child buried properly but of course he lost since it was illegitimate and unbaptized he was very put out with the local minister over that the feeling lasted for quite a while francis would have baptized the child regardless and taken the consequences but of course he didnt have the power pitt tried to think of something to say that expressed the emotions boiling up inside him and found nothing that touched the anger or the futility he felt and of course he comforted her the best he could duncan continued he knew the wretched medium was a fraud but penelope wouldnt listen she was desperate to have any belief at all that her child still existed somewhere poor creature she wasnt very old herself of course francis has had something of a passion against all kinds of spiritualist activity ever since then from time to time he has launched something of a crusade yes pitt said pity twisting inside him with a hard empty pain i can understand his feelings there can be little more bitterly cruel even if possibly it is not meant so yes duncan nodded yes indeed one cannot blame his anger i think i felt much the same myself at the time pitt thanked him and excused himself there was nothing more to learn from other people it was time he faced wray again and pressed him further to account more precisely for his whereabouts on the evenings cartouche was recorded in maude lamonts diary as having been at southampton row at udney road mary ann welcomed him in without question and wray himself met him in the study doorway with a smile he did not even ask pitt if he would stay for tea but sent mary ann straightaway to prepare it with sandwiches and fruit scones with greengage jam it was an excellent crop last year he said enthusiastically leading the way back into the study and offering pitt a chair he blinked and his voice dropped and became suddenly very gentle my wife was extremely good at making jam greengage was one of her favorites pitt felt wretched he was sure guilt must be written in his face at the thought of probing the grief of this man who so obviously liked and trusted him and had not the remotest suspicion that pitt was here not in friendship but in pursuit of his job perhaps i should not take it he said unhappily would you not rather keep it for he was not sure what he wanted to say no no wray assured him not at all i am afraid the raspberry is all gone i rather indulged myself i should be delighted to share this with you she really was very good sudden concern filled his eyes unless of course you do not care for it oh i do i like it very much good then we shall have it wray smiled now tell me why you are here and how you are mr pitt have you found this unfortunate man who was consulting the medium who died pitt was not ready to pursue it yet he had thought his plan was clear and now it was not no no i havent he replied and it is important that i do he may have knowledge which would make it much plainer why she was killed and by whom oh dear wray shook his head how very sad evil always comes of such things you know we should not meddle with them to do so even in the imagination of innocence is to awaken the devil to our weaknesses and never doubt it mr pitt it is an invitation he will not pass by pitt was embarrassed it was an area of thought he had never considered perhaps because his faith was more of morality than the metaphysics of god or satan and certainly he had never considered belief in calling upon spirits yet wray was in deadly earnest no one looking at the passion in his face could mistake it pitt compromised it seems likely that she was in the practice of a very human evil mr wray namely that of blackmail wray shook his head a kind of moral murder i think he said very quietly poor woman she has forfeited a great deal of herself i fear he was prevented from saying any more on the subject by a knock on the door and a moment later mary ann appeared with their tea the tray was so laden with plates that it looked precariously heavy and pitt shot to his feet to take it from her in case in her efforts to hold both it and the door she should drop it thank you sir she said uncomfortably flushing a little but you shouldnt it is no trouble pitt assured her it looks excellent and very generous i had not realized i was hungry but now i definitely am she bobbed a little curtsy of satisfaction and almost ran out leaving wray to pour smiling at pitt as he did so a nice child he said with a nod she does everything she can to care for me there was no answer to make that would not have been trite the contents of the tray were stronger evidence of her care than any words could have been they ate in silent appreciation for several minutes the tea was hot and fragrant the sandwiches delicious and the fresh scones crumbled at the touch rich with butter and the sharp sweet jam pitt bit into it and looked up wray was watching him intently waiting to see if he truly liked the greengage jam and he could not bear to ask pitt did not know whether to praise it highly if that would sound artificial in the end a condescension worse than silence pity could be the ultimate offense and yet if he were lukewarm that would be wrong too insensitive and of little use i hate to eat the last of it he said with his mouth full you wont get the like of it again there is a richness and a delicacy to it it must be exactly the right amount of sugar because there is no cloying sweetness to mar the taste of the fruit he took a deep breath and thought of charlotte and voisey and everything he could lose and how it would destroy all that was good and precious in his world my wife makes the best marmalade ive ever tasted he said and was horrified to hear his voice husky does she wray struggled to keep control to speak with something like normality they were two men who were barely acquaintances sharing afternoon tea and thoughts of preserves and the women they loved more profoundly than any words about anything at all could say the tears brimmed in wrays eyes and slid down his cheeks pitt swallowed the last mouthful of scone and jam wray bent his head and his shoulders trembled and then began to shake he struggled for a moment or two pitt stood up quietly and went around the table and sat sideways on the arm of the old mans chair tentatively at first then with more assurance he put his hand on wrays shoulder feeling it startlingly frail then around him and as he relaxed his weight allowed him to weep perhaps it was the first time wray had permitted himself to do so since his wifes death pitt had no idea how long they sat like that until at last wray ceased to move to shake and finally straightened himself up he must be allowed dignity without looking at him pitt rose to his feet and walked out of the french doors into the garden and the sun he would give him ten minutes at least to compose himself wash his face and then they could both pretend nothing had happened he was standing facing the road when he saw the carriage coming it was a very handsome vehicle with excellent horses and a coachman in livery to his great surprise it stopped at the gate and a woman alighted carrying a basket covered with a cloth she was of very striking appearance darkhaired with a face not immediately beautiful but of powerful intelligence and character she walked with unusual grace and appeared to notice him only as her hand was on the latch perhaps at first she had assumed he was a gardener until she looked more clearly and saw his clothes good afternoon she said calmly is mr wray at home yes but he is a little unwell he answered moving towards her i daresay he will be pleased to see you but in courtesy i think we should allow him a few minutes to recover himself mrs cavendish she replied her look was very direct i know his doctor and you are not he who are you sir my name is pitt i am merely a friend should we call his doctor i can send my carriage immediately she half turned joseph dr trent it is not necessary pitt said quickly a few minutes and he will be much better she looked doubtful please mrs cavendish if you are a friend then your company may be the thing most helpful he glanced down at her basket i brought him some books she said with a faint smile and some jam tarts oh not greengage this is merely ordinary raspberry that is kind of you he said sincerely i am very fond of him she answered as i was of his wife they stood together in the sun for a few minutes longer then the french doors opened and wray himself came out walking carefully as if a trifle uncertain of his balance his skin was very pink and his eyes redrimmed but he had obviously dashed a little water over his face and was almost composed he looked startled to see mrs cavendish but not in the least displeased only perhaps embarrassed that she should find him in such a barely concealed emotional state he did not meet pitts eyes my dear octavia he said with warmth how kind of you to call on me again and so soon you really are very generous she smiled at him with affection i think of you very often she replied it seemed the natural thing to do we are all extremely fond of you she turned her shoulders away from pitt as if to exclude him from the remark she took the cloth off the basket i have brought a few books you may care to read and some tarts i hope you will enjoy them how thoughtful he said with an immense effort to sound pleased perhaps you will come in and have some tea she accepted and with a sharp look at pitt started to walk towards the french doors wray turned to pitt mr pitt do you care to come back also you are most welcome i do not feel as if i have helped you very much although i confess i have no idea how i can i am not at all sure that there is any way pitt said before he considered the defeat implicit in the remark and you have given me most excellent hospitality i shall not forget it he did not mention the jam but he knew by the sudden brightness of wrays eyes and the way he blushed that he understood perfectly thank you wray said with overwhelming emotion and before he was overcome again he turned and followed mrs cavendish back towards the french doors and went inside after her pitt walked through the flowers to the gate and out into udney road chapter eleven the air blowing down off the moor was sweet barely stirring the leaves of the apple tree in the cottage garden and the silence and darkness were unbroken it ought to have been a perfect night for deep untroubled sleep but charlotte lay awake aware of her loneliness ears straining as if expecting to hear a sound a footfall somewhere a loose stone disturbed on the track beyond the gate perhaps wheels or more likely simply a horses hoof striking a sudden hard surface when at last she did hear it the reality shot through her blood like fire she threw back the bedcovers and stumbled the mere three steps to the window and peered out in the starlight there was nothing but a variance of depth in the shadows anyone could have been there and she would not have seen she stayed until her eyes ached but there was no movement just another slight sound no more than a rustle a fox a stray cat or a night hunting bird she had seen an owl at dusk yesterday evening she crept back to bed but still lay awake waiting emily also found it hard to sleep but it was guilt that disturbed her and a decision she did not want to make but knew now was inevitable of all the possibilities she had considered for the fear that haunted rose insanity had never been among them she had thought of an unfortunate romance before aubrey or even after possibly a lost child someone in her family with whom she had quarreled and who had died before she had had the chance to repair the rift not once had she imagined something as terrible as madness she could not commit herself to telling pitt and yet in her heart she knew she had to she was just not prepared yet to admit it to herself she still wanted to believe that somehow she would be able to protect rose from what injustice judgment that knew only some of the facts the truth she toyed with the idea of going to pitt in the morning an hour or so after breakfast when she had had time to compose herself think exactly what she was going to say and how to word it but honesty compelled her to acknowledge that if she waited then pitt would almost certainly have left the house and she was only thinking of doing it so she could pretend to herself that she had tried when in actuality she had quite deliberately gone when she knew it was too late so she rose at six when her maid brought her the requested cup of hot tea which made her feel rather more like facing the day she dressed and was out of the house by half past seven once you have made up your mind to do something that you know will be difficult and unpleasant it is better to do it immediately before too much thinking of it can fill your mind with the fears of all that can hurt and go wrong pitt was startled to see her he stood in the doorway in keppel street in shirtsleeves and stocking feet his hair untidy as ever emily his concern was instant has something happened are you all right yes something has happened she replied and i am not sure whether i will be all right or not he stood aside inviting her in allowing her to lead the way to the kitchen she sat down on one of the hardbacked chairs sparing only a glance at the familiar surroundings so subtly different without either charlotte or gracie there the room had a vaguely unused feel as if only the necessities were being done no baking of cakes no smell of richness or warmth too little linen on the airing rail strung up to the ceiling only archie and angus stretching themselves awake on the hearth of the cooking range looking totally comfortable tea pitt asked indicating the pot on the table and the kettle whistling gently on the back of the hob toast no thank you she declined he sat down ignoring his own halffinished drink what is it she had passed the point of changing her mind well almost there was still time to say something else he was looking at her waiting perhaps he would draw it out of her whether she wanted him to or not if she hesitated long enough he might do that and relieve her of the guilt except that was a lie to herself she was here at least do what needed doing with some integrity she raised her eyes and stared at him i saw rose serracold yesterday evening and talked with her as if we were alone it can be like that sometimes at a big party find yourself sort of islanded in noise so no one overhears you i bullied her into telling me why she went to maude lamont she stopped remembering how she had forced rose into an emotional corner bullied was the right word pitt waited without prompting her she is afraid her father died insane she stopped abruptly seeing pitts amazement and then instant horror she is terrified that she might have inherited the same taint in the blood she went on quietly as if whispering could lessen the pain of it she wanted to ask her mothers spirit if it was true if he really was mad but she didnt have the chance maude lamont was killed too soon i see he sat staring at her without moving we can ask general kingsley to confirm that at least she had not contacted her mother by the time she left she was startled you think she might have gone back afterwards and had a private seance someone went back whatever for he pointed out not rose she said with more conviction than she felt she wanted her alive she leaned forward across the table shes still so afraid she can hardly keep control of herself thomas she doesnt know yet shes hunting for another medium so she can go on searching the kettle shrilled more insistently on the hob and he ignored it or maude lamont told her something she doesnt want to believe he said gently and she is terrified that it will be discovered she looked at him wishing he did not understand her so well read in her the racing thoughts she would so much rather have concealed and yet if she could dupe him that would not be any comfort either she had always believed that her own skill with people was her greatest asset she could charm and beguile and so often make people do what she wished them to without their even being aware that what they embraced so eagerly was actually her idea and the use of it left her oddly dissatisfied she had realized that more and more lately she did not want to see further than jack could or be stronger or cleverer than he was ahead was a very lonely place one had to take the burden sometimes it was part of love part of responsibilitybut only sometimes not always and it was a pleasure only because it was right fair an act of giving not because it afforded any comfort to oneself so while she resented pitts pressure on her to tell him more than she wished to she also felt a sense of comfort that she could not fob him off with half an answer she needed him to be cleverer than she was because she had not the power to help rose or even to be certain what help would be she might only make it worse she realized now that she was not absolutely sure that rose was not touched with the edge of madness and could in her panic have thought maude lamont knew her secret and would endanger her and then aubrey she remembered how quickly rose had turned on her when she was afraid friendship had vanished like water dropped on the hot surface of a griddle evaporated before her sight she swore she did not kill her she said aloud and you want to believe her pitt finished the unsaid thought he stood up and went to the stove moving the kettle off the heat he turned back to face her i hope you are right but somebody did i dont want it to be general kingsley either the anonymous person emily concluded you still dont know who he was do you no she looked at him something was closed and hurt in his eyes he was not lying she had never known him to do that but there was a world of feeling and of fact that he was not willing to tell her thank you emily he said coming back to the table did she say if anyone else knew of this fear does aubrey know no she was quite certain aubrey doesnt know and if you are thinking maude lamont blackmailed her i dont think so she was aware of a sudden lurch of anxiety as she said it and that it was only partially true could pitt see that in her face he gave a slight shrug perhaps maude lamont didnt know yet he said dryly someone may have affected a very lucky escape for rose aubrey doesnt know thomas he really doesnt probably not he walked with her to the front door collecting his jacket on the way and outside he accepted a lift in her carriage as far as oxford street where she turned west to go back home he went south towards the war office to again search its records for whatever it was that had forced general kingsley to attack the political party whose values he had always believed surely it had to have some connection with the death of his son or some action shortly before it he had been there over an hour reading one report after another when he realized that he still had no flavor of the man no sense of anything other than a torrent of formal fleshless words it was like seeing the skeleton of a man and trying to imagine the look of his face his voice his laughter the way he moved there was nothing here whatever it had been was covered over he could read this all day and learn nothing he copied out the names of most of the other officers and men who had been at mfolozi to see if any of them were here in london and perhaps willing to tell him more than this then he thanked the clerk and left he had already given the cabbie the address of the first man on the list when he changed his mind and gave lady vespasia cumminggoulds address instead perhaps it was an impertinence to call on her uninvited but he had never found her unwilling to help in any cause in which she believed and after whitechapel where they had shared not only the battle itself but a depth of emotion a fear and a loss and a victory at terrible price there was a bond between them unlike any other therefore it was with confidence that he presented himself at the front door of her house and told the maid who answered it that he wished to speak with lady vespasia on a matter of some urgency he would await her convenience however long that might be he was left in the morning room but it proved to be only for a matter of minutes then he was shown into her sitting room which faced onto the garden and always seemed to be full of peace and a soft light whatever the season or the weather she was wearing a shade of clover pink so subtle it was hardly pink at all and the usual pearls around her neck she smiled to greet him and held out her hand very slightly not for him to take merely as a gesture that he should come in good morning thomas how pleasant to see you her eyes searched his face i have been half expecting you ever since emily called or perhaps half hoping would be more accurate voisey is standing for parliament she could not even say his name without the emotion thickening her voice she had to be remembering mario corena and the sacrifice which had cost voisey so dearly yes i know he said softly he wished he could have spared her being aware of it but she had never evaded anything in her life and to protect her now would surely be the ultimate insult that is why i am here in london rather than with charlotte in the country i am glad she is away her face was bleak but what is it you believe you can do thomas i dont know much about victor narraway i have asked but either the people i spoke to know little themselves or they are not prepared to tell me she looked at him steadily be very careful that you do not trust him more than is wise dont assume that he has the concern for you or the loyalty that captain cornwallis had he is not a straightforward man do you know that pitt said cutting across her unintentionally she smiled very slightly a gesture that barely moved her lips my dear thomas special branch is designed and created to catch anarchists bombers all kinds of men and i suppose a few women who plan in secret to overthrow our government some of them intend to replace it with another of their own choosing others simply wish to destroy without the slightest idea what will follow some of course have loyalties to other countries can you imagine john cornwallis organizing a force to prevent them before they succeed no pitt admitted with a sigh he is brave and profoundly honest he would expect to see the whites of their eyes before he would shoot he would invite them to surrender she amended special branch requires a devious man subtle full of imagination a man seen only in the shadows and never by the public do not forget that pitt was cold even in the sun i think general kingsley was being blackmailed by maude lamont at least on the surface it was by her for money she was surprised possibly but i think more likely to attack aubrey serracold in the newspapers sensing his inexperience and the probability that he would react badly damaging himself further oh dear she shook her head very slightly one of them killed her he continued rose serracold general kingsley or the man denoted in her diary by a cartouche a little drawing rather like a reversed small f with a semicircle over the top of it how curious and have you any idea who he may be superintendent wetron believes he is an elderly professor of theology who lives in teddington her eyes widened why that seems a very perverse thing for a religious man to do was he seeking to expose her as a fraud i dont know but i he hesitated not sure how to explain either his feelings or his actions i really dont believe it was he but i am not certain he recently lost his wife and is deeply grieved he has a passion against spirit mediums he believes they are evil and acting contrary to the commandments of god and you are afraid that this man deranged by his grief may have taken it into his head to finish her intervention permanently she concluded oh thomas my dear you are too softhearted for your profession sometimes very good men can make the most terrible mistakes and bring untold misery while convinced they are bent upon the work of god not all the inquisitors of spain were cruel or narrowminded men you know some truly believed they were saving the souls of those in their charge they would be astounded if they knew how we perceived them now she shook her head sometimes we see the world so differently from each other you would swear we could not possibly be speaking of the same existence have you never asked half a dozen witnesses to an event in the street even the description of a person and received such conflicting answers told in all sincerity that they cancel each other out entirely yes i have but i still do not think he is guilty of having killed maude lamont you do not want to think it what can i do to help you more than simply listen i must discover who killed maude lamont even though that is really tellmans job because the people she blackmailed are part of the effort to discredit serracold sadness and anger filled her eyes they have already succeeded with the poor mans own help you will have to perform a miracle if you are to rescue him now then she brightened unless of course you can demonstrate that voisey had a hand in it if he obtained her murder she stopped i think that would be good fortune beyond our reach he would not be so foolish above all he is clever but he will be behind the blackmail it just depends how far behind can you prove that he leaned forward a little i may be able to he saw her eyes shine and he knew she was thinking of mario corena again she could not weep she had already shed all her tears for him first in rome in then here in london only a few weeks ago but the loss was still raw perhaps it always would be i need to know why kingsley was being blackmailed he went on i think it was to do with the death of his son briefly he told her what he had learned first about kingsley himself and his part in the zulu wars and then the ambush at mfolozi so soon after the heroism of rorkes drift i see she said when he had finished it is very hard to follow in the steps of a father or brother who has succeeded in the eyes of the world most especially in the world of military courage many young men have thrown away their lives rather than be thought to fail in what was expected of them there was a weight of sadness in her voice and memory sharp and painful in her eyes perhaps she was thinking of the crimea of balaclava and the alma or of rorkes drift isandlwana or the indian mutiny and god knew how many other wars and losses her memory might even have stretched back as far as her girlhood and waterloo aunt vespasia she brought herself back to the present with a jolt of course she agreed it will not be too difficult for me to learn from one friend or another what really happened to young kingsley at mfolozi but i think it hardly matters except to his father no doubt what was used to blackmail him was the possibility of a cowards death it did not have to be the fact it is not only the wicked who run where no man pursues it is also the vulnerable those who care more than they are able to govern and who have raw wounds they cannot defend pitt thought of kingsleys bent shoulders and the haggard lines of his face it took a particular kind of sadism to torture a man in such a way for ones own profit for a moment he hated voisey with a passion that would have exploded in physical violence had he been there to lash out at of course it may be that the incident of his death is so blurred that the truth cannot be known or a lie dismissed vespasia went on but i shall do all i can to find out and if it is of any ease at all i shall inform general kingsley of it thank you which is not a great deal of use in tying the blackmail to voisey she continued with a trace of anger what hope have you of discovering the identity of this third person i assume you know it is a man you refer to him as he yes it is a man of late middle years fair or gray hair average height and build he seems to be well educated your theologian she said unhappily if he went to a spirit medium with the intent of proving her a fraud and unmasking her in front of her clients that would not please voisey very much i think we may assume he could retaliate perhaps with extreme pressure that was impossible to argue against pitt remembered the look in voiseys eyes as they had passed each other in the house of commons voisey forgot nothing and forgave nothing again pitt found himself sitting in the light of the sun and cold inside vespasia was frowning what is it he asked her silvergray eyes were troubled her body not merely straightbacked with the disciplined posture of decades of selfcontrol but her shoulders stiff with an inner tension i have given it much thought thomas and i still do not understand why you were dismissed a second time from command of bow street voisey he said with a bitterness that startled him he had thought himself in control of his anger his burning sense of injustice on the subject but now it came back in a drowning wave no she said half under her breath no matter how much he may hate you thomas he will never act against his own interest that is his greatest strength his head always governs his heart she stared straight ahead of her and it is not in his interest to have you in special branch which is where he must have known you would go if dismissed from bow street again in the police unless he commits a crime you have no jurisdiction in his affairs if you involve yourself with him he can charge you with harassment and have you disciplined but in special branch your duties are far more fluid special branch is secret not answerable to the public she turned to look at him always keep your enemies where you can see them he is not fool enough to forget that then why would he do it he asked confused by her logic perhaps it was not voisey she said very carefully then who he asked who else but the inner circle would have the power to go behind the queens back and undo what she had done the thought was dark and frightening he knew of no one else he had offended and certainly no other secret societies with such tentacles winding into the heart of government thomas how hard have you thought about the effect on the inner circle of voiseys knighthood and the reason for it vespasia asked i hope it shattered his leadership he said honestly he tried to swallow down his anger and the gall of disappointment inside him it hurts that it hasnt few of them are idealists she replied ruefully but have you considered that it might have fractured the power within the circle a rival leader who has arisen may have taken with him sufficient of the old circle to form a new one pitt had not thought of it and as the idea ballooned in his mind he saw all sorts of possibilities dangerous to england but also exquisitely dangerous to voisey himself voisey would know who the rival leader was but would he ever be certain whose loyalty was where vespasia saw all these thoughts in pitts face dont rejoice yet she warned if i am right then the rival is powerful too and no more a friend of yours than voisey it is not always true that my enemys enemy is my friend is it not possible that it was he who removed you again from bow street either because he believes you will be more of a thorn in voiseys flesh in special branch possibly in time even destroy voisey for him or else it matters to him to have superintendent wetron in charge of bow street rather than you wetron in the inner circle why not there was no reason why not the deeper it sank into his mind the more it clarified into a picture he could not disbelieve there was an exhilaration to it a beating of the blood as at the knowledge of danger but there was fear as well an open battle between the two leaders of the inner circle might leave many other victims in its wake he was still considering the implications of this when the maid appeared at the door looking alarmed yes vespasia asked mlady theres a mr narraway to see mr pitt he said he would wait but that i was to interrupt you she did not apologize in words but it was there in her gestures and her voice indeed vespasia sat very straight then you had better ask him to come in yes mlady she dropped the very slightest curtsy and withdrew to obey pitt met vespasias eyes a hundred ideas flashed between them all wordless all touched with fear narraway appeared a moment later his face was bleak with misery and defeat it dragged his shoulders in spite of the fact that he stood straight pitt climbed to his feet very slowly finding his legs shaking his mind whirled with thoughts of horror the most hideous and persistent crowding all the rest was that something had happened to charlotte his lips were dry and when he tried to speak his voice caught in his throat good morning mr narraway vespasia said coolly please sit down and inform us what it is that brings you personally to speak to thomas in my house he remained standing i am sorry lady vespasia he said very softly merely glancing at her before turning to pitt francis wray was found dead this morning for a moment pitt could not grasp it he was lightheaded his senses swimming it was nothing to do with charlotte she was safe it was all right the horror had not happened he was almost afraid he was going to laugh out of sheer hysteria of relief it cost him an intense effort to control himself im sorry he said aloud he meant it at least in part he had liked wray but considering the depth of grief that wray had been in perhaps death was not a hard thing but a reunion nothing changed in narraways face except a tiny twitch of muscle near his mouth it appears to have been suicide he said harshly it seems he took poison some time yesterday evening his maid found him this morning suicide pitt was appalled he refused to believe it he could not imagine wray doing anything he would regard as so deeply against the will of the god in whom all his trust lay the only pathway back to those he loved so intensely no there has to be another answer he protested his voice harsh and high narraway looked impatient as if a fearful anger lay only just under the surface of his control he left a message he said bitterly in a poem by matthew arnold and without waiting he went on and quoted by heart creep into thy narrow bed creep and let no more be said vain thy onset all stands fast thou thyself must break at last let the long contention cease geese are swans and swans are geese let them have it how they will those art tired best be still narraways eyes did not move from pitts close enough to a suicide note for most people he said softly and voiseys sister octavia cavendish who has been a friend of wrays for some time called by to visit him just as you were leaving yesterday afternoon she found him in a state of some distress in her opinion he had been weeping you had made enquiries about him in the village pitt felt the blood drain from him he wept for his wife he protested but he heard the note of despair in his voice it was the truth but it sounded like an excuse narraway nodded very slowly his mouth a thin tight line this is voiseys revenge vespasia whispered he has not minded sacrificing an old man in order to blame thomas for hounding him to his death i didnt pitt began then stopped seeing the look in her eyes it was wetron who had given him wrays name and suggested he was the man behind the cartouche and according to tellman it was wetron who had insisted pitt go out again and follow up his first enquiry or else he himself would send a force of men surely knowing pitt would go before he would allow that was he with voisey or against him or either way as it suited his own purposes vespasia turned to narraway what are you going to do she asked him as if it were inconceivable he should do nothing narraway looked beaten you are quite right my lady it is voiseys revenge and it is exquisite the newspapers will crucify pitt francis wray was deeply revered even loved by all who knew him he had suffered many reverses of fortune with courage and dignity first the loss of his children then of his wife someone has already told the newspapers that pitt suspected him of having consulted maude lamont and then having murdered her i did not pitt said desperately that is irrelevant now narraway dismissed it you were trying to determine if he was cartouche and cartouche is among the suspects you are arguing the depth of the water in which you will drown it is deep enough what does it matter if it is two fathoms or thirty or a hundred we had afternoon tea pitt said almost to himself with greengage jam he hadnt much of it left it was an act of friendship that he shared it with me we talked of love and loss that was why he wept i doubt that is what mrs cavendish will say narraway replied and he was not cartouche someone else has come forward to say exactly where wray was on the evening of maude lamonts last seance he had a late supper with the local vicar and his wife i believe i already asked you mr narraway what you intend to do about it vespasia said a little more sharply he turned to look at her there is nothing i can do lady vespasia the newspapers will say what they wish and i have no power over them they believe that an innocent and bereaved old man has been hounded to death by an overzealous policeman there is considerable evidence to that effect and i cannot prove it false even though i believe it is there was no conviction in his voice just a flat despair he looked at pitt i hope you will be able to continue with your job although it seems inevitable now that voisey will win if you need anyone to help you other than tellman let me know he stopped his face pinched with misery im sorry pitt no one crosses the inner circle and wins for long at least not yet he went to the door good day lady vespasia i apologize for my intrusion and he left as easily as he had come pitt was stunned in a matter of a quarter of an hour his world had been shattered charlotte and the children were safe voisey had no idea where they were but then possibly he had never tried to find out his vengeance was subtler and more appropriate than simple violence pitt had ruined him in the eyes of the republicans and in return he had ruined pitt in the eyes of the people he served and who had once thought so well of him courage my dear vespasia said gently but her voice cracked i think this is going to be very hard but we will not cease to fight we will not allow evil to triumph without giving everything we have in the cause against it he looked at her frailer now than she used to be her back ramrod stiff her thin shoulders square her eyes burning with tears he could not possibly let her down no of course not he agreed though he had not the faintest idea even where or how to begin chapter twelve the next morning was one of the worst in pitts life he had finally gone to sleep holding on to his gratitude that at least charlotte the children and gracie were safe he awoke with them pictured in his mind and found himself smiling then memory returned and he knew that francis wray was dead possibly by his own hand alone and in despair he could remember him so clearly sitting at the tea table apologizing for having no cake or raspberry jam to offer and giving pitt the precious greengage instead with such pride pitt lay on his back staring up at the ceiling the house was silent it was shortly after six two hours before mrs brody would come he could think of nothing to get up for but his mind would not let him go back to sleep this was voiseys revenge and it was perfect had wetron known he was helping to accomplish it for him when he had sent tellman to prompt pitt to go back to teddington a second time and ask around the village wray was the perfect victim a bereaved and forgetful old man too honest to guard his tongue in his hatred of what was to him a sin against god in the calling up of the dead voisey would certainly have known the story of the young woman penelope who had lost her child and in her grief sought a spirit medium who had used her duped her taken her money and then been caught in a cheap fraud after all it had happened in the very village where his sister lived a situation too ideal to pass by perhaps it was even octavia cavendish who had left the tract on maude lamont in wrays house simple enough to do and right where pitt would see it they had both been led like lambs to the slaughter and in wrays case it was literal in pitts it would be slower more exquisite he would suffer and voisey would watch taking his pleasure sip by sip it was stupid lying here thinking about it he got up quickly washed shaved and dressed then went downstairs in the silence to make himself a cup of tea and feed archie and angus he did not feel like eating what would he tell charlotte how could he explain to her yet another disaster in their fortunes his mind was almost numb with pain at the thought he was not aware of time as he sat letting his tea go cold before finally standing up fishing in his pockets to see what change he had and going out to buy a newspaper it was still not yet eight oclock a calm summer morning the light pale through the haze of the city but the sun already high it was the middle of summer and the nights were short there were many people up and busy errand boys delivery carts peddlers looking for early business maids banging around in the areaways as they put out rubbish bossed around the bootboys and scullery maids or told the tweenies what to do and how to do it every now and again he heard the hard thwack of someone beating a rug and saw a fine cloud of dust rise in the air there was a newsboy on the corner the same one he knew from every other day but this time there was no smile no greeting yerll not be wantin it i should think he said grimly im surprised ill say that for yer knew yer was a rozzer for all yer live in a nice area n all never thought yerd ound an old man ter is death thatll be tuppence if yer please pitt held the money and the newsboy took it without a word half turning his back as soon as the exchange was made pitt walked home without opening the paper two or three other people passed him none of them spoke he had no idea whether they would have normally he was too dazed to think once inside he sat down at the kitchen table again and spread the paper open it was not in the front pagesthey were dominated by the election as he had expected them to bebut as soon as he was past that on page it was there at the top in the middle we are deeply sorry to report the death of the reverend francis w wray discovered at his home in teddington yesterday he was seventythree years old and was still griefstricken at the recent death of his beloved wife eliza he leaves no children all having died in their early years the police in the person of thomas pitt lately relieved of his command of the bow street station and with no acknowledged authority called upon mr wray several times and spoke to other residents in the area asking them many intrusive and personal questions regarding mr wrays life and beliefs and his recent behavior he denied that this was in his sofarunsuccessful pursuit of the murder in southampton row bloomsbury of the spirit medium and conductor of seances miss maude lamont after mr pitts latest enquiries in the village he visited mr wray in his home and a later caller found mr wray in a state of extreme distress as if he had been reduced to weeping the next morning mr wrays housekeeper mary ann smith found mr wray dead in his armchair leaving no letter but a book of poetry marked at the verse by the late matthew arnold which appears his tragic despairing farewell to a world he could no longer endure the doctor was called and gave his opinion that the cause of death was poison most likely of the type that creates damage to the heart speculation has occurred that it might have been something from the wide variety of plants within mr wrays garden because it is known that he did not leave home after mr pitts call francis wray had an outstanding academic career it then went on to list the achievements of wrays life followed by tributes from a number of prominent people all of whom mourned his death and were shocked and grieved by the manner of it pitt closed the paper and made himself another cup of tea he sat down again nursing his tea between his hands trying to think exactly what he had said to the people in teddington that could have gone back so quickly to wray and how it could possibly have hurt him so deeply had he really been guilty of such crass clumsiness certainly he had said nothing to wray himself the distress octavia cavendish had seen was the grief for his wife but of course she could not know that nor in the circumstances would she be likely to believe it no one would that wray had grieved for his wife only added to pitts sin how could he fight voisey now the election was too close aubrey serracold was losing ground and voisey gaining it with each hour pitt had made not the slightest mark in voiseys success he had watched it all happen and had about as much effect on it as a member of the audience has on a play on the stage in front of him visible audible but totally beyond his reach he did not even know which one of her three clients had killed maude lamont all he felt certain of was that the motive had been the blackmail she was exercising over them because of their different fears kingsley that his son had died a cowards death rose serracold that her father had died insane and the truth or falsity of that was still unknown and the man represented by the cartouche and pitt had no idea who that was or what his vulnerability might be nothing he had heard from rose serracold or kingsley shed any light on it there was not even a suggestion those already dead could in theory know anything at all it could be a family secret a dead friend betrayed a child a lover a crime concealed or simply some foolishness that would embarrass by its intimacy all it had to be was sufficient for the knowledge of it to be worth paying a price to keep hidden perhaps if he started at the other end of the reasoning it would make more sense what was the price if it was connected with voisey then it was something that provided fuel in his campaign for power he had all the help he needed in his own speeches his funds the issues to address what could help him was to undermine serracold that is what he had had kingsley do his own supporters were already won the victory lay in turning those who would be natural liberals holding the balance of power who had attacked serracold to any effect who that one would not have expected reluctantly he picked up the newspaper again and looked through the political commentary the letters to the editor the reports of speeches there were plenty praising and blaming candidates on both sides but most of them were general aimed more at party than individual there were several barbed comments about keir hardie and his attempt to create a new voice for the workingman underneath one such pitt found a personal letter criticizing the immoral and potentially disastrous views of the liberal candidate for lambeth south and praising sir charles voisey who stood for sanity rather than socialism the values of thrift and responsibility selfdiscipline and christian compassion rather than laxity selfindulgence and untried social experiment which took away the ideals of worth and justice it was signed by reginald underhill bishop in the church of england of course underhill was entitled to political opinions and to express them as fiercely as he wished like any other man regardless of whether they were logical or even honest but was he doing so from his own conviction or because he was being blackmailed into it except what reason could there possibly be for a bishop of the church ever to have consulted a spirit medium surely like francis wray he would have abhorred the very idea pitt was still considering the possibility when mrs brody arrived she said good morning to him civilly enough then stood moving her weight from one foot to the other obviously embarrassed what is it mrs brody he asked he was in no mood to care about a domestic crisis today she looked miserable im sorry mr pitt but arter wots in the papers this mornin i cant keep on comin ter do for yer me usband says it int right theres plenty o work goin round about an e says i gotta find another place tell mrs pitt im very sorry like but i gotta do like e says there was no point in arguing with her her face was set in unhappy defiance she had to live with her husband whatever her own opinions she could walk away from pitt then youd better go he said flatly he took half a crown out of his pocket and put it on the table thats what i owe you for this week so far goodbye she did not move i cant elp it she accused you have made your decision mrs brody he stared at her with equal anger all the hurt and helplessness boiling up inside him you have worked here for over two years and you have decided to believe what is written in the newspapers thats an end of the matter ill tell mrs pitt that you left without notice whether she gives you a character or not is her decision but then as you are believing ill of her by inference because she is my wife i doubt that as my wife her recommendation would be of much value to you anyway please close the front door as you leave it int my doing she said loudly i dont go out ter some poor old man an ound im ter is death you think i suspected him without grounds he asked his own voice louder than he had meant it to be thats wot it says she stared back at him then if that is sufficient for you you had better judge me equally without grounds and leave as i said please make sure the front door is closed behind you it is the kind of day when anyone might come in off the street with ill will goodbye she snorted loudly picked up the money off the table then swiveled on the heel of her boot and went marching down the passage he heard the front door bang loudly no doubt so he would entertain no question as to whether she had left it was another miserable quarter of an hour before the doorbell rang pitt very nearly ignored it it rang again whoever it was did not intend to accept refusal lightly it rang a third time pitt stood up and walked the length of the passage he opened the door ready to defend himself cornwallis stood on the step looking miserable but resolute his face set grimly eyes meeting pitts good morning he said quietly may i come in what for pitt asked less graciously than he meant he would find criticism from cornwallis harder to take than from almost any other man he was surprised and a little frightened by how vulnerable he felt because im not going to talk to you standing here on the step like a peddler cornwallis said tartly ive no idea what to say but id rather try to think of something sitting down i was so damned angry when i read the newspapers i forgot to have any breakfast pitt almost smiled ive got bread and marmalade and the kettles on id better stoke the stove mrs brodys just given her notice the daily cornwallis asked stepping inside and closing the door behind him as he followed pitt back down the passage yes ill have to start fetching for myself in the kitchen he offered tea and toast which cornwallis accepted making himself reasonably comfortable sitting on one of the hardbacked chairs pitt stoked the stove with coal and poked it until it was burning brightly then put a slice of bread on the toasting fork and held it to brown the kettle started to whistle gently on the hob when they had a piece of toast each and the tea was brewing cornwallis began to talk did this man wray have anything to do with maude lamont he asked not so far as i know pitt replied he had a hatred of spirit mediums especially those who give false hope to the bereaved but so far as i know not to maude lamont in particular why pitt told him the story of the young woman in teddington her child her consulting of the spirit medium at the time the violence of her grief and then her own death could it have been maude lamont cornwallis asked no pitt was quite certain when that happened she could not have been more than about twelve years old theres no connection except the one voisey created to trap me and i did everything to help him so it would seem cornwallis agreed but im damned if im going to let him get away with it if we cant defend ourselves then we must attack this time pitt did smile surprise and gratitude welled up inside him that cornwallis should so fully and without question take his part i wish i knew how pitt answered i have been considering the possibility that the real man behind the cartouche was bishop underhill he was startled to hear himself say it aloud and without fear that cornwallis would dismiss it as absurd cornwalliss friendship was the only decent thing in the day he knew inside himself that vespasia would react similarly he was relying on her to help charlotte in what would be a very difficult time to bearnot only for herself both in her anger and inability to help and her pain for him but also for the cruelty the children would endure from school friends even people in the street barely knowing why only that their father was hated it was something they had never known before and would not understand he refused to think about it now terrible enough when he had to no need to anticipate the pain when he could do nothing about it bishop underhill cornwallis repeated thoughtfully why why him pitt told him his line of reasoning based upon the assistance the bishop had given voisey cornwallis frowned what would take him to a spirit medium ive no idea pitt replied too lost in his own unhappiness to catch the emotion in the other mans voice further discussion was interrupted by the sound of the doorbell again cornwallis stood up immediately and went to answer it without giving pitt the opportunity he returned a few moments later with tellman behind him looking like the chief mourner at a funeral pitt waited for one of the other two to speak tellman cleared his throat then sank back into a wretched silence what did you come for pitt asked him he heard his voice edgy and accusing but it was beyond his control tellman looked at him glaring where else would i be he challenged it was my fault i told you to go to teddington youd never have heard of wray if it werent for me his face was filled with anguish his body rigid his eyes hot pitt saw with a rush of surprise that tellman really did blame himself for what had happened he was scalded with a shame too deep to find words at another time if pitt were hurting even a little less himself he would have been moved by tellmans loyalty but now his own fear was too deep it all stemmed back to his evidence before whitechapel if only he hadnt been so sure of himself so pigheaded in giving evidence because he wanted his idea of justice served he had been right of course but that was not going to help now who told you about francis wray cornwallis asked tellman and for heavens sake sit down were standing around as if we were at the graveside the battle is not over yet pitt wanted to believe that but there was no rational hope that he could grasp superintendent wetron tellman answered he glanced at pitt why cornwallis persisted what reason did he give who suggested wray to him he didnt know him himself so who told him about wray who made the connection between wray and the unknown man who visited maude lamont absentmindedly pitt thought how cornwallis had grown in his knowledge of detection he looked at tellman he never said tellman replied his eyes widening i did ask him but somehow he never really answered voisey it must have been there was a thin thread of hope in his voice all the information about wray came from superintendent wetron so far as i know his mouth tightened but if he believes in voisey or or maybe he is inner circle himself he said it with disbelief as if even now the thought of his superiors being one of that terrible society was too monstrous to be more than a bad idea something to be said and discarded pitt thought of vespasia when we disgraced voisey we may have fractured the inner circle he said looking from cornwallis to tellman and back again tellman knew all about the whitechapel matter cornwallis knew something but there were still large gaps in his knowledge although even as pitt watched him he saw his understanding leap forward he asked no questions fractured tellman said slowly you mean like in two parts at least pitt answered voisey and someone else cornwalliss eyebrows rose wetron tellmans sense of decency was outraged oh no hes a policeman but even as he protested he was entertaining the idea he shook his head pushing it away a small member maybe people do to get on but cornwallis chewed his lip it would make a lot of sense someone with a great deal of power a very great deal had you dismissed from bow street a second time he said to pitt perhaps it was wetron after all he was the one who took charge from you superintendent of bow street is a very nice place for the head of the inner circle he looked rueful even for an instant aware of fear therell be no end to his ambition no one laughed and no one denied it hes an ambitious man tellman said very seriously cornwallis leaned forward a little across the table could they be rivals almost as if he had spoken it aloud pitt knew what he was thinking it was the first spark of real hope wild as it was use it he asked almost afraid to put words to it cornwallis nodded very slowly tellman stared at them his face pale one against the other can you think of anything else cornwallis asked him wetron is ambitious if he thinks he can challenge voisey for leadership of half the inner circle and i think we can assume he is the one who led the breakaway if not at first then at least by the time it achieved its independence then he is very ambitious indeed and he cannot be fool enough to think voisey will forgive him for it he will have to live the rest of his life watching his back if you know you have an enemy better make a preemptive strike if you believe you can do it effectively finish your man how pitt asked tie voisey in to the southampton row murder the idea strengthened as he was speaking there must be a continuous connection voisey goes to maude lamont with social connections money whatever it is she wants and in return she blackmails certain of her clients to speak out against voiseys opponent in the election aubrey serracold which in turn helps voisey ties up tellman agreed voisey to maude lamont to her clients who do what she tells them which helps voisey but we cant prove it maude lamont was the link and shes dead he took in a deep breath just a minute did the blackmail stop did they stop helping voisey that question was asked of pitt no he said no so maude didnt do the blackmailing she just provided the information as to where they were vulnerable then the chill returned but we found no connection to voisey we searched all her papers letters diaries banking accounts everything there is no trace of a link between them but then he wouldnt leave one hes far too clever for that for a start she could have used it herself you are looking at the wrong enemy cornwallis said with a rising note of excitement in his voice it was almost as if he was reliving one of his battles at sea lining up the opposing ship to fire the broadside that would hole her below the waterline wetron we shouldnt aim at either one but make them attack each other tellman scowled how pitt felt a leap of triumph again and turned to stifle it in case it flared up out of control and the darkness afterwards was too deep to bear wetron is an ambitious man cornwallis said again but this time with a new intensity if he could solve the southampton row murder in a spectacular way personally taking the credit for it it would enhance his position make him strong enough no one could challenge him in bow street and perhaps build a rung higher in the ladder the next major step up would be cornwalliss own job pitt felt a tug of emotion that cornwallis could not have been unaware of such a risk and yet looking at him leaning his elbows on the kitchen table there was not a shadow of hesitation in him find cartouche cornwallis said if it was wetron who worked out who he was and trapped him and forced from him the secret of the blackmail perhaps even to implicate voiseywhich might be possible with rose serracold being one of the other victims and kingsley the third dangerous pitt warned but the blood was beginning to beat in his pulses and he felt alive again quickened inside and something like hope at the edge of his mind cornwallis smiled very slightly more a baring of the teeth he used wray let us use him again the poor man is beyond being hurt anymore even his reputation is ruined if they bring in a verdict of suicide his life will be rendered almost meaningless in the sense he valued a black rage hardened in pitt at that thought yes i should very much like to use wray he said between clenched jaws no one knows what i said to him or he to me and since i cannot prove i did not threaten him neither can they deny anything i say he told me he too leaned forward across the table he had no idea who cartouche was but no one else knows that what if i say that he did and he told me and that it was cartouches identity which so distressed him his mind was racing now and that maude herself knew in spite of all his precautions and she left a note of it somewhere hidden in her papers we searched the house but we did not understand what we saw now with wrays information we will then cartouche will come to look for it and destroy it if he knows tellman finished except how will we make sure he hears will wetron tell him wetron doesnt know who he is or hed he stopped confused newspapers cornwallis replied ill make sure the newspapers print it tomorrow the case is still headlines because of wrays death i can make cartouche think he has to get back maude lamonts notes on him or hell be exposed it doesnt matter what his secret is what are you going to tell wetron tellman asked frowning he was puzzled but the eagerness to act burned in him his eyes were bright you are cornwallis corrected report back to him as you ordinarily would that the circle is about to be completed voisey through money to maude lamont through blackmail to kingsley and cartouche to destroy voiseys opponent back to voisey and that you are about to get the proof then he will call the press but he must believe it or they wont print it tellman swallowed and nodded slowly wray will still be buried as a suicide pitt said and found even putting words to it painful i i find it hard to believe that he would not after he had endured his grief and but he could imagine it no matter how brave one was there were some pains that became unendurable in the darkest moments of the night maybe he could manage most of the time when there were people around something to do even sunlight the beauty of flowers anyone else who cared but alone in the dark too tired to fight anymore he was deeply loved and admired cornwallis was struggling to find a better answer himself perhaps he will have friends in the church who will use influence to see that he is never named as such but you didnt hound him tellman protested why would he give in now its against his faith it was some kind of poison pitt told him how could he do that by accident and it wasnt natural causes but another thought was stirring in his mind a wild possibility perhaps voisey wasnt using a perfect chance given him perhaps he murdered wray or at least caused him to be murdered his revenge was only complete if wray was dead with wray miserable haunted by gossip and fear violated i appear a villain but if he is dead that is far better then i am irredeemable surely voisey would not hesitate at the final act he didnt in whitechapel his sister cornwallis said with genuine horror he used her to poison wray she may have had no idea what she was doing pitt pointed out and there was virtually no chance of her getting caught as far as she knew she was no more than a witness to my cruelty to an old and vulnerable man how do we prove it tellman said thinlipped us knowing it is no good it only adds to the flavor of his victory if we actually know what happened and still cant do a damn thing about it an autopsy pitt said it was the only thing that seemed an answer theyd never do it cornwallis shook his head no one wants it the church will be afraid it would prove suicide which theyll do all they can to protect him from and voisey will be afraid it will prove murder or at least raise the question pitt stood up therell be a way ill make one ill go to see lady vespasia if anyone can force the issue she will know who it is and how to find him he looked at cornwallis then at tellman thank you he said with sudden overwhelming gratitude thank you for coming neither of them answered each in his own way confused for words they did not seek or want gratitude only to help tellman went straight back to bow street it was a quarter past ten in the morning the desk sergeant called out to him but he barely heard he went straight up the stairs to wetrons office which had once been pitts it was extraordinary to think that had been only a few months ago now it was an alien place the man in it an enemy that idea had come easily he was startled to realize that it had taken no effort of mind to accommodate it he knocked and after a few moments heard wetrons voice telling him to come in good morning sir he said when he was inside and the door closed behind him morning tellman wetron looked up from his desk at first sight he seemed an ordinary man middle height mousy coloring only when you looked at his eyes did you realize the strength in him the undeviating will to succeed tellman swallowed he began the lie i saw pitt this morning he told me what he actually said to mr wray and why wray was so distressed wetron looked up at him his face bleak i think the sooner you dissociate yourself and this police force from mr pitt the better inspector i shall issue a statement to the newspapers that he no longer has anything whatever to do with the metropolitan police and we take no responsibility for his actions hes special branchs problem let them get him out of this if they can the mans a disaster tellman stood rigid the fury inside him ready to explode every injustice hed ever seen like a red haze inside him im sure youre right sir but i think you ought to know what he learned before you do that he ignored wetrons impatience signaled in his flicking fingers and the crease between his brows it seems mr wray knew who the third visitor was at maude lamonts the night she was murdered he took a shaky breath because it was someone of his acquaintance another churchman i think what now he had wetrons entire attention even if not his belief tellman met his eyes without flinching yes sir apparently theres something in the womans notes miss lamont i mean which could prove it now we know who she meant what is it man wetron demanded dont stand there talking in riddles thats it sir mr pitt cant be sure until he sees the papers in miss lamonts home he hurried on before wetron could interrupt him again forcing his voice to rise as if in excitement itll still be hard to prove it but if we were to tell the newspapers that we have the information of course we dont need to mention mr pitt if you dont think its a good idea then whoever this man is and he is probably the one who killed her then he may very well betray himself by going to southampton row yes yes tellman you dont need to spell it out for me wetron said sharply i understand what you are suggesting let me give it some thought yes sir well keep pitt out of it i think you should go to southampton row after all its your case he made the point deliberately watching tellmans face tellman made himself smile yes sir i dont know why special branch got involved with it at all unless of course it was because of sir charles voisey wetron sat very still what has it to do with voisey youre not imagining the man implicated by the cartouche was voisey are you there was heavy ridicule in his tone and the curl of his smile was bitter tinged with mockery and regret oh no sir tellman said quickly were pretty sure that maude lamont was blackmailing at least some of her clients certainly the three that were there the night she was killed over what wetron asked carefully different things but not for money for certain behavior in the present political campaign that was helpful to sir charles voisey wetrons eyes widened indeed thats a rather odd accusation tellman i suppose you are aware of exactly who sir charles is yes sir hes a most distinguished appeal court judge who is now standing for a seat in parliament he was recently knighted by her majesty but i dont know exactly what for except word has it that it was something remarkably brave he said it with reverence and watched wetrons lips tighten and the muscles stand out cordhard on his neck perhaps lady vespasia was right and has pitt got some reason to believe all this wetron asked yes sir tellman kept his voice perfectly level not too assured there is some very definite connecting link it all makes a lot of sense were that far from it he held up his finger and thumb about an inch apart we just need to flush this man out and then we can prove it murders a very nasty crime indeed any way you want to look at it and this one especially choked the woman looks like he put his knee in her chest and forced this stuff down her throat until she died yes you dont need to be graphic inspector wetron said tartly ill call the press and tell them you get on with finding the proof you need he bent to the paper he had been reading before he was interrupted it was dismissal yes sir tellman stood to attention then turned on his heel he did not breathe a sigh of relief or allow his body to let go of the tension and shiver until he was halfway down the stairs again chapter thirteen pitt returned immediately to vespasia this time writing a note which he handed to the maid then he waited in the morning room he believed vespasia was one person who would refrain from judging his part in wrays death but he could not bring himself to assume it before he had seen her he waited pacing the floor his hands sweating his breath ragged he spun around when the morning room door opened expecting the maid to tell him either that lady vespasia would see him or that she would not but it was vespasia herself who was there she came in and closed the door behind her shutting out the servants and from the look on her face the rest of the world good morning thomas i assume you have come because you have some plan of battle and a part in it for me you had better tell me what it is are we to fight alone or do we have allies her use of the plural was the most heartening thing she could have said he should never have doubted her regardless of what the press wrote or what the odds against them might be it was not modesty on his part it was lack of faith yes captain cornwallis and inspector tellman good and what are we to do she sat down in one of the large rosepink morning room chairs and indicated another for him he told her the plan such as it was which they had formulated around his kitchen table she listened in silence until he had finished an autopsy she said at last that will not be easy he was a man not only revered but actually loved no one apart from voisey will wish to see him named a suicide even though that is already the assumption i imagine the church will endeavor to leave the exact verdict open and at least tacitly assume some kind of misadventure in the belief that the less that is said the sooner it will be forgotten and there is considerable discretion and kindness in that she looked at him very steadily are you prepared for the discovery that he did in fact take his own life thomas no he said honestly but nothing i feel about it is going to alter the truth and i think i need to know it i really dont believe he took his own life but i admit it is possible i think voisey contrived his death using his sister almost certainly without her knowledge and you believe an autopsy will indicate that you may be right anyway as you will no doubt agree we have little else she rose to her feet stiffly i do not have the influence to force such a thing myself but i believe somerset carlisle does the faintest smile flickered over her face and lit her silvergray eyes you no doubt remember him from that farcical tragedy in resurrection row among the thugs she did not go on to mention his bizarre part in it it was something neither of them would forget if any man on earth would be willing to risk his reputation for a cause in which he believed it was carlisle pitt smiled back for a moment memory erasing the present time had bleached the horror from those events and left only the black humor and the passion which had compelled that extraordinary man to act as he had yes he agreed with fervor yes well ask him vespasia rather liked the telephone it was one of several inventions to have become generally available to those with the means to afford it and it was reasonably useful in a mere quarter of an hour she was able to ascertain that carlisle was at his club in pall mallwhere of course ladies were not admittedbut that he would leave forthwith and go to the savoy hotel where he would receive them as soon as they arrived actually with the state of the traffic as it was and the time of the day it was almost an hour later when pitt and vespasia were shown into the private sitting room that carlisle had engaged for the purpose he rose to his feet the instant they were shown in elegant a little gaunt now his unusual eyebrows still giving his face a faintly quizzical look as soon as they were seated and appropriate refreshments had been ordered vespasia came straight to the point no doubt you have read the newspapers and are aware of thomass situation you may not be aware that it has been carefully and extremely cleverly arranged by a man whose intense desire is to be revenged for a recent very grave defeat i cannot tell you what it was only that he is powerful and dangerous and has managed to salvage from the wreck of his previous ambition a new one only slightly less ruinous to the country carlisle asked no questions as to what it might be he was well acquainted with the need for absolute discretion he regarded pitt levelly for several moments perhaps seeing the weariness in him and the marks of the despair so close under the surface what is it you want from me he asked very seriously it was vespasia who answered an autopsy of the body of the reverend francis wray carlisle gulped for an instant he was thrown off balance vespasia gave a tiny smile if it were easy my dear i should not have needed to ask for your assistance the poor man is going to be regarded as a suicide although of course the church will never permit it to be said in so many words they will speak of unfortunate accidents and bury him properly but people will still believe he took his own life and that is necessary to the plan of our enemy otherwise his revenge upon thomas fails to have effect yes i see that carlisle agreed no one can have driven him to suicide unless there is believed to have been one people will assume the church is concealing it as a matter of loyalty which will probably be the truth he turned to pitt what do you believe happened i think he was murdered pitt replied i doubt there was an accident which timed itself to the hour to suit their purposes i dont know if an autopsy will prove that but it is the only chance we have carlisle thought in silence for several minutes and neither pitt nor vespasia interrupted him they glanced at each other and then away again and waited carlisle looked up if you are prepared to abide by the result whatever it is i believe i know a way to persuade the local coroner that it must be done he smiled a little sourly it will entail a certain elasticity of the truth but i have shown a skill in that area before i think the less you know about it thomas the better you never had any talent in that direction at all in fact it worries me more than a little that special branch is desperate enough to employ you you are the last man cut out to succeed in this kind of work i heard you may have been drafted merely to give them a more respectable face in that case they have failed spectacularly pitt replied with a considerable edge to his voice nonsense vespasia snapped he was dismissed out of bow street because the inner circle wanted one of their own men there there is nothing subtle or devious about it at all special branch was simply available and not in a position to refuse she rose to her feet thank you somerset i assume that as well as the necessity for this autopsy you are also aware of the urgency tomorrow would be good the longer this slander against thomas is around the more people will hear it and the work of undoing it will become a great deal more difficult also of course there is the matter of the election once the polls close there are certain things it becomes very difficult to abrogate carlisle opened his mouth and then closed it again you are utterly reliable lady vespasia he said rising also i swear you are the only person since i was twenty who can totally wrongfoot me and you never fail to do it i have always admired you but it completely escapes me why i also like you because you have no desire to be comfortable my dear she replied without hesitation more than a month or two and you become bored she smiled at him utterly charmingly as if she had given him a great compliment and extended her hand for him to kiss which he did with grace then she took pitts arm and with head high walked out into the corridor and the main foyer they were about halfway across when pitt quite clearly saw voisey excuse himself from a group of passersby and walk towards them he was half smiling supremely confident pitt knew from his face that he had come to taste victory to savor it and roll it around his tongue he had very possibly arranged to be here precisely for that purpose what was revenge worth if you did not see your enemys pain and in this instance he not only had pitt he had vespasia as well voisey could never have forgiven her for the crucial part she had played not only in the whitechapel defeat but in using all her influence to gain him his knighthood perhaps ruining pitt was as much to hurt her as it was to hurt him and now he could watch them both lady vespasia he said with extreme courtesy what a pleasure to see you how loyal of you to take mr pitt to luncheon so publicly at this unfortunate time i do admire loyalty and the more expensive it is the more valuable without waiting for her to reply he turned to pitt perhaps you will be able to find a position away from london i would advise it after your recent unfortunate behavior with poor francis wray somewhere in the country if your wife and family have taken a liking to dartmoor perhaps that would do although harford is much too small to require a policeman it is barely a village more of a hamlet a mere two or three streets and very isolated up there on the edge of ugborough moor i doubt they have ever seen a crime let alone a murder it was murder you specialized in wasnt it still i suppose that might change he smiled turned to vespasia and then continued on his way pitt stood frozen the cold running through him like a tide drowning from the inside he was barely aware of the room around him even of vespasias hand on his arm voisey knew where charlotte was he could reach out at any time and destroy her pitts heart contracted inside him he could barely breathe he heard vespasias voice from a long way off her words indistinct thomas time had no meaning thomas the grip tightened on his arm fingers digging into him she spoke his name for the third time yes we must leave here she said firmly we are beginning to draw attention to ourselves he knows where charlotte is he turned to look at her ive got to get her away ive got to no my dear her hand held on to him with all her strength you have got to stay here and fight charles voisey if you are here then his attention will remain here send that young man tellman to take charlotte and your family somewhere else as discreetly as possible voisey needs to win the election and he also needs to guard himself against your effort to find out the truth of francis wrays death and to watch and see what you learn about the man you have named as cartouche if voisey is indeed connected with maude lamonts death he cannot afford to delegate that to someone else you already know that he does not trust anyone to hold that power over him of having known the ultimate secret she was right and when pitts mind cleared again and he faced reality he knew it also but there was no time to waste he must find tellman immediately and be sure that he would go to devon even as the thoughts were in his mind he put his hand into his pocket to see what money he had tellman would need his rail fare to devon and back again certainly and he would need money to move the family also and to find a new and safer place for them they could not come back to london yet he had no idea when that would be it was impossible to plan that far ahead or to see how he could even make it safe for them vespasia understood the gesture and the need she opened her reticule and took out all the money she had he was startled how much it was nearly twenty pounds with the four pounds seventeen shillings he had plus a few odd pennies it would be enough wordlessly she passed it to him thank you he accepted this was no time for pride or burden of gratitude she must know that he felt it more profoundly than could be conveyed my carriage she directed we must find tellman we my dear thomas you are not leaving me in the savoy penniless to find my own way home while you go pursuing the cause oh no do you no i do not she said decisively you may require every penny let us proceed we also should use every minute where will he be what is his most urgent task we have not time to search half of london for him pitt disciplined his mind to remember exactly what tellman had been sent to do first he would have gone to bow street to speak with wetron that might have taken no more than an hour at the most unless wetron were not there then since ostensibly his greatest concern was the identity of cartouche he would have done something to appear to be following that pitt had not mentioned bishop underhill to tellman it was only a deduction based upon the bishops attacks against aubrey serracold where to vespasia enquired as he handed her up into her carriage and then climbed in after her and sat down he must answer with something would tellman have told anyone in bow street where he was going perhaps not but it was a chance he should not overlook bow street he replied when they got there he excused himself and went straight to the desk sergeant do you know where inspector tellman is he asked trying to keep the panic out of his voice yes sir the man replied immediately it was clear in his face that he had seen the newspapers and his concern was genuine and more than that sympathetic he had known pitt many years and he believed what he knew not what he read e said as e were goin ter see some o that spirit mediums other clients e said as if yer was ter come by for any reason an ask sir as i was ter tell yer where e wos he regarded pitt anxiously and produced a list of addresses written on a sheet torn from a notebook pitt gave a prayer of thanks for tellmans intelligence then thanked the desk sergeant so sincerely the man colored with pleasure back in the carriage weak with mounting relief he showed the paper to vespasia and asked her if she would rather be taken home before he began to follow the trail certainly not she said briskly please get on with it tellman had already checked on lena forrests story of visiting her friend in newington and found that she had indeed been there although mrs lightfoot had only the vaguest ideas of time now he was retracing his steps with maude lamonts other clients simply in the vague hope of learning something more about her methods which might lead him to cartouche he had little expectation of success but he must appear to wetron to be following it with urgency previously he had regarded wetron as no more than the man who had replaced pitt by chance more than design he resented him for it but knew that it was not wetrons fault someone had to take the position he did not like wetron his personality seemed to be calculating and too remote from the emotions of anger and pity that tellman was used to in pitt but then whoever it had been would not have pleased him now he suddenly perceived wetron in an entirely different way he was not a colorless career officer he was a dangerous enemy to be regarded in an acutely personal light any man who could rise to leadership in the inner circle was brave ruthless and extremely ambitious he was also clever enough to have outwitted even voisey or he would be no threat to him only a fool would leave any act or word unguarded therefore tellman set about appearing to pursue cartouche after having left a list of the places he would be with the desk sergeant in case pitt should want him for anything to do with the real issues that mattered he was listening to a mrs drayton recounting her last seance which had produced manifestations so dramatic as to astound maude lamont herself when the butler interrupted them to say that a mr pitt had called to see mr tellman and the matter was so urgent that he regretted it could not await their convenience send him in mrs drayton said before tellman could excuse himself to leave the butler naturally obeyed and a moment later pitt was in the room looking whitefaced and hardly able to keep still really completely remarkable mr tellman mrs drayton said enthusiastically i mean miss lamont had not expected such a display herself i could see the amazement in her face even fear her voice rose with excitement it was at that moment that i absolutely truly knew she had the power i confess i had wondered once or twice before if it could have been faked but this wasnt the look in her eyes was proof to me yes thank you mrs drayton tellman said rather abruptly it all seemed terribly unimportant now they had found the lever on the table a simple mechanical trick he stared at pitt knowing that something of great and terrible urgency had happened excuse me mrs drayton pitt said his voice husky i am afraid i require inspector tellman to undertake something else now oh but she began pitt probably had no intention of dismissing her but he was beyond the point of patience thank you mrs drayton good day tellman followed him outside and saw vespasias carriage at the curb and the glimpse of her profile inside voisey knows where charlotte and the family are pitt could contain himself no longer he named the village tellman felt the sweat break out on his body and his chest tighten until he could hardly breathe he cared about charlotte of course he did but if voisey sent anyone after charlotte it would mean gracie would be hurt as well and it was the thought of that which filled his mind and drenched him with horror the idea of gracie hurt crushed the specter of a world without her was so terrible he could not bear it it was as if happiness would never again be possible he heard pitts voice as if from miles away he was holding out something in his hand i wish you to go down to devon today now and take them somewhere safe tellman blinked it was money pitt was giving him yes he said grasping it but i dont know where they are harford pitt replied take the great western as far as ivybridge from there its only a couple of miles to harford its a small village ask and youll find them youd better take them to one of the nearby towns where youll be anonymous find lodgings where there are lots of other people and stay with them at least until after the election results for voisey it wont be very long he knew what he was asking and what it might cost tellman when wetron found out and he asked anyway right tellman agreed it did not even occur to him to question it he took the money then climbed into the carriage beside vespasia and as soon as pitt was in also they drove to the railway terminus for the great western with the briefest farewell tellman was on his way to purchase his ticket and get onto the next train it was a nightmare journey simply because it seemed to take forever mile after mile of countryside rattled past the windows of the carriage the sun began to sink in the west and the lateafternoon light deepened and still they were nowhere near their destination tellman stood up and stretched his cramped legs but there was nothing to do except sway adjusting his weight and balance watch the hills and valleys steepen and then flatten out again then sit down and wait longer he had not stopped to pack clean shirts or socks or linen in fact he did not even have a razor a comb or a toothbrush none of that mattered it was just easier to think of the small things than of the larger ones how would he defend them if voisey sent someone to attack them what if when he got there they were already gone how would he find them that was too terrible to bear and yet he could not drive it from his thoughts he stared out of the window surely they were in devon by now they had been traveling for hours he noticed how red the earth was quite unlike the soil around london that he was used to the land looked vast and in the distance ahead even in high summer there was something forbidding about it the tracks stretched over the graceful span of a viaduct for a moment the sheer daring of having built such a thing amazed him then he realized the train was slowing they were reaching a station ivybridge this was it at last he threw the door open and almost tripped in his haste to reach the platform the evening light was long shadows stretching two and three times the length of the objects that cast them the horizon to the west burned in a blaze of color so brilliant it hurt his eyes to look at it when he turned away he was blinded can i help you sir he blinked and swiveled around he was facing a man in the extremely smart uniform of a stationmaster and who obviously took his position with great seriousness yes tellman said urgently i have to get to harford as soon as possible within the next half hour it is an emergency i must hire a vehicle of some sort and have the use of it for a day at least where can i begin ah the stationmaster scratched his head setting his cap crooked what sort of a vehicle would you be wanting sir tellman could barely contain his impatience it took a monumental effort not to shout at the man anything its an emergency the stationmaster seemed to remain unmoved in that case sir mr callard down at the end of the road he pointed helpfully he might have something otherwise theres old mr drysdale up the other way bout a mile and a half he has the odd dray or the like that he can sometimes spare something faster than that would be better and i havent time to walk in both directions to find it tellman replied trying to keep the panic and the temper out of his voice then youd best walk to the left down that way the stationmaster pointed again ask mr callard if he doesnt have anything hell maybe know someone who does thank you tellman called over his shoulder as he already began moving away the road was downhill slightly and he strode out as fast as he could and kept up the pace when he reached the yard it took him another five minutes to locate the proprietor who seemed as unmoved by any sense of haste as the stationmaster had been however the sight of vespasias money drew his attention and he found he did have a fairly light cart still capable of carrying half a dozen people and a good enough horse to pull it he took an exorbitant deposit which tellman resented until he realized that he had no idea how or when he was going to return the vehicle and that his skill at driving it was absolutely minimal in fact even climbing up onto the seat was awkward and he heard callard muttering under his breath as he turned away tellman very gingerly encouraged the horse to move and then guided the cart out of the yard and along the road he had been told led to the village of harford half an hour later he was knocking on the door of appletree cottage it was dark and he could see the lights on through the cracks in the curtains at the window he had met no one else on the road except one man in a dray cart from whom he had asked directions now he stood on the step acutely aware of the intense darkness around him the sharp smell of the wind off the open stretch of the moor he could no longer see away to the north it was no more than a denser black against the occasional stars it was a different world from the city and he felt alien to it at a loss to know what to do or how to cope there was no one else to turn to pitt had entrusted him with rescuing the women and children how on earth was he going to be equal to it he had no idea what to do who is it a voice demanded from behind the door it was gracie his heart leaped its me he shouted then added selfconsciously tellman he heard bolts withdrawn and the door open with a crash showing a candlelit interior with gracie standing in the doorway and charlotte just behind her the poker from the fireplace hanging loosely in her hand nothing could have told him more vividly that something had frightened them far more than the mere knocking on the door of a stranger he saw the fear and the question in charlottes face mr pitts all right maam he said in answer to it things are hard but hes quite safe should he tell her about wrays death and all that had happened there was nothing she could do about it it would only worry her when she should be concerned with herself and escaping from here and should he even tell them how urgent that was was it his job to protect them from fear as well as actual physical danger or would lying by omission make them act less urgently he had thought about that on the train and vacillated one way and then the other making up his mind and as quickly unmaking it why are yer ere then gracies voice cut across his thoughts if nothins wrong why arent yer in the city doin yer job oo killed the ghosty woman yer get that all sorted no he answered moving inside to allow her to close the door he looked at her pale set face and the rigidity of her body inside her handmedown country dress and he had to fight to keep the emotion down stop it from tightening his throat until he couldnt get the words out mr pitts working on it theres been another death he needs to prove isnt suicide so why arent yer doin summink about it too gracie was far from satisfied yer look like summink the cat drug in wots the matter wif yer he could see she was going to fight him all the way it was infuriating and yet so characteristic of her he felt tears sting his eyes this was ridiculous he should not allow her to do this to him mr pitt isnt satisfied this is a safe place for you he said tartly mr voisey knows where you are and im to take you somewhere else straightaway theres probably no danger but best be safe he saw the fear in charlottes face and knew that for all gracies bravado they were just as aware as pitt that the danger was real he swallowed so if youll get the children up and dressed well go tonight while its dark doesnt stay long this time of year we need to be well out of the area in three or four hours because itll be daylight by then charlotte stood motionless are you sure thomas is all right her voice was sharp edged with doubt her eyes wide if he told her it would relieve pitt from having to try to find a way when they finally got back to london and perhaps it would ease her physical fear for him voisey would never damage him now he was too precious alive to watch him suffer samuel gracie demanded sharply well he is and he isnt he replied voiseys made it look like it was mr pitts fault that this man committed suicide and he was a churchman very well liked of course it wasnt and well get to prove it that was a pretty wild piece of optimism but for now the newspapers are giving him a hard time but will you please go and get the children up and put your things into cases or whatever you brought them in we havent got time to stand here and argue it out charlotte moved to obey i suppose id better pack up the kitchen gracie said darting tellman a fierce look well dont just stand there yer look as starved as an alley cat come ave a slice o bread an jam while i pack up wot we got no sense leaving it ere an yer can carry it out ter wotever kind o cart yer got out there wot ave yer got anyway itll do he answered make me a slice and ill eat it on the way she shivered and he noticed that her hands were clenched knuckles white im sorry he said with a wave of feeling so intense his voice was husky theres no need to be afraid gracie ill look after you he reached out to touch her a stab of physical memory bringing back the moment he had kissed her when they were following after remus in the whitechapel affair i will she looked away from him and sniffed i know yer will yer daft aporth she said savagely an all of us oneman army yare now do summink useful an get these things inter a box an take em out to yer cart or wotever it is an wait put that light out afore yer open the door he froze is someone watching you i dunno but they could be couldnt they she started to take things out of the cupboards and put them into a wicker laundry basket in the dim candlelight he saw two loaves of bread a large pot of butter a leg of ham biscuits half a cake two jars of jam and other tins and boxes he couldnt name when the basket was full enough he shaded the candle with his hand opened the door and then blowing out the flame and picking up the basket he stumbled his way to the cart several times barely missing tripping over the uneven path fifteen minutes later they were all sitting wedged in edward shivering daniel half asleep jemima sitting awkwardly between gracie and charlotte her arms gripped tightly around herself tellman urged the horse forward and they began to move but the feeling was extremely different from when he had driven in now the cart was heavily laden and the night was so black it was hard to know how even the horse could find its way he also had very little idea where they were going paignton was the obvious place the first that anyone voisey employed would think to look perhaps the opposite direction was equally obvious maybe there was somewhere off to the side where else was there a station by train they could go anywhere how much money had he left they had to pay for lodgings and food as well as tickets pitt had said a town somewhere with lots of people that meant paignton or torquay but back at the ivybridge station they would be remembered all standing together waiting for the first train the stationmaster would be able to tell anyone who asked exactly where they went as if reading his thoughts even in the dark gracie spoke where are we goin then exeter he said without hesitation why she asked because it isnt really a holiday place he replied it seemed as good an answer as any other they drove in silence for a quarter of an hour the darkness and the weight of the cart made them slow but he could not urge the horse any more if it slipped or went lame they were lost they must be over a mile from harford and the cottage by now the road was not bad and the horse was finding its way with more ease tellman began to relax a little none of the difficulties he had feared had come to pass the horse pulled up abruptly tellman nearly fell off the seat and saved himself only by grabbing hold of it at the last moment gracie stifled a shriek what is it charlotte said sharply there was someone on the road ahead of them peering forward tellman could just make out the dark shape in the gloom then a voice spoke quite clearly only a yard or so away now where are you going at this time o the night mistress pitt isnt it from harford way you shouldnt be out at this hour get lost you will or have an accident it was a mans voice deep and with a lift of sarcasm to it tellman heard gracie gasp with fear the fact that the man had used charlottes name meant that he knew them was it intended as a threat was he the watcher who had told voisey where they were the horse shook its head as if someone were holding its bridle the darkness prevented tellman from seeing he hoped it also prevented the man from seeing him how did he know who they were he must have been watching and ridden ahead knowing they would come this way if he had seen tellman go to the cottage door and then carry the boxes out then it meant he had been there all the time he had to be voiseys man he had come ahead of them here into this lonely stretch of road between harford and ivybridge to catch them where there was no one to see or to help and there was no oneexcept tellman everything rested with him what could he use for a weapon he remembered packing a bottle of vinegar it was half empty but there was enough in it still to give it weight but he darent ask gracie for it aloud the man would hear him and he did not know how she had stacked the basket he leaned over and whispered in her ear vinegar wha oh she understood she slid back a little and started feeling for the bottle tellman made some move himself to cover the sounds climbing off the box and slithering down the side of the cart until his feet touched the ground he felt his way around to the back hand over hand on the rough wood and was coming around on the other side when he made out in the gloom the figure of a man ahead of him then he felt a smooth weight against his forearm and gracies breath on his cheek he took the vinegar bottle from her hand he could see the dark shape of charlotte with her arms around the children its you again gracies voice came clearly from just beside him but she was speaking to the man at the horses head drawing his attention wot yer doin out ere in the middle o the night then were goin cos we got a family emergency yer got one too ave yer thats a shame the man replied the expression in his voice impossible to read going back to london then we never said we come from london gracie challenged him but tellman could hear the fear in her the slight quiver the higher pitch he was only a yard away from the man now the vinegar bottle was heavy in his hand he swung it back and as if he had caught the movement in the corner of his eye the man swiveled and shot out his fist sending tellman sprawling backwards onto the ground the vinegar bottle flying out of his grasp and rolling away on the grass oh no you dont mister the man said his voice suddenly altered to a vicious anger and the next moment tellman felt a tremendous weight on top of him knocking the air out of his lungs he was no match for the man in strength and he knew it but he had grown up in the streets and the instinct to survive was above almost everything else the only thing greater was the passion to protect gracie and of course charlotte and the children he kneed the man in the groin and heard him gasp then poked at his eyes with stiff fingers or at any piece of flesh he could reach the fight was short intense and absolute it was only moments later that his hands reached the unbroken vinegar bottle and he finished the job cracking the man over the head with it and laying him senseless he scrambled to his feet and staggered around to where the other horse was standing with a dogcart pulled across the track and led it off onto the side then he ran back and with difficulty in the dark took the bridle of their own horse and led it past before climbing up onto the box again and urging it forward as fast as it was capable of going the east was already fading a little ahead of them and dawn would not be far away thank you charlotte said quietly holding a shivering jemima close to her and daniel by the other hand edward was clinging on at the farther end i think he has been watching us almost since we got here charlotte did not add anything further or mention voiseys name or the inner circle it was in all their minds yes gracie agreed a quiet pride in her voice and in the stiff squareshouldered way she sat thank you samuel tellman was bruised his blood was beating so hard he was dizzy but above all he was astounded by the savagery which had driven him he had behaved like something primitive and it was exhilarating and frightening youre going to stay in exeter until the election is over and we know whether voisey has won or lost he answered no i think i shall return to london charlotte contradicted if they are blaming thomas for this mans death then i should be there with him youre to stay here tellman said flatly thats an order ill send a telephone message to mr pitt to say as youre all right and safe inspector tellman i she began its an order he said again sorry but thats the end of it yes samuel gracie murmured charlotte tightened her arms around jemima and said nothing more chapter fourteen isadora sat at the breakfast table across from the bishop and watched him toy with his food pushing bacon eggs sausage and kidney around his plate he did not look well but then he so often complained of some minor ailment and she knew that if she asked him he would tell her she would be required in ordinary civility to listen and to offer some condolence kindness dictated she do more than that and she could not bring herself to feel such a thing so she ate her own breakfast of toast and marmalade and avoided his eyes the butler brought in the morning newspaper and the bishop motioned him to lay it on the table at his end where he could reach it in a moment or two when he was ready take my plate away he directed yes my lord is there something else you would prefer the butler asked solicitously doing as he was bidden i am sure cook would oblige no thank you the bishop declined im not hungry just pour the tea would you yes my lord again he did as he was bidden and then discreetly withdrew are you feeling unwell isadora asked before checking herself it was so much habit with her that it required a conscious effort not to do so the news is depressing he answered but without picking up the paper the liberals will win and gladstone will form a government again but it wont last but then nothing does she must make the effort she had promised him and she sensed the fear in him across the table as if it were an odor in the air governments dont last but neither should they she said gently the good things do youve preached that all your life you know its true and the things that are destroyed but in righteousness god can rebuild isnt that what the resurrection is all about that is the idea the hope he replied but his voice was flat and he did not look up at her is it not the truth she thought that by provoking him into arguing it the sound of his own words would strengthen him he would realize that he did believe it really i have no idea he answered instead it is a habit of thought i repeat it over and over every sunday because it is my job i cant afford to stop but i dont know that i believe it any more than the members of my congregation who come because it is the thing to be seen to do kneel in your pew every sunday repeat all the prayers sing all the hymns and look as if you are listening to the sermon and you will seem to be a good man your mind can be anywhere on your neighbors wife or his goods or relishing his sins and who will know god will know she said startled by the anger in her voice and quite apart from that you will know yourself there are millions of us isadora do you suppose god has nothing better to do than listen to our witterings i want this and give me that bless so and so which will release me of the necessity of doing anything about him those are the sort of orders i give my servants which is why we have them in the first place so we dont have to do everything ourselves his face twisted with disgust that isnt worship its a ritual performed for ourselves and to impress each other what kind of a god wants that or has any use for it at all there was contempt in his eyes and anger as if he had been let down unfairly and was just realizing the fullness of it who decided that it was what god wanted she asked he was startled it is what the church has done for the best part of two thousand years he retorted in fact always i thought it was only meant to be the instrument of our growth she replied to him not an end in itself his brow creased with irritation sometimes you talk the most arrant nonsense isadora i am a bishop ordained of god dont try to tell me what the church is for you make yourself ridiculous if you are ordained of god then you should not doubt him she snapped but if you are ordained of man then perhaps you should be looking for what god wishes instead it may not be the same at all his face froze he sat motionless for a moment then leaned over and picked up the newspaper holding it high enough to hide behind francis wray committed suicide he said after a few moments it seems that damned policeman pitt was hounding him over the murder of the spirit medium imagining he knew something about it stupid man she was horrified she remembered pitt he had been one of cornwalliss men one he was particularly fond of her first thought was for how it would hurt cornwallis for the injustice if it were not true and for the disillusion if by some terrible chance it were why on earth would he think that she said aloud heaven knows he sounded final as if that closed the matter well what do they say she demanded youve got it in front of you he was irritated that was yesterdays paper theres very little about it today what did they say she insisted what are they blaming pitt for why would he think francis wray of all people would know anything about a spirit medium it really doesnt matter he replied without lowering the paper and pitt was quite wrong anyway wray had nothing to do with it that has been proved and he refused to say anything further she poured a second cup of tea and drank it in silence then she heard his suddenly indrawn breath and a gasp the paper slid from his hands and fell in loose sheets in his lap and over his plate his face was ashen what is it she said with alarm afraid he was having some kind of attack whats happened have you pain reginald shall she stopped he was struggling to his feet i i have to go out he mumbled he thrashed at the newspaper sending the sheets slithering to the floor rattling together but you have the reverend williams coming in half an hour she protested hes come all the way from brighton tell him to wait he flapped a hand at her where are you going she was on her feet also reginald where are you going not far he said from the doorway tell him to wait there was no use asking anymore he was not going to tell her it had to be something in the newspaper which had created such a panic of emotion in him she bent and picked it up starting her search on the second page roughly where she guessed he had been reading she saw it almost immediately it was an announcement by the police on the maude lamont case there had been three clients at her house on southampton row for the last seance she had given two of them were named in her diary of engagements the third had been represented by a little drawing a pictograph or cartouche it was like a small f hastily written under a half circle or to isadoras eye a bishops crozier under a roughly drawn hillunderhill the police said that there was something in maude lamonts papers which indicated that she had known who the third man was and that he like the other two had been blackmailed by her they were close to a breakthrough and when they read her diaries again with this new understanding they would have the identity of cartouche and of her murderer the bishop had gone to southampton row she knew it as surely as if she had followed him there he was the one who had gone to maude lamonts seances hoping to find some kind of proof that there was life after death that his spirit would live on in a form he could recognize it was not extinction that awaited him but merely change all the christian teachings of his lifetime had built no sure faith in him in his desperation he had turned to a spirit medium with her table rappings levitation ectoplasm far worse than that which held more horror doubt and weakness and which she could understand only too easily he had known fear loneliness souldeep even the hollow consuming well of despair but he had done it secretly and even when maude lamont had been murdered he had not come forward he had allowed francis wray to be suspected of being the third person and to have his reputation ruined and now pitts as well her anger and her contempt for him burned in a pain that ran through her mind and body consuming her she sat down suddenly in his chair the newspaper dropped onto the table still open at the article it had been proved that francis wray was not the third person but too late to save his grief or his sense that all his lifes meaning had been denied as far as those who had loved and cherished him could see too late above all to prevent him from committing the irretrievable act of taking his own life could she ever forgive reginald for his part in letting that happen for his utter cowardice what was she going to do reginald was even now going to southampton row to see if he could find and destroy the evidence that implicated him what loyalty did she owe him he was doing something she believed to be profoundly wrong it was hypocritical and ugly but it was largely his own destruction rather than anyone elses worse he had allowed francis wray to be blamed for long enough to destroy him to be the last weight of misery on top of his grief which had broken him perhaps not only for this life but for the life to come although she could not accept that god would condemn forever any man or woman who had finally broken perhaps only for one fatal instant beneath something too great for them to bear it could not be undone wray was gone the degree of sin in his death was beyond anyone to alter if the church concealed it and gave him a decent burial that would redeem him to the world but it altered none of the truth what was her deepest loyalty now how far along the road of his cowardice did she have to go with her husband not all the way you did not owe it to anyone to drown yourself along with him and yet she was perfectly sure that he would regard it as betrayal whenever she left him did he know who had killed maude lamont was it even imaginable that he had done it himself surely not no he was shallow selfimportant condescending totally absorbed in his own feelings and oblivious of the joy or the pain of anyone else and he was a coward but he would not have committed any of the open sins the ones that even he could not deny because they were against the law of the land and he would be forced to conceal them even he could not justify murdering maude lamont no matter what she had blackmailed him for but he might know who had and why the police must know the truth she had no idea how to contact pitt at special branch and the new commander of bow street was a stranger to her she needed to speak to someone she knew this was going to be agonizing enough without trying to explain to a stranger she would go to cornwallis he would begin halfway towards understanding now that she had made up her mind she did not hesitate it hardly mattered what she wore simply that she composed her mind to speak sensibly and to tell only the truth she knew and allow him to make all deductions she must not permit her anger or her contempt to show through or the bitterness that welled up inside her there must be no manipulation of emotions she must tell him as one person to another no more and with no reminder however subtle of what either of them might feel cornwallis was in his office but occupied with someone she asked if she might wait and nearly half an hour later she was taken up by a constable and found cornwallis standing in the middle of his room waiting for her the constable closed the door behind her and she remained standing cornwallis opened his mouth to say something the conventional greeting to give himself time to adjust to her presence and then before he could speak he saw the pain in her eyes he took half a step forward what is it she stood where she was keeping the distance between them this must be done carefully and without ever losing her selfcontrol this morning something occurred which makes me believe that i know who the third person was who visited maude lamont on the night of her death she began he was indicated only by the little drawing which looks rather like a small f with a semicircle over the top now it was too late to retreat she had committed herself what would he think of her that she was disloyal he probably regarded that as the ultimate human sin one does not betray ones own no matter what the circumstances she stared at him and could read nothing of what was in his face he looked at the chair as if to invite her to sit down then changed his mind what was it that happened he asked the police have issued a statement saying that they believe maude lamont knew the identity of that person she replied she was blackmailing him and there are papers still in her house in southampton row together with the information that mr pitt gathered from the reverend francis wray her voice dropped at mention of wrays name and for all her intentions not to allow it her anger came through it will make his identity plain yes he agreed frowning superintendent wetron told the press she took a deep breath she wished she could control the lurching of her heart and the dizziness in her the sheer physical reactions that were going to let her down when my husband read that at the breakfast table he went completely white she continued and then he rose and said that he was canceling his appointments this morning and has left the house put like that it sounded absurd as if she wanted to believe it was reginald that was proof of nothing at all except what was going on in her own mind no wife who loved her husband would have leaped to such a conclusion cornwallis must see thatand despise her for it did he think she was trying to create some excuse to leave reginald that was terrible she must make him understand that she truly believed it and that it had come to her only slowly and reluctantly he is ill she said jerkily im sorry he murmured he looked terribly awkward not knowing whether to offer any more sympathy as if it were an irrelevance he is afraid he is dying she hurried on i mean really very afraid i suppose i should have realized years ago now she was speaking too quickly words falling over each other all the signs were there if id been looking but it never occurred to me he preached so vividly sometimes with such power that was true at least it was how she remembered it her voice dropped but he has no belief in god now when it really matters he is not sure if there is anything beyond the grave that is why he went to a spirit medium to try to contact a dead person any dead person just to know they were there he looked stunned she could see it in his face his unblinking eyes the line of his lips he had no idea what to say to her was it pity that silenced him or disgust she felt both herself and shame because reginald was her husband however far apart they were in thought or care they were still tied together by the years they had been married perhaps she could have helped him if she had loved him enough perhaps the depth of the love she longed for had nothing to do with it common humanity for a fellow being should have reached across the gulf and offered something it was too late now of course when she knew who he was that gave her the means to blackmail him her voice was now little more than a whisper she felt the color hot in her cheeks church of england bishop goes to spirit medium to seek proof of life after death hed be a laughingstock it would ruin him as she said it she realized just how much that was true would he have killed to prevent it she had started out quite sure that that was impossiblebut was it if his reputation were gone what had he left how far had his illness and the fear of death unbalanced his mind fear can warp almost anything only love was strong enough to overcome it and did reginald really love anything well enough for that im so sorry cornwallis said with a break in his voice i i wish i could he stopped staring at her helplessly not knowing what to do with his hands arent you going to to do something she asked if he finds the evidence hell destroy it thats what hes gone for he shook his head there isnt any he answered quietly we put it in the paper to try to make cartouche show himself oh she was stunned reginald had betrayed himself unnecessarily he would be caught the police would be waiting for him but that was what she had come here for it had to be she could never have imagined cornwallis would simply listen and not act and yet now that it was going to happen she realized the enormity of it it would be the end of her husbands career a complete disgrace he would not ever be able to retire behind excuses of ill health because the police would be involved he might even be charged with somethingobstruction or concealing evidence she refused to think even in the very back of her mind of a charge of murder suddenly cornwallis was standing in front of her his hands holding her arms steadying her as if she had swayed and were about to fall over please he said urgently please sit down let me send for tea or something brandy he slid his arm around her and led her to the chair still holding her as she sank down into it the drawing she said gulping a little it wasnt an f it was a bishops crozier under a hill its very clear when you think about it i dont want brandy thank you tea would be quite all right pitt knew that if he went to southampton row alone he could not prove anything satisfactorily either about the identity of cartouche or about his involvement in the death of maude lamont tellman was in devon and pitt did not trust anyone from bow street even supposing wetron would give him somebody which was unlikely without an explanation and of course he could not explain not knowing wetrons own involvement in any of it therefore he went straight to narraway and it was narraway himself who came with pitt to southampton row in the bright early sunlight of the july morning they traveled in mere silence each absorbed in his own thoughts pitt could not rid his mind of his memory of francis wray he hardly dared allow himself to hope that an autopsy would somehow show that wray had not taken his own life even if only to pitt whether they could ever prove it to the rest of the world was another matter he repeated in his mind all that he thought he had asked of the people in the village were the questions so open so accusatory that anyone would have supposed from them that wray was suspected of being involved in maude lamonts death and if he went to see her with the intent of exposing her manifestations as fraud then where was there any fault or hypocrisy in that and it was very easy to believe that in his outrage at the damage spirit mediums could do he might well have used all his energy to expose them pitt thought back to the story of the young woman penelope who had lived in teddington and whom wray must have known she had lost her child and been tricked and misled by seances and manifestations and when she had seen through them in despair she had taken her own life he already knew that maude lamont had used mechanical tricks at least some of the timethe table for exampleand he could not help feeling that the collected electric light bulbs were part of an illusion also that number of them was certainly not for ordinary domestic use was it conceivable she had some real power of which she herself was only partly aware more than one of her clients had said she seemed startled by some of the manifestations as if she had not engineered them herself and she had no helper lena forrest denied all knowledge of her arts or how they were exercised then another thought occurred to him new and extraordinary but the more he weighed it and measured it against all he knew the more it seemed to make some kind of sense when they reached southampton row he climbed out of the hansom with narraway at his heels narraway paid the cabbie and they waited until he had driven away before they turned into the short alley of cosmo place narraway looked at the door into the garden of maude lamonts house itll be locked pitt observed probably narraway squinted at it but im not climbing that damn wall and then finding i didnt have to he put out his hand and tried the iron ring turning it a quarter of a circle until it stopped he grunted ill give you a lift up pitt offered narraway shot him a malicious glance but considering their relative heights and narraways slender build it would have been absurd for him to have tried to lift pitt he regarded his trousers his lips forming a thin line as he considered what the mossy stone would do to them then turned to pitt impatiently get on with it then i would greatly prefer not to be caught doing this and trying to explain myself to the local constable on the beat pitt grinned at the idea but it was brief and there was little pleasure in it he bent and made a cradle of his hands and narraway stepped gingerly onto it pitt straightened up and in seconds narraway was on top of the wall scrambling for a moment until he found his balance and sat astride then he leaned forward and offered pitt his hand it was an effort to haul himself up but after a few very undignified wriggles he breasted the wall and a moment later swung his legs over and down onto the earth at the far side immediately followed by narraway he brushed as much of the moss stain and dust off himself as he could then stared around it was the reverse of the view he had seen from the strip of grass in front of the french windows of the parlor keep back he waved another couple of yards and we can be seen from the house then what exactly are we doing here narraway retorted we cant see the front door and we cant see the parlor and now we cant even see the street if we keep to the bushes we can make our way to the back of the house and once weve seen where lena forrest is well know if she goes to answer the door and we can get inside through the back pitt replied softly he moved over to shelter behind the laurels as he spoke motioning narraway to follow him since cartouche always came through the side door anyway i think thats probably the way hell come now if hes still got the key then wed better make sure the bar is up narraway observed looking back over his shoulder at the door and its not he strode rapidly over to it and in a single movement lifted the bar up and laid it back off the rests that kept it closed then he drew back behind the shelter of the bushes beside pitt pitts mind was still half occupied with the idea which had come to him he looked up at the branches of the silver birch trees above the laurels there would probably be nothing to see no mark now but he could not help searching what is it narraway said crossly hes hardly going to come down from the sky can you see any notches up there notches rubbed bare of moss or scraping on the bark pitt said softly narraways face was tense interest flaring in his eyes like a rope burn why an idea it may be of course its an idea narraway snapped what to do with the night maude lamont was killed and tricks illusion that there might have been well discuss it when were watching the woman i dont care how brilliant your theory is itll do us no good if we miss cartouche arriving assuming he comes obediently pitt started to creep along the wall as much as possible keeping concealed behind the various bushes and shrubs until they were fifteen yards away from the door in the wall and only four yards from the scullery windows and the back door they could see the shadowy figure of lena forrest moving about in the kitchen presumably she was getting herself breakfast and perhaps beginning whatever chores she had for the day it must be a long drawnout boring time for her with no mistress in the house to care for they could not expect her to remain here much longer why were you looking for rope marks narraway said insistently did you see any pitt countered yes very slight a mark more like twine than rope what was on it something to do with cartouche no they heard the sound at the same instant the scraping of a key in the lock of the garden door as one they shrank back behind the heavy leaves and pitt found himself holding his breath there was no sound until the key scraped again and then the slight clunk of the bar being dropped back there were no footfalls across the grass they waited seconds ticked by was the visitor waiting also or had he passed by soundlessly and might already be inside narraway moved very carefully until he could see the side of the house hes gone in through the french windows he said softly i can see him in the parlor he straightened up theres no cover outside here wed better go around the back if we run into the woman well have to tell her and without waiting for pitt to argue he sprinted across the open space towards the scullery door and stopped just outside pitt wondered for an instant if perhaps they should have left a constable at the front door just in case cartouche tried to escape that way but then if he had seen anyone in the street he might not have risked coming in at all and the whole exercise would have been useless another alternative was for one of them to wait in the garden now but then if cartouche said anything or lena did there needed to be more than one witness to it he ran across the open lawn and joined narraway at the scullery door narraway looked cautiously in through the window theres no one there he said pushing the door inside was a small tidy room with vegetable racks rubbish bins a sack of potatoes and several pots and pans as well as the usual sink and low tub for laundry they went up the step into the kitchen and still there was no one in sight lena must have heard the intruder and gone through to the parlor on tiptoe pitt and narraway crept along the passage and stopped just short of the doorway it was ajar they could hear the voices inside the first was male rich and melodious only slightly sharpened by emotion his diction was still perfect i know that there are other papers miss forrest dont try to mislead me then lenas voice in reply surprised and a trifle edgy the police already took everything that has to do with her appointments theres nothing here now but household bills and accounts outstanding and thats just the ones that have come in through the last week the lawyers have all the old ones its part of her estate now there was fear in his voice and anger if you imagine you can continue where miss lamont was obliged to desist and that you can blackmail me miss forrest you are most deeply mistaken i will not permit it i will do not another thing by coercion do you hear me not one more word written or spoken there was a moment of silence narraway was standing in front of pitt blocking his view through the crack between the door and the jamb his eye was about level with the top of the hinge she was blackmailing you lena said with consuming disgust you were so afraid of what she knew about you that youd rather remove her papers for good or ill than have people know about you i no longer care miss forrest there was a wild note in him now as if he would overbalance out of control any moment pitt stiffened was she in possible danger had cartouche murdered maude lamont over this blackmail and if lena pressed him too far would he kill again once he knew where the papers were and of course she could not tell him because they did not exist then why are you here lena asked youve come for something only her notes that would tell who i am he replied shes dead she cant say anything further now and its my word against yours there was an element of confidence creeping in theres no question which of us they would believe so dont be foolish enough to try blackmail of your own just give me the papers and ill not trouble you again you arent troubling me now she pointed out and i never blackmailed anyone in my life a sophistry he sneered you were helping her i dont know if theres a legal difference but morally there isnt there was real anger in her voice it shook with something close to fury i believed her i worked in this house for five years before i had any idea she was a fraud i thought she was honest she choked on a sob and caught her breath painfully her voice sank so low pitt leaned forward to hear her it was only after someone else made her blackmail certain people that i found her out in tricks with the magnesium powder on the wires of the light bulbs and that table she never used them before that i know of another moments silence this time it was he who was urgent choked with feeling wasnt it all tricks it was a cry of the heart desperate she must have heard it she hesitated pitt could hear narraways breath and felt the tension in him when they stood almost touching each other there are real powers lena said very softly i discovered that myself silence again as if he could not bear to put it to the test how he said at last how would you know you said she used tricks you discovered it dont lie to me i saw it in your face it shattered you that was almost an accusation as if somehow it were her fault why why do you care her voice was almost unrecognizable except that it could be no one else because my sister had a baby out of wedlock he died because he was illegitimate they wouldnt baptize him she was gasping for breath choking on her pain so they wouldnt bury him in hallowed ground she went to a spirit medium to know what happened to him after after death that medium was a fake as well it was more than she could bear she killed herself im sorry he said softly the child at least was innocent it would have done no harm to he tailed off knowing it was all too late and a lie anyway the churchs rules on illegitimacy and suicide were beyond his power to break but there was pity in his voice and contempt for those who built rules without compassion he obviously saw no kind of god in it narraway turned and stared at pitt pitt nodded there was a rustle inside the room narraway swiveled back you werent here the night she was killed the man said i saw you go myself she snorted you saw the lantern and the coat she retorted you think i learned nothing the weeks i worked here after i knew she was a fraud i watched i listened its not very hard with ropes i heard you replace the lantern outside the front door when you got round to the street he made it an accusation a few stones dropped on the ground she said with scorn i let another lantern down on a string i went out afterwards to see a friend who has no clock the police checked i knew they would and you killed her after wed gone leaving us to take the blame now he was angry again and frightened she heard it no ones been blamed yet i will be when they find those papers he sounded shrill the pity gone well i dont know where they are she retorted why why dont we ask miss lamont what ask her she repeated dont you want to know if theres life after death or if this is the end isnt that why you came here in the first place if anyone should be able to come back to tell us its her oh yes his tone was razoredged with sarcasm and yet he could not keep the thin thread of hope out of it and how are we going to do that i told you now she was sharp too i have powers you mean you learned some of her tricks the voice was filled with contempt yes of course i did she said witheringly i already told you that but ive been looking ever since nell died im not easily taken in there was some truth as well before the blackmailing started spirits can be called up if the circumstances are right draw the curtains ill show you there was silence narraway turned and looked at pitt questioning in his eyes pitt had no idea what lena was going to do or if they should allow it to go ahead narraway pursed his lips they heard the very slight sound of fabric against fabric then footsteps pitt grasped narraway by the shoulders and half dragged him backwards and they were in the drawing room opposite still with the door open only just in time to avoid being seen by lena as she came out of the parlor and disappeared towards the kitchen she was gone for several minutes there was no sound from cartouche in the parlor lena returned and went into the room again closing the door pitt and narraway resumed their listening position but could make out only the occasional word maude that was lenas voice then nothing maude miss lamont that was cartouche unmistakable even though his voice was higher pitched with urgency narraway swung around to look at pitt his eyes wide miss lamont it was cartouche again but this time with excitement almost awe you know me you wrote my name down where are the papers there was a long moan impossible to tell if it was a man or a woman in fact it could even have been an animal so strange and stifled in the throat was it where are you where are you he begged what is it like can you see can you hear tell me there was a loud bang and a shriek and an even louder crash as if something made of glass had broken narraway put his hand on the door just as an explosion shook the whole house and there was a roaring like a sheet of flame and the smell of burning was thick in the air pitt threw himself at narraway and dragged him away from the door handle narraway kicking and struggling against him theyre in there he shouted furiously the stupid woman has set fire to something theyll suffocate let go of me damn it pitt do you want them to burn gas pitt yelled back at him just as the whole side of the house erupted hurling them backwards to land sprawled on the floor a couple of yards from the front door which now hung crazily on its hinges gaping open pitt scrambled to his feet the parlor door had gone altogether and the room was full of flame and smoke a gust from the hall blew across it and it cleared for a moment bishop underhill lay on his back with his head towards the doorway a look of amazement on his face lena forrest was slumped in the chair at the end of the table blood on her head and shoulders then the fire took renewed hold as the flames roared upwards consuming the curtains and the woodwork narraway was on his feet now too his face ashen under the dust and smoke we cant do anything for them pitt said shakily the whole house could go up any moment narraway coughed and choked come on out pitt run and he yanked him around by the arm and plunged for the front door they went careering out over the step and fell into the street side by side just as the third explosion rent the air and a gout of flame shot out through the windows with glass flying everywhere did you know narraway demanded on his hands and knees did you know it was lena who killed maude lamont i did by this morning pitt replied rolling over to sit his knees were scraped his hands scarred and he was scorched and filthy when i realized it was her sister who died in teddington nell is short for penelope he bared his teeth savagely voisey missed that one there were several people in the street now running shouting in a little while the fire engines would be here yes narraway agreed his smokegrimed face splitting into a whitetoothed grin he diddidnt he chapter fifteen there was little to be salvaged from the ruins of the house on southampton row but the fire engines did at least stop the flames from spreading to the house to the south or across cosmo place to the north there was no question that it was the curtains catching fire and the flames spreading to the gas brackets which had caused the first explosion which had then cracked other gas mains throughout the north part of the house gas had leaked out and as soon as the open flame had reached it it had made a bomb out of the parlor and its immediate surrounds pitt and narraway were fortunate to be no more seriously hurt than a few scratches and bruises and clothing that would never again be fit to wear it would be late tonight or even tomorrow morning before it would be safe for anyone to go into the ruins to look for what was left of lena forrest and bishop underhill and unless there was a connection between maude lamont and voisey in the papers they already had there was no way in which they could prove such a thing now certainly there would be nothing in southampton row nor would lena forrest be able to speak again the solution for what its worth narraway said when the firemen had asked them all they wished and were satisfied there was nothing more to add pitt knew what he meant there was little satisfaction in it except that of the mind and perhaps that rose serracold was not guilty but there was none of the connection to voisey they had hoped for it was there but impossible to prove which made it more acutely painful voisey could look at them and know they knew very clearly what he had done and why and that he would succeed im going to teddington pitt said after a moment or two as they walked along the footpath out of the way of the horses and the fire engines even if theres nothing i can prove i want to know that francis wray didnt kill himself ill come with you narraway said flatly he gave a thin smile not for your sake i want to catch voisey enough to take any chance there is no matter how slight but first one of us had better tell bow street whats happened here weve solved their case for them he said that with considerable satisfaction then he frowned why the devil isnt tellman here pitt was too tired to bother with a lie i sent him to devon to move my family he saw narraway start voisey knew where they were he told me so himself did he get there yes pitt said it with infinite satisfaction yes he did narraway grunted there was no comment worth making the darkness seemed to be gathering on all sides around pitt and facile remarks would be worse than useless ill tell wetron about this he said instead you might tell cornwallis he deserves to know i will and someone has to tell the bishops wife it will be a while before the firemen get to know who he is cornwallis will find someone narraway said quickly you havent time and you cant go looking like that anyway they reached the end of the pavement at the corner of high holborn narraway hailed the first empty hansom that passed isadora returned home after having told cornwallis about the bishops going to southampton row she arrived in the house feeling miserable and horribly ashamed because the step she had taken was irrevocable she had made her husbands secret public and cornwallis was a policeman he could not keep such a thing in confidence it was possible the bishop was actually the person who had killed the unfortunate spirit medium although the more she thought about it the less did she actually believe he had done it but she had not the right to conceal information on the strength of her own beliefs when they were not knowledge somebody had killed maude lamont and the other people there that evening seemed equally unlikely she had thought she knew her husband but she had been completely unaware of his crisis of faith the terror inside him it could not have arisen suddenly even if it had seemed so to him the underlying weakness must have been there for years perhaps always how much do we ever know other people especially if we dont really care not deeply not with compassion and the effort to watch to listen to stretch the imagination and to stop placing self to the front the fact that he did not know her or particularly want to was not an excuse she sat thinking all these things not moving from her chair not finding anything to comfort herself with or even anything there was purpose in doing until he should return either with or without the proof he sought what would she say to him then would she have to tell him that she had been to cornwallis probably she would not be able to lie to him to live in the same house sit across the meal table and make idiotic conversation about nothing all the time hiding that secret she was still sitting doing nothing her mind consumed in thought when the maid came to say that captain cornwallis was in the morning room and said he must see her her heart lurched and for a moment she felt so dizzy she could not stand up so it was reginald who had killed the medium he had been arrested she told the maid that she would come and then as the girl stood staring at her she realized she had spoken only in her mind thank you she said aloud i shall see him very slowly she stood up please do not interrupt unless i send for you i i fear it may be bad news she walked past the girl and out of the door across the hall and into the morning room closing the door behind her before she faced cornwallis at last she looked at him he was very pale his eyes fixed as if something had shocked him so profoundly he was slow to react in the most physical sense he took a step towards her then stopped i i know of no gentle way to tell you he began the room swam around her it was true she had not even really thought it could be not even a moment ago she felt his hands on her arms holding her almost supporting her weight it was ridiculous but her legs were buckling under her she staggered back and sank into one of the chairs he was leaning over her his face tense with overwhelming emotion bishop underhill went to southampton row and spoke for some time to the housekeeper lena forrest he was saying we do not know exactly what was the cause but there was a fire and then an explosion which broke the gas lines she blinked is he hurt why did she not ask what really mattered is he guilty i am afraid there was another bigger explosion he said very quietly they were both killed there is very little left of the house im so sorry dead reginald was dead that was the one thing she had not thought of she should be feeling horror loss a great aching hollow inside herself the pity was all right but not the sense of escape she closed her eyes not for grief but so cornwallis would not see in her the confusion the great rise of overwhelming relief that she would not have to watch reginald suffer shame humiliation rejection by his fellows the confusion and pain that would follow then perhaps a long and debilitating illness and the fear of death that would go with it instead death had found him suddenly with no time for him even to recognize its face will they ever know the real reason he went there she asked opening her eyes and looking at him i know of no reason why they should he replied it was the housekeeper who killed maude lamont it seems her sister had had a tragic experience with a medium years ago and took her own life as a result lena never got over it she believed in maude lamont until just recently at least that is what pitt explained to me he dropped to his knees in front of her taking her stiff hands in his isadora it was the first time he had used her name suddenly she wanted to weep it was shock the warmth of him close to her she felt the tears flood her eyes and spill over for a moment he was at a loss then he leaned forward and put his arms around her holding her and allowing her to weep as long as she needed to safe very close his cheek against her hair and she stayed there long after the shock had worn itself out because she did not wish to move and she knew in her heart that he did not either pitt met narraway again at the railway station waiting for the train to teddington narraway had a tight hard smile on his face still savoring the satisfaction of telling wetron the conclusion of the case and handing it to him cornwallis will tell mrs underhill pitt said briefly his mind was leaping ahead to the coroner and the thin thread of hope that in examining wrays body he would find something that would show any truth better than the one pitt feared there was little to say on the train journey both men had been bruised physically and emotionally by the tragedy of the morning pitt at least felt a mixture of compassion and revulsion for the bishop fear was too familiar not to understand it whether it was of physical pain and then extinction or of emotional humiliation but there had been too little in the man to admire it was a pity without respect lena forrest was different he could not approve what she had done she had murdered maude lamont in revenge and outrage not to save her own life or anyone elses at least not directly she may have believed it so in her own imagination they would never know but she had planned it with great care and ingenuity and after carrying it out had been perfectly willing to allow the police to suspect others still he felt sorry for the pain she must have endured over the years since her sisters death and they had suspected others of having killed maude lamont only because there were those she had given real cause to hate and fear her she was a woman prepared to act with extraordinary cruelty and to manipulate the tragedies of the most vulnerable for her own personal gain he would have guessed cornwallis might have felt similarly of narraways thoughts he had no idea at all and no intention of asking if after this he was still able to work in london at all it would be for narraway he could not afford anger or contempt for him they sat in silence all the way to teddington and to kingston beyond the noise of the train was sufficient to make conversation difficult and neither had any desire to discuss either what had passed or what might be to come at kingston they took a hansom from the station to the mortuary where the autopsy had been conducted narraways position was sufficient to command an almost immediate attention from a highly irritated doctor he was a large man with a snub nose and receding hair in his youth he had been handsome but now his features had coarsened he regarded the two bruised filthy men with extreme distaste narraway retained his look with a level stare i cant imagine what special branch wants with the death of an unfortunate old man of such distinction in his life the doctor said tartly good thing he has only friends and no family to be distressed by all this he flicked his hand indicating the room behind him where presumably autopsies were carried out fortunately your imagination or lack of it does not matter narraway replied frostily we are concerned only with your forensic skill what was the cause of mr wrays death in your opinion it is not an opinion it is a fact the doctor snapped back at him he died of digitalis poisoning a slight dose would have slowed the heart this was sufficient to stop it altogether taken in what form pitt asked he could feel his own heart racing as he waited for the answer he was not certain if he wanted it powder the doctor said without hesitation crushed up tablets probably in raspberry jam almost certainly in a pastry tart it was eaten very shortly before he died pitt was startled what the doctor looked at him with mounting annoyance am i going to have to say everything again for you if it matters enough yes you are narraway told him he turned to pitt whats wrong with raspberry jam he didnt have any pitt replied he apologized for it said it was his favorite and he had eaten it all i know raspberry jam when i see it the doctor said furiously it was barely digested at all the poor man died within a very short time of eating it and it was unquestionably in pastry you would have to produce some very remarkable evidence and i cannot imagine what it would be to make me believe other than that he went to bed with jam tarts and a glass of milk the digitalis was in the jam not the milk he looked at pitt with withering disgust although from special branchs point of view i cant see why it matters either way in fact i cant see why any of it is even remotely your business i want the report in writing narraway told him he glanced at pitt and pitt nodded time and cause of death specifically that the digitalis which killed him was in the raspberry jam in pastry ill wait muttering to himself the doctor went out of the door leaving pitt and narraway alone well narraway asked as soon as they were out of earshot he had no raspberry jam pitt insisted but octavia cavendish came with a basket of food for him just as i was leaving there must have been raspberry jam tarts in it he tried to crush the leap of hope inside himself it was too soon too fragile the weight of defeat was still closed down hard ask mary ann shell remember whatever she unwrapped and put out for him and shell tell you there were no jam tarts in the house before that oh i will narraway said vehemently i will and when we have the autopsy report in writing he cant go back on it the doctor returned a few moments later handing over a sealed envelope narraway took it from him tore it open and read every word on the paper inside while the doctor glared at him offended that he had not been trusted narraway looked at him with contempt he trusted no one his job depended upon being right to the last detail a mistake one thing taken for granted a single word could cost lives thank you he said satisfied and put the paper in his pocket he led the way out pitt following closely behind it was necessary to go to the station to catch the next train back towards london the first stop would be teddington and from there it was only a short distance to wrays house from the outside it looked just the same the flowers brilliant in the sun tended with love but not discipline the roses still tumbled around the doors and windows and ran riot over the arch above the gate pinks spilled over the pathways filling the air with perfume for a moment it was hard to remember that wray was gone from here forever and yet there was a blind look to the windows a sense of emptiness or perhaps that was only in his mind narraway glanced at him he seemed about to say something then kept silent they walked one behind the other up the flagstoned path and pitt knocked on the door it was several moments before mary ann came she looked at narraway then at pitt and her face lit with remembrance oh its you mr pitt its nice o yer to ave come specially after the rotten stupid things some folk are saying sometimes i give up yer know bout poor mr wray o course she blinked and the tears welled up in her eyes did yer know as e left yer the jam e didnt actually write it down like but e said it to me mary ann i must give mr pitt some more o the jam e was so kind to me i meant to an then mrs cavendish came an the chance rather slipped away yer know the way e used to talk she sniffed and searched for a handkerchief blowing her nose hard im sorry but i miss im summink terrible pitt was so touched by the gesture so overwhelmingly relieved that even if wray had taken his own life it was not with ill thought towards him that he felt his throat tighten and a sting in his eyes he would not betray it by speaking thats very kind of you narraway spoke for him whether he sensed the need or simply was accustomed to taking control but i think that there may be other claimants to his possessions even those of the kitchen and we would not wish you to be in any difficulty oh no she said with certainty there int no one else mr wray left everything to me an the cats o course the lawyers came and told me she gulped and swallowed this whole house everything can you imagine that so the jams mine except e said as mr pitt should ave it narraway was startled but pitt saw with surprise a softness in his face as if he also were moved by some deep emotion in that case i am sure mr pitt would be very grateful we apologize for intruding miss smith but in light of knowledge we now have it is necessary we ask you certain questions may we come in she frowned looking at pitt then back at narraway they are not difficult questions pitt assured her and in nothing are you to blame but we do need to be sure she pulled the door and stepped backwards well i spose yerd better would yer like a cup o tea yes please pitt accepted not bothering to see whether narraway did or not she would have had them wait in the study where pitt had met with wray but partly from haste mostly out of revulsion at the idea of sitting where he had talked so deeply with a man now dead they followed her into the kitchen the questions narraway began as she put more water in the kettle and opened the damper in the stove to set the flames burning inside again when mr pitt was here for tea the day mr wray died what did you serve them oh she was startled and disconcerted sandwiches and scones and jam i think we adnt any cake what kind of jam greengage are you sure absolutely certain yes it was mrs wrays own jam er favorite no raspberry we didnt ave any raspberry mr wrayd eaten it all that was is favorite could you swear to that before a judge in court if you had to narraway pressed yes course i could i know raspberry from greengage but why whats appened narraway ignored the question mrs cavendish came to visit mr wray just as mr pitt was leaving yes she glanced at pitt then back at narraway she brung him some tarts with raspberry jam in them an a custard pie an a book how many tarts two why whats wrong and did he eat them both do you know whats wrong she was very pale now you didnt eat one narraway insisted course i didnt she said hotly she brung them for im what dyer think i am to go eating the masters tarts what a friend come with i think you are an honest woman narraway answered with sudden gentleness and i think that honesty saved your life to inherit a house a generous man wished you to have in appreciation for your kindness to him she blushed at the compliment did you see the book mrs cavendish brought narraway asked she looked up quickly yes it were poems was it the book that was found beside him when he died narraway winced very slightly at the baldness of the question but he did not retreat from it she nodded her eyes filling with tears yes are you certain yes can you write mary ann o course i can but she said it with sufficient pride that the possibility of her not having been able to was very real good narraway said with approval then will you please find a paper and pen and write down exactly what you have told usthat there was no raspberry jam in the house that day until it was brought in by mrs octavia cavendish and that she came with two raspberry jam tarts both of which mr wray ate also if you please that she brought the book of poetry found beside him and put the date on it and sign your name why please do it then i shall explain to you write it first it is important she saw something of the gravity in his face and she excused herself and went to the study nearly ten minutes later after pitt had taken the kettle off the stove she returned and offered narraway a piece of paper very carefully written on and signed and dated he took it from her and read it then gave it to pitt who glanced at it saw that it was wholly satisfactory and put it away narraway gave him a sharp look but did not demand it back well mary ann asked you said youd tell me if i wrote that for you yes narraway agreed mr wray died as a result of eating raspberry jam that had poison in it he ignored her pale face and her gasp of breath the poison to be specific was digitalis which occurs quite naturally in the foxglove plant of which you have several very fine specimens in your garden it has been supposed by certain people that mr wray took some of the leaves and made a potion which he drank with the intention of ending his life hed never do that she said furiously i know that even if theres some as dont no narraway agreed and you have been most helpful in proving that to be the case however you would be very wise in your own safety not to say so to anyone else do you understand me she looked at him with fear in her eyes and in her voice youre saying as mrs cavendish gave im tarts what was poisoned why would she do that she was real fond of im it dont make no sense e must ave ad a eart attack it would be best that you think so narraway agreed by far the best but the jam is very important so no one ever supposes that he took his own life that is a sin in his church and they would bury him in unhallowed ground thats wicked she cried furiously its downright vicious it is wicked narraway said with profound feeling but when did that ever stop men who consider themselves righteous from judging others they think are not she swung around to pitt her eyes burning e trusted yer yer got to see they dont do that to im youve got to that is what i am here for pitt said softly for his sake and for my own i have enemies and as you know some of them are saying that i was the one who drove him to it i tell you that so i have not misled you i never believed he was the man who went to southampton row and i did not even refer to it the last time i was here the man who visited the spirit medium was called bishop underhill and he is dead too e never no he died by accident her face creased with pity poor man she said softly thank you very much miss smith no one could have mistaken narraways sincerity you have been of the greatest help we will take care of the matter from here the coroner will bring in a verdict of death by misadventure because i will see to it that he does if you have any care for your own safety you will agree to that regardless to whom you speak or in what circumstances unless brought to a court of law by me or by mr pitt and questioned on the subject under oath do you understand me she nodded swallowing hard good then we shall leave you and be on our way to the coroner yer dont want a cup o tea anyway yer got to take your jam she added to pitt narraway looked at the kettle actually yes we can stay for tea just a cup thank you it has been an unusually trying day she glanced at the dirt and the tears in his clothes and in pitts but she made no remark she would have considered it rude anyone can fall on hard times and she knew that very well she did not judge people she liked pitt and narraway walked as far as the station together i am going back to kingston to the coroner narraway announced as they crossed the road i can enforce the verdict we wish francis wray will be buried in hallowed ground however there is little purpose in proving that mrs cavendishs tarts poisoned him she would be charged with murder on unarguable circumstantial evidence and i doubt very much that she had the slightest idea of what she was doing voisey either gave her the jam or more probably the tarts themselves in order to make sure no one else was affected both for his own safety in case it was traced back to him and because insofar as he cares for anyone it is she then how in gods name did he bring himself to use her as an instrument of murder pitt demanded such callousness was utterly beyond him he could not conceive of a rage consuming enough to use any innocent person as a weapon of death let alone someone you loved and above all who trusted you pitt if you are to be any damned use to me at all then you must stop imagining everyone else operates on the same moral and emotional plane as you do narraway demanded they dont he glared savagely at the footpath ahead of him dont be so bloody stupid as to think what you would do in a situation think what they would do you are dealing with them not a hundred mirror images of yourself voisey hates you with a passion you cant even think of but believe it believe it every day and every hour of your life because if you dont one day you will pay for it he stopped and held out his hand causing pitt to all but collide with him and i will have mary anns testimony that and the autopsy result are going where even voisey will never find them he needs to know that and he needs to know that if anything happens to you or to your family then they will become public which would be very unfortunate for mrs cavendish very unfortunate indeed and ultimately for voisey himself whether she were prepared to testify against him or not pitt hesitated only a moment it was safety for his family and bought without compromise without surrender he put his hand in his pocket and pulled out mary anns testimony if he could not trust narraway then he had nothing narraway took it and smiled thinlipped thank you he said with mild sarcasm he knew pitt had doubted for an instant i am perfectly happy to have a photograph made of both papers and lodged wherever you wish the originals must remain where even voisey can never reach them and it is best you also do not know where that is believe me pitt they will be safe pitt smiled back thank you he accepted yes a photograph of each would be nice i daresay commissioner cornwallis would appreciate that then he shall have it narraway answered now catch your train back to the city and see what election results have come in there should be some by now i would suggest the liberal club they will have news as fast as anyone and they put it up in electric lights for all to see if i didnt have to speak to the coroner id go myself a flicker of pain crossed his face i think the fight between voisey and serracold may be far closer than we wish and i wont call it good luck pitt and before pitt could answer he turned and walked smartly away pitt exhausted stood in the crowd on the pavement outside the liberal club staring up at the electric lights which flashed the latest news of the results he cared about jack but the voiseyserracold contest filled his mind and he refused to let go of the last hope that serracold could still ride the liberal tide and win by however narrow a majority the result at the moment was one in which he had no interest a safe tory seat somewhere in the north of the city two men were standing a yard or two from him did you hear one of them demanded incredulously that fellow got in would you believe it what fellow his companion asked irritably hardie of course the first man replied keir hardie labor party indeed you mean he won the questioners voice was high with disbelief i told you pitt smiled to himself although he was not sure what it would mean for politics if anything his eyes were fixed on the electric lights but he began to realize it was pointless results were coming in as they were known but jacks seat or the lambeth south seat might already have been declared he needed to find someone who could tell him if there were time he could even get a hansom and go to lambeth and hear the result in person he moved away from the group watching the lights and went to the doorman he had to wait a moment or two before the man was free to speak to him yes sir he enquired patiently politely ignoring pitts appearance everyone was seeking him tonight and it was a highly satisfying feeling is there any news on mr radleys result in chiswick he asked yes sir came almost quarter of an hour ago close but es nicely in sir pitt felt a burst of relief warm inside him thank you what about lambeth south mr serracold and sir charles voisey dont know sir eard its a bit tighter there but couldnt say for sure might be either way thank you pitt stepped back to make room for the next eager enquirer and hurried to find a cab unless he came across an extraordinary traffic jam he would be able to get to lambeths town hall in less than an hour he could see the result come in himself it was a fine evening warm and humid half of london seemed to be out taking the air walking or riding choking the streets it was ten minutes before he found a free hansom and climbed in calling to the driver to take him over the river to the lambeth town hall the hansom turned and headed back the way it had come fighting against the stream there were lights everywhere people calling out the sound of hooves on cobbles and the clash and jingle of harness he wanted to shout to the driver to hurry to push his way through but he knew it was pointless for his own sake the man would already be doing all he could pitt sat back forcing himself to be patient he veered between believing aubrey serracold could still win and the sick doubt in his stomach that anyone could beat voisey he was too clever too certain they were crossing the vauxhall bridge now he could smell the damp of the river and see the lights reflected from the shore there were still pleasure boats out laughter floating on the air on the far side there were people in the streets but a little less traffic the hansom picked up speed perhaps he would be there in time to hear them announce the result part of him hoped it would be all over when he got there then he could simply be told and that would be it was there anything at all even narraway could do to curb voiseys power if he were to win would he end up lord chancellor of england one day perhaps even before the next government was out or would wetron be the one to stop him nowetron had neither the skill nor the nerve voisey would crush him when he was ready ere yare sir the cabbie called this is as close as i can get right pitt scrambled out paid him and pushed his way through the rest of the traffic to the town hall steps inside was full of more people jostling each other cramming forward to see the returning officer was on the platform the noise abated something was about to happen the light shone on aubrey serracolds pale hair he looked stiff tense but his head was high pitt saw rose in the crowd smiling she was excited but the fear seemed to have gone from her perhaps she had found the answer to the question she had asked maude lamont in a far better more certain way than any medium could give voisey was on the other side of the returning officer standing to attention waiting pitt realized with a particle of pleasure that he did not yet know if he had won or not he was not sure hope welled up inside pitt like a spring making him gasp there was silence in the room the returning officer read out the figures aubrey first there was a tremendous shout it was high aubrey flushed with pleasure the officer read out voiseys figure it was nearly a hundred higher the noise was deafening aubrey was white but he had been born and bred to accept defeat as graciously as victory he turned to voisey and offered his hand voisey took it then that of the returning officer then he stepped forward to thank his supporters pitt stood frozen he should have known but he had hoped right to the bitter end he had hoped defeat was crushing like a weight in his chest the words went on the cheers then at last voisey left the platform and pushed his way through the crowd he was bent on savoring the last drop of his victory he must see pitt look at him and be certain he knew a moment and he was there standing in front of him close enough to touch pitt offered his hand congratulations sir charles he said levelly in a sense you deserved it you paid a far higher price than serracold ever would have the amusement was sharp in voiseys eyes indeed well the big prizes do cost pitt that is the difference between the men who reach the top and those who dont i imagine you know that bishop underhill and lena forrest both died in the explosion in southampton row this morning pitt went on standing in front of voisey blocking his way yes i heard an unfortunate business he was still smiling he knew he was safe perhaps you have not yet heard that they performed an autopsy on francis wray pitt continued he saw voiseys eyes flicker digitalis poisoning he pronounced the words very clearly in raspberry jam tarts quite unmistakably i dont have the autopsy report myself but i have seen it voisey was staring at him incredulously fighting against belief in what he had heard a bead of sweat formed on his lip the odd thing ispitt smiled very slightlythere was no raspberry jam in the house except in two tarts brought as a gift by a mrs octavia cavendish why on earth she should wish to murder such a gentle and harmless old man i have no idea there must be some reason we have not yet discovered there was panic in voiseys eyes his breath was ragged beyond his control it seems probable pitt said that someone who trusted mrs cavendish implicitly enlisted her help with the express purpose of killing wray in a manner that would look like suicide regardless of what it might cost her he moved his hand very slightly dismissing the subject the reason doesnt matter let us say it was a complicated scheme of personal revenge that is as good a story as any voisey opened his mouth to speak then gulped air and closed it again we have the coroners report pitt continued and mary ann smiths testimony signed and witnessed and there will be photographs of both kept in separate and extremely safe places to be made public should anything unpleasant happen to me or to any member of my familyor of course to mr narraway voisey stared at him his skin pasty white im sure he said between dry lips im sure nothing will happen to them good pitt said with intense feeling very good and he stood back for voisey to pass unsteadily ashenfaced on his way
