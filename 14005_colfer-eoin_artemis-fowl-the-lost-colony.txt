eoin colfer artemis fowl the lost colony chapter blast to the past barcelona spain happy was not a word often used to describe artemis fowls bodyguard jolly and contented were also words that were rarely applied to him or to people in his immediate vicinity butler did not get to be one of the most dangerous men in the world by chatting with anyone who happened to stroll past unless the chat concerned exit routes and concealed weapons on this particular afternoon butler and artemis were in spain and the bodyguards eurasian features were even more taciturn than normal his young charge was as usual making butlers job more complicated than it needed to be artemis had insisted that they stand on the sidewalk of barcelonas passeig de gratia for over an hour in the afternoon sun with only a few slender trees to provide them with cover from the heat or possible enemies this was the fourth unexplained trip to foreign locations in as many months first edinburgh then death valley in the american west followed by an extremely arduous trek to doubly landlocked uzbekistan and now barcelona all to wait for a mysterious visitor who had not as yet made an appearance they made an odd couple on the busy pathway a huge muscular man forties hugo boss suit shaven head and a slight teenager pale ravenhaired with large piercing blueblack eyes why must you circle so butler asked artemis irritated he knew the answer to his own question but according to his calculations the expected visitor to barcelona was a minute late and he allowed his annoyance to transfer to the bodyguard you know perfectly well why artemis replied butler in case there is a sniper or an audiotech on one of the rooftops i am circling to provide the maximum cover artemis was in the mood to demonstrate his genius this was a mood in which he frequently found himself and as satisfying as these demonstrations were for the fourteenyearold irish boy they could be intensely irritating for anyone on the receiving end firstly it is hardly likely that there is a sniper gunning for me he said i have liquidated eighty per cent of my illegal ventures and spread the capital across an extremely lucrative portfolio secondly any audiotech trying to eavesdrop on us may as well pack up and go home as the third button on your jacket is emitting a solinium pulse that whites out any surveillance tape human or fairy butler glanced at a passing couple who were bewitched by spain and young love the man had a camcorder slung round his neck butler fingered his third button guiltily we may have ruined a few honeymoon videos he noted artemis shrugged a small price to pay for my privacy was there a third point asked butler innocently yes said artemis a touch testily still no sign of the individual he was expecting i was about to say that if there is a gunman on one of these buildings its that one directly to the rear so you should stay behind me butler was the best bodyguard in the business and even he couldnt be a hundred per cent sure which rooftop a potential gunman would be on go on tell me how you know i know youre dying to very well since you ask no sniper would position himself on the rooftop of casa mila directly across the street because it is open to the public and so his access and escape would probably be recorded his or her corrected butler most metal men are women these days his or her amended artemis the two buildings on the right are somewhat screened by foliage so why handicap yourself very good go on the cluster behind us to the left is a group of financial buildings with private security stickers on the windows a professional will avoid any confrontation he is not being paid for butler nodded it was true and so i logically conclude that your imaginary sniper would pick the fourstorey construction to our rear it is residential so access is easy the roof affords him or her a direct line of fire and the security is possibly dismal and more than likely nonexistent butler snorted artemis was probably right but in the protection game probably wasnt nearly as comforting as a kevlar vest youre probably right admitted the bodyguard but only if the sniper is as smart as you are good point said artemis and i imagine you could put together a convincing argument for any one of these buildings you just picked that one to keep me out of your line of vision which leads me to believe that whoever youre expecting will turn up outside casa mila artemis smiled well done old friend casa mila was an early twentiethcentury dwelling designed by the spanish art nouveau architect antonio gaudi the facade consisted of curved walls and balconies topped by twisted ironworks the walkway outside the building was thronged with tourists lining up for the afternoon tour of the spectacular house will we recognize our visitor among all these people are you sure that he is not already here watching us artemis smiled and his eyes glittered believe me he is not here if he were there would be a lot more screaming butler scowled once just once he would like to get all the facts before they boarded the jet but that wasnt the way artemis worked to the young irish genius the reveal was the most important part of his schemes at least tell me if our contact will be armed i doubt it said artemis and even if he is he wont be with us for more than a second a second just beaming down through outer space is he not space old friend said artemis checking his wristwatch time the boy sighed anyway the moment has passed it seems as though i have brought us here for nothing our visitor has not materialized the chances were slim obviously there was nobody at the other end of the rift butler didnt know what rift artemis was referring to he was simply relieved to be leaving this insecure location the sooner they could get back to barcelona airport the better the bodyguard pulled a mobile phone from his pocket and hit a number on the speed dial the person on the other end picked up on the first ring maria said butler collection pronto si replied maria tersely maria worked for an exclusive spanish limousine company she was extremely pretty and could break a breeze block with her forehead was that maria said artemis mimicking casual conversation perfectly butler was not fooled artemis fowl rarely asked casual questions yes that was maria you could tell because i used her name when i spoke to her you dont usually ask so many questions about the limo driver thats four in the past fifteen minutes will maria be picking us up where do you think maria is right now how old do you think maria is artemis rubbed his temples its this blasted puberty butler every time i see a pretty girl i waste valuable mind space thinking about her that girl at the restaurant for instance ive glanced in her direction a dozen times in the past few minutes butler gave the pretty girl in question an automatic bodyguards onceover she was twelve or thirteen did not appear to be armed and had a mane of tight blonde curls the girl was studiously working her way through a selection of tapas while a male guardian perhaps her father read the paper there was another man at the table who was struggling to stow a set of crutches under his chair butler judged that the girl was not a direct threat to their safety though indirectly she could cause trouble if artemis was unable to concentrate on his plan butler patted his young charge on the shoulder its normal to be distracted by girls natural if you hadnt been so busy saving the world these past few years it would have happened sooner nevertheless i have to control it butler i have things to do control puberty snorted the bodyguard if you manage that youll be the first i generally am said artemis and it was true no other teenager had kidnapped a fairy rescued their father from the russian mafiya and helped put down a goblin revolution by the tender age of fourteen a horn honked twice from across the intersection a young lady gestured through an open limousine window its maria said artemis then caught himself i mean let us go maybe well have better luck at the next site butler took the lead stopping the traffic with a wave of one massive palm maybe we should take maria with us a fulltime driver would make my job a lot easier it took artemis a moment to realize that he was being ribbed very funny butler you were joking werent you yes i was i thought so but i dont have a lot of experience with humour apart from mulch diggums mulch was a kleptomaniac dwarf who had stolen from and for artemis on previous occasions diggums liked to think of himself as a funny fairy and his main sources of humour were his own bodily functions if you can call that humour said butler smiling in spite of himself at his own memories of the pungent dwarf and suddenly artemis froze in the middle of a heaving intersection butler glowered at the three lanes of city traffic a hundred impatient drivers leaning on their horns i feel something breathed artemis electricity could you feel it on the other side of the road asked butler artemis stretched out his arms feeling a tingle on his palms hes coming after all but several metres off target somewhere there is a constant that is not constant a shape formed in the air from nothing came a cluster of sparks and the smell of sulphur inside the cluster a greygreen thing appeared with golden eyes chunky scales and great horned ears it stepped out of nowhere and on to the road it stood erect five feet high humanoid but there was no mistaking this creature for human it sniffed the air through slitted nostrils opened a snakes mouth and spoke felicitations to lady heatherington smythe it said in a voice of crushed glass and grating steel the creature grasped artemiss outstretched palm with a fourfingered hand curious said the irish boy butler wasnt interested in curious he was interested in getting artemis away from this creature as quickly as possible lets go he said brusquely laying a hand on artemiss shoulder but artemis was already gone the creature had disappeared as quickly as it had come taking the teenager with him the incident would make the news later that day but strangely enough in spite of the hundreds of tourists armed with cameras there would be no pictures the creature was insubstantial as though it did not have a proper hold on this world its grip on artemiss hand was soft with a hard core like bone wrapped in foam rubber artemis did not try to pull away he was fascinated lady heatherington smythe repeated the creature and artemis could hear that it was scared dost this be her estate hardly modern syntax thought artemis but definitely english now how does a demon exiled in limbo learn to speak english the air buzzed with power and white electrical bolts crackled around the creature slicing holes in space a temporal rent a hole in time artemis was not overly awed by this after all he had seen the lower elements police actually stop time during the fowl manor siege what did concern him was that he was likely to be whisked away with the creature in which case the chances of him being returned to his own dimension were small the chances of him being returned to his own time were miniscule he tried to call out to butler but it was too late if the word late can be used in a place where time does not exist the rent had expanded to envelop both him and the demon the architecture and population of barcelona faded slowly like spirits to be replaced first by a purple fog then a galaxy of stars artemis experienced feverish heat then bitter cold he felt sure that if he materialized fully he would be scorched to cinders then his ashes would freeze and scatter across space their surroundings changed in a flash or maybe a year it was impossible to tell the stars were replaced by an ocean and they were underneath it strange deepsea creatures loomed from the depths luminous tentacles scything the water all around them then there was a field of ice then a red landscape the air filled with fine dust finally they were looking at barcelona again but different the city was younger the demon howled and gnashed its pointed teeth abandoning all attempts to speak english luckily artemis was one of two humans in any dimension who spoke gnommish the fairy language calm yourself friend he said our fate is sealed enjoy these wondrous sights the demons howl ceased abruptly and he dropped artemiss hand speak you fairy tongue gnommish corrected artemis and better than you i might add the demon fell silent regarding artemis as though he was some kind of fantastic creature which of course he was artemis for his part spent what could possibly be the last few moments of his life observing the scene before him they were materializing at a building site it was the casa mila but not yet completed workmen swarmed across scaffolding erected at the front of the building and a swarthy bearded man stood scowling at a sheet of architectural drawings artemis smiled it was gaudi himself how amazing the scene solidified colours painting themselves brighter artemis could smell the dry spanish air now and the heavy tangs of sweat and paint excuse me said artemis in spanish gaudi looked up from the drawings and his scowl was replaced with a look of utter disbelief there was a boy stepping from thin air beside him a cowering demon the brilliant architect absorbed every detail of the tableau committing it to his memory forever si he said hesitantly artemis pointed to the top of the building youve got some mosaics planned for the roof you might want to rethink those very derivative then boy and demon disappeared butler did not panic when a creature stepped out of the hole in time then again he was trained not to panic no matter how extreme the situation unfortunately nobody else at the passeig de gracia intersection had attended madam kos personal protection academy and so they proceeded to panic just as loudly and quickly as they could all except the curlyhaired girl and the two men with her when the demon appeared the public froze when the creature disappeared they unfroze explosively the air was rent with the sounds of shouting and screaming drivers abandoned their cars or simply drove them into store windows to escape a wave of humans withdrew from the point of materialization as though repelled by an invisible force again the girl and her companions bucked the trend actually running towards the spot where the demon had shown up the man with the crutches displayed remarkable agility for one who was supposedly injured butler ignored the pandemonium concentrating on his right hand or rather where his right hand had been a second earlier just before artemis fizzled into another dimension butler had managed to get a grip on his shoulder now the disappearing virus had claimed his own hand he was going wherever artemis had gone he could still feel his young charges bony shoulder in his grip butler fully expected his arm to vanish but it didnt just the hand he could still feel it in an underwaterpinsandneedles kind of way and he could still feel artemis no you dont he grunted tightening his invisible grip ive put up with too much hardship over the years for you to disappear on me now and so butler reached down through the decades and yanked his young charge back from the past artemis didnt come easy it was like dragging a boulder through a sea of mud but butler was not the kind of person that gave up easily he planted his feet and put his back into it artemis popped out of the twentieth century and landed sprawling in the twentyfirst im back said the irish boy as if he had simply returned from an everyday errand how unexpected butler picked his principal up and gave him a perfunctory examination everything is in the right place nothing broken now artemis tell me what is twentyseven multiplied by eighteen point five artemis straightened his suit jacket oh i see youre checking my mental faculties very good i suppose its conceivable that time travel could affect the mind just answer the question insisted butler four hundred and ninetynine point five if you must know ill take your word for it the giant bodyguard cocked his head to one side sirens we need to get out of this area artemis before im forced to cause an international incident he hustled artemis to the other side of the road to the only car still idling there maria looked a little pale but at least she had not abandoned her clients well done said butler flinging open the rear door airport stay off the motorway as much as possible maria barely waited until butler and artemis were belted before burning rubber down the street ignoring the traffic lights the blonde girl and her companions were left on the roadside behind them maria glanced at artemis in the mirror what happened out there no questions said butler curtly eyes on the road drive he knew better than to ask questions himself artemis would explain all about the strange creature and the shining rift when he was ready artemis remained silent as the limousine swung down towards las ramblas and from there into the labyrinthine backstreets of downtown barcelona how did i get here he said eventually musing aloud or rather why arent we there or why arent we then what anchored us to this time he looked at butler are you wearing any silver butler grimaced sheepishly you know i never usually wear jewellery but there is this he shot one cuff there was a leather bracelet on his wrist with a silver nugget in the centre juliet sent it to me from mexico its to ward off evil spirits apparently she made me promise to wear it artemis smiled broadly it was juliet she anchored us he tapped the silver nugget on butlers wrist you should give your sister a call she saved our lives as artemis tapped his bodyguards wristband he noticed something about his own fingers they were his fingers no doubt about it but different somehow it took him a moment to realize what had happened he had of course done some theorizing on the hypothetical results of interdimensional travel and concluded that there could possibly be some deterioration of the original as with a computer program that has been copied once too often streams of information could be lost in the ether as far as artemis could tell nothing had been lost but now the index finger on his left hand was longer than the second finger or more accurately the index finger had swapped places with the second finger he flexed the fingers experimentally hmm noted artemis fowl i am unique butler grunted tell me about it he said chapter doodah day haven city the lower elements holly shorts career as an elfin private investigator was not working out as well as shed hoped this was mainly because the lower elements most popular current events show had run not one but two specials on her over the past few months it was difficult to go undercover when her face was forever popping up on cable reruns surgery suggested a voice in her head this voice was not the first sign of madness it was her partner mulch diggums communicating from his mike to her earpiece what she said her voice carrying to her own microphone a tiny fleshcoloured chip glued to her throat i m looking at a poster of your famous face and im thinking that you should have some cosmetic surgery if we want to stay in business and i mean real business not this bountyhunting game bounty hunters are the lowest of the low holly sighed her dwarf partner was right even criminals were considered more trustworthy than bounty hunters a few implants and a reshaped nose and even your best friend wouldnt recognize you continued mulch diggums its not as if youre a beauty queen forget it said holly she was fond of the face she had it reminded her of her mothers what about a skin spray you could go green disguise yourself as a sprite mulch are you in position snapped holly yep came the dwarfs reply any sign of the pixie no hes not up and about yet but he will be soon so stop the chatter and just get ready hey were partners now no more criminal and police officer i dont have to take orders from you get ready please no problem mulch diggums lowlife bounty hunter signing off holly sighed sometimes she missed the discipline of the lower elements police reconnaissance division when an order was given it was followed although if she was honest holly had to admit she had got herself into trouble more than once for disobeying a direct command she had only survived in leprecon for as long as she had because of a few highprofile arrests and because of her mentor commander julius root holly felt her heart lurch as she remembered for the thousandth time that julius was dead she could go for hours without thinking about it then it would hit her every time like the first time she had quit the lep because juliuss replacement had actually accused her of murdering the commander holly figured with a boss like that she could do the fairy people ignore good outside the system it was starting to look like she had been dead wrong in her time as leprecon captain she had been involved in putting down a goblin revolution thwarting a plan to expose the subterranean fairy culture to the humans and reclaiming stolen fairy techjiology from a mud man in chicago now she was tracking a fish smuggler who had skipped out on his bail not exactly national security stuff what about shin extensions said mulch interrupting her thoughts you could be taller in hours holly smiled as irritating as her partner was he could always cheer her up also as a dwarf mulch had special talents which came in very handy in their new line of business until recently he had used these skills to break into houses and out of prisons but now he was on the side of the angels or so he swore unfortunately all fairies knew that a dwarfs vow to a nondwarf wasnt worth the spitsodden handshake that sealed the deal maybe you could get a brain extension holly retorted mulch chortled oh brilliant i must write that one down in my witty retorts book holly was trying to come up with an actual witty retort when their target appeared at the motelroom door he was a harmlesslooking pixie barely half a metre high but you didnt have to be tall to drive a lorry of fish the smuggling bosses hired pixies as drivers and couriers because they looked so innocent and childlike holly had read this pixies jacket and she knew that he was anything but innocent doodah day had been smuggling livestock to illegal restaurants for over a century in smuggling circles he was something of a legend as an excriminal mulch was privy to criminal folklore and was able to supply holly with all kinds of useful information that wouldnt find its way into an lep report for instance doodah had once made the heavily patrolled atlantis haven run in under six hours without losing a fish from the tank doodah had been arrested in the atlantis trench by a squad of lep water sprites he had skipped out en route from a holding cell to the courthouse and now holly had tracked him here the bounty on doodah day was enough to pay six months rent on their office the plaque on the door read short and diggums private investigators doodah day stepped out of his room scowling at the world in general he zipped his jacket then headed south towards the shopping district holly stayed twenty steps back hiding her face underneath a hood this street had traditionally been a rough spot but the council were putting millions of ingots into a major revamp in five years there would be no more goblin ghetto huge yellow multimixers were chewing up old sidewalk and laying down brandnew paths behind them overhead public service sprites unhooked burnedout sunstrips from the tunnel ceiling and replaced them with new molecule models the pixie followed the same route that he had for the past three days he strolled down the road to the nearest plaza picked up a carton of vole curry at a kiosk then bought a ticket to the twentyfourhour movie theatre if be stayed true to form then doodah would be in there for at least eight hours not if i can help it thought holly she was determined to get this case wrapped by close of business it wouldnt be easy doodah was small but he was fast without weapons or restraints it would be almost impossible to contain him almost impossible but there was a way holly bought a ticket from the gnome attendant then settled into a seat two rows behind the target the theatre was pretty quiet at this time of day there were maybe fifty patrons besides themselves most of them werent even wearing theatre goggles this was just somewhere to put in a few hours between meals the theatre was running the hill of tailke trilogy nonstop the trilogy told a cinematic version of the events surrounding the hill of taillte battle where the humans had finally forced the fairies underground the final part of the trilogy had cleaned up at the amp awards a couple of years ago the effects were splendid and there was even a special edition interactive version where the player could become one of the minor characters looking at the movie now holly felt the same pang of loss as she always did the people should be living above ground instead they were stuck in this technologically advanced cave holly watched the sweeping aerial views and slowmotion battles for forty minutes then she moved into the aisle and threw off her hood in her lep days she would simply have come up behind the pixie and stuck her neutrino in his back but civilians were not allowed to carry weapons of any kind and so a more subtle strategy would have to be employed she called the pixie from the aisle hey you arent you doodah day the pixie jumped from his seat which did not make him any taller he fixed his fiercest scowl on his features and threw it hollys way who wants to know the lep replied holly technically she had not identified herself as a member of the lep which would be impersonating a police officer doodah squinted at her i know you youre that female elf the one who tackled the goblins ive seen you on digital youre not lep any more holly felt her heartbeat speed up it was good to be back in action any kind of action maybe not doodah but im still here to bring you in are you going to come quietly and spend a few centuries in the atlantis pen what do you think said doodah day dropping to his knees the little pixie was gone like a stone from a sling crawling under the seats jinking left and right holly pulled up her hood and ran towards the fire exit thats where doodah would be going he went this way every day every good criminal checks the exit routes in whatever building he visits doodah was at the exit before her crashing through the door like a dog through a hatch all holly could see was the blue blur of his jumpsuit target on the move she said knowing her throat mike would pick up whatever she said coming your way i hope thought holly but she didnt say it in theory doodah would make for his bolthole a small storage unit over on crystal which was kitted out with a small cot and airconditioning unit when the pixie got there mulch would be waiting it was a classic human hunting technique beat the grass and be ready when the bird flies of course if you were human you shot the bird then ate it mulchs method of capture was less terminal but equally revolting holly stuck close but not too close she could hear the pitterpatter of the pixies tiny feet scurrying along the theatres carpet but she couldnt see the little fellow she didnt want to see him it was vital that doodah believed he had got away otherwise he wouldnt make for his bolthole in her lep days there would have been no need for this kind of closeup pursuit she would have had complete access to five thousand surveillance cameras dotted throughout haven not to mention a hundred other gadgets and gimmicks from the lep surveillance arsenal now there was just her and mulch four eyes and some special dwarf talents the main door was still flapping when holly reached it just inside an outraged gnome was flat on his behind covered with nettle smoothie a little kid he complained to an usher or a pixie it had a big head i know that much hit me right in the gut holly skirted the pair shouldering her way on to the plaza outside outside relatively speaking everything was inside when you lived in a tunnel overhead the sunstrips were set to midmorning she could trace doodahs progress by the trail of chaos in his wake the vole kiosk was overturned lumpy greygreen curry congealed on the flagstones and lumpy greygreen footsteps led to the plazas northern corner so far doodah was behaving very predictably holly shouldered through the ragged line of curry customers keeping her eyes on the pixies footsteps two minutes she said for mulchs benefit there was no reply but there shouldnt be not if the dwarf was in position doodah should take the next service alley and cut across to crystal next time they were going after a gnome pixies were too fast the fairy council did not really like bounty hunters and tried to make life as difficult for them as possible there was no such thing as a licensed firearm outside the lep anyone with a weapon without a badge was going to prison holly rounded the corner expecting to see the tail end of a pixie blur instead she saw a tentonne yellow multimixer bearing down on her obviously doodah day had finished being predictable darvit swore holly diving to one side the multimixers front rotor chewed through the plazas paving spitting it out at the rear in centimetreperfect slabs she rolled into a crouch reaching for the neutrino blaster which had been on her hip until recently all she found was air the multimixer was swinging round for a second run bucking and hissing like a mechanical jurassic carnivore giant pistons thumped and rotor blades carved scythelike through whatever surface fell beneath their blades debris was shovelled into the machines belly to be processed and shaped by heated plates it reminds me a bit of mulch thought holly funny what crosses your mind when your life is in danger she backpedalled away from the mixer yes it was big but it was slow and unwieldy holly glanced upwards to the cab and there was doodah expertly manipulating the gears his hands flashed across the knobs and levers dragging the metal behemoth towards holly all around was pandemonium shoppers howling emergency klaxons sounding but holly couldnt worry about that now priority one stay alive terrifying as this situation might be to the general public holly had years of lep training and experience shed escaped the grasp of far quicker enemies than this multimixer as it turned out holly was mistaken the multimixer was slow as a whole but some of its parts were lightning fast for example the containment paddles two threemetre high walls of steel that slotted out on either side of the front rotor to contain any debris that might be thrown up by the rotor blades doodah day an instinctive driver of any vehicle saw his opportunity and took it he overrode the safety and deployed the paddles four pneumatic pumps instantly pressurized and literally blew the paddles into the wall on both sides of holly they bit deep sinking fifteen centimetres into the stone hollys confidence drained down into her boots she was trapped with a hundred curved strip blades tearing up the ground before her wings said holly but only her lep suit had wings and she had given up the right to wear that the paddles contained the vortex created by the blades and turned it back on itself the vibration was terrific holly felt her teeth shake in her gums she could see ten of everything her whole world was bad reception beneath her feet the blades greedily chewed the pavement holly jumped at the lefthand paddle but it was well lubricated and afforded her no purchase her luck was equally bad with the other paddle the only other possible avenue was straight ahead and that wasnt really an option not with the deadly rotor waiting holly shouted at doodah maybe her mouth formed actual words she couldnt be certain not with the shaking and the noise blades snicked through the air grabbing for her with each pass they tore strips from the ground beneath her feet there wasnt much ground left soon she would be feeding the multimixer she would be shredded passed through the machines innards and finally laid as a paving slab holly short would literally be part of the city there was nothing to do nothing mulch was too far away to be of any assistance and it wasnt likely that any civilian would attempt to mount a rogue mixer even if they had known she was trapped between the paddles as the blades closed in holly gazed towards the computergenerated sky it would have been nice to die on the surface feeling the heat of the real sun warming her brow it would have been nice then the rotor stopped holly was sprayed with a shower of halfdigested debris from the mixers stomach a few stone slivers scratched her skin but that was the extent of her injury holly wiped the grime from her face and looked up her ears rang with the engines aftershock and her eyes watered from the dust that settled on her like dirty snow doodah peered down at her from the cab his face was pale but fierce leave me alone he shouted his voice seemed weak and tinny to hollys damaged eardrums just leave me alone and he was gone scurrying down the access ladder maybe heading for his bolthole holly leaned against one of the paddles allowing herself a moment to recover tiny sparks of magic blossomed on her many cuts sealing them her ears popped whined and flexed as the magic automatically targeted her eardrums in seconds hollys hearing was back to normal she had to get out of here and there was only one way over the rotor past the blades holly tipped one gingerly with a finger a droplet of blood oozed from a tiny cut only to be sucked back in by a blue spark of magic those blades would cut her to ribbons if she slipped and there wouldnt be enough magic under the world to stitch her back together again but the rotor was her only way out otherwise she would have to sit it out here until lep traffic arrived it would be bad enough causing this kind of damage with the weight of lep public liability insurance behind her but as a freelancer shed probably be thrown in jail for a couple of months while the courts decided what to charge her with holly threaded her fingers between the blades gripping the first bar on the rotor it would be just like climbing a ladder a very sharp potentially fatal ladder she stepped on a lower bar and boosted herself up the rotor groaned and dropped fifteen centimetres holly held on because it was safer than letting go blades quivered two centimetres from her limbs slow and steady no false moves one bar at a time holly climbed the rotor twice a blade nicked her flesh but the wounds were not serious and were quickly sealed by blue sparks after a brief eternity of utter concentration holly pulled herself on to the hood the bonnet was filthy and hot but at least it wasnt sharper than a centaurs tongue he went that way said a voice from ground level holly looked down to see a large frowning gnome in a city services uniform pointing towards crystal he went that way repeated the gnome the pixie who threw me out of my mixer holly stared at the burly public services guy that tiny pixie threw you out the gnome almost blushed i was getting out anyway he just tipped me over he suddenly forgot all about his embarrassment hey arent you polly something polly little thats it the lep hero holly climbed down the cab ladder polly little thats me holly landed running her boots crunching on pebbles of crushed pavement mulch she said doodah is coming your way be careful hes a lot more dangerous than we thought dangerous maybe maybe not he hadnt killed her when hed had the chance it would seem that the pixie had no stomach for murder doodahs stunt with the multimixer had caused chaos in the plaza traffic police nicknamed wheelies were pouring in and civilians were pouring out holly counted at least six leptraffic magnabikes and two cruisers she was keeping her head down when one of the traffic officers hopped off his bike and grabbed her shoulder did you see what happened missy missy holly was tempted to twist the hand on her shoulder and flip the officer into a nearby recycler but this was not the time for outrage she needed to redirect his attention why thank goodness youre here officer she twittered in a voice at least an octave higher than her normal tones over there by the multimixertheres blood everywhere blood exclaimed the wheelie delighted to hear it everywhere absolutely everywhere the traffic cop dropped hollys shoulder thank you missy ill handle it from here he strode purposefully towards the multimixer then turned back excuse me missy he said recognition glimmering in his eye just out of reach dont i know you but the hooded elf had disappeared ah well thought the wheelie i should probably go look at the blood everywhere holly ran towards crystal street though she felt sure there was no need for haste doodah had either decided that there was too much heat on him to reveal his bolthole or mulch had him either way it was out of her control once again she lamented the loss of lep backup in her recon days all it would have taken was a quick order into her helmet microphone and every street in the area would be cordoned off she skirted a streetcleaning robot turning on to crystal the narrow street was a service lane for the main shopping plaza and consisted mostly of delivery bays the rest of the units were rented out for storage holly was surprised to find doodah directly in front of her rummaging in his pocket presumably for the access chip to his unit something must have held him up for a minute maybe he had ducked behind a crate to avoid the wheelies whatever she had another shot at him doodah looked up and all holly could do was wave morning she said doodah shook a tiny fist at her dont you have better things to do elf all i do is smuggle a few fish the question cut holly deeply was this really the best way to help the people surely commander root had wanted more from her in the past few months she had gone from top priority surface operations to chasing down fish smugglers in a back alley that was quite a drop she showed doodah her hands i dont want you to get hurt so stand perfectly still doodah chuckled hurt by you not likely no said holly not by me by him she pointed at the patch of mud under doodahs feet him doodah looked down suspiciously suspecting a trap his suspicions were absolutely correct the ground beneath his feet fizzled slightly as the surface earth shivered and bounced what said doodah lifting one foot he would doubtless have stepped off the patch if hed had time but what happened next happened very quickly the ground did more than just collapse it was sucked from below doodah with a sickening slurping sound a hoop of teeth cut through the earth followed by a huge mouth there was a dwarf on the other end of the mouth and he breached the ground like a dolphin jumping driven apparently by gas from his rear end the ring of teeth closed round doodah swallowing him to the neck mulch diggums for of course it was he settled back into his tunnel taking the unfortunate pixie with him doodah it has to be said did not look quite so cocky as he had a second ago a ddwarf he stammered i thought your people didnt like the law generally they dont but mulch is an exception you dont mind if he doesnt answer you himself he might accidentally bite your head off doodah squirmed suddenly whats he doing i imagine hes licking you dwarf spittle hardens on contact with air as soon as he opens his mouth youll be locked up tight as a chick in an egg mulch winked at holly it was about as much as he could gloat at the moment but holly knew that he would spend the next several days boasting about his skills dwarfs can tunnel through kilometres of earth dwarfs have jetpowered rear ends dwarfs can produce two litres of rock spittle every hour what have you got besides a famous face that keeps blowing our cover holly peered into the hole the toe of one boot hooked over the edge ok partner good job now can you please spit out the fugitive mulch was happy to oblige he hawked doodah on to the lanes surface then clambered up himself rehingeing his jaw this is disgusting moaned doodah as the viscous spittle solidified on his limbs it stinks too hey said mulch injured the smell is not my fault if you rented storage in a cleaner lane oh yeah stinky well this is what i think of you doodah attempted a pixie hex gesture but fortunately the rock spittle froze his arm before he could complete it ok you two cut it out said holly we have thirty minutes to get this little guy to the lep before the spittle loosens up mulch peered over her shoulder towards the mouth of the lane he turned suddenly pale underneath his coating of wet earth and his beard hair bristled nervously you know something partner he said i dont think were going to need thirty minutes holly turned away from her prisoner there were half a dozen elves blocking the entrance to the lane they were lep or something very like it they wore plain clothes with no markings or insignia of any kind they were official though the heavy artillery cradled in their elbows attested to that holly noticed with some relief that none of the guns were pointed at her or mulch one of the elves stepped forward popping the visor on her helmet hello holly she said weve been looking for you all morning howve you been holly swallowed a relieved sigh it was wing commander vinyaya a longtime supporter of holly and julius root vinyaya had blazed the trail for all females in the forces in a fivehundredyear career she had done everything from leading a retrieval team to the dark side of the moon to heading up the liberal vote on the fairy council in addition to this she had been hollys flight instructor in the academy fine commander said holly vinyaya nodded at the solidifying mass of rock spittle keeping busy i see yes thats doodah day the fish smuggler quite a catch the commander frowned youre going to have to cut him loose holly we have bigger snails to pop holly placed her boot on doodahs midriff she was reluctant to jump through lep hoops even for an undercover wing commander what kind of snails vinyayas frown deepened cutting a slash between her brows can we talk in the car captain the regulars are on the way captain vinyaya had referred to her by her old rank what was going on here if the regulars were lep who were these fairies i dont trust the force as much as i used to commander you need to give me something before we go anywhere vinyaya sighed firstly captain were not the force not the one you think anyway secondly you want me to give you something ill give you two words care to hazard a guess what they are holly knew at once she felt it artemis fowl she whispered thats right confirmed vinyaya artemis fowl now are you and your partner prepared to come with us where are you parked asked holly vinyaya and her mysterious unit obviously had a serious budget not only were their weapons state of the art but their transportation was way out of the usual lep league within seconds of scraping doodah day and slipping a tracker into his boot holly and mulch were strapped into lounger seats in the back of a stretch armoured vehicle they werent prisoners exactly but holly couldnt help feeling that she wasnt in control of her destiny any more vinyaya took off her helmet shaking out long silver hair holly was surprised the commander smiled you like the colour i got fed up dyeing it yes it suits you mulch raised a finger sorry to interrupt the salon chat but who are you people youre not lep ill bet my bumflap on it vinyaya swivelled to face the dwarf how much do you know about demons mulch checked the vehicles cooler and was delighted to find simchicken and nettle beer he liberated both demons not a lot never seen one myself what about you holly remember anything from school holly was intrigued where could this conversation be going was this a test of some kind she thought back to her history classes in police academy demons the eighth family of the fairy people ten thousand years ago after the battle of taillte they refused to move underground opting instead to lift their island out of time and live there in isolation vinyaya nodded very good so they assembled their circle of warlocks and cast a time spell over the island of hybras they disappeared off the face of the earth recited mulch and no ones seen a demon since not quite true a few have popped up over the centuries one quite recently in fact and guess who was there to meet him artemis said holly and mulch simultaneously exactly somehow he was able to predict what we couldnt we knew when but our where was off by several metres holly sat forward interested back in the game did we get artemis on film not exactly replied vinyaya cryptically if you dont mind ill leave the explaining to someone more qualified than me hes back at base and she would say no more on the subject most infuriating mulch wasnt one for patience what youre just going to take a nap come on vinyaya tell us what little arty is up to vinyaya would not be drawn relax mister diggums have another nettle beer or some spring water the commander took two bottles from the cooler offering one to mulch mulch studied the label derrier no thanks you know how they put the bubbles in this stuff vinyayas mouth twitched with the ghost of a smile i thought it was naturally carbonated yeah thats what i thought until i got a prison job at the derrier plant they employ every dwarf in the deeps they made us sign confidentiality contracts vinyaya was hooked so go on tell me how do they get the bubbles in mulch tapped his nose cant say breach of contract all i can say is it involves a huge vat of water and several dwarfs using our er mulch pointed to his rear end natural talents vinyaya replaced her bottle gingerly as holly sat back in her comfortable gel chair enjoying yet another of mulchs tall tales a niggling thought nudged through she realized that commander vinyaya had avoided answering the dwarfs initial question who are these people ten minutes later that question was answered welcome to section eight headquarters said vinyaya forgive my theatrics its not often we get to wow people holly didnt feel very wowed they had pulled into a multistorey car park several blocks down from police plaza the stretch armoured vehicle followed the curved arrows up to the seventh floor which was stuffed below the craggy roof ceiling the driver parked in the least accessible darkest space then switched off the engine they sat for several seconds in the damp darkness listening to rockwater drip from stalactites on to the roof wow said mulch this is something i guess you people spent all your money on the car vinyaya smiled just wait the driver ran a quick proximity scan on the dashboard scanner and came up clean he then took an infrared remote from the dash and clicked it through the transparent plastic roof at the rock face overhead remotecontrolled rocks said mulch dryly delighted at the opportunity to exercise his sarcasm muscle vinyaya did not respond she didnt have to what happened next shut mulch up all on its own the parking space rose hydraulically sending the car catapulting towards the rock face above the rocks did not move out of the way there was no doubt in hollys mind that when rock went up against metal the rock would win it made no sense of course that vinyaya would bring them here only to crush the entire party but there was no time to consider this in the half a second that it took the stretch vehicle to reach the hard unforgiving rock in truth the rock wasnt hard or unforgiving it was digital they passed right through to a smaller carport built into the rock hologram breathed holly vinyaya winked at mulch remotecontrolled rocks she said she flipped open the rear door stepping out into an airconditioned corridor the entire headquarters has been hewn from the rock actually most of the cave was already here we just lasered off a corner here and there forgive all the cloakanddagger but its vital that what we do here at section eight remains secret holly followed the commander through a set of automatic doors and down a slick corridor there were sensors and cameras every few paces and holly knew that her identity had been verified at least a dozen times before they reached the steel door at the end of the corridor vinyaya plunged her hand into a plate of liquid metal at the doors centre flux metal she explained pulling her hand out the metal is saturated with nanosensors theres no way to fake your way through this door the nanosensors read everything from my handprint to my dna even if someone cut off my hand and stuck it in here the sensors would read a lack of pulse holly folded her arms all this paranoia in one place i think i can guess who your technical consultant is the door whooshed back and standing on the other side was exactly the person holly had expected to see foaly she said fondly stepping through to embrace the centaur foaly hugged her warmly stamping his rear hooves with delight holly he said holding her at arms length how have you been busy replied holly foaly frowned you look a little skinny amazingly so do you laughed holly foaly had lost a little weight since she had last seen him and his coat was glossy and groomed holly patted his flank hmm she mused youre using conditioner and youre not wearing the brainprobeproof tinfoil hat dont tell me you have a little lady centaur tucked away somewhere foaly actually blushed its early days yet but im hopeful the room was packed from floor to ceiling with stateoftheart electronics in fact some of it was in the floor and ceiling including wallsized gas view screens and an incredibly realistic simsky overhead foaly was obviously proud of what he had put together section eight has the budget i get the very best of everything what about your old job the centaur scowled i tried working for sool but it didnt work out hes destroying everything commander root built section eight headhunted me discreetly at a speeddating weekend they made me an offer and i accepted i get plenty of fawning adoration here not to mention a huge salary hike mulch had a quick nosey around and was irritated to find that there wasnt a single crumb of food in the room none of that salary went on vole curry i suppose foaly raised an eyebrow at the dwarf who was still coated with tunnel dirt no but we do have a shower room you do know what a shower is dont you diggums mulchs beard hair bristled yes i do and i know a donkey when i see one too holly stepped between them ok you two no need to take up where you left off lets hold off on the traditional insults until we find out where we are and why were here mulch lowered himself gleefully on to a cream couch fully aware that some of his mucky coating would rub into the furniture holly sat beside him but not too close foaly activated a wall screen then touched it gently to navigate to the program he wanted i love these new gas screens he snickered electric pulses heat the particles to different temperatures causing the gas to turn different colours forming pictures of course its a lot more complicated than that but im dumbing it down for the convict i was completely exonerated objected mulch as you well know the charges were dropped foaly pointed out you were not exonerated its a different thing slightly yes like a centaur and a donkey are different things slightly holly sighed it was almost like old times foaly was the lep technical consultant who had steered her through many operations and mulch was their reluctant helper it would be difficult for a stranger to believe that the dwarf and the centaur were actually good friends she supposed this irritating bickering was how the males of every species showed affection a lifesize picture of a demon flashed up on the screen its eyes were slitted and its ears were crowned with spikes mulch jumped darvit relax said foaly its computergenerated amazing picture quality though i grant you the centaur enlarged the face until it filled the screen fullgrown buck demon post warp post warp yes holly demons do not grow like other fairies they are quite cuddly until they hit puberty then their bodies undergo a violent and painful spasm or warp after eight to ten hours they emerge from a cocoon of nutrient slime as demons before that they are simply imps not the warlocks though they never warp instead their magic blossoms i dont envy them instead of acne and mood swings a pubescent warlock demon gets lightning bolts shooting out of his fingers if hes lucky where do they shoot out of if hes unlucky and why do we care about any of this asked mulch cutting to the chase we care because a demon popped up recently in europe and we didnt get to him first so we heard demons are coming back from hybras now maybe holly foaly tapped the screen splitting it into smaller sections demon pictures appeared in each one these demons have materialized momentarily over the past five centuries luckily none of them have stayed around long enough to be captured by the mud men foaly highlighted the fourth picture my predecessor managed to hold on to this one for twelve hours he got a silver medallion on to him and there was a full moon that mustve been a special moment said mulch foaly sighed didnt you learn anything in school demons are unique among all the creatures of the earth their island hybras is actually an enormous moonrock that came down in the triassic period when the moon was hit by a meteorite from what we can glean from fairy cave paintings and virtual models this moonrock punched into a magma stream and more or less got itself welded to the surface demons are descended from lunar microorganisms that lived inside the rock they are subject to a strong physical and mental lunar attraction they even levitate during the full moon and it is this attraction which pulls them back into our dimension they have to wear silver to repel the lunar pull silver is the most effective dimensional anchor gold works too but sometimes you leave bits of yourself behind so lets say we believe all this interdimensional lunar attraction baloney said mulch doing his utmost to wind foaly up what has that got to do with us it has everything to do with us snapped foaly if the humans capture a demon who do you think will be next under their microscope vinyaya took up the backstory that is why five hundred years ago council chairman nan burdeh set up section eight to monitor demon activity luckily burdeh was a billionaire and when she died she left her entire fortune to section eight hence the rather impressive setup we are a very small covert council division of the lep but everything we have is the best over the years our brief has expanded to include secret missions that are too sensitive to entrust to regular lep but demonology is still our priority for five centuries our finest minds have been studying the ancient demon texts trying to predict where the next demon will pop up generally our calculations are correct and we can contain the situation but twelve hours ago something happened in barcelona what happened asked mulch a reasonable question for once foaly opened another box on the screen most of the picture was white this happened mulch peered at the box a very small snowstorm foaly wagged a finger at him i swear if i wasnt such a fan of mockery myself i would have you tossed out of here on your combustible behind mulch accepted the compliment with a gracious nod no this is not a small snowstorm this is whiteout someone was blocking our scopes holly nodded scopes was the shop name for the shrouded trackers attached to human communications satellites you can see that whatever happened in our little snowstorm must have been pretty unusual because the mud men are very eager to get away from it on screen humans outside the whiteout zone ran away wildly or drove their cars into walls human news programmes report several sightings of a lizardlike creature appearing out of thin air for several seconds of course there are no photographs i had calculated that there would be an appearance but more than three metres to the left and we had set up an elldee sorry light distortion projector accordingly unfortunately although we got the time right the exact location was wrong somehow whoever was inside that ball of interference got the location exactly right so artemis saved us noted holly vinyaya was puzzled saved us how well if it hadnt been for that interference our demon friend would have been all over the internet by now and you think that artemis was inside the ball of interference foaly grinned obviously delighted with his own cunning little arty thought he could outwit me he knows the lep keep him under constant surveillance even though they promised not to interjected holly foaly ignored this technicality ploughing on so artemis sent out decoys to brazil and finland but we put a satellite on all three took a big chunk out of my budget i can tell you mulch groaned i am either going to barf or fall asleep or both vinyaya slammed a fist into her palm right ive had enough of the dwarf lets just toss him in a holding cell for a few days you cant do that objected mulch vinyaya grinned nastily at him oh yes i can you wouldnt believe the powers section eight has so shut up or listen to your own voice bouncing back at you from steel walls mulch locked his mouth and threw away the key so we know artemis was in barcelona continued foaly and we know a demon appeared he was at several other possible materialization sites too but no demons showed up hes involved somehow how do we know that for sure asked holly heres how said foaly he tapped the screen enlarging a section of the casa milas roof holly stared at the picture for several seconds looking for whatever it was she was supposed to see foaly gave her a hint this is a gaudi building you like gaudi he designed some lovely mosaics holly looked harder oh my god she said suddenly it cant be oh but it is laughed foaly enlarging a particular rooftop mosaic until it filled the entire wall screen there were two figures in the picture stepping from a hole in the sky one was obviously a demon and the other was clearly artemis fowl but thats impossible that building must be a hundred years old time is the key to this whole thing said foaly hybras has been lifted out of time a demon who gets sucked off the island drifts through the centuries like a temporal nomad this demon obviously got hold of artemis and took him along for the ride they must have appeared to one of gaudis artists or maybe even the man himself holly paled you mean artemis is no no artemis is home in bed weve pulled a satellite out of orbit to keep twentyfourseven watch on him how is this possible foaly said nothing so vinyaya answered the question ill take this one because foaly doesnt like saying the words we dont know holly this affair leaves a lot of important questions unanswered thats where you come in how i dont know anything about demons vinyaya nodded craftily yes but you know a lot about artemis fowl i believe you keep in touch holly shrugged well i wouldnt say we really foaly cleared his throat then called up an audio file on the system hey artemis said a recording of hollys voice ive got a little problem you might be able to help me with happy to help holly said artemiss voice something difficult i hope well theres this pixie im after but hes a fast one foaly switched off the file i think we can say youre in contact holly smiled sheepishly hoping nobody would ask who gave artemis a fairy communicator ok i call from time to time just to keep an eye on him for the greater good whatever your reasons said vinyaya we need you to contact him again go to the surface and find out how he can predict demon appearances so accurately according to foalys calculations there isnt a demon appearance due for six weeks but we would like to know where exactly its going to be holly took her time to think about this in what capacity would i be contacting artemis full captain your old rank of course now youd be working for section eight everything you do for us would be hushhush a spy a spy but with excellent overtime and medical insurance holly jerked a thumb at mulch what about my partner the dwarf jumped to his feet i dont want to be a spy far too dangerous he winked slyly at foaly but i could be a consultant for a fee vinyaya scowled were not prepared to grant diggums a surface visa mulch shrugged good i dont like the surface its too close to the sun and i have sensitive skin but we are prepared to compensate him for loss of earnings i dont know if im ready to put on the uniform again said holly i like working with mulch lets call this mission a probationary term do this one i for us see if you like the way we operate holly mulled it over what colour is the uniform vinyaya smiled matte black ok said holly im in foaly hugged her again i knew youd do it i knew it holly short cannot resist adventure i told them vinyaya saluted stiffly welcome on board captain short foaly will complete your briefing and get you kitted out i expect you to make contact with the subject as soon as possible holly returned the salute yes commander thank you commander now if youll excuse me i have a debriefing with a pixie weve managed to place inside the goblin triads he has been wearing a scale suit for six months and hes having a bit of an identity crisis vinyaya left her silver mane rippling behind her the automatic doors closed with barely a whisper foaly dragged holly from her seat i have so much to show you he babbled excitedly the fairies here are nice but a bit on the square side sure they ooh and aah but no one appreciates me like you do we have our own shuttle port you know and field equipment you are not going to believe the spec wait until you see the new shimmer suit and the helmet holly this thing comes home on its own i built a series of minithrusters into the skin it cant fly but it can bounce wherever you want it to the thing is beyond genius mulch covered his ears same old foaly modest to a fault foaly aimed a kick at mulch pulling it at the last second keep it up diggums i could snap at any moment i am half beast remember mulch moved the hoof away from his face with a finger i cant help it he whined all this melodrama someone has to poke fun foaly turned once more to his precious wall screen he selected and enlarged an artists impression of the island of hybras i know this all sounds very cloakanddagger and i know you think im making an anaconda out of a stinkworm but believe me somewhere on that island there is an unsuspecting demon who is about to make a reluctant visit to earth and make life very difficult for us holly stepped close to the screen where was that reluctant demon she wondered and did he have any idea that he was about to be snatched from his own dimension and propelled into another as it happened hollys questions were inaccurate on two counts firstly the demon in question was not actually a demon he was just an imp and secondly the imp in question was anything but reluctant in fact visiting earth was his dearest wish chapter first impression the island of hybras limbo one night imp no dreamed he was a demon he dreamed his horns were curved and pointed his hide was coarse and armoured and his talons were sharp enough to rip the hide from a wild boars back he dreamed the other demons cowered before him then scurried away lest he injure them while in the throes of his battle spasms that night he dreamed this magnificent dream then awoke to find he was still merely an imp of course technically he did not have this dream at night the sky over hybras is forever tinged with the red glow of dawn but no thought of his rest period as night even though hed never seen one imp no dressed quickly rushing into the hallway to check his reflection in the lodge mirror just in case he had warped in his sleep but there was no change still the same unimpressive figure as usual one hundred per cent imp grrr he said to his image and even the no in the mirror was unconvinced and if he couldnt scare himself then he was not a scary creature and might as well get a job changing baby imps there was some potential in the mirror imp no had the general skeletal structure of a proper demon he was about the same height as a sheep sitting on its rear his skin was grey as moon dust and pebbled with armoured plating spiralling red runes wound their way round his chest up along his neck and across his forehead his eyes had striking orange irises and his jaw had a noble jut about it or so he liked to think though others had called it protruding he had two arms slightly longer than an average human tenyearold and two legs slightly shorter fingers and toes eight of each so nothing weird there one tail more of a stump actually but excellent for burrowing holes if youre hunting for grubs all in all your typical imp but at fourteen years old the oldest imp in hybras roughly fourteen years old that is it was hard to be exact when it was always dawn the hour of power as the warlocks used to call it before they got sucked into the depths of cold space the hour of power very catchy hadley shrivelington basset a demon who was actually six months nos junior but already fully fledged strolled down the tiled corridor on his way to the washroom his horns corkscrewed impressively and his ears had at least four points hadley enjoyed parading his new demon self in front of the imps generally demons shouldnt even bunk in the imp lodge but basset seemed in no hurry to move out hey imp he said snapping his towel at nos behind it connected with a sharp crack are you going to warp any time soon maybe if i get you angry enough the towel stung but no didnt get angry just nervous everything made him nervous that was his problem time for a quick subject change morning basset nice ears i know said hadley tipping the points one after another four points already and i think theres a fifth coming up abbot himself only has six points leon abbot the hero of hybras the demons selfproclaimed saviour hadley snapped no again with the towel dont you get a pain in your face looking in the mirror imp because youre giving me a pain in mine he put his hands on his hips threw back his head and laughed it was all very dramatic youd think there was an artist in the wings doing sketches eh basset youre not wearing any silver the laughing stopped to be replaced by a froglike gurgle shrivelington basset bolted down the lodge corridor without pause for more bullying no knew scaring people half to death shouldnt give him any satisfaction and generally it wouldnt but for basset hed make an exception not wearing silver on your person is much more than a fashion disaster for a demon or imp for them it can be fatal or worse painful for all eternity this rule usually only applied by the volcano crater but luckily basset was too scared to remember that no ducked back into the senior imp dorm hoping his roommates were still snoring no such luck they were knuckling the sleep from their eyes and already searching for the target of their daily ribbing which was of course him he was by far the oldest in the senior dorm no one else had made it to fourteen without warping it was getting to the point where he was a permanent fixture each night his legs protruded from the foot of the bed and his blanket barely covered the swirling moon markings on his chest hey runt called one are you going to warp today do you think or will pink flowers grow out of my armpits ill check your armpits tomorrow sniggered another more abuse this time from a couple of twelveyearold imps who were so pumped up that they were likely to warp before class but they were right he would have gone for the pink flowers option too runt was his imp nickname they didnt have real names not until after they warped then they would be given a name from the sacred text until that moment he was stuck with no or runt he smiled goodnaturedly it didnt pay to antagonize his dormmates even though they were smaller than him today they could be a lot bigger tomorrow im feeling pumped he said flexing his biceps today is going to be my day everyone in the dorm was excited tomorrow they could be out of this room for good once they warped they were transferred to decent accommodation and nothing in hybras was offlimits who do we hate shouted one humans came the reply the next minute or so was spent howling at the ceiling imp no joined in but he wasnt really feeling it it shouldnt be who do we hate he thought it really should be whom but this probably wasnt a good time to bring that up imp school sometimes no wished he had known his mother this was not a very demonlike desire so he kept it to himself demons were born equal and whatever they made of themselves they did with their claws and teeth as soon as the female laid an egg it was tossed in a bucket of mineralenriched mud and left to hatch imps never knew who their families were and therefore everyone was their family but still some days when his selfesteem had taken a bit of a pounding no couldnt help gazing wistfully across at the female compound on his way to school and wondering which one was his mother there was one demoness with red markings like his own and a kind face often she smiled across the wall at him she was looking for her son no suddenly realized and from that day he smiled back they could both pretend to have found each other no had never experienced a feeling of belonging he ached for the time when he could wake up and look forward to what lay ahead that day hadnt come yet and it wasnt likely to not for as long as they lived in limbo nothing would change nothing could change well that wasnt strictly true things could get worse imp school was a low stone building with little ventilation and hardly any light perfect for most imps the stench and the smoky fire made them feel hard done by and warlike no longed for light and fresh air he was uniquely different a brandnew point on the compass or maybe an old one no often thought that perhaps he could be a warlock true there hadnt been a warlock in the demon pride since they lifted out of time but maybe he was the first and that was why he felt so differently about almost everything no had raised his theory with master rawley but the teacher had cuffed his earhole and sent him digging grubs for the other imps there was another thing why couldnt they just once have a cooked meal what would be so horrible about a soft stew and maybe even a few spices why did imps delight in chomping their food down before it stopped wriggling as usual no was the last to school the other dozen or so imps were already in the hall revelling in the thoughts of another day spent hunting skinning butchering and possibly even warping no wasnt feeling particularly hopeful maybe today would be his day but he doubted it the warp spasm was brought on by bloodlust and no had never felt the slightest urge to hurt any other creature he even felt bad for the rabbits he ate and sometimes dreamed that their little spirits were haunting him master rawley sat at his bench sharpening a curved sword every now and then he would hack a chunk from the bench and grunt with satisfaction the desks surface was littered with various weapons for hacking sawing and cutting and of course one book a copy of lady heatherington smythes hedgerow the book leon abbot had brought back from the old world the book that would save them all according to abbot himself when rawley had sharpened the blade to a silver crescent he banged the hilt of the weapon on his bench sit down he roared at the imps and make it fast you shower of stinking rabbit droppings ive got a fresh blade here that im just itching to test the imps hurried to their places rawley would not cut them but he was certainly not above strapping their backs with the flat of his sword and then again maybe he would cut them no squashed in on the end of the fourth row look tough he told himself sneer a bityoure an imp rawley sank his blade into the wood leaving it there quivering the other imps grunted impressed all no could think was show off and hes ruined that bench so pig slime said rawley you want to be demons do you yes master rawley roared the imps you think you have what it takes yes master rawley rawley spread his muscled arms wide he threw back a green head and roared well then let me hear it the imps screamed and stomped bashed their desks with weapons and clattered each other on the shoulders no avoided as much of the consternation as possible while doing his best to seem involved not an easy trick finally rawley settled them down well well see this morning is a big morning for some of you but for others it will be just one more day of dishonour grubhunting with the females he stared pointedly at no but before we get to oozing we have to do some snoozing much groaning from the imps thats right girls history time nothing to kill and nothing to eat just knowledge for the sake of it rawley shrugged his giant knotted shoulders its a waste of time if you ask me but im under orders here thats right master rawley said a voice from the doorway youre under orders the voice belonged to leon abbot himself paying one of his surprise visits to the school abbot was immediately surrounded by adoring imps clamouring to receive a friendly cuff on the ear or to touch his sword abbot endured this adoration for a moment then brushed the imps aside he elbowed rawley out of the prime spot at the head of the class then waited for silence he didnt have to wait long abbot was an impressive specimen even if you didnt know a thing about his past he was almost five feet tall with curved ram horns that jutted from his forehead his armoured scales were deep red and covered his entire torso and forehead very impressive and of course difficult to penetrate you could bash away with an axe all day at abbots chest and get nowhere indeed one of his party tricks was to challenge anyone in the room to hurt him abbot threw back his rawhide cloak and slapped his chest right who wants to have a go several imps nearly warped right then and there make a line ladies said rawley as if he was still in control the imps piled to the head of the class hammering abbot with fist foot and forehead they bounced off every one much to abbots amusement idiots thought no as if they could possibly succeed actually no had a theory about armoured scales a few years ago he had been toying with a discarded baby armoured scale and hed noticed that they were made of dozens of layers which made them almost impossible to breach head on whereas if you went at them at an angle with something hot what about you runt the raucous laughter of his classmates stomped all over nos thoughts no physically twitched with shock as he realized that not only had leon abbot spoken to him he had actually used his dormitory nickname yessir pardon me what abbot thumped his own chest you think you can get through the thickest plates on hybras i doubt theyre the thickest said no s mouth before his brain had a chance to catch up raahhr roared abbot or something similar are you insulting me impling being called impling was even worse than being called runt the term impling was generally reserved for the recently hatched no no of course not master abbot i just thought that naturally some of the older demons would have more layers on their scales but yours are probably tougher no dead layers on the inside abbots slitted eyes squinted at no you seem to know a lot about scales why dont you try to get through these no tried to laugh it off oh i really dont think but abbot wasnt even smiling i really do think runt get your stumpy tail up here before i give master rawley licence to do what he has wanted to do for a long time rawley pulled his blade from the bench and winked at nothis was not a friendly youandishareasecret wink it was a letsseewhatcolouryourinsidesare wink no sloped reluctantly to the head of the class passing the smouldering embers of last nights fire wooden meat skewers jutted from the coals no paused for a beat gazing at the sharp skewers thinking that if he had the guts one of those would probably do the trick abbot followed his gaze whatyou think a meat skewer is going to help you the demon snorted i was buried in molten lava once runt and im still here bring one up do your worst do your worst echoed several of nos classmates their loyalties obvious nl reluctantly selected a wooden needle from the fire the handle was solid enough but the tip was black and flaky no tapped the skewer against his leg to dislodge loose ash abbot grabbed the meat skewer from no s hand holding it aloft this is your chosen weapon he said mockingly the runt thinks hes hunting rabbits the jeers and hoots broke over nos furrowed brow like a wave he could feel one of his headaches coming on he could always count on one to show up just when it was least wanted this is probably a bad idea he admitted t should just pound on your armoured plates like those other morons i mean my classmates no no said abbot handing back the skewer you go ahead little bee prick me with your sting prick me with your sting warbled no in a highly insulting imitation of the pride leader of course he didnt warble this aloud no was rarely confrontational outside his head aloud he said ill do my best master abbot ill do my best master abbot warbled abbot in a highly insulting imitation of imp no as loudly as he could no felt beads of sweat spiral down his stumpy tail there really was no good way out of this situation if he failed then he was in for another bout of jeering and mild personal injury but if he won then he really lost abbot knocked on the crown of his head hello runt lets get moving there are imps here waiting to warp no stared at the tip of the skewer and allowed the problem to take over he placed the flat of his right hand on abbots chest then wrapping his fingers tightly round the thick end he twisted the skewer upwards into one of abbots armoured scales he twisted slowly concentrating on the point of contact the scale greyed slightly with ash but no penetration acrid smoke twirled round the skewer abbot chuckled delighted trying to start a fire there runt should i summon the water brigade one of the imps threw his lunch at no it slid down the back of his head a lump of fat bone and gristle no persisted rolling the skewer between thumb and forefinger he rolled faster now feeling the skewer take hold burning a slight indent no felt an excitement build in him he tried to contain it think about consequences but he couldnt he was on the point of success here he was just about to accomplish with brains something all these other idiots couldnt do with brawn of course they would pummel him and abbot would invent some excuse to undermine his achievement but no would know and so would abbot the skewer penetrated just a fraction no felt the plate give way perhaps a single layer the little imp felt something he had never felt before triumph the feeling built inside him irresistible unquenchable it became more than a feeling it transformed into a force rebuilding some forgotten neural pathways releasing an ancient energy inside no whats happening wondered no should i stop can i stop yes and no were the answers to those questions yes he should stop but no he couldnt the force flowed through his limbs raising his temperature he heard voices chanting inside his mind no realized that he was chanting with them chanting what he had no idea but somehow his memory knew the strange force throbbed in nos fingers in time with his heartbeat then pulsed out of his body into the skewer the pin turned to stone wood morphed to granite before his eyes the rock virus spread along the shaft rippling like water in the flash of a spark the skewer was completely made of stone it expanded slightly into the breach in abbots armoured plate the expansion cracked the plate open a couple of centimetres abbot heard the noise so did everybody else the demon pride leader flicked his eyes downwards and realized instantly what was going on magic he hissed the word was out before he could stop it with a vicious swipe he swatted the skewer away from his torso into the fire no stared at his throbbing hand power still shimmered around his fingertips a tiny heat haze magic he repeated that means i must be a shut your stupid mouth snapped abbot covering the cracked scale with his cloak obviously i dont mean actual magic i mean trickery you twist the handle on that skewer to make it crack then you ooh and aah as though you have actually achieved something no pulled at abbots cloak but your scale abbot drew the cloak tighter what about my scale theres not a mark on it not so much as a smear you believe me dont you no sighed this was leon abbot the truth meant nothing yes master abbot i believe you i can tell by your insolent tone that you do not very well proof then abbot whipped back his cloak revealing an unblemished scale for a moment no thought he saw a blue spark playing about where the mark had definitely been but then the spark winked itself out blue sparks could it be magic abbot jabbed the imps chest with a rigid finger weve talked about this number one i know you think youre a warlock but there are no warlocks there havent been since we lifted out of time you are not a warlock forget that idiotic notion and concentrate on warping youre a disgrace to your race no was about to risk a protest when he was grabbed roughly by the arm you slippery little snail shouted rawley spittle spattering nos face trying to trick the pride leader get back to your place ill deal with you later no could do nothing but return to the bench and bear the insults of his classmates and there were plenty of those usually accompanied by a missile or blow but somehow no ignored these latest humiliations staring instead at his own hand the one that had turned wood to stone could it be true could he actually be a warlock and if he was would that make him feel better or worse a toothpick bounced off his forehead on to the bench there was a sliver of grey meat stuck to the end no glanced up to find rawley grinning at him been trying to get that out for weeks wild boar i think now pay attention runt master abbot is trying to educate you oh yes the history lesson it was amazing how much leon abbot managed to insert himself into demon history to hear him tell it you would think that he had singlehandedly saved the eighth family in spite of the meddling warlocks abbot studied the hooked talons on his fingertips each one could gut a large pig if abbots own stories were true he had warped at age eight while wrestling one of the islands wild dogs his fingernails had actually changed into talons during the fight lacerating the dogs side no found this story highly unlikely it took hours to warp fully sometimes days but abbot expected them to believe that his warp was instantaneous hogwash and yet all the other imps lapped up these selfglorifying legends of all the demons who fought in the last battle attaillte droned abbot in what he probably thought was a good voice for history lessons but in what no thought was a boring enough voice to turn soft cheese hard i leon abbot am the last convenient thought no nobody left around to argue he also thought you look your age leon too many barrels of pork fat no was an uncharitable imp when in a bad mood it is the nature of out of time spells that the ageing process is drastically slowed abbot had been a young buck when the warlocks lifted hybras out of time and so the spell combined with good genes had kept him and his huge ego alive ever since possibly a thousand years of course that was a thousand years normal time in hybras time a millennium meant very little a couple of centuries could skip by in the blink of an eye on the island an imp could wake up one morning to find that hed evolved a while back every demon and imp in hybras got up one morning with a stubby tail where his magnificent long one used to be for a considerable time after that the most common noises on the island were the sounds of demons falling down or swearing as they got up again after that great battle in which the demon battalions were the bravest and fiercest in the peoples army continued abbot to hoots of approval from the imps we were defeated by treachery and cowardice the elves would not fight and the dwarfs would not dig traps we had no choice but to cast our spell and regroup until the time was right to return more hooting plus stamping of feet every time thought no do we have to go through this every time these imps act like they never heard this story before when is someone going to stand up and say excuse me old news move on and so we breed we breed and grow strong now our army has over five thousand warriors surely enough to defeat the humans i know this because i leon abbot have been to the world and returned to hybras alive this was abbots golden nugget this was where anyone who stood against him withered and blew away abbot had not come directly to limbo with the rest of hybras for some reason he had been diverted to the human future then sucked across to hybras he had seen the human camps and actually brought his knowledge home how all this happened was a bit hazy according to abbot there had been a great battle hed defeated fifty or so men then a mysterious warlock had lifted him out of time again but not before hed grabbed a couple of things to bring back since the warlocks had been explosively removed from the eighth family nobody had much of a clue about magic any more normal demons had no magic of their own it had been thought that all the warlocks had been sucked into space during the transferral of hybras from earth to limbo but according to abbot one had survived this warlock was in league with the humans and had only helped the demon leader under threat of grievous injury no was highly sceptical of this version of events first of all because it came from abbot and secondly because warlocks were being cast once more in a bad light demons seemed to forget that if it wasnt for the warlocks hybras would have been overrun by humans on this particular day no was feeling a special attachment to the warlocks and he did not appreciate their memory being sullied by this loudmouth braggart hardly a day went past where no did not spend a moment praying for the return of the mysterious warlock who had helped abbot and now that he was certain of magic in his own blood no would pray all the harder the moon separated me from the rest of the island during the great journey continued abbot his eyes half closed as if the memory had him in a swoon i was powerless to resist her charms and so i travelled through space and time until i came to rest in the new world which is now the world of men the humans clamped silver on my ankles tried to make me submit but i would not abbot hunched his massive shoulders and roared at the roof for i am demonkind and we will never submit needless to say the imps went into overdrive the entire room heaved with their exertions in nos opinion abbots entire performance was wooden to say the least the we will never submit speech was the oldest page in abbots book no rubbed his temples trying to ease the headache there was worse to come he knew first the book then the crossbow if abbot didnt deviate from the script and why would he he hadnt in all the years since his return from the new world and so i fought shouted abbot i kicked off their shackles and hybras called me home but before i took my leave of the hated humans i fought my way to their altar and stole away with two of their blessed objects the book and the bow muttered no rolling his orange eyes tell us what you stole begged the others on cue as if they didnt know the book and the bow proclaimed leon abbot pulling the objects from beneath his robe as if by magic as if by magic thought no but not actual magic because then abbot would be a warlock and he couldnt possibly be a warlock as he had already warped and warlocks did not warp now we know how the humans think said abbot waving the book and how they fight he proclaimed brandishing the crossbow i dont believe any of this for a minute thought no or i wouldnt if we had minutes in limbo oh how i wish i was on earth with the last warlock then there would be two of us and i would find out what really happened when leon abbot came calling and armed with this knowledge we can return when the time spell fades and retake the old country when cried the imps when soon replied abbot soon and there will be humans enough for us all they will be crushed like the grass beneath our boots we will tear their heads off like dandelion flowers oh please thought no enough plant similes it was quite possible that no was the only creature on hybras who ever even thought the human word simile saying it aloud would have certainly earned him a thrashing if the other imps knew that his human vocabulary also included words like grooming and decoration they would string him up for sure ironically he had learned these words from lady heatherington smythes hedgerow which was supposed to be a school text tear their heads off shouted one imp and it quickly became a chant taken up by everyone in the room yes tear their heads off said no trying it out but there was no feeling in his voice whats my motivation he wondered ive never even met a human the imps climbed on their benches bobbing in primal rhythm tear their heads off tear their heads off abbot and rawley urged them on flexing their claws and howling a sickly sweet smell clogged the air warp muck someone was entering the warp spasm phase the excitement was bringing on the change no felt nothing not so much as a twinge he tried his best squeezing his eyelids together letting the pressure build in his head thinking bloody thoughts but his true feelings shattered the false visions of bloodlust and carnage its no use he thought i am not that kind of demon no stopped chanting and sat head in hands no point in pretending another change cycle was passing him by not so the other imps abbots theatrics had opened a natural well of testosterone bloodlust and bodily fluid one by one they succumbed to the warp spasm green gunge flowed from their pores slowly at first then in bubbling gushes they all went under every one of them it must be some kind of record so many imps warping simultaneously of course abbot would take the credit the sight of the fluid brought on fresh rounds of howling and the more the imps howled the faster the gunge spurted no had heard it said that humans took several years to make the transition from childhood to adulthood imps did it in a few hours and a change like that is going to hurt the howls of exultation changed to grunts of pain as bones stretched and horns curled the gungecoated limbs already lengthening the smell was sweet enough to make nl gag imps toppled to the floor all around they thrashed for a few seconds then their own fluids mummified them they were cocooned like enormous green bugs strapped tight by the hardening gunge the schoolroom was suddenly silent except for the crack of drying nutrient fluid and a rustle of flames from the stone fireplace abbot beamed a toothy smile that seemed to split his head in half a good mornings work wouldnt you say rawley i got them all warping rawley grunted his agreement then noticed no except the runt well of course not began abbot then caught himself yes absolutely except the runt nos forehead burned under rawley and abbots scrutiny i want to warp he said looking at his fingers i really do but its the hating thing i just cant manage it and all that slime even the thought of that stuff all over me makes me feel a bit nauseous a bit what said rawley suspiciously no realized that he needed to dumb it down for his teacher sick a bit sick oh rawley shook his head in disgust slime makes you sick what kind of imp are you the others live for slime no took a deep breath and said something aloud that he had known for a long time im not like the others nos voice trembled he was on the verge of tears are you going to cry asked rawley his eyes bugging this is too much leon hes going to cry now just like a female i give up abbot scratched his chin let me try something he rummaged in a cape pocket surreptitiously fixing something over his hand oh no thought no please no not stony abbot raised a forearm his cloak draped over it a ministage a puppet human poked his head over the leather cape the puppets head was a grotesque ball of painted clay with a heavy forehead and clumsy features no doubted that humans were this ugly in real life but demons were not known for their artistic skills abbot often produced stony as a visual incentive for those imps who were having difficulty warping needless to say no had been introduced to the puppet before grrr said the puppet or rather abbot said as he waggled the puppet grrr my name is stony the mud man hello stony said no weakly howve you been the puppet held a tiny wooden sword in its hand never mind how ive been i dont care how youve been because i hate all fairies said abbot in a squeaky voice i drove them from their homes and if they ever try to come back i will kill them all abbot lowered the puppet now how does that make you feel it makes me feel that the wrong demon is in charge of the pride thought no but aloud he said eh angry abbot blinked angry really no confessed no wringing his hands i dont feel anything its a puppet i can see your fingers through the material abbot stuffed stony back in his pocket thats it ive had it with you number one you will never earn a name from the book once demons warped they were given a human name from lady heatherington smythes hedgerow the logic being that learning the human language and possessing a human name would help the demon army think like humans and therefore defeat them abbot may have hated the mud men but that wasnt to say he didnt admire them also politically it was a good idea to have every demon on hybras calling each other by names that leon abbot had procured for them rawley grabbed nos ear dragging him from his seat to the rear of the classroom a metal grille on the floor covered a shallow pungent dung pit get to work runt he said gruffly you know what to do no sighed he knew only too well this wasnt the first or second time hed had to endure this odious task he hefted a longhandled gaff from a peg on the wall pulling the heavy grille from its groove the smell was rank but not unbearable as a crust had formed on the dungs surface beetles crawled across the craggy skin their legs clicking like claws on wood no uncovered the pit completely then selected his nearest classmate there was no way of telling which classmate it actually was because of the slime cocoon the only movements were small air bubbles around the mouth and nose at least he hoped it was the mouth and nose no bent low rolling the cocoon along the floor and into the dung pit the warping imp crashed through the crust taking a dozen beetles with him into the muck below a gush of dung stink washed over and he knew his skin would smell for days the others would wear their pit stink proudly but for no it was just another badge of shame it was arduous work not all the warping imps were still several struggled inside their cocoons and twice demon claws punctured the green chrysalis centimetres from nls skin he persisted groaning loudly in the hope that rawley or leon abbot would lend a hand it was a vain hope the two demons were huddled at the head of the classroom poring over lady heatherington smythes hedgerow eventually no rolled his last classmate into the dung pit they were piled in there like meat in a thick stew the nutrientrich dung would accelerate their warp ensuring they reached full potential no sat on the stone floor catching his breath lucky you thought no dunked in dung no tried to feel envious but even being near the pit made him gag the thought of being immersed in it surrounded by cocooned imps made his stomach churn a shadow fell across the flagstones before him flickering in the firelight ah number one said abbot always an imp never a demon eh what am i going to do with you no stared at his own feet clicking baby talons on the floor master abbot sir dont you think isnt there the tiniest chance he took a deep breath and raised his eyes to meet abbots couldnt i be a warlock you saw what happened with the skewer i dont want to embarrass you but you saw it abbots expression changed instantly one second he was playing the genial master the next his true colours shone through i saw nothing he hissed heaving no to his feet nothing happened you odious little freak of nature the skewer was coated with ash nothing more there was no transformation no magic abbot drew no close enough to see the slivers of trapped meat between his yellowed teeth the next time he spoke his voice seemed different somehow layered as though an entire choir was singing in harmony it was a voice that could not be ignored magical if you are a warlock then you should really be on the other side with your relative wouldnt that be for the best one quick leap thats all it would take do you understand what i am saying to you runt no nodded dazed what a lovely voice where had that come from the other side of course thats where he should go one small step for an imp i understand sir good the subject is closed as lady heatherington smythe would say best foot forward young sir the world awaits no nodded just as he knew abbot wanted him to but inside his brain churned along with his stomach was this to be the whole extent of his life forever mocked forever different never a moment of light or hope unless he crossed over abbots suggestion was his only hope cross over no had never seen the appeal of jumping into a crater before but now the notion seemed nigh on irresistible he was a warlock there couldnt be any doubt and somewhere out there in the human world there was another like him an ancient brother who could teach him the ways of his kind no watched abbot stride away from him off to exercise his power on some other part of the island possibly by belittling the females in the compound another of his favourite pastimes then again how bad could abbot be after all he had given no this wonderful idea i cannot stay here thought no i must go to the volcano the notion took firm hold of his brain and in minutes it had drowned out all the other notions in his head go to the volcano it pounded inside his skull like waves breaking on the shore obey abbot go to the volcano no brushed the dust from his knees you know what he muttered to himself in case rawley could hear i think im going to the volcano chapter mission impossible the massimo bellini theater catania eastern sicily artemis fowl and his bodyguard butler relaxed in a private box at the stageleft side of sicilys worldfamous massimo bellini theatre perhaps it is not altogether accurate to say butler relaxed rather he appeared to relax as a tiger appears to relax in the moment before it strikes butler was even less happy here than he had been in barcelona at least for the spain trip hed had a few days to prepare but for this jaunt he barely had time to catch up on his martial arts routines as soon as the fowl bentley had pulled up at fowl manor artemis had disappeared into his study firing up his computers butler took the opportunity to work out freshen up and prepare dinner onion marmalade tartlets rack of lamb with garlic gratin and a red berries crepe to finish artemis broke the news over coffee we need to go to sicily he said toying with the biscotti on his saucer i made a breakthrough on the time spell figures how soon asked the bodyguard mentally listing his contacts on the mediterranean island artemis looked at his rado watch and butler moaned dont check your watch artemis check the calendar sorry old friend but you know time is limited i cant risk missing a materialization but on the jet you said that there wasnt another materialization due for six weeks i was wrong or rather foaly was wrong he missed a few new factors in the temporal equation artemis had filled butler in on the eighth family details as the jet soared over the english channel allow me to demonstrate said artemis he put a silver salt cellar on his plate let us say that this salt cellar is hybras my plate is where it is our dimension and your plate is where it wants to go limbo with me so far butler nodded reluctantly he knew that the more he understood the more artemis would tell him and there wasnt much space in a bodyguards head for quantum physics so the demon warlocks wanted to move the island from plate a to plate b but not through space through time how do you know all this its all in the fairy book replied the irish teenager quite a detailed description if a bit flowery the book was the fairy bible containing their history and commandments artemis had managed to obtain a copy from a drunken sprite in ho chi minh city years earlier it was proving to be an invaluable source of information i doubt the book has too many charts and graphs noted butler artemis smiled no i got the specifics from foaly not that he knows hes sharing information butler rubbed his temples artemis i warned you not to mess with foaly the decoy thing is bad enough artemis was fully aware that foaly was tracking him and any decoys he sent out in fact he only sent out the decoys to make foaly dip into his funds it was his idea of a joke i didnt initiate the surveillance objected artemis foaly did i found over a dozen devices on my computers alone all i did was reverse the spike to get into some of his shared files nothing classified well maybe a few foalys been busy since he left the lep so what did foalys files tell you said butler resignedly they told me about magic basically magic is energy and the ability to manipulate energy to move hybras from a to b the demon warlocks harnessed the power of their volcano to create a time rent or tunnel artemis rolled his napkin into a tube popped the salt cellar into it and deposited the cellar on butlers plate simple as that said butler doubtfully not really said artemis in fact the warlocks did an exceptional job considering the instruments available to them at the time they had to calculate the power of the volcano the size of the island the energy of each individual demon on the island not to mention the reverse pull of lunar attraction its amazing the spell worked as well as it did there was a glitch yes according to the book the warlocks induced the volcano but the force was too strong they couldnt control it and the magic circle was broken hybras and the demons were transported but the warlocks were blasted into space butler whistled thats quite a glitch its more than a glitch the demon warlocks were all killed so now the rest of the pride are stuck in limbo held by a magical spell that was never meant to be permanent without a warlock to bring them back couldnt foaly go and get them no it would be an impossible mission to recreate the same circumstances imagine trying to steer a feather in a sandstorm then land the feather on a particular grain of sand except you dont know where the grain is and even if you did know where the grain was demon magic can only be controlled by a demon they are by far the most powerful of warlocks tricky admitted butler so tell me why these demons are popping up here now artemis corrected him with a wagging finger not just here and not just now the demons have always felt an attraction to their home world a combination of lunar and terrestrial radiations but a demon could only be pulled back if he was at his end of the timetunnel mouth the crater and not wearing a dimensional anchor butler fingered his wristband silver thats right now because of massively increased radiation levels worldwide the pull on demons is much stronger and reaches critical level with greater frequency butler was struggling to keep up sometimes it was not easy being a geniuss bodyguard artemis i thought we werent going into specifics artemis continued regardless he was hardly going to stop now in midlecture bear with me old friend nearly there so now energy spikes occur more often than foaly thinks butler raised a finger ah yes but the demons are ok as long as they stay away from the crater artemis raised a triumphant finger yes he crowed thats what you would think thats what foaly thinks but when our last demon was off course i ran the equation from back to front my conclusion is that the time spell is decaying the tunnel is unravelling artemis allowed the napkin tube to widen in his hand now the catchment area is bigger as is the deposit area pretty soon demons wont be safe anywhere on hybras butler asked the obvious question what happens when the tunnel decays altogether just before that happens demons all over hybras will be plucked off the island silver or no silver when the tunnel collapses some will be deposited on earth more on the moon and the rest scattered through space and time one thing is for sure not many of them will survive and those that do will be locked up in laboratories and zoos butler frowned we need to tell holly about this yes agreed artemis but not just yet i need one more day to confirm my figures im not going to foaly with nothing but theory dont tell me said butler sicily right so now they were in the massimo bellini theatre and butler had barely half an idea why they were there if a demon materialized on that stage then artemis was right and the fairy people were in major trouble and if the fairies were in trouble then it was up to artemis to help them butler was actually quite proud that his young charge was doing something for somebody else for a change even so they had only a week to complete their task and return to fowl manor because in seven days artemiss parents returned from rhode island where artemis fowl senior had finally taken possession of an artificial biohybrid leg to replace the one he had lost when the russian mafiya blew up his ship butler peered out of the box at the hundreds of golden arches and the thirteen hundredodd people enjoying the evenings performance of bellinis norma first a gaudi building now this theatre commented the bodyguard his words audible only to artemis thanks to their boxs isolation and the booming volume of the opera dont these demons ever materialize somewhere quiet artemis replied in a whisper just let the sublime music flow over you enjoy the show dont you know how difficult it is to get a box for a vincenzo bellini opera especially norma norma combines the requirements of both a coloratura and a dramatic soprano and the soprano is excellent comparable to callas herself butler grunted perhaps it was difficult for ordinary people to get a box in the theatre but artemis had simply called his billionaire environmentalist friend giovanni zito the sicilian had gladly surrendered his own box in exchange for two cases of the finest bordeaux hardly surprising since artemis had recently invested over ten million euros in zitos water purification research a sicilian drinking bordeaux artemis had chuckled down the phone you should be ashamed of yourself keep your watch pointed at the stage directed artemis interrupting butlers thoughts the chances are miniscule that a demon will be caught without silver even away from the crater but if one does show up i want it on film to prove to foaly that my theory is correct if we dont have incontrovertible proof the fairy council will never take action butler checked that his watch crystal that doubled as a camera lens was angled towards the stage the camera is fine but if you dont mind i wont be letting the sublime music flow over me i have enough to do keeping you safe the bellini theatre was a bodyguards nightmare multiple entrances and exits over a thousand patrons that refused to be frisked hundreds of golden arches that could conceal a gunman and countless nooks crannies and corridors that probably didnt appear on the theatre plan nevertheless butler was reasonably confident that he had done all he could to protect artemis of course there were certain things that bodyguards could not guard against as butler was about to find out invisible things artemiss phone vibrated gently usually artemis deplored the kind of person who kept their phone on during a performance but this phone was special and he never turned it off it was the fairy communicator given to him by holly short plus a few modifications and addons made by artemis himself the phone was the size and shape of a twoeuro coin with a pulsing red crystal at its centre this was a fairy omnisensor which could interface with any communications system including the human body the phone was disguised as a rather ostentatious ring on artemiss middle finger artemis twisted the ring so that the phone sat on his palm then closed his middle fingers extending his thumb and little finger the sensor would decode vibrations in his little finger and send them as voice patterns it would also use the bones in his hand to transmit the callers voice to the tip of his thumb artemis looked for all the world like a young boy talking on an imaginary phone holly he said butler watched as artemis listened for a few moments then hung up twisting the phone back into ring position he looked steadily at butler dont draw your weapon he said which of course had butler reaching for the butt of his sig sauer its fine said artemis reassuringly someone is here a friend butlers hand dropped to his side he knew who it was holly short materialized in the velvetcovered seat beside artemis her knees were drawn to her chin and her pointed ears were covered by a black helmet as she fizzled into the visible spectrum a fullface visor collapsed into sections and stored itself in her helmet her arrival among the humans was covered by the theatres darkness afternoon mud boys she said smiling her hazel eyes sparkled impishly or more accurately elfishly thanks for calling ahead said butler sarcastically wouldnt want to spook anyone no shimmer usually when fairies used their magic to shield the only thing visible was a slight shimmer like a heat haze hollys entrance had been completely undetectable holly patted her own shoulder new suit made entirely from smart wafers it vibrates with me artemis studied one of the wafers noting the microfilaments in the material foalys work section eight issue holly could not hide her surprise she punched artemis playfully on the shoulder how do you know about section eight arent we allowed any secrets foaly shouldnt spy on me said artemis where theres a way in theres a way back i suppose i should congratulate you on the new job and foaly too he nodded at the tiny lens over hollys right eye is he watching us now no hes trying to figure out how you know what he doesnt were taping though i presume youre talking about demons i might be butler stepped between them interrupting the verbal sparring that was bound to follow before you two get into negotiations how about a real hello holly smiled fondly at the huge bodyguard she activated the electronic wings built into her suit and hovered to his eye level holly kissed his cheek then wrapped her arms all the way round his head they barely made it butler rapped her helmet nice equipment not runofthemill lower elements police no agreed holly removing the helmet this section eight stuff is years ahead of standard lep you get what you pay for i suppose butler plucked the helmet from her hands anything an old soldier would be interested in holly pressed a button on her wrist computer check out the night vision its as clear as well day and the clever thing is that the filter reacts to light as it passes through so no more being blinded by camera flashes butler nodded appreciatively night visions major drawback had historically been that it left the soldier vulnerable to sudden flashes of light even a candle flame could blind the wearer momentarily artemis cleared his throat excuse me captain are you two going to weep salty tears of admiration over a helmet all night or do we have matters to discuss holly winked at butler your master calls i better see what he wants holly deactivated her wings settling into the chair she folded her arms looking artemis straight in the eyes ok mud boy im all yours demons we need to talk about demons hollys eyes lost their playful twinkle and why are you so interested in demons artemis artemis opened two shirt buttons and pulled out a gold coin on a thong the coin had a circular hole in the centre put there by a blast from hollys laser you gave this to me after you saved my fathers life i owe you i owe the people so now im doing something for them holly wasnt entirely convinced usually before you do anything for the people you negotiate a fee artemis accepted the accusation with a slight nod its true it was true but i have changed holly folded her arms and and its nice to find something foaly missed even if i did stumble on to it by accident and artemis sighed very well there is another factor i thought so what do you want gold technology no nothing like that artemis sat forward in his seat have you any idea how difficult it is to have had all those thrilling adventures with the lep and suddenly not be a part of that world any more yes replied holly actually i do i went from saving the world to geometry in a week im bored holly my intellect is not being challenged so when i came across the demon gospel in the book i realized that here was a way to be involved without affecting things i could simply observe and perhaps refine foalys calculations which are not actually in the book holly pointed out simply observe my foot artemis waved hollys point away some harmless hacking the centaur started it so i began travelling to materialization sites but nothing happened until barcelona a demon showed up all right except he showed up in the wrong place and late i simply stumbled across him i would be floating in prehistoric space right now if butler hadnt anchored me to this dimension with silver holly stifled a laugh so it was luck the great artemis fowl trumps the mighty foaly thanks to dumb luck artemis was miffed informed luck i think is a better description anyway that is unimportant i have recalculated with the new figures and my conclusions if borne out could be calamitous for the people go on tell me in short words though you wouldnt believe the amount of science i had to listen to today this is serious holly snapped artemis his outburst was followed by a chorus of shushes from the audience this is serious he repeated in hushed tones why asked holly surely its just a matter of sharing your new figures and letting foaly take care of the rest with lightdistortion projectors not quite said artemis settling back in his chair if a demon appears on that stage in the next four minutes then soon there wont be enough projectors to go round if im right and the time spell is unravelling then hybras and everyone on it will soon be dragged back into this dimension most of the demons wont make it alive but those who do could pop up anywhere and at any time holly switched her gaze to the stage a ravenhaired woman was holding ridiculously high notes for a ridiculously long time holly wondered if the woman would even notice a demon popping out of the air for a second or two there wasnt supposed to be a materialization today if there was then that would mean artemis was right as usual and a lot more demons were on the way if that happened then artemis fowl and holly short would be up to their necks in the whole savingthefairyrace thing yet again holly glanced sideways at artemis who was studying the stage through a pair of opera glasses she would never tell him but if a human had to be involved with saving the fairy people then artemis was probably the best man or boy for the job the island of hybras limbo no struggled up towards the first rocky ridge on the side of the volcano several demons passed him on the trail but not one tried to talk him out of it in fact hed bumped into hadley shrivelington basset who had offered to scratch a map on a piece of bark for him no suspected that if he did take the big dimensional jump no one would miss him any more than they would miss their favourite crossbow target except perhaps the demoness with red markings who smiled at him the one from the compound maybe she would miss him a little no stopped in his tracks when he realized that the only demon who would care if he was gone was one he had never spoken to he moaned aloud how depressing was that no trudged onwards past the final warning which with typical demon subtlety was in the form of a bloodreddened wolf skull mounted on a stick whats that even supposed to mean muttered no as he passed the sign a wolfs head on a stick big wolf barbecue tonight bring your own wolf barbecue another word from lady heatherington smythe no sat on the ridge wiggling his rump to dig a little trench for his tail might as well be comfortable before jumping the hundred or so metres into the mouth of a steaming volcano of course even if he didnt get whisked away to the old country the still wouldnt be vaporized by the lava no he would probably be dashed against the rocks on the way down what a cheery thought from his seat on the ridge no could see the jagged mouth of the crater and the rhythmic wisps of smoke that drifted skywards like the breath of a sleeping giant it was the nature of the time spell that things progressed as though hybras were still attached to the rest of the world albeit at a different pace so the volcano still bubbled and occasionally burped up a skinny column of flame even though there was no earth beneath it if no was honest with himself his resolve was wavering it was easy to imagine hopping into an interdimensional crater when you were rolling your cocooned classmates into a becrusted dung pit it had seemed then as the flakes of ash had fluttered down on him that things could not get any worse and there had been something in abbots voice that made the idea seem irresistible but now sitting on the ridge with a gentle wind cooling his chest plates things didnt seem quite as bleak at least he was alive and there was no guarantee that the crater led anywhere except into the belly of the volcano none of the other demons had made it back alive they came back all right some encased in blocks of ice some burned to a crisp but none hale and hearty like the pride leader although for some reason when no thought about abbot the many moments of cruelty he had suffered at the pride leaders whim seemed hazy hard to focus on all he could remember was that beautiful insistent voice telling him to cross over moon madness that was the heart of the matter demonkind was attracted to the moon it sang to them agitating particles in their blood they dreamed of it at night and ground their teeth at its absence at any hour of the socalled day here on hybras demons could be seen stopping in their tracks to gaze at the space where the moon used to be it was part of them a live organic part and on an atomic level they belonged together there were threads of the time spell still in the crater wisps of magic that curled about the mountain top snagging any demon stupid enough to be caught without silver and coded inside the magic was the song of the moon calling the demons back enticing them with visions of white light and weightlessness once those pale tendrils had a grip on a demons mind he would do anything to be closer to the source the magic and moon madness would pour energy into the atoms of his being vibrating his very electrons to a new orbit changing his molecular structure pulling him through time and space but there was only abbots word that this journey would end on earth it could end on the moon and as much as demons loved the moon they knew that nothing survived on its barren surface the elders said that sprites could not fly close without freezing to death spiralling to earth with frozen wings and blue faces for some reason no wanted to take the journey today he wanted the moon to call him into the crater then deposit him somewhere where another warlock existed someone who would teach him to control his strange powers but he admitted miserably he didnt have the courage he could not just hurl himself into a rocky crater the volcanos base was littered with the charred corpses of those who had imagined the moon calling to them how could he know if the moons power was truly beckoning or if it was simply wishful thinking no rested his face in his hands nothing for it but to return to the school the imps in the pit would need turning or their hides could suffer dung lividity marks he sighed this was not the first time he had made this desperate journey but now no really thought he would do it abbot was in his head urging him on he could almost bear the idea of the rocks rushing towards him almost no toyed with the silver bangle on his wrist it would have been so easy to slip off this trinket and just disappear slip it off then little one said a voice in his head slip it off and come to me no was not surprised by the voice actually it was more a feeling than a voice no had supplied the words himself he often conversed with voices in his head there was no one else to talk to there was flambard the shoemaker and lady bonnie the spinster and his favourite bookie the lisping gossip this voice was new more forceful a moment without silver and a new world could be yours nos bottom lip jutted as he considered he could remove the bangle he supposed just for a moment what harm could it do he was nowhere near the crater and the magic rarely strayed beyond the volcano no harm no harm at all one little tug the ridiculous notion had no now taking off the bangle could be like a practice run for the day when he finally worked up the courage to feel the moon madness his fingers traced the runes on the bangle they were precisely the same as the markings on his chest a double charm repelling the moon magic removing one meant that the force of his own markings was reversed pulling him straight towards the moon take it off reverse the power no watched his fingers grip the bangles rim he was in a daze a buzzing fugue the new voice had coated his mind with fog and was in control we will be together you and i you will bask in my light bask in my light thought the last conscious sliver of no this new voice is quite the drama queen bookie is not going to like you take it off little one no watched his hand tug the bangle over his knuckles he was powerless to stop himself not that he wanted to moon madness he realized with a jolt all the way over here how can that be something in him knew the warlock part of him perhaps the time spell is breaking down no one is safe no saw the bangle his dimensional anchor slip from his fingers and spin to the ground it seemed to happen in slow motion the silver flowed and rippled like sunlight through water no felt the tingle that comes when every atom in your body is overloaded with energy and boosted into a gaseous form it really should be terribly painful but the body doesnt really know how to respond to this kind of cell damage and so throws up a pathetic tingling there was no time to scream all no could do was disappear into a million flashing pinpoints of light which quickly wound themselves into a tight band following a path to another dimension in seconds there was nothing left to show that no had ever been there but a spinning silver bangle it would be a long time relatively speaking before anyone missed him and no one would care enough to come looking the massimo bellini theatre sicily to look at artemis fowl you would have thought that he was here simply for the opera one hand trained a pair of opera glasses on the stage the other hand conducted expertly following the score note for note maria callas is the acknowledged seminal norma he said to holly who nodded politely then rolled her eyes at butler but i have a confession i actually prefer montserrat caballe she took the role on in the seventies of course i have only heard recordings but to me caballes performance is more robust really said holly im trying to care artemis really but i thought it was all supposed to be over when the fat lady sings well shes singing but it doesnt appear to be over artemis smiled exposing his incisors thats wagner youre thinking of butler did not participate in the operarelated chitchat to him it was just another layer of distraction to be zoned out instead he decided to test the nightvision filter on hollys new helmet if it could indeed overcome the whiteout problem as holly claimed then he would have to ask artemis to procure one for him needless to say hollys helmet would not fit butlers head in fact it would barely slot over his fist so the bodyguard folded the filters left wing out until he could squint through it by holding the helmet to his cheek the effect was impressive the filter successfully equalized the light throughout the building it boosted or dimmed so that every person in the building was seen in the same light those on the stage appeared caked in makeup and those in the boxes had no shadows to hide in butler panned across the boxes satisfying himself that there was no threat present he saw plenty of nosepicking and handholding sometimes by the same people but nothing obviously dangerous but in a secondtier box adjacent to the stage there was a girl with a head of blonde curls all dressed up for a night of theatre butler immediately recalled seeing the same girl at the materialization site in barcelona and now she was here too coincidence there was no such thing in the bodyguards experience if you saw a stranger more than once either they were following you or you were both after the same thing he scanned the rest of the box there were two men behind the girl one in his fifties paunchy expensive tuxedo was filming the stage with his mobilephone camera this was the first man from barcelona the second man was there too possibly chinese wiry spiked hair he had apparently not yet recovered from his leg injury and was adjusting one of his crutches he flipped it round removed a rubber grip from the foot then nestled it against his shoulder like a rifle butler automatically moved between artemis and the mans line of fire not that the crutch was aimed at his charge it was pointed stage right a metre from the soprano just where artemis was expecting his demon to show up holly he said in a low calm voice i think you should shield artemis lowered his opera glasses problems maybe replied butler though not for us i think somebody else knows about the new materialization figures and i think theyre planning to do more than just observe artemis tapped his chin with two fingers thinking fast where tier two beside the stage i see one possible weapon trained on the stage not a standard gun maybe a modified dart rifle artemis leaned forward gripping the brass rail they plan to take the demon alive if one turns up in that case they will need a distraction holly was on her feet what can we do its too late to stop them said artemis a frown slashing his brow if we interfere we may upset the distraction in which case the demon will be exposed if these people are clever enough to be here you may be sure their plan is a good one holly claimed her helmet slotting it over her ears air pads automatically inflated to cradle her head i cant just let them kidnap a fairy you have no choice snapped artemis risking the audiences displeasure best and most likely case scenario nothing happens no materialization holly scowled you know as well as i do that fortune never sends the bestcase scenario our way you have too much bad karma artemis had to chuckle youre right of course worstcase scenario a demon appears they anchor it with the dart rifle we interfere and in the confusion the demon is swept up by the local polizia and we all end up in custody not good so we just sit back and watch butler and i sit back and watch you get over there and record as much data as possible and when these people go you go after them holly activated her wings they slid from her backpack crackling blue as the flight computer sent a charge through them how much time do i have asked holly as she faded from sight artemis checked the stopwatch on his watch if you hurry he said none holly launched herself out over the audience controlling her trajectory using the joystick built into the thumb of her glove she soared above the gathered humans invisible with the aid of her helmets filters she could clearly see the occupants of the stageside box artemis was wrong there was time to stop this all she had to do was throw the shooters aim off a little the demon would never get anchored and section could track these mud men at their leisure it was simply a matter of touching the marksmans elbow with her buzz baton to make him lose control of all his motor functions for a few seconds plenty of time for a demon to appear then disappear then holly smelled burning ozone and felt heat on her arm artemis was not wrong there was no time someone was coming no appeared on the stage more or less intact the trip had cost him the last knuckle on his right index finger and about two gigabytes worth of memories but they were mostly bad memories and he had never been very good with his hands dematerialization isnt a particularly painful process but materialization happens to be a thoroughly enjoyable one the brain is so happy to register all the bodys essential bits and bobs coming together again that it releases a surge of happy endorphins no looked at the nub where his previously whole index finger used to be look he said tittering no finger then he noticed the humans scores of them arranged in rings rising up to the heavens no knew instantly what this must be a theatre im in a theatre with only seven and a half fingers i have only seven and a half fingers not the theatre this observation brought on another fit of giggles and that would have been about it for no he would have been whisked off to the next stop on his interdimensional jaunt had not a human near the stage aimed a tube at him tube said no proud of his human vocabulary pointing with the finger that wasnt altogether there after that things happened very quickly a flurry of events blurred like mixed stripes of vivid paint the tube flashed something exploded over his head a bee stung no on the leg a female screamed piercingly a herd of animals elephants perhaps passed directly below himthen most disconcertingly the ground disappeared from beneath his feet and everything went black the blackness was rough against his fingers and face the last thing no heard before his own personal blackness claimed him was a voice it was not a demons voice the tones were lighter halfway between bird and boar welcome demon said the voice then sniggered they know thought no and he would have panicked had the chloral hydrate seeping into his system through a leg wound allowed such exertions they know all about us then the knockout serum caressed his brain tipping him off a cliff into a deep dark hole artemis watched events unfold from his box a smile of admiration twitched at the corners of his mouth as the plan unrolled smoothly like the most expensive tunisian carpet whoever was behind this was good more than good perhaps they were related keep your camera pointed at the stage artemis said to butler holly will get the box butler was squirming to cover hollys back but his place was at artemiss side and after all captain short could look after herself he made sure his watch crystal was trained on the stage artemis would never let him forget it if he missed even a nanosecond of the action on stage the opera was almost over norma was leading pollione to the pyre where they were both to be burned all eyes were upon her except those involved in a drama of the fairy kind the music was lush and layered providing an unwitting soundtrack to the reallife drama unfolding in the theatre it began with an electric crackle downstage stage right barely noticeable unless you were expecting it and even i if some patrons did notice the glow they were not alarmed it could easily be a reflected blotch of light or one of the special effects these modern theatre directors were so fond of so thought artemis feeling the excitement buzz in his fingertips something is coming another game begins the something began to materialize inside the crackling blue envelope it took on a vague humanoid shape smaller than the last one but definitely a demon and definitely not a reflected blotch of light initially the shape was insubstantial wraithlike but after a second it became less transparent and more of this world now thought artemis anchor it and tranquilize it too a slender silver tube poked from the shadows on the opposite side of the theatre there was a small pop and a dart sped from the tubes mouth artemis did not need to follow the darts path he knew that it was headed straight into the creatures leg the leg would be best a good target but unlikely to be fatal a silver tip with some kind of knockout cocktail the creature was trying to communicate now and making wild gestures artemis heard a few gasps from the audience as patrons noticed the shape inside the light very well you have anchored it now you need a distraction something flashy and loud but not particularly dangerous if somebody gets hurt there will be an investigation artemis switched his gaze to the demon solid now in the shadows around him the opera steamrolled towards act fours crescendo the soprano lamented hysterically and almost every eye in the theatre was riveted on her almost every eye but there are always a few bored audience members at an opera especially by the time act four comes along those particular eyes would be wandering around the hall searching for something anything interesting to watch those eyes would land on the little demon downstage stage right unless they were distracted right on cue a large stage lamp broke free of its clamp in the rigging and swung on its cable into the back canvas the impact was both flashy and loud the bulb exploded showering the stage and orchestra pit with glass fragments the bulbs filament glowed with a magnesium glare temporarily blinding everyone staring at it which was almost the entire audience glass rained down on the orchestra and the musicians panicked fleeing en masse towards the green room dragging their instruments behind them a cacophony of squealing strings and overturned percussion instruments shattered any echoes of bellinis masterpiece nice thought artemis appreciatively the clamp and the filament were rigged the stampeding orchestra is a lucky bonus artemis appreciated all of this out of the corner of his eye his main focus was the diminutive demon lost in the shadows behind a canvas flat now if it was me thought the irish teenager i would have butler drop a black sack over that little creature and whisk him out of the stage door into a fourwheel drive we could be on the ferry to ravenna before the theatre crew got the bulb changed what actually happened was slightly different a stage trapdoor opened beneath the demon and it disappeared on a hydraulic platform artemis shook his head in admiration fabulous his mysterious adversaries must have hijacked the theatre computer system and when the demon appeared they simply sent a command to open the appropriate trapdoor panel doubtless there was someone waiting below to transfer the sleeping demon to an idling vehicle outside artemis leaned over the railing gazing into the audience below as the house lights were brought up the theatre patrons rubbed their dazzled eyes and spoke in the sheepish tones that follow shock there was no talk of demons no pointing and screaming he had just witnessed the perfect execution of a perfect plan artemis gazed across to the box on the far side of the stage the three occupants stood calmly they were simply leaving the show was over and it was time to go artemis recognized the pretty girl from barcelona and her two guardians the thin man seemed to have recovered from his leg injury as his crutches were now tucked underneath one arm the girl wore a selfsatisfied smile the kind that usually decorated artemiss own face after a successful mission its the girl artemis realized with some surprise she is the brains here this girls smile a reflection of his own rankled artemis he was not accustomed to being two steps behind no doubt she believed that victory was hers she may have won this battle but the campaign was far from over its time he thought that this girl knew she had an opponent he brought his hands together in a slow handclap brava he called brava ragazza his voice carried easily above the heads of the audience the girls smile froze on her lips and her eyes searched for the source of this compliment in seconds she located the irish teenager and their eyes locked if artemis had been expecting the girl to quail and tremble at the sight of him and his bodyguard then he was disappointed true a shadow of surprise flitted across her brow but then she accepted the applause with a nod and royal wave the girl said two words before she left the distance was too great for artemis actually to hear them but even if he hadnt long since trained himself to lipread it would have been easy to guess what they were artemis fowl she said nothing more there was a game beginning here no doubt about it how intriguing then a funny thing happened artemiss clapping hands were joined by a scattering of others from various spots in the theatre the applause grew from hesitant beginnings to a crescendo soon the patrons were on their feet and the bewildered singers were forced to take several curtain calls on his way through the lobby minutes later artemis was highly amused to overhear several audience members gushing over the unorthodox direction of the operas final scene the exploding lamp mused one buff was doubtless a metaphor for normas own falling star but no argued a second the lamp was obviously a modernistic interpretation of the burning stake which norma was about to face or perhaps thought artemis as he pushed through the crowd to find a light sicilian mist falling on his forehead the exploding lamp was simply an exploding lamp chapter imprisoned captain holly short of section followed the abductors to a land rover discovery and from there to the ravenna ferry their captive had been transferred from a canvas sack into a stout golf bag which was then topped off with the heads of several clubs it was a very slick operation three adult male humans and one teenage female holly was only mildly surprised to see that a young girl was involved after all artemis fowl was little more than a child and he managed to involve himself in far more complex plots than this the land rover was returned to a hertz rental in italy and from there the group took a firstclass sleeper carriage on an overnight bullet train along the western coast it made sense to travel by train there was no need to pass the golf bag through an xray machine holly didnt need to worry about xray machines or indeed any form of human security device wearing her section shimmer suit she was invisible to any kind of ray the border police could throw at her the only way to find a shielded fairy was to hit one accidentally with a stone and even then you would probably only get an invisible smack on the ear for your trouble holly slipped into the sleeper carriage and deposited herself on an unused luggage rack over the girls head below her the three humans propped the golf bag against the table and stared at it as if as if there was a demon inside three men and one girl it would be easy to take them she could knock them out with her neutrino then get foaly to send in some techs to do mind wipes holly was itching to free the poor demon it would take mere seconds the only thing stopping her was the voices in her head one of those voices belonged to foaly the other to artemis hold your position captain short advised foaly the centaur we need to see how far this goes section had become very interested in hollys mission since the demon abduction foaly was keeping a dedicated line to her helmet open hollys helmet was soundproof yet she was still nervous talking in such close proximity to the targets the trick in this situation is to train oneself to speak without any of the usual accompanying gestures this is harder than it sounds that poor demon will be terrified said holly lying perfectly still i have to get it out of there no said artemis sharply you have to see the bigger picture holly we have no idea how big this organization is or how much they know about the fairy people not as much as you demons dont carry the fairy book theyre not much for rules at least you have something in common said butler i could use the mesmer on them holly offered the mesmer was one of the tricks in every fairys magical bag it was a sirens song that could have any human happily spilling his guts that would make them tell me what they know and only what they know artemis pointed out if i was running this organization everyone would be told only what they needed to know nobody would know everything except me of course holly resisted the urge to thump something in frustration artemis was right of course she had to hang back and see how this situation played out they needed to spread their net as wide as possible in order to catch all the members of this group ill need backup holly whispered how many agents can section eight spare foaly cleared his throat but didnt answer what is it foaly whats going on down there ark sool caught wind of the abduction the mere mention of that gnomes name drove hollys blood pressure up a few points commander ark sool was the reason she had quit the lep in the first place sool how did he find out about it so quickly hes got a source somewhere in section eight he called in vinyaya she had no option but to hand over all the facts holly groaned sool was the king of red tape as the dwarfs said he couldnt make a decision if he was holding a jug of water and his bumflap was onjire whats the word sool is going for damage limitation the blast walls are up and overground missions have been cancelled no further action pending a meeting of the council if the manure hits the air circulator sool isnt going to be the one taking the blame not on his own politics spat holly sool only cares about his precious career so you cant send me anyone foaly chose his words carefully not officially and no one official i mean it would be impossible for anyone a consultant say to get past the blast walls carrying something you might need if you see what i mean holly understood exactly what foaly was trying to tell her ten four foaly im on my own officially exactly as far as commander sool knows you are simply shadowing the suspects you are only to take action if they decide to go public in that case your orders are and im quoting sool here to take the least complicated and most permanent course of action he means vaporize the demon sool didnt say that but thats what he wants holly despised sool more with every heartbeat he cant order me to do that killing a fairy goes against every law in the book i wont do it sool knows he cant officially order you to use terminal force on a fairy what hes doing here is making an unofficial recommendation the kind that could have a major effect on your career its a tricky one holly bestcase scenario this all blows over somehow artemis voiced the opinion that they all held thats not going to happen this is no opportunistic snatch we are dealing with an organized group that knew what they were after these people were at barcelona and now here they have an agenda for their demon and unless theyre military i would bet it involves going public for large amounts of money this will be bigger than the loch ness monster bigfoot and theyeti all rolled into one foaly sighed youre in a fix holly the best thing that could happen for you right now would be a nice nonlethal injury to take you out of the game holly remembered her old mentors words its not about whats best for us julius root had told her once its about whats best for the people sometimes its not about us foaly ill figure this out somehow i do have help right thats right confirmed the centaur its not as if its the first time weve saved the fairy world foalys confident tones made holly feel better even if he was hundreds of miles underground artemis interrupted them you two can swap war stories later we cant afford to miss a word that these people say if we can beat them to their destination it could be an advantage artemis was right this was not a time for drifting holly ran a quick systems check on her helmet instruments then pointed her visor at the humans below you getting this foaly she asked clear as crystal did i tell you about my new gas screens artemiss sigh rattled through the speakers yes you did now be quiet centaur were on a mission remember whatever you say mud boy hey look your girlfriend is saying something artemis had a vast mental reserve of scathing comebacks at his disposal but none of them covered girlfriend insults he wasnt even sure if it was an insult and if it was who was being insulted him or the girl the girl spoke french as only a native could technically she said the only crime we are guilty of is faredodging and perhaps not even that legally speaking how can you kidnap something that is not supposed to exist i doubt anyone ever accused murray gellmann of kidnapping a quark even though he knowingly carried a billion of them around in his pocket the girl chuckled gently causing her glasses to slip down again no one else laughed except an eavesdropping irish boy two hundred miles away at fontanarossa international airport about to board the last alitalia flight to rome rome artemis reasoned would be a lot more central than sicily wherever the demon was headed artemis could get there faster if he flew from rome that wasnt bad artemis commented then relayed the joke to butler obviously there are differences in the scenarios but its a joke not a quantum physics lecture butlers left eyebrow cranked up like a drawbridge differences in the scenarios thats just what i was thinking back on board the bullet train one of the men the one with the miraculously healed leg shifted on the leatherette upholstery what time do we get into nice minerva he said this single sentence was a goldmine of information for the listening artemis firstly the girls name was minerva named presumably for the roman goddess of wisdom so far a very apt name indeed secondly their destination was nice in the south of france and thirdly this girl seemed to be in charge extraordinary the girl who had been smiling still at her quark joke switched to irritated mode no names remember there are ears everywhere if a single person uncovers a single detail of our plan everything we have worked for could be ruined too late mud girl thought captain holly short from her luggage rack artemis fowl already knows too much about you not to mention my own little guardian angel foaly holly snapped a closeup of the girls face we have a mugshot and a first name foaly is that enough for you should be replied the centaur i got stills of the males too give me a while to run them through my database below her the second man from barcelona unzipped the fake top from the golf bag i should check on my clubs he said see if theyre settled ok if theyve started to move about i might put in something to keep them still all of which would have been a perfectly acceptable code had there not been a camera pointed right at them the man reached into the bag and after a moments feeling around he pulled out a small arm and checked the pulse fine everythings fine good said minerva now you should get some sleep we have a long journey ahead of us i will stay awake for a while because i feel like reading the next person can read in four hours the three men nodded but nobody lay down they just sat there staring at the golf bag as if there were a demon in there artemis and butler picked up a lucky connection to nice with air france and by ten they had checked into the hotel negresco and were enjoying coffee and croissants on the promenade des anglais holly was not so lucky she was still perched on a luggage rack on board a train not the same luggage rack this was her third rack altogether first they had to change in rome then again in monte carlo and now finally they were headed for nice artemis was speaking into his little finger which transmitted the vibrations to the fairy phone in his palm any hints as to the exact final destination nothing yet replied a tired and irritated holly this girl is controlling the adults with a rod of iron theyre afraid to say anything i am sick of lying on this rack i feel like i have been lying on racks for a year what are you two doing artemis put his decaf cappuccino down gently so as not to rattle the saucer were at the nice library trying to dig up anything on this minerva person perhaps we can find out if she has a villa near here glad to hear it said holly i had visions of you two drinking tea at the beach while i sweat it out here six metres from where artemis was sitting waves swirled along the beach like emerald paint poured from a bucket tea at the beach no time for luxuries holly there is important work to be done he winked at butler are you sure youre at the library i thought i heard water artemis smiled enjoying the exchange water surely not the only thing flowing here is information are you grinning artemis for some reason i get the feeling that youre wearing that smug smile of yours foaly cut into the line pay dirt holly it took a while but we tracked down our mystery girl artemiss smile vanished all business now who is she foaly to be honest i am amazed that i dont already know her the girl is minerva paradizo twelve years old born in cagnes sur mer south of france the bespectacled man is her father gaspard paradizo fiftytwo cosmetic surgeon of brazilian descent one more child a boy beau five years old the mother left a year ago lives in marseille with the exgardener artemis was puzzled gaspard paradizo is a cosmetic surgeon why did it take so long to find these two there must have been records pictures thats just it there were no pictures on the net not even a local paper snapshot i got the feeling that somebody had systematically wiped out every etrace of this family they could find but nobody can hide from you eh foaly thats right i ran a deep probe and came across a ghost image on a french tv archive page minerva paradizo won a national spelling bee when she was four once i had the name then it was easy to retrieve all the other wipes your girlfriend is quite something artemis she has already completed high school and is currently studying for two distance learning degrees quantum physics and psychology i suspect that she also has a doctorate in chemistry under an assumed name what about the other two men asked holly moving the conversation on before foaly could get in another girlfriend crack the latin one is juan soto head of soto security he seems to be a legitimate security operative not much expertise hardly any training nothing to worry about and the sniper the crutch guy is billy kong a real nasty piece of work im sending the file to your helmet in seconds the mail alert dinged in hollys ear and she opened the file in her visor a threedimensional photo of kong revolved slowly in the top left corner of the visor while his criminal record scrolled down before her eyes artemis cleared his throat i dont happen to have a helmet foaly oh yes little master lotech said foaly his voice dripping with condescension shall i read it for you if your mighty brain can bear to use simple vocalization ok billy kong grew up in a circus lost an eye in a fight with a tiger artemis sighed please foaly we dont have time for jokes sure retorted the centaur like youre in the library ok then the truth born jonah lee malibu early seventies family originally from taiwan mother annie one older brother eric killed in a gang fight the mother moved them both back to hsinchu south of taipei kong moved to the city and became a petty thief he had to leave in the nineties when a row with an accomplice turned into a murder charge kong used a kitchen knife on his friend theres still a warrant out for him there under the name jonah lee holly was surprised kong seemed harmless enough he was a slight man with spiked highlighted hair he seemed more like a member of a boy band than a closeup man moved to paris and changed his name continued foaly took up martial arts hes had facial surgery but not enough to escape my computer artemis lowered his phone hand and talked to butler billy kong the bodyguard drew a sharp breath dangerous man he has a small welltrained crew they hire themselves out as bodyguards to people who live dangerously i heard he went legit and was working for a doctor in europe kong is on the train said artemis he was the man with the fake crutch butler nodded thoughtfully kong was infamous in underworld circles the man had no morals and would happily perform any task however distasteful for the right price kong only had one rule never quit until the job is done if billy kong is involved things just got a lot more dangerous we need to rescue that demon as quickly as possible agreed said artemis raising the phone do we have an address foaly gaspard paradizo owns a chateau on thevence side of tourrettes sur loup twenty minutes from nice artemis finished his cappuccino in a single draught very well holly we shall meet you there artemis stood straightening his suit jacket butler old friend we need some surveillance equipment do you know anybody in nice who might oblige butler flipped open a waferthin mobile phone what do you think tourrettes sur loup southern france tourrettes sur loup is a small artisans village perched on the lower slopes of the alpes maritimes the paradizo chateau was further up the slopes on a flattened peak below the snowline the chateau was originally nineteenth century but had undergone extensive renovation the walls were solid stone the windows were reflective and probably bulletproof and there were cameras every where the road leading to the chateau was typical of the region narrow and tightly looped there was an observation tower on the buildings southern corner which afforded any sentry a degree view of any avenue of approach several men patrolled the grounds close to the main building and the gardens were dotted with grassy dunes but did not provide a shred of cover artemis and butler were concealed in a line of bushes on the adjacent slope butler studied the chateau through highpowered binoculars you certainly can pick them noted the bodyguard i think i saw this place in a bond movie once no problem for you surely butler frowned im a bodyguard artemis a human bulletproof vest breaking into fortified castles is not my speciality you have rescued me from more secure locations than this one true agreed the bodyguard but i had intel an inside man or i was desperate if i had to walk away from here it wouldnt trouble me unduly so long as you were walking away with me artemis patted his arm we cant walk away old friend butler sighed i suppose not he handed artemis the binoculars now start at the western corner and sweep east artemis raised the binoculars to his eyes then adjusted the focus i see twoman patrols sotos private security company no weapons showing but they have bulges below their jackets basic training i imagine but with more than twenty of them on and around the premises it would be very difficult to overpower them all and even if i did the local police would be here in minutes artemis moved the binoculars a few degrees i see a little boy wearing a cowboy hat driving a toy car paradizos son beau presumably nobody pays much attention to him move on sensors in the eaves ive actually researched that particular model the very latest sealed security pods closed circuit infrared motion sensors night vision the works ive been meaning to upgrade fowl manor there were small speakers on spikes dotted around the chateau a sound system butler snorted i wish those are waffle boxes they transmit interference our directional microphones are useless here i doubt even foaly could pick up anything inside that building holly shimmered into visibility beside them youre right hes pulled one of our shrouded satellites out of orbit to get a look at this place but its going to be several hours before the chateau is inside its footprint butler took his hand off his gun butt holly i wish you wouldnt appear like that im a bodyguard i get jumpy holly smiled punching him on the leg i know big man thats why i do it think of me as onthejob training artemis barely glanced up from the binoculars we need to find out whats happening in there if only we could get a man inside holly frowned i cant go into a human dwelling without per mission you know the rules if a fairy enters a human dwelling without an invitation they lose their magic and thats after a few hours of painful vomiting and cramps after the battles attaillte frond the king of the fairy people had tried to keep mischievous fairies away from human dwellings by imposing magical geasa or rules on fairies he had used his warlocks to construct a powerful spell to impose his will anyone attempting to break these rules would become deathly ill and lose their magic now the spell was fading with time but it was still strong enough to cause nausea and a dimming of the sparks of magic what about butler you could lend him a sheet of foalys cam foil hed be as good as invisible holly shook her head theres a laser pyramid all over the grounds even with cam foil butler would break the beams mulch then hes a criminal long past the allergic reaction stage cramps and vomiting wouldnt affect him holly scanned the grounds with her xray filter this place is built on solid rock and the walls are a metre thick mulch could never burrow in there unnoticed her xray vision fell on the skeleton of a small boy driving his little electric car she raised her visor to see beau paradizo zigzagging through the guards unmolested mulch couldnt get in there she said smiling but i think i know someone who could chapter dwarf walks into a bar the lower elements mulch diggums strolled through havens market district feeling more relaxed with every step the market district was a lowlife zone as much as you could have a lowlife zone on a street which boasted two hundred cameras and a permanent lep cabin on the corner but even so criminals outnumbered civilians here eight to one my kind of people thought mulch or at least they used to be before i threw in with holly it wasnt that mulch regretted teaming up with holly but sometimes he did miss the old days there was something about thievery that made his heart sing the thrill of the snatch the euphoria of easy money dont forget the despair of prison his practical side reminded him and the loneliness of life on the run true crime wasnt all fun and games it had minor downsides like fear pain and death but mulch had been able to ignore those for a long time until commander julius root had been killed by a criminal until then it had all been a game julius was the cat and he was the elusive mouse but with julius gone returning to a life of crime would seem like a slap in the face to the commanders memory and thats why i like this new job so much concluded mulch happily i get to run around behind the leps back and consort with known criminals he had been watching talk shows in the section lounge when foaly had come cantering in truth be told mulch liked foaly they knocked sparks off each other whenever they met but it kept both of them on their toes or hooves whichever the case may be in this instance there had been no time for tomfoolery and foaly had brusquely explained the situation above ground they did have a plan but it hinged on mulchs ability to find the pixie smuggler doodah day and bring him back to section thats going to take some doing noted mulch the last time i saw doodah he was scraping dwarf gunge off his boots he doesnt like me very much im going to need leverage you tell that pixie that if he helps us out hes a free fairy ill go into the system myself and wipe his record mulch raised his shaggy eyebrows its that important its that important i saved this city grumbled the dwarf twice in fact nobody ever wiped my record this pixie goes on one mission and poof he walks what do i get seeing as were handing out wishes foaly stamped a hoof impatiently you get your exorbitant consultants fee whatever just get on this do you have any way to track mister day down mulch whistled its going to be devilishly tough that pixie will have gone to ground after this morning but i have certain skills i can do it foaly glowered at him thats why you get paid the big bucks in fact finding doodah was not going to be quite as devilishly difficult as mulch had pretended the last thing mulch had done before waving a cheery goodbye to doodah day was to slip a tracker pill down his boot the tracker pills had been a gift from foaly he liked to pass redundant equipment to holly to help keep the agency afloat the pills were made from a baked adhesive gel that started to melt as soon as you popped it from its foil case the gel stuck to whatever it was touching and adopted its colour inside was a tiny transmitter that emitted harmless radiation for up to five years the tracking system was not very sophisticated each pill left its signature on the individual foil cases so the case glowed whenever it detected the signature radiation the brighter the glow the closer the pill idiotproof holly had quipped issuing the pills and idiotproof they were proving to be barely ten minutes after leaving section mulch had tracked doodah day to the market district by the dwarfs reckoning his quarry was somewhere within a twentymetre radius the most likely place was the fish bar across the street pixies loved fish especially shellfish especially especially protected shellfish such as lobster which was why doodahs smuggling skills were so much in demand mulch crossed the street adjusted his expression to fearsome and barged into happy as a clam as if he owned the place the bar was ostensibly a dive the floor was bare boards and the air stank of weekold mackerel the menu was written on the wall in what looked like fish blood and the only customer appeared to be asleep in a bowl of chowder a pixie waiter glared at him from behind a kneehigh counter theres a dwarf bar down the street he said mulch flashed him a toothy grin now thats not very hospitable i could be a customer not likely said the waiter i never saw a dwarf pay for a meal yet it was true dwarfs were scroungers by nature you got me admitted mulch im no customer im looking for someone the waiter gestured at the almost deserted restaurant if you dont see him he aint here mulch flashed a very shiny lep temporary deputy badge that foaly had issued i think i might take a closer look the waiter ran out from behind his counter i think you might need a warrant to take one more step cop mulch brushed him aside im not that kind of cop pixie mulch followed the transmitters signal through the main restaurant down a shabby corridor and into the restrooms which were even shabbier even mulch winced and he burrowed in mud for a living one cubicle had an out of order sign on the door mulch squeezed into the pixiesized space and quickly located the secret door he wormed his way through into a far more salubrious room than the one he had just left there was a velvetlined cloakroom box staffed by a rather surprised pixie in a pink dress do you have a reservation she asked haltingly more than one replied mulch for starters do you think its a good idea to put the secret entrance to an illegal restaurant in a toilet it didnt fool me and i think i lost my appetite mulch did not wait for an answer instead he bowed under a low lintel into an opulent main restaurant here dozens of pixies were tucking into steaming plates of shellfish doodah day was alone at a table for two cracking a lobster with a hammer as if he hated it mulch walked over ignoring the surprised glares from other diners thinking about someone he asked lowering himself into a tiny pixie chair doodah glanced up if he was surprised he hid it well you dwarf im imagining that this claw is your fat head doodah brought the hammer down hard splattering mulch with white lobster meat hey watch it that stinks doodah was livid that stinks that stinks ive taken three showers three and i cant get the stink of your mouth offa me it follows me like my own personal sewer you see im eating alone usually i got me a table full of buddies but not today today i smell like dwarf mulch was unperturbed hey easy little guy i could get offended doodah waved the hammer you see anyone in here caring how you feel offended or otherwise mulch took a deep breath this was going to be a hard sell yeah ok doodah point made youre a real wise guy a tickedoff wise guy but i got an offer for you doodah laughed you got an offer for me i got an offer for you why dont you get your dwarf stink outta here before i crack your teeth with this hammer i get it said mulch testily youre a tough little guy and mean too and a dwarf would have to be crazy to mess with you generally i would sit here for a couple of hours trading insults but today im busy a friend of mine is in trouble doodah smiled broadly raising a glass of wine in a mock toast well dwarf heres hoping its that slippery elf holly short cause theres nobody i would rather see up to her pointy ears in something dangerous mulch showed his teeth but he wasnt smiling actually ive been meaning to talk to you about that you attacked my friend with a multimixer nearly killed her nearly said doodah raising a finger just scared her is all she shouldnt have been chasing me i just smuggle a few crates of shrimp i dont kill anyone just drive thats right just drive mulch relaxed well doodah lucky for you your driving skill is the very thing stopping me unhingeing my jaw and chewing on you like one of those shrimp balls you got there and this time who knows which end youd come out the bravado instantly drained from doodahs face im listening he said mulch reined in his teeth ok so you can drive anything right absolutely anything i dont care if martians built it doodah day can drive it good because i got an offer for you im not particularly happy about it but i have to run it past you anyway go for it stinky mulch groaned internally their little band of adventurers needed another smartass like they needed ten years of bad luck i need you for one day to drive one vehicle for one trip you do that and you have amnesty doodah was impressed it was an impressive deal so all i gotta do is drive and you wipe the slate apparently doodah tapped his forehead with a lobster claw this is too easy theres gotta be a catch mulch shrugged well its going to be above ground and therell be a lot of armed mud men chasing after you yeah grinned doodah through a mouthful of lobster juice but whats the catch chapter bobos run the parchateau southern france by the time mulch and doodah landed outside tourrettes sur loup the dwarf was a nervous wreck hes crazy he gibbered tumbling from the hatch of a tiny titanium pod which had been landed expertly on a flat patch not much bigger than a postage stamp the pixie is crazy give me your gun holly im going to shoot him doodah day appeared in the hatch hopping nimbly to the ground that ship is fantastic he said in gnommish where can i get one his grin withered and died when he noticed that the thing he had previously believed to be a tree moved and spoke in one of the primitive mud man tongues this would be doodah day i presume he makes a lot of noise doesnt he arkkkk said doodah big mud man yes he is said another mud man or maybe a mud boy this one was smaller but somehow seemed even more dangerous you speak gnommish asked the terrified pixie in case the big one would eat him for not being polite yes said artemis i do but butler is not so fluent so english if you wouldnt mind sure thing not a problem said doodah grateful that he still had the tiny spark of magic left in his brain necessary to fuel his gift of tongues doodah and mulch had flown across the lower peaks of the alpes maritimes in a pod built for riding the magma flares from the earths core these chutes had rudimentary shields but they were not intended for aboveground travel doodahs instructions had been to ride the hotshots to a small port near berne switzerland then strap on a pair of wings and lowfly the rest of the way but once doodah got behind the pods wheel he decided that it would be much faster if they did the second leg on board the tiny ship holly was impressed you fly pretty well for a smuggler those pods handle like a threelegged pig doodah slapped a titanium fin fondly shes a good girl you just need to treat her right mulch was still shaking we came this close this close to being incinerated i lost count after the first dozen times doodah chortled thats not all you lost dwarf someone is going to have to swab the decks in there holly looked doodah in the eyes ok they were making small talk but there was a little history between them you could have killed me pixie said holly evenly giving the little smuggler a chance to explain himself i know i nearly did thats why its time for me to get out of the business review the situation take a long hard look at my priorities horse manure tutted holly i dont believe a word me neither said doodah thats my parole board spiel with the big eyes and the wobbly lip works every time but seriously im sorry about the multimixer thing officer i was desperate but you were never in danger these hands are pure magic on a wheel holly decided to let it go nursing a grudge would only make a difficult mission next to impossible and anyway now doodah would have a chance to make it up to her butler lifted mulch to his feet how are you doing there mulch mulch glowered at doodah i will be doing fine once my head stops spinning that ship is only built for one you know ive had that little monkey on my lap for the past few hours every time we went over a bump he butted me under the chin butler winked at his dwarf friend well look at it this way you had to take a ride in his environment but now he has to take a ride in yours doodah caught the end of that sentence ride what ride who has to take a ride mulch rubbed his hairy palms together i am going to enjoy this they lay down in a row in a low ditch overlooking the chateau the land sloped gently downwards and was dotted with the twisted forms of ancient olive trees the surface soil was dry and loose but reasonably tasty according to mulch the alpine water is pretty good he explained spitting out a mouthful of pebbles and the olives give the clay a nice tang thats very nice said artemis patiently but all i really want to know is can you make it to the septic tank septic tank said doodah nervously what are we talking about septic tanks for i aint going into no septic tank forget the deal not into the tank corrected artemis behind it the tank is the only cover before the chateau itself holly was scanning the terrain with her visor the tank is buried as close to the house as possible after that its just rock but you have a nice thick vein of soil as far as that point what you need to do is lure that boy in the cowboy hat in behind the tank with a bar of chocolate then doodah takes his place then what that toy car isnt going anywhere fast it doesnt need to doodah all you have to do is drive inside the house and wind this round any video cable you see holly handed doodah a cable tie with tiny spikes along its length this is loaded fibre optic once its in place we own their surveillance can we rewind to the bar of chocolate said mulch does anyone have one here said artemis handing him a flat bar in a green wrapper butler bought this in the village its very low quality not seventy per cent cocoa or fair trade for that matter but it will do so what about after the kid eats the chocolate asked mulch what do i do with a kid you are not to injure him said holly just entertain him for a minute entertain him how am i supposed to do that use your dwarf talents suggested artemis young children are inquisitive eat some rocks pass wind little beau will be fascinated couldnt i just shoot him mulch said holly horrified i dont mean kill him just knock him out for a few minutes kids like naps id be doing him a favour really knocking him out would be ideal admitted holly but i dont have anything safe so youll have to keep him busy for five minutes tops i am a charmer i suppose said mulch and if worst comes to worst i can always eat him he grinned widely at hollys horrified expression im kidding honest id never eat a mud kid theyre too bony holly elbowed artemis who was beside her on the bank are you sure about this it was your basic idea replied artemis but yes i am sure there are other options but we dont have the time mulch has always displayed initiative i feel certain he wont let us down as for mister day his freedom is on the line a strong incentive to perform enough of the chatter said mulch im starting to burn here you know how sensitive dwarf skin is he stood unbuttoning a bumflap on the seat of his pants where else would a bumflap be ok pixie hop on doodah day seemed genuinely frightened are you sure mulch sighed sure im sure what are you afraid of its just a rear end yeah maybe but its smiling at me perhaps its happy to see you you dont want to be there if it gets angry holly punched mulch on the shoulder that is a really bad habit complained mulch rubbing his upper arm you should see someone about your anger issues could you please quit the bum talk were on a tight schedule here ok get on pixie i promise it wont bite butler lifted the tiny pixie on to mulchs back just dont look down advised the bodyguard youll be ok easy for you to say grumbled doodah youre not the one riding the whirlwind you never mentioned this in the restaurant diggums artemis pointed at the pixies backpack do you really need that mister day its not very streamlined doodah held on to the strap tools of the trade mud boy they go where i go very well said artemis a word of advice get in and out as fast as you can doodah rolled his eyes wow thats great advice you should write a book mulch chortled good one and avoid his family continued artemis especially the girl minerva family minerva got it now lets go if were going before i lose my nerve the dwarf unhinged his jaw with winceworthy cracks and dived head first into the mound of earth it was something to see scythelike jaws chomping through the dirt excavating a tunnel for the dwarf and his passenger doodahs eyes were tightly shut and his expression was one of absolute shock oh gods he said let me off let me then they were gone lost under a blanket of vibrating earth holly elbowed her way atop the mound following their progress through her visor diggums is fast she proclaimed im surprised we ever caught him artemis lay beside her i hope hes fast enough the last thing we need is for minerva paradizo to add a dwarf and a pixie to her fairy collection mulch felt good underground this was a dwarfs natural habitat his fingers absorbed the rhythms of the earth and they calmed him his coarse beard hairs which were actually a series of sensors dug into the clay worming into cracks sending out pings and reporting back to mulchs brain he could feel rabbits digging half a mile to his left maybe he could snag one on the way back for a snack doodah hung on for dear life his face was a rictus of desperation he would have screamed but that would have meant opening his mouth and that was out of the question just below doodahs toes mulchs behind churned out a rapidfire mixture of dirt and air driving the pair deeper into the tunnel doodah could feel the heat from the reaction spreading up his legs every now and then the pixies boots dropped too close to the dwarfs rear exhaust and doodah would have to jerk them up or lose a toe it only took mulch a minute to reach the septic tank he eased himself from the earth blinking mud from his eyes with thick corkscrew dwarf lashes spot on he mumbled spitting out a wriggling worm doodah hauled himself over the dwarfs head clamping a hand over his own mouth to stop himself screaming after several deep breaths he calmed down sufficiently to hiss at mulch you enjoyed that didnt you mulch rehinged his jaw then released a final burst of tunnel gas which popped him out of the earth its what i do lets say were even for the pod ride doodah disagreed lets say i still owe you one for swallowing me the bickering would probably have continued in spite of the urgency of their mission had not a little boy in an electric toy car come trundling round the corner of the tank hello i am beau paradizo said the driver are you monsters doodah and mulch froze momentarily then remembered the plan no little boy said mulch glad he still had the tiny spark of magic necessary to speak french he tried to smile endearingly something he didnt spend a lot of time practising in the mirror we are the chocolate fairies and we have a special gift for you he waved the chocolate bar hoping the theatrical presentation would make the cheap candy seem more impressive than it was chocolate fairies said the boy climbing from his car sugarfree chocolate i hope because i get hyper with sugar and daddy says that god knows im already hyper enough without it but he still loves me mulch glanced at the label eighteen per cent sugar yep sugarfree would you like a square beau took the entire bar and demolished it in less than ten seconds you fairies stink especially you hairy you stink worse than the blocked toilet in aunty morganas stinky fairy doodah laughed what can i tell you the kid tells it like it is mulch do you live in a blocked toilet mister fatty chocolate fairy hey said mulch brightly how about a nap would you like a nap kid beau paradizo punched mulch in the stomach i had a nap stupid more chocolate now no punching i dont have more chocolate beau punched him again i said more chocolate or im going to call the guards and pierre will reach down your throat and pull out your guts thats what he does he told me mulch sniggered id like to see him reach into my insides really asked beau brightly ill get him the little boy sprinted for the corner of the tank he moved with surprising speed and mulchs instincts took over from his brain the dwarf leaped towards the boy unhingeing as he went pierre shouted beau once but not a second time because mulch had enclosed him in his mouth all except the cowboy hat do not swallow hissed doodah mulch worked the boy round his cheeks for a few seconds then spat him out beau was dripping wet and sound asleep mulch wiped the childs face before the dwarf spittle could harden sedative in the saliva he explained hooking up his jaw its a predator thing you didnt fall asleep yesterday because i didnt do your head hell wake up completely refreshed ill peel this stuff off when it hardens doodah shrugged hey do i care i didnt like him anyway a voice drifted over the tank beau where are you that must be pierre you better get moving lead him away from here doodah poked his head above the embankment a large man was headed their way not as large as butler true but plenty big enough to squash the pixie under a single boot the man wore a black security jumpsuit with matching hat a pistol grip poked from between the buttons the man squinted towards the tank beau is that you he said in french oui cest moi replied doodah in a warbling falsetto pierre was not convinced the voice had sounded more like a talking piglet than a child he kept coming reaching inside his jumpsuit for the gun doodah bolted for the electric car on the way he picked up beaus cowboy hat jamming it on to his head pierre was barely a dozen steps away now and quickening his pace beau come here now minerva wants you in the house doodah slid over the bonnet into the car hillbilly style he could tell from a single glance that this toy wouldnt do much more than walking speed which would be zero use to him in an emergency he pulled a flat black panel from his bag suckering it on to the little cars plastic dash this was a mongocharger something no selfrespecting smuggler would leave home without the mongocharger was equipped with a strong computer omni sensor and a clean nuclear battery pack the omnisensor hacked into the toy cars tiny chip and took over its workings doodah pulled a retractable spike cable from the mongochargers base and plunged the tip into the cars own power cable beneath the dash now the toy car was nuclearpowered doodah revved the accelerator thats more like it he said satisfied pierre came round the right side of the tank this was good because mulch and the dozing beau were on his blind side it was bad because pierre was directly behind doodah beau said pierre is something wrong his gun was out pointed at the ground doodahs foot hovered over the accelerator but he couldnt punch it now not with this goon staring down his neck nothings wrong eh pierre he trilled keeping his face hidden under the cowboy hats brim you sound strange beau are you ill doodah tipped the accelerator inching forward no im fine just doing funny voices the way human kids do pierre was still suspicious human kids doodah took a chance yes human kids im an alien today pretending to be a human so go away or i will reach down your throat and pull out your guts pierre stopped in his tracks thought for a moment then remembered beau you scoundrel dont let minerva hear you talking like that no more chocolate if you do pull out your guts repeated doodah for good measure accelerating gently across a gravel bed on to the driveway the pixie pulled a stickon convex mirror from his pack suckering it to the windscreen he was relieved to see that pierre had bolstered his weapon and was headed back to his post even though it went against all his smugglers instincts doodah kept his speed down on the driveway his teeth knocked together as he drove over the uneven granite flagstones a digital readout informed him that he was utilizing one hundredth of one per cent of the engines new power doodah remembered just in time to mute the mongocharger the last thing he needed right now was the computers electronic voice complaining about his driving skills there were two guards in front of the main doors they barely glanced down as doodah swept past howdy sheriff said one grinning chocolate squeaked doodah from the little he knew about beau it seemed the appropriate thing to say he tapped the accelerator to bump him over the lintel then drove slowly across a streaked marble floor the tyres spun for grip on the sleek stone which was a bit worrying it could cost crucial seconds in the event that he had to make a quick getaway but at least the corridor was wide enough for a uturn if one became necessary doodah motored down the hallway past rows of towering potted palms and several bright abstract works of art until he came to the corridors end there was a camera mounted over an archway pointed directly at the front hall a cable snaked out from the box and into a conduit which ran down to the base of the wall doodah pulled up by the conduit hopping from the car so far his luck was holding nobody had challenged him this human security was lame in any fairy building he would have been laserscanned a dozen times by now the pixie yanked a section of conduit away revealing the cable beneath it took him mere seconds to twist the length of loaded fibre optics round the video cable job done smiling doodah climbed back into his stolen car this had been a sweet deal amnesty for five minutes work time to go home and enjoy a life of freedom until he broke the rules again beau paradizo you little brat come over here right now doodah froze momentarily then checked his mirror there was a girl behind him glaring his way hands on hips this he guessed would be minerva if memory served he was supposed to keep far away from minerva beau its time for your antibiotic do you want to have that chest infection forever doodah started the car rolling it towards the arch and out of this mud girls sight line once round the corner he could floor the accelerator dont you dare drive away from me bobo bobo no wonder im driving away thought doodah who would drive towards someone calling them bobo eh chocolate said the pixie hopefully it was the wrong thing to do this girl knew her brothers voice when she heard it and that wasnt it bobo is there something wrong with your voice doodah swore under his breath ches inflecchun he said but minerva wasnt buying it she took a walkietalkie from her pocket and took rapid strides towards the car pierre can you come in here please bring andre and louis and then to doodah just stay there bobo i have a nice bar of chocolate for you sure thought doodah chocolate and a concrete cell he considered his options for a second and came to a conclusion the conclusion was i would rather escape quickly than get captured and tortured to death i am out of here thought doodah and floored the accelerator sending several hundred horsepower shuddering down the fragile driveshaft he had maybe a minute before the car fell apart but by then he could be far away from this mud girl and her transparent promises of chocolate the car took off so fast that it left an image of itself where it had been minerva stopped dead what there was a corner coming up quickly doodah pulled the wheel in as far as he could but the vehicles turning circle was too wide gotta bounce it said doodah through gritted teeth he leaned hard left eased up on the accelerator and hit the wall sideon at the moment of impact he shifted his weight and stepped on the gas the car lost a door but shot out of the corner like a stone from a sling beautiful thought doodah as soon as his head stopped ringing he had maybe seconds now before the girl could see him again and who knew how many guards stood between him and freedom he was in a long straight corridor opening on to a sitting room doodah could see a wallmounted television and the top rim of a red velvet sofa there must be steps down into the room not good this car only had one more impact left in it where is bobo shouted the girl what have you done with him no point in subtlety now time to see what this buggy could do doodah jammed his foot on the accelerator then made a beeline for a window behind the velvet sofa he patted the dash you can do it you little junk box one jump your chance to be a thoroughbred the car didnt answer back they never did though occasionally in times of extreme stress and oxygen deprivation doodah imagined they shared his cavalier attitude minerva came round the corner she was running hard and screaming into a walkietalkie doodah heard the words apprehend necessary violence and interrogation none of which boded well for him the toy cars wheels spun on a long rug then caught the rug was shunted backwards like a length of toffee from a roller minerva was bowled over but kept talking as she went down hes headed for the library take him down shoot if necessary doodah held on to the wheel grimly keeping his line he was going out of that window closed or not he entered the room at seventy miles per hour flying off the top step not bad acceleration for a toy there were two guards in the room in the act of drawing their weapons they wouldnt shoot though it still appeared as though the car was being driven by a child suckers thought doodah then the first bullet crashed into the chassis ok maybe they would shoot the car he flew in a gentle arc towards the window two more bullets took plastic chunks from the bodywork but it was too late to stop the tiny vehicle it clipped the lower frame lost a fender and tumbled out through the open window someone really should be filming this thought doodah as he clenched his teeth for impact the crash shook him all the way from his toes to his skull stars danced before doodahs eyes for a moment then he was in control again careering towards the septic tank mulch was waiting his wild halo of hair quivering with impatience where have you been im running out of sunblock doodah did not waste time with an answer instead he extricated himself from the all but demolished car prising off his mongocharger and mirror mulch pointed a stubby finger at him i have a few more questions a bullet fired from the open window ricocheted off the septic tank throwing up concrete splinters but they can wait hop on mulch turned presenting doodah with his back and more besides doodah jumped on grabbing thick hanks of mulchs beard go he shouted theyre right behind me mulch unhinged his jaw and he went into the clay like a hairy torpedo but fast as he was they wouldnt have made it armed guards were two paces away they would have seen the gently snoring beau and riddled the moving tunnel mound with bullets they probably would have tossed in a few grenades for good measure but they didnt because at that precise moment all hell broke loose inside the chateau as soon as doodah had twisted the loaded fibre optic round the video cable hundreds of tiny spikes had punctured the rubber making dozens of strong contacts with the wiring inside seconds later in section hq information came flooding into foalys terminal he had video alarm systems waffle boxes and communications all flashing up in separate windows on his screen foaly cackled cracking his knuckles like a concert pianist he loved those old fibre optic twists not as fancy as the new organic bugs but twice as reliable ok he said into a reed mike on his desk im in control what kind of nightmares would you like to give the paradizos in the south of france captain holly short spoke into her helmet microphone whatever you have storm troopers helicopters overload their communications blow out their waffle boxes set off all the alarms i want them to believe they are under attack foaly called up several phantom files on his computer the phantoms were one of his own pet projects he would lift patterns from human movies soldiers explosions whatever and then use them universally in whatever scene he chose in this case he sent a squad of french army special forces the commandement des operations speciales or cos to the paradizos closedcircuit system that would do nicely for starters inside the chateau the paradizo chief of security juan soto had a little problem his little problem was that a couple of loose shots were being popped off in the house this can only be seen as a little problem in relation to the very big problem that foaly was sending his way soto was speaking into a radio yes miss paradizo he said keeping his voice calm i realize that your brother may be missing i say may be because that may be him in the toy car it sure looks like him to me ok ok i take your point it is unusual for toy cars to fly that far it could be a malfunction soto resolved to have strong words with the two idiots who had actually fired on a toy car on minervas command he did not care how smart she was no child was giving orders like that on his watch even though miss minerva was nowhere near the security centre and could not see his face chief soto adopted a stern expression for the lecture he was about to give now miss paradizo you listen to me he began then his expression changed completely as the security system went ballistic yes chief im listening the chief held on to his radio with one hand with the other he flicked numerous switches on his security console praying for malfunction there seems to be a full squad of cos converging on the chateau my god there are some in the house helicopters the rooftop cameras are picking up helicopters transmissions suddenly squawked through the band monitor and we have chatter theyre after you miss paradizo and your prisoner my god the alarms have all been tripped every sector were surrounded we need to evacuate i can see them in the treeline they have a tank how did they get a tank up here outside artemis and butler watched the chaos foaly had created alarm klaxons ripped through the alpine air and security men sprinted to ordained spots butler lobbed a few smoke grenades into the grounds to add to the effect a tank said artemis wryly into his fairy phone you sent them a tank youve hacked into the audio feed said foaly sharply just what else can that phone of yours do it can play solitaire and minesweeper replied artemis innocently foaly grunted doubtfully well talk about this later mud boy for now lets concentrate on the plan excellent suggestion do you have any phantom guided missiles the security chief nearly fainted the radar had picked up two tracks spiralling from the belly of a helicopter man dieu missiles theyre firing smart bombs at us we must evacuate now he flicked open a perspex panel revealing an orange switch below with only a moments hesitation he pressed the orange switch the various alarms were immediately cut off and replaced by a single continuous whine the evac alarm the moment this was sounded the guards changed course heading for their assigned vehicles or principals and the nonsecurity residents of the chateau began gathering data or whatever was most precious to them on the eastern side of the house a series of garage doors opened and six black bmw fourwheel drives sprang into the courtyard like cougars one had blackedout windows artemis studied the situation through binoculars watch the girl he said into the tiny phone in his palm the girl is the key im guessing hers is the vehicle with the tinted windows the girl minerva appeared through patio doors speaking calmly into a walkietalkie her father trailed beside her dragging a protesting beau paradizo by the hand billy kong came last bending slightly under the weight of a large golf bag here we go holly are you ready artemis im the field agent here came the irritated reply stay off my band unless you have something to contribute i was just thinking i was just thinking that you should change your middle name to control freak artemis glanced across at butler who was lying beside him on the verge and couldnt help overhearing the entire exchange control freak can you believe that the nerve of some people replied the bodyguard without taking his eyes off the chateau to their left a small patch of earth began to vibrate mud grass and insects were thrust upwards in a sudden gush followed by two heads one dwarf and one pixie doodah climbed over mulchs shoulders collapsing on the ground you people are crazy he panted plucking a beetle from his shirt pocket i should be getting more than amnesty for this i should be getting a pension quiet little man said butler calmly phase two of the plan is about to start and i wouldnt want to miss it because of you doodah blanched neither would i want you to miss it that is because of me outside the chateaus garage billy kong popped one of i the bmws boots hefting the golf bag inside it was the car with the tinted windows artemis opened his mouth to issue an order then closed it again holly probably knew what to do she did the drivers door clunked open a fraction apparently all on its own then closed again before minerva or billy kong could do more than blink in surprise the fourbyfour started up and laid down a sixmetre length of rubber skidding towards the main gate perfect said artemis under his breath now miss minerva paradizo wouldbe criminal mastermind let us see exactly how smart you are i know what i would do in this situation minerva paradizos reaction was a bit less dramatic than one might expect from a child who has just had her prize possession stolen there were no tantrums or footstamping billy kong also defied expectations he did not so much as draw a weapon instead he squatted on his hunkers ran his fingers through manga hair and lit a cigarette which minerva promptly plucked from his lips and squashed underfoot meanwhile the fourbyfour was getting away barrelling towards the main gates perhaps minerva was confident that the reinforced steel barrier would be sufficient to halt the bmw in its tracks she was wrong holly had already weakened the bolts with her neutrino one tap from the vehicles grille would be more than sufficient to barge the gates out of the way if it got that far which it did not after she had crushed kongs cigarette minerva took a remote control from her pocket tapped in a short code then hit the send button in the bmws cab a tiny charge detonated in the airflow system releasing a cloud of sevoflurane a potent sleeping gas in seconds the vehicle began to weave ramping the driveway bushes and cutting a swathe through the manicured lawn problems said butler hmm said artemis a gas device i would guess fastacting possibly cyclopropane or sevoflurane butler knelt drawing his pistol should i stroll in there and get them no you shouldnt the bmw was careering wildly now following the dips and slopes of the grounds topography it destroyed a minigolf green pulverized a gazebo and decapitated a centaur statue hundreds of miles below ground foaly winced the vehicle finally came to rest in a lavender bed nose down rear wheels spinning spitting out hunks of clay and uprooted longstemmed purple flowers like missiles nice action thought mulch but he kept the notion to himself fully aware that this might not be the time to stretch butlers patience butler was raring to go his gun was out and the tendons in his neck were stretched but artemis held him back with a touch to the forearm no he said not now i know your impulses to help but now is not the time the bodyguard jammed his sig sauer handgun back into its holster scowling are you sure artemis trust me old friend and of course butler did even if his instincts were not so sure inside the grounds a dozen security guards were warily approaching the vehicle led by billy kong the man moved like a cat on the balls of his feet even his face was feline smug grin and flat eyes on his signal the men rushed the car reclaiming the golf bag and hauling an unconscious holly from the front seat the elf was cuffed with plastic ties and hauled across the garden to where minerva paradizo and her father stood waiting minerva removed hollys helmet and kneeled to examine her pointed ears through his binocular lenses artemis could clearly see that she was smiling it had been a trap ah a trap minerva tucked the helmet under her arm then walked briskly back towards the house halfway there she stopped and turned shielding her eyes from the suns glare she scanned the shadows and peaks of the surrounding hillsides whats she looking for butler speculated aloud artemis did not wonder he knew exactly what this surprising girl was after shes looking for us old friend if that was your chateau perhaps you might have wondered where a spy would conceal himself of course and thats why i picked this spot the ideal location would have been further up the hill in that cluster of rocks but that would also have been the first spot any security expert would boobytrap this would be my second choice and so my first choice minervas gaze swept past the rock cluster and rested on the line of bushes where they were hiding she couldnt possibly see them but her intellect told her that they were there artemis focused on the girls pretty face it amazed him that he could appreciate minervas features even as his friend was being hauled into captivity puberty was a powerful force minerva was smiling her eyes were bright and they taunted artemis across the vale between them she spoke in english then artemis and butler both expert lipreaders had no difficulty interpreting her short sentence did you get that artemis asked butler i got it and she got us your move artemis fowl minerva had said butler sat back in the ditch slapping mud from his elbows i thought you were one of a kind artemis but that girl is a smart one yes said artemis musing shes a regular juvenile criminal mastermind below ground in section hq foaly groaned into his microphone great he said now there are two of you chapter sudden impact inside the chateau paradizo no was having a lovely dream in the dream his mother was holding a surprise party for him in honour of his graduation from warlock college the food was scrumptious the dishes were cooked and most of the meat was already dead he was reaching for a beautifully presented basted pheasant in a basket of woven herb bread ropes just like the one described in chapter three of lady heatherington smythes hedgerow when suddenly the vision retreated into the far distance as though reality itself was being stretched no tried to follow the feast but it drew further and further away and now his legs wouldnt work and no couldnt understand why he looked down and saw to his horror that everything from his armpits down had turned to stone the stone virus was spreading upwards across his chest and along his neck no felt the urge to scream he was suddenly terrified that his mouth would turn to stone before he could scream to be petrified forever and hold that scream inside would be the ultimate horror no opened his mouth and screamed billy kong who had been lounging on a chair watching snapped his fingers at a camera on the ceiling the ugly one is awake he said and i think it wants its mother no stopped screaming when his breath ran out it was a bit of an anticlimax really starting out with a lusty howl and petering off to a reedy whine ok thought no i am alive and in the land of men time to open my eyes andjind out just how deep in the pig dung i actually am no cracked his eyes open warily as though he might see something big and hard heading for his face at high speed what he did see was that he was in a small bare room there were rectangular lights on the ceiling that threw out the light of a thousand candles and most of one wall was taken up by a mirror there was a human possibly a child perhaps a female with a ridiculous mane of blonde curls and an extra finger on each hand the creature was wearing a ludicrously impractical togatype arrangement and spongysoled shoes with lightning bolts embossed on the sides there was another person in the room a slouching leering thin man who tapped a staccato rhythm on his leg no s eyes were drawn to the second humans hair there were at least half a dozen colours in there the man was a peacock no decided that perhaps he should raise his empty hands to show that he wasnt carrying a weapon but its difficult to do that when you are tied to a chair im tied to a chair he said apologetically as though it was his fault unfortunately he said this in gnommish and in the demon dialect to the humans it sounded like he was trying to dislodge a particularly annoying blockage from his throat no resolved not to talk again doubtless he would say the wrong thing and the humans would have to ritually execute him thankfully the female seemed eager to chat hello i am minerva paradizo and this man is mister kong she said can you understand me it was all gibberish to no not a single recognizable word from the text of lady heatherington smythes hedgerow he smiled encouragingly to show he appreciated the effort do you speak french asked the blonde girl then switched languages how about english no sat up that last bit was familiar strange inflections surely but the words themselves were from the book english he repeated this was the language of lady heatherington smythe learned at her mothers knee explored in the lecture halls of oxford used to profess her undying love for professor rupert smythe no loved the book he sometimes believed that he was the only one who did even abbot didnt seem to appreciate the romantic bits yes said minerva english the last one spoke it well enough french too manners must be appreciated somewhere outside a book no had always thought so he decided to give them a go he growled which was the polite demon way of asking to speak in front of your betters this must not be how humans interpreted it because the skinny human jumped to his feet pulling out a knife no kind sir said no hurriedly cobbling together a couple of sentences from lady heatherington prithee sheath thine weapon i bring joyous tidings only the skinny human was confounded he spoke english as well as the next american but this little runt was spouting some kind of medieval nonsense kong straddled no holding the knife to his throat talk straight ugly said the man deciding to give taiwanese a go i wish i could understand said no shaking unfortunately he said this in gnommish what i eh meanest to say is it was no good quotes from lady heatherington that he could generally shoehorn into any occasion just werent coming under pressure talk straight or die shrieked the human into his face no shrieked right back at him how can i talk straight you son of a threelegged dog i dont speak taiwanese all of this was said in perfect taiwanese no was stunned the gift of tongues was not one demons possessed except the warlocks more proof he intended to ponder this development for a few moments now that the knifewielding human had backed off but suddenly the beauty of language exploded inside his brain even his own tongue gnommish had been severely culled by the demons there were thousands of words that had dropped from regular use on the basis that they did not relate to killing things or eating them and not necessarily in that order cappuccino shouted no surprising everyone excuse me said minerva what a lovely word and manoeuvre and balloon the skinny man pocketed his knife now hes talking if hes anything like the videos you showed me of the other one well never get him to shut up pink exclaimed no delightedly we dont have a word for that colour in the demon commonspeak pink is considered undemonlike so we ignore it its such a relief to be able to say pink pink said minerva fabulous tell me said no what is a candyfloss i know the words and it sounds scrumptious but the picture in my head cannot be accurate the girl seemed pleased that no could talk but slightly miffed that he had forgotten his situation we can talk about candyfloss later little demon there are more important things to discuss yes agreed kong the demon invasion for example no rolled the sentence round in his head sorry my gifts must not be fully developed the only meaning i have for invasion is a hostile entry of an armed force into a territory thats the one i mean you little toad again im a little confused my new vocabulary is telling me that a toad is a froglike creature no s face fell oh i see youre insulting me kong scowled at minerva i think i preferred him when he spoke like an old movie i was quoting scripture explained no enjoying the shape of these new words in his mouth from the sacred book lady heatherington smythes hedgerow minerva frowned looking at the ceiling as she thought back in time lady heatherington smythe why is that familiar lady heatherington smythes hedgerow is the source of all our human knowledge lord abbot brought it back to us no bit his lip shutting off his own babbling he had said too much already these humans were the enemy and he had given them the blueprint to abbots plans blueprint nice word minerva clapped her hands once sharply she had found the memory she was looking for lady heatherington smythe my goodness that ridiculous romance remember mister kong kong shrugged i dont read fiction manuals mostly no remember the video footage of the other demon we let him have a book he carried it around like a security blanket ah yes i remember that stupid little goat always toting around that stupid book you know youre repeating yourself said no wittering nervously there are other words for stupid dim dense slow thick just to name a few i can do taiwanese if you prefer a knife appeared in kongs hand as if from nowhere wow said no thats a real talent a bravura in fact kong ignored the compliment flipping the knife so he was holding the blade just shut up creature or this goes between your eyes i dont care how valuable you are to miss paradizo to me you and your kind are simply something to be wiped off the face of the earth minerva folded her arms i will thank you mister kong not to threaten our guest you work for my father and you will do what my father tells you to do and i am pretty sure my father told you to keep a civil tongue in your head minerva paradizo may have been a precocious talent in many areas but because of her age she had limited experience from her studies she knew how to read body language but she did not know that a skilled martial artist can train himself to control his body so that his real feelings are hidden a true disciple of the discipline would have noted the subtle tightening of the tendons in billy kongs neck this was a man holding himself in check not yet his stance said not yet minerva returned her attention to no lady heatherington smythes hedgerow you say no nodded he was afraid to speak in case his runaway mouth leaked any more information than it already had minerva spoke now to the large mirror you remember that one papa the most ridiculous fluffy romance you are ever likely to avoid like the plague i loved it when i was six its all about a nineteenthcentury english aristocrat oh whos the author carter cooper harbison the canadian girl she was eighteen when she wrote it did absolutely no research she had nineteenthcentury nobles speaking like they were from the fifteen hundreds absolute tosh so obviously a worldwide hit well it seems our old friend abbot brought it home with him the cheeky devil has managed to sell it as gospel truth it seems he has the rest of the demons spouting cooper harbison as though she were an evangelist no broke his nospeaking vow abbot abbot was here mais oui said minerva how do you think we knew where to find you abbot told us everything a voice boomed through a wallmounted speaker not everything his figures were flawed but my young genius minerva figured it out ill get you a pony for this darling whatever colour you like minerva waved at the mirror thank you papa you should know by now that i dont like ponies or ballet the speaker laughed thats my little girl what about a trip to disneyland paris you could dress as a princess perhaps after the selection committee said minerva with a smile the smile was slightly forced though she did not have time for disney dreams at the moment after i am sure of the nobel nomination we have less than a week to question our subjects and organize secure travel to the royal academy in stockholm no had another important question and lady heatherington smythes hedgerow its not true minerva laughed delightedly true my dear little fellow nothing could be further from the truth that book is a cringeworthy testament to teenage hormonal fabrication no was stunned but i studied that book for hours i acted out scenes i made costumes are you telling me that there is no heatherington hall no heatherington hall and no evil prince karloz fiction no remembered something but abbot came back with a crossbow just like in the book thats evidence kong joined the discussion after all this was his area of expertise crossbows ancient history toad we use things like these now billy kong drew a black ceramic handgun from a holster tucked in his armpit this little beauty shoots fire and death weve got much bigger ones too we fly round the world in our metal birds and rain down exploding eggs on our enemies no snorted that little thing shoots fire and death flying metal birds and i suppose you eat lead and blow golden bubbles too kong did not respond well to cynicism especially from a little reptilian creature in one fluid motion he flicked the safety off his weapon and fired three shots blowing apart the headrest of no s seat the imps face was showered with sparks and splinters and the sound of the shots echoed like thunder in the confined space minerva was furious she began screaming long before anyone could hear her get out of here kong out she kept screaming this or words to that effect until their ears stopped ringing when minerva realized that billy kong was ignoring her commands she switched to taiwanese i told my father not to employ you you are an impulsive and violent man we are conducting a scientific experiment here this demon is of no use to me if he is dead do you understand you reckless man i need to communicate with our guest so you must leave because you obviously terrify him go now i warn you or your contract will be terminated kong rubbed the bridge of his nose it was taking every shred of patience he had not to dispose of this whingeing infant right now and take his chances with her security but it would be foolhardy to risk everything because he could not hold his temper for a few more hours for now he would have to content himself with some more insolence kong took a small mirror from his trouser pocket and plucked at the gelled strands of his hair i will go now little girl but be careful how you speak to me you may come to regret it minerva split the fingers of her right hand into a w whatever she said in english kong pocketed his mirror winked at no and left no did not feel comforted by that wink in the demon world you winked at your opponent in pitched battle to make clear your intention to kill him next no got the distinct impression that this spikyhaired human had that same intention minerva sighed took a moment to compose herself then resumed her interview with the prisoner lets start at the beginning what is your name no supposed that was a safe question to answer i have no real name because i never warped i used to worry about that but now i seem to have a lot more to worry about minerva realized that her questions would have to be quite specific what do people call you you mean human people or other demons demons oh right they call me number one number one thats right its not much of a name but its all i have and i console myself with the fact that its better than number two i see well then number one i suppose you would like to know whats going on here nos eyes were wide and pleading yes please ok then minerva began as she sat facing her prisoner two years ago one of your pride materialized here just popped up in the middle of the night on the statue of dartagnan in the courtyard he was lucky not to be killed actually dartagnans sword actually pierced one of his arms the tip broke off inside was the sword silver asked no yes yes it was of course we realized later that the silver anchored him to this dimension otherwise he would have been attracted to his own space and time the demon was of course abbot my parents wanted to call the gendarmes but i persuaded them to bring the poor halfdead beast inside papa has a small surgery here that he uses for his more paranoid patients he treated abbots burns but we missed the silver tip until a few weeks later when the wound became infected and papa did an xray abbot was quite fascinating to observe initially and for many days he flew into a psychotic rage whenever a human approached him he tried to kill us all and vowed that his army was coming to exterminate humankind from the face of the earth he conducted long arguments with himself it was more than split personality it was as if there were two people in one body a warrior and a scientist the warrior would rage and thrash then the scientist would write calculations on the wall i knew that i was on to something important here something revolutionary i had discovered a new species or rather rediscovered an old one and if abbot really was to bring a demon army then it was up to me to save lives human and demon but of course i am merely a child so no one would listen to me but if i could record this and present it to the nobel committee in stockholm i could win the physics prize and establish demons as a protected species saving a species would give me a certain satisfaction and no child has ever won the prize before not even the great artemis fowl something had been puzzling no arent you a little young to be studying other species and youre a girl too that pony offer made by the magic voice box sounded pretty good minerva had obviously come across this attitude before times are changing demon she snapped children are a lot smarter than they used to be were writing books mastering computers tearing apart scientific myths did you know that most scientists wont even acknowledge the existence of magic once you add magic into the energy equation nearly all the current laws of physics are shown to be seriously flawed i see said no not convincing anyone i am exactly the right age for this project added minerva i am young enough to believe in magic and old enough to understand how it works when i present you in stockholm and we put forward our thesis on time travel and magic as elemental energy it will be a historic moment the world will have to take magic seriously and make ready for the invasion there is no invasion protested no minerva smiled as a kindergarten teacher would at a fibbing child i know all about it once abbots warrior personality became dominant he told us about the battle of taillte and how the demons would return and wage a terrible war with the mud men as he called us there was a lot of blood and hacking of limbs involved no nodded that sounded like abbot thats what abbot believed but things have changed i explained that to him i explained that he had been flitting through time and space for ten thousand years and that we had come a long way since then there are more of us than there used to be and we didnt use crossbows any more you didnt you dont you saw mister kongs gun thats only a tiny example of the kind of weaponry we have even if your entire pride of demons arrived all together armed to the teeth it would take about ten minutes to have you all locked up is that what youre going to do lock us up that was the plan yes admitted minerva as soon as abbot realized that the demons could never beat us he changed his tactics he voluntarily explained the mechanics of the time tunnel to me and in return i gave him books to read and old weapons to examine after a few days reading he asked to be called abbot after general leon abbot in the book i knew that once i presented leon abbot in stockholm it would be easy to get funding for an international task force whenever a demon popped up we could tag him with silver and house him in an artificial demon community for study central park zoo was my preferred location no ran the word zoo through his new lexicon arent zoos for animals minerva gazed at her feet yes i am rethinking that especially having met you you seem quite civilized not like that abbot creature he was an animal when he arrived we tended his wounds nursed him back to health and all he could do was try to eat us we had no choice but to restrain him so youre not going to lock us up in a zoo any more actually i dont have a choice judging by my calculations the time tunnel is unravelling at both ends and deteriorating along the shaft soon any calculations will be unreliable and it will be impossible to predict where or when demons will materialize im afraid number one that your pride doesnt have long left before it disappears altogether no was stunned this was more information than anyone could absorb in one day for some reason the demoness with the red markings flashed into his mind isnt there any way to help we are intelligent beings you know not animals minerva stood and paced stretching one of her corkscrew curls i have been giving this some thought theres nothing that can be done without magic and abbot told me the warlocks all died in the transition its true said no he did not mention that he might be a warlock himself something told him that this was valuable information and it was not a good idea to reveal too much valuable information to a person who had tied you to a chair he had said too much already maybe if abbot had known about the time spell he wouldnt have been so eager to get back to hybras mused minerva papa told him that there was a silver chip in his arm and that very night he dug it out with his nails and disappeared we have the whole thing on tape i have wondered every day if he managed to make it home he made it said no the time spell took him right back to the beginning he never said anything about this place just turned up with the book and the crossbow claiming to be our saviour it was all lies well then sighed minerva and she seemed genuinely sorry i dont have a single idea about how to save the pride maybe your little friend in the next room can help when she wakes up what little friend asked no puzzled the one who knocked out bobo my brother the little creature we captured trying to rescue you explained minerva or more accurately trying to rescue an empty golf bag she looks like a magical creature maybe she can help who would want to rescue a golf bag wondered no the door opened a crack and juan sotos head appeared in the gap minerva not now snapped minerva waving at the man to go away theres a call for you im not available take a number the security guard persisted he stepped into the room one hand cupped over the mouthpiece of a cordless phone i think you might want to talk to this person he says his name is artemis fowl minerva gave so to her full attention ill take it she said reaching for the phone the lep recon field helmet is an amazing piece of equipment the section field helmet on the other hand is a miracle of modern science to compare the two would be akin to comparing a flintlock to a lasersighted sniper rifle foaly had taken full advantage of his almost unlimited budget to indulge his every techhead fantasy and stuff the helmet with every piece of diagnostic surveillance defence and just plain cool equipment he could cram in there the centaur was vocally proud of the entire package but if forced to pick just one addon to brag about he would go for the bouncing bags every time bouncing bags in themselves were not a recent addition even civilian helmets had gel bags in between their outer and inner shells which provided a bit of extra buffering in case of a crash but foaly had replaced the helmets rigid outer shell with a more yielding polymer and then swapped the electrosensitive gel for tiny electrosensitive beads the beads could be controlled with electronic pulses to expand contract roll or group providing the helmet with a simple but highly effective propulsion system this little marvel cant fly but it can bounce wherever you want it to foaly had said earlier when holly was signing out her equipment only commanders get the flying helmets i wouldnt recommend them though the engines field has been known to straighten perms not that im saying you have a perm or need one for that matter while no was being interrogated by minerva foaly was flexing his fingers over the remote controls for hollys section helmet at the moment the helmet was locked in a wire mesh strongbox at the rear of the security office foaly liked to sing a little ditty while he worked in this instance the song was the riverbend classic if it looks like a dwarf and smells like a dwarf then its probably a dwarf or a latrine wearing dungarees this was a relatively short title for a riverbend song which was the fairy equivalent of human country and western when i got an itch i cant scratch when theres a slug in my vole stew when i got sunburn on my bald patch thats when i remember you foaly had considerately switched off his mike so artemis would not have the chance to object to his singing in fact he was using an extremely old hardwired antenna to send his signal in the hope that no one in police plaza would pick up on his transmission haven city was in lockdown and that meant no communications with the surface foaly was knowingly disobeying commander ark sools orders and he was quite enjoying himself doing it the centaur donned a set of vgoggles through which he could see everything in the helmets vista not only that but the goggles pip facility gave him rear and side views from the helmets cameras foaly already had control of the chateaus security systems now he wanted to have a little peek through their computer files something he could not do from section hq especially not with the lep waiting to pounce on any signal coming out of the city the helmet was naturally equipped with wireless omnisensor capabilities but the closer he could get to an actual hard drive the quicker the job could be completed foaly pressed a combination key command on his vkeyboard to anyone watching it would have seemed like the centaur was playing an invisible piano but in fact the vgoggles interpreted the movements as key strokes a small laser pencil popped out of a hidden compartment just above the right earcushion of hollys helmet foaly targeted the wire mesh boxs locking mechanism one second burst fire nothing happened so foaly swore briefly turned on his microphone and tried it again one second burst fire this time a red beam pulsed from the pencils tip and the lock melted into metallic mush always good to have the equipment switched on thought foaly glad that no one had witnessed his mistake especially not artemis fowl foaly targeted a desktop computer at the far side of the office with a glare and three blinks compute bounce he ordered the helmet and almost immediately an animated dotted arrow appeared on the screen dipping once to the floor and then rising to the computer desk execute bounce said foaly and smiled as his creation rolled into life the helmet hit the floor with a basketball ping then bounced across the room directly on to the computer desk perfect you genius said foaly congratulating himself sometimes his own achievements brought a tear to his eye i wish caballine could have seen that he thought and then wow i must be getting serious about this girl caballine was a centaur he had bumped into at a gallery downtown she was a researcher with pptv by day and a sculptor by night a very smart lady and she knew all about foaly apparently caballine was a big fan of the mood blanket a multisensor massage and homeopathic garment designed by foaly specifically for centaurs so they talked about that for half an hour one thing led to another and now he found himself jogging with her every evening whenever there wasnt an emergency which there is now he reminded himself turning his attention back to work the helmet was sitting next to the human computer keyboard with its omnisensor pointed directly at the hard drive foaly stared at the hard drive and blinked three times selecting it on the screen download all files from this and any networked computers instructed the centaur and the helmet immediately began to suck information from the apple mac after several seconds an animated bottle on the vgoggles screen was filled to the brim and burped transfer completed now they could find out exactly how much information these humans had and where they were getting it from but there was still the matter of backup files this group could have burned their information on to cds or even sent it by email or stored it on the internet foaly used the virtual keyboard to open a data charge folder and send a virus into the human computer the charge would completely wipe any computers on the network but before that it would run along any internet pathways explored by these humans and completely burn the sites foaly would like to be a bit more delicate about it and just erase fairyrelated files but he couldnt afford to take chances with this mysterious group the mere fact that they had avoided detection for so long was proof that they were not to be trifled with this was a major virus to lob into a human system it would probably crash thousands of sites including google or yahoo but foaly didnt see that he had a choice on foalys screen the data charge appeared as a red flickering flame that chuckled nastily as it dived into the omnisensors data stream in five minutes the paradizos hard drives would be burned beyond repair and as an added bonus the charge would also attach itself to any storage devices within the sensors range that bore the networks signature so any information stored on cds or flashdrives would disintegrate as soon as someone tried to load them it was potent stuff and there wasnt a firewall or antivirus that could stop it artemiss voice issued from two gel speakers in jars on the desk interrupting his concentration theres a wall safe in the office its where minerva keeps her notes you need to burn anything inside it wall safe replied foaly lets see the centaur ran an xray scan on the room and found the safe behind a row of shelving given the time he would like to scan all the contents but he had a rendezvous to keep he sent a concentrated laser beam the width of a length of fishing line into the belly of the safe reducing the contents to ash hopefully he was destroying more than the family jewels the xray scan revealed nothing else promising so foaly sent the helmet beads spinning toppling hollys helmet off the desk in a display of keyboard virtuosity foaly used the laser to carve a section from the base of the office door while the helmet was in midair in two choreographed bounces the helmet was through the section and into the corridor outside foaly grinned satisfied never even touched the wood he said the centaur called up a blueprint for the chateau paradizo and superimposed it over a grid on his screen there were two dots on the grid one was the helmet and the other was holly it was time the two were reunited as he worked foaly unconsciously sang a verse of the riverbend dirge when my lucky numbers run out of luck when im stuck in the hole i tumbled into when my favourite dawg gets squashed by a truck thats when i think me some thoughts of you on the planets surface artemis winced as the song twanged through his tiny phone and along his thumb please foaly he said in pained tones im trying to negotiate on the other line foaly whinnied surprised hed forgotten about artemis some people aint got no riverbend in their souls he said switching off his microphone billy kong decided that hed have a little word with the new prisoner the female if indeed she was female how was he supposed to know for sure what class of a creature it was it looked like a girl but maybe demon girls werent the same as human ones so billy kong thought he might ask it what exactly it was among other things if the creature decided not to answer kong didnt mind there were ways to persuade people to talk asking them nicely was one way giving them candy was another but billy kong preferred torture back in the early eighties when billy kong was still plain old jonah lee he lived in the california beach town of malibu with his mother annie and big brother eric annie worked two jobs to keep her boys in sneakers so jonah got left with eric in the evenings that should have worked out fine eric was sixteen and old enough to look after his kid brother but like most sixteenyearolds he had more on his mind than little brothers in fact sitting with jonah was seriously interfering with his social life the problem was as eric saw it that jonah was an outdoorsy kind of boy as soon as eric took off to hang out with his friends jonah would ignore his big brothers orders and head out into the california evening and outdoors in the city was no place for an eightyearold so what eric needed to do was devise a strategy that kept jonah indoors and allowed him to roam free he came upon the perfect plan quite by accident one night returning home after a latenight argument with his girlfriends other boyfriend and brothers for once jonah had not ventured out and was plonked in front of the tv watching horror shows on hacked cable eric who had always been impulsive and reckless had taken to sneaking around with the girlfriend of a local gangster now word had leaked out and the gang was after him they had roughed him up a bit already but he had got away he was bloody and tired but still kind of enjoying himself lock the doors he called to his little brother startling him out of his tv stupor jonah jumped to his feet eyes widening as he noticed erics bloodied nose and lip what happened to you eric grinned he was that kind of person exhausted battered but buzzing with adrenaline i got there was this bunch of and then he stopped because the spark of an idea was ricocheting around in his head he must look pretty beatup maybe he could use this to keep little jonah indoors while mom was working i cant tell you he said dragging a smear of blood across his face with one sleeve ive sworn an oath just bolt the doors and close the shutters usually jonah didnt have time for his brothers theatrics but tonight there was blood and horror on the tv and he could hear footsteps pounding up the driveway dammit theyve found me swore eric peeking through a shutter little jonah grabbed his brothers sleeve whos found you eric you gotta tell me eric appeared to consider it ok he said finally i belong to a uh secret society we fight a secret enemy what like a gang no said eric we fight demons demons said little jonah half sceptical half scared out of his wits yeah theyre all over california by day theyre normal guys accountants and basketball players stuff like that but at night they peel off their skin and go hunting kids under tens under tens like me like you exactly like you i found these demons chewing on a couple of twin girls maybe eight years old i killed most of em but a few mustve followed me home we gotta stay real quiet and theyll go away jonah rushed for the phone we should call mom no said eric snatching the phone you want to get mom killed is that what you want the idea of his mother dying started jonah crying no mom cant die exactly said eric gently you gotta leave the demonslaying to me and my boys when youre fifteen then you get to be sworn in but until then this is our secret you stay in the house and let me do my duty promise jonah nodded blubbering too much to say the word and so the brothers sat huddled on the sofa while erics girlfriends boyfriends brothers battered on the windows and called him out this is a cruel trick eric thought maybe ill just let it run jot a couple of months itll keep the kid out of trouble until everything dies down the deception worked well jonah didnt set foot outside the house after dusk for weeks he sat on the settee with his knees drawn to his chin waiting for eric to return with elaborate demonslaying stories every night he feared that his brother would not return that the demons would kill him one night his fears came to pass the cops said that eric had been killed by a notorious gang of brothers who had been gunning for him something about a girl but jonah knew different he knew the demons had done it they had peeled off their faces and killed his brother so jonah lee now known as billy kong was going in to see holly carrying the weight of his childhood memories for the sake of his sanity he had managed to convince himself over the decades that there were no demons and that his beloved brother had lied to him this betrayal had messed him up for years preventing him forming lasting relationships and making it a lot easier for him to hurt people and now this crazy minerva girl was paying him to help her to hunt down actual demons and it turns out they are real he had seen them with his own eyes at this stage billy kong couldnt tell fact from fiction a part of him believed that hes had a bad accident and that all of this was coma hallucination all billy knew for sure was that if there was the slightest chance that these demons were the same ones who killed eric then they were going to pay holly was not too happy playing the victim she had enough of this in the academy every time the curriculum threw up a roleplaying game holly as the only girl in that class was picked to be the hostage or the elf walking home alone or the teller facing a bank robber she tried to object that this was stereotyping but the instructor replied that stereotypes were stereotypes for a reason so get that blonde wig on so when artemis proposed that she allow herself to get caught holly took a bit of persuading now she was sitting tied to a wooden chair in a dark damp basement room waiting for some human to come and torture her the next time artemis had a plan involving someone being taken hostage he could play the part himself it was ridiculous she was a captain in her eighties and artemis was a fourteenyearold civilian and yet he was dishing out the orders and she was taking them thats because artemis is a tactical genius said her sensible side oh shut up responded her irritated side eloquently and then billy kong came into the room and proceeded to irritate holly even further he glided across the floor like a pale hairgelled ghost circling holly silently several times before speaking tell me something demon can you peel off your face holly met his eyes with what my teeth hands tied moron billy kong sighed lately everyone under five feet seemed to think it was their prerogative to give him verbal abuse you probably know im not supposed to kill you said billy teasing his hair into spikes but i often do things that im not supposed to holly decided to crack this humans confidence a little i know that billy or should i say jonah youve done a lot of bad things over the years kong took a step back you know me we know all about you billy weve been watching you for years this wasnt strictly true of course holly knew no more about kong than foaly had told her perhaps she wouldnt have baited him if shed known about his demon history to billy kong this simple statement was confirmation of everything eric had told him suddenly the building blocks of his beliefs and understandings toppled and smashed beyond repair it was all true eric had not lied demons walked the earth and his brother had tried to protect him and paid with his life you remember my brother he asked his voice shaking holly presumed that this was a test foaly had mentioned a brother yes i remember derek wasnt it kong pulled a stiletto from his breast pocket gripping it so tightly his knuckles whitened eric he shouted spittle spraying from his mouth it was eric do you remember what happened to him holly felt suddenly nervous this mud man was unstable it would only take her a second to escape from these bonds but maybe a second was too long artemis had requested that she remain bound for as long as possible but from the look on billy kongs face it seemed as if staying bound could be a fatal mistake do you remember what happened to my brother asked kong again waving the knife like a conductors baton i remember said holly he died violently kong was thunderstruck reeling internally for several moments he circled the room muttering to himself which didnt encourage holly any its true eric never betrayed me my brother loved me he loved me and they took him holly took advantage of this lack of focus to escape from the plastic ties binding her wrists she did this using an old lep trick taught to her by commander vinyaya back in the academy she rubbed her wrists against the rough edge causing two small grazes when magical sparks erupted from her fingertips to heal the wounds she siphoned a few off to melt the plastic enough for her to yank her way out when kong faced holly again she was untethered but concealing the fact kong knelt before her so their eyes were level he was blinking rapidly and his pulse beat in a temple vein he spoke slowly in a voice fraught with barely repressed madness and violence he had switched to taiwanese his familys first language i want you to peel off your face right now this reasoned kong would be the final proof if this demon could peel off her face then he would stab her in the heart and damn the consequences i cant said holly my hands are tied why dont you peel it off for me we have new masks now disposable they come off easily kong coughed in surprise rocking back on his hunkers then he steadied himself and reached out shaking hands his hands did not shake from fear but from anger and sorrow that he had dishonoured his brothers memory by believing the worst of him at the hairline said holly just grab and pull dont worry if you tear it kong looked up and they made eye contact this was all holly needed to employ the magical fairy mesmer dont those arms feel heavy she asked her voice layered and irresistible kongs brow suddenly creased and the creases filled with sweat my arms what theyre like lead like two lead pipes i cant holly pushed the mesmer a little harder why dont you put them down take it easy sit on the floor kong sat on the concrete im just going to sit for a second were still doing the facepeeling thing but in a second im tired you probably feel like talking you know what demon i feel like talking what should we talk about this whole group youre involved with billy the paradizos tell me about them kong snorted the paradizos youre only dealing with one paradizo here and thats the girl minerva her daddy is just a money man if minerva wants it gaspard pays for it hes so proud of his little girl the genius that he does whatever she says can you believe that she convinced him to keep the whole demon thing quiet until after the nobel committee get a look at her research this was very good news you mean that no one outside this house knows about the demons hardly anybody inside the house knows minerva is paranoid that some other egghead will get hold of her work the staff think were guarding a political prisoner who needs his face redone only juan soto the chief of inhouse security and myself were told the truth does minerva keep records records she writes everything down and i mean everything we have records of every demon action right down to toilet breaks shes got every twitch on video the only reason that theres no cameras down here is that we werent expecting anyone where does she keep these notes a little wall safe in the security office minerva thinks i dont know the combination but i do bobos birthday holly touched a skincoloured microphone pad glued to her throat a wall safe in the security office she said clearly i hope youre getting that there was no reply wearing an earpiece had been too risky so holly had to make do with the mike pad on her neck and iriscam suckered like a contact lens over her right eye kong still felt like talking you know im going to kill all of you demons ive got a plan real clever too miss minerva thinks that shes going to stockholm but thats never going to happen im just waiting for the right moment i know that silver is the only thing keeping you in this dimension so im going to send you back and give you a little present to take with you not if i can help it thought holly kong half smiled at her are we doing the facepeeling thing can you really do that of course i can said holly are you sure you want to see it kong nodded slackjawed ok then watch carefully holly raised her hands to her face and when she took them away her head had disappeared her body and limbs quickly followed suit not only can i peel off my face said hollys voice from thin air i can do my entire body its true croaked kong its all true then a tiny invisible fist swished through the air knocking him into unconsciousness billy kong lay on the concrete floor dreaming that he was jonah lee once more and his brother stood before him saying i told you so bio i told you there were demons they murdered me back in malibu so what are you going to do about it and little jonah answered im working on it eric minerva accepted the phone from the security guard minerva paradizo speaking minerva this is artemis fowl said a voice in perfect french we met once across a crowded room in sicily i know who you are we nearly met in barcelona too and i know its really you i memorized your voice pattern and cadence from a lecture you gave on balkan politics two years ago at trinity college very good i find it strange that i havent heard of you minerva smiled i am not as careless as you artemis i prefer anonymity until i have something exceptional to be recognized for the existence of demons for instance prompted artemis that would be exceptional minerva gripped the phone tightly yes master fowl it would be exceptional it is exceptional so you can keep your irish paws off my research the last thing i need is for some bigheaded teenage boy to hijack all my work at the last second you had your own demon but that wasnt enough you had to try and steal mine too the moment i recognized you in barcelona i knew you would be after my research subject i knew you would try to smoke us out have someone hide in the car it was the logical thing to do so i boobytrapped the vehicle you knocked out my baby brother too how could you apparently i did you a favour said artemis lightly little bobo is obnoxious by all accounts is that why you called me to insult my family no replied artemis i do apologize that was juvenile i called you to try and make you see sense there is much more at stake here than a nobel prize not to belittle the prize of course minerva smiled knowingly artemis fowl whatever your pretence you called me because your plan failed i have your demon and you want her back but if it makes you feel better please proceed with your good of humanity speech outside on the bluff overlooking chateau paradizo artemis frowned this girl reminded him a lot of himself eighteen months ago when achievement and acquisition were everything and family and friends were secondary honesty on this occasion actually was the best policy miss paradizo he said gently minerva listen to me for a few moments you will feel the truth of what i say minerva tutted why is that because were connected actually we are we are similar people both the most intelligent person in whatever room we happen to be in both constantly underestimated both determined to shine brightest in whichever discipline we pursue both dogged by scorn and loneliness ridiculous scoffed minerva but her protestations rang hollow i am not lonely i have my work artemis persisted i know how it feels minerva and let me tell you no matter how many prizes you win no matter how many theorems you prove it will not be enough to make people like you oh spare me your amateur psychology lectures youre not even three years older than me artemis was injured hardly amateur and for your information age is often detrimental to intelligence i have written a paper on the subject in psychology today under the pseudonym doctor c niall demencha minerva giggled i get it senile dementia very good artemis himself smiled you are the first person to get that i always am me too dont you find that tiresome incredibly i mean what is wrong with people everybody says that i have no sense of humour then i construct a perfectly sound pun round a wellknown psychological condition and it is ignored people should be rolling in the aisles absolutely agreed minerva that happens to me all the time i know i loved that murray gellmann kidnapping a quark joke that you did on the train very clever analogy the congenial conversation ground to a frosty halt how did you hear that how long have you been spying on me artemis was quietly stunned he had not meant to reveal that fact it was most unlike him to chatter on about trifles when there were lives at stake but he liked this minerva girl she was so like him there was a security camera in the corridor on the train i procured the tape had it enhanced and read your lips hmm said minerva i dont remember a camera it was there inside a red plastic bubble fisheye lens i apologize for the intrusion of your privacy but it was an emergency minerva was silent for a moment artemis we could have a lot to talk about i havent talked this much with a boy in well ever but i have to finish this project can you call me again in six weeks six weeks will be too late the world will be a different place and possibly not a better one artemis stop it i was just beginning to like you and now were back where we started just give me one more minute artemis insisted if i cant convince you in a single minute then i will hang up and leave you to your research fiftynine said minerva fiftyeight artemis wondered if all girls were so emotional holly could be this way too warm one moment and icy the next you are holding two creatures captive both sentient neither human if you expose either one to the wider scientific community then their kind will be hunted down you will be responsible for the extinction of at least one species is that what you want thats what they want retorted minerva the first one we rescued threatened to kill us all and possibly eat us he said that the demons would return and wipe out the human scourge i know all about abbot said artemis using what he had learned from minervas own surveillance cameras he was a dinosaur demons could never take on humans now judging by my temporal calculations abbot was whisked ten thousand years into his own future and then sent back again declaring war on demons would be like declaring war on monkeys in fact monkeys would be a bigger threat there are more of them and anyway the demons cant even fully materialize unless we shoot them full of silver i am sure they will find a way around that or one could get through accidentally just like abbot then open the gates for the rest of them highly unlikely i mean really minerva what are the odds so artemis fowl wants me to forget all about my nobel project and turn my demon captives loose forget the project certainly said artemis checking his watch but i dont think there is any need for you to set your captives free oh really and why is that because i imagine they are already gone minerva spun round to face the spot where no had been sitting it was empty her captive demon had disappeared along with his chair a perfunctory sweep told her the entire room was empty except for her where is he artemis she screamed into the phone where is my prize forget about all of this said artemis softly its not worth it take it from someone who has made your mistakes i will call you soon minerva squeezed the phone as though it were artemiss neck you tricked me she said the truth suddenly dawning on her you allowed me to capture your demon but artemis did not reply he had reluctantly closed his fist on the conversation generally outsmarting someone gave him a warm and fuzzy feeling but hoodwinking minerva paradizo just made him feel like a sneak it was ironic that he felt like a bad guy now that he was almost a good guy butler glanced across at him from his perch on the knoll how did that go he asked your first lengthy conversation with a girl your own age fabulous said artemis voice dripping with sarcasm were planning a june wedding chapter turned tables chateau paradizo when holly short had opened the door of her makeshift basement cell she found her helmet bouncing on the spot in front of her with a threedimensional image of foalys face projected on to it that is really creepy she said couldnt you just text me foaly had included a threedimensional help program in hollys helmets computer it came as no surprise to holly that he had given the help module his own features ive lost some weight since this model was constructed said foalys image ive been jogging every evening focus holly ordered holly dipped her chin and foaly bounced the helmet on to her head she sealed it tight where is the demon straight up the stairs second on the left answered foaly good youve wiped our patterns from the security system of course the demon is invisible and you cant be picked up no matter what kind of lens they use holly jumped up the humansized steps it would have been easier to fly but she had left her wings outside along with her suit computer there had been no need to risk placing them in human hands other than artemiss and even that took a little thinking about she hurried along the corridor past the first door on the left and crept through the open doorway of the second taking in the situation with a quick scan of the room the demon was secured on a chair and the human girl was on the phone facing away from him there was a large twoway mirror on the wall holly used her thermal scan to ascertain that the adjoining room had one occupant a large male he appeared to be talking on his mobile phone not facing the demons cell should i stun her asked foaly hopefully she knocked you out with sleeping gas he was quite enjoying playing with his new toy it was like a firstperson computer game i wasnt actually unconscious said holly her words contained by the helmets seal i was holding my breath artemis had told me that she would use gas the first thing i did was vent the vehicle what about that mud man next door persisted foaly i can focus the laser through the glass its quite clever really shut up or you will pay for it when i get home warned holly we only shoot in an emergency holly skirted minerva careful to avoid brushing against the mud girl or treading on a loose board a single creak now could scupper all their plans she squatted before the little demon who did not seem too worried about his plight what he was actually doing was listing off words and having a little giggle after every one cornucopia oh very good he said and then sanitary i like that one hee hee marvellous thought holly this demon obviously lost a few brain cells in the transfer she used voice command to type a text on her visor nod if you can read this the text read to the demon the words appeared floating in space before him nod if you can he mouthed then stopped and began nodding furiously stop nodding sent holly i am an elf one of the first family of fairies i am here to rescue you do you understand no response so holly sent a command nod once if you understand a single nod from the demon good all you need to do is stay very still and quiet another nod the little demon was catching on foaly had transferred his image to the inside of hollys visor ready asked the centaur yep you keep an eye on the mud man next door if he turns round then you can stun him holly wiggled her hand up her right sleeve pincering a sheet of foil between her index and middle fingers this is not as easy as it sounds when a fairy is shielded and vibrating at speeds faster than the human eye can follow it was made easier by the section suit which reduced the amount of vibration necessary holly pulled out and unfolded a large square of cam foil that automatically projected a fair approximation of what should be behind it each bead on the cam foil was actually a fairymade multifaceted diamond that could reflect accurately no matter what the viewing angle was she backed up close to no then held up the sheet of foil the foil was equipped with multisensor technology so it was a simple matter for foaly to wipe no from the projection to minerva it would seem that her demon captive had simply vanished to no it would seem like nothing whatsoever was happening and that this was the lamest rescue in the history of rescues seconds later minerva turned quickly to face them no nodded hello and was amazed to find that she could not see him where is he artemis the girl screamed into her phone where is my prize no thought about saying im right here but decided against it you tricked me squealed minerva you allowed me to capture your demon finally the penny drops thought holly now go and search the chateau like a good girl minerva obligingly stalked out of the room yelling for her father next door papa paradizo hearing his daughters screams closed his phone and began to turn foaly activated the helmet laser and shot him in the chest he tumbled to the floor and lay in a heap his chest heaving with the slow breaths of the unconscious sweet crowed the centaur did you see that not so much as a smudge on the glass he was heading for the door objected holly dropping the cam foil he was coming to the glass i had to stun him we will talk about this later foaly i do not like your new gungho attitude caballine likes me to be masterful she calls me her stallion who listen just stop talking hissed holly melting nos bonds with two sharp laser bursts free exclaimed the imp jumping to his feet liberated unbound without restrictions holly shut off her shield revealing herself to no i hope thats a helmet said no holly touched a button and her visor slid up yes i am a fairy just like you just a different family an elf exclaimed no delightedly an actual elf i hear you cook your food and like music is that true occasionally when were not trying to escape from murderous humans oh theyre not murderous pugnacious homicidal or even bellicose maybe not the one you met but theres a guy with funny hair in the basement and believe me when he wakes up hes going to be murderous and all those other things you mentioned no remembered billy kong he had no desire to meet him again very well elf what next call me holly i am number one so what next holly next we escape there are friends waiting for us eh number one friends said no he knew the word of course but never imagined it could apply to him it was a warming notion even in these dire straits what do i do holly wrapped the cam foil round him like a shawl keep this on it will cover most of you amazing said no a cloak of invisibility foaly moaned in hollys ear a cloak of invisibility that is a highly sensitive piece of field equipment what does he think some warlock pulled it out of his armpit holly ignored the centaur something that was becoming a habit hold the foil close with one hand hang on to my belt with the other we need to get out of here quickly i only have enough magic left for a few minutes shielding ready no s anxious features peeped out from a shawl of invisibility hold the foil hang on to the belt got it good foaly watch our backs lets move out holly shielded then hurried out the open door pulling no behind her the corridor was lined with tall potted plants and lush oils including a matisse holly could hear the humans shouting in adjacent rooms there was activity all around them and it could only be seconds before some mud men spilled into this corridor no struggled to keep up his little legs stumbling along behind the superfit elfin captain it seemed impossible that they could escape all around was the clatter of approaching footsteps no slightly distracted snagged a toe on the cam foil and trampled it underfoot the foils electronics crackled and died the demon was as visible as a bloodstain on a patch of snow we lost the foil said foaly holly clenched her fingers she missed her handgun ok nothing to do but make a run for it foaly you have free rein if youll pardon the horse analogy finally whinnied the centaur i added a gamepod joystick to my controls a bit unorthodox but very accurate weve got hostiles converging from all sides my advice is to take the direct route go to the end of the corridor and follow our friend doodahs path out the window butler will cover you once youre in the open ok hold on number one whatever happens dont let go the first threat came from ahead two security guards rounded the corner guns extended expolice holly guessed covering the diagonals the men were shocked to see no obviously they were not in the needtoknow loop what the hell said one the other kept his nerve hold it right there foaly hit them both in the chest with fat laser bursts the energy sank through their clothes and they slid down the wall unconscious panted no comatose cataleptic out for the count he realized that this vocabularyspouting was a good way to deal with stress stress pressure strain and anxiety holly dragged no onwards towards the still open window more guards came from the side corridors and foaly dispatched them efficiently i should get bonus points for this he said or at the very least a free life there were two more guards in the sitting room sneaking an espresso foaly dropped them where they stood and then flashed out a fan laser burst to evaporate the coffee before it hit the rug its tunisian he explained very difficult to get coffee out now they can just suck up the grains holly stepped down into the room sometimes i think you dont quite get the gravity of field missions she said skirting a massive velvet sofa no stumbled down the humansized steps after his rescuer in spite of all his new vocabulary the imp was not quite sure how he was feeling scared of course big mud men with fire weapons and all that excited too being rescued by some kind of elf superhero who was invisible too pain in the leg dont forget that the angry human had shot him in the leg with a silver bullet no doubt but no realized that one feeling was missing from the melting pot one that had been strong within him for as long as he could remember uncertainty in spite of the frantic antics unfolding all around he felt more at home on this planet than he ever had on hybras a bullet whistled past his ear then again maybe hybras hadnt been so bad wake up foaly admonished holly youre supposed to be watching our backs sorry said the centaur swivelling the laser and strobing the doorway the female guard smiled broadly then collapsed on the ground she began singing a nursery rhyme about doggies and their bones bizarre said foaly that guard is singing often happens grunted holly clambering on to the window sill the laser knocks out some functions but sometimes awakens others interesting thought the centaur a happy gun certainly worth investigating holly reached down and grasped nos wrist pulling him over the sill she was dismayed to see that her own arms were not as invisible as she would have hoped her magic was wearing thin shielding was a real power siphon she would flicker into visibility soon whether they were safely away or not nearly there she said just across the wide open green space is it said no displaying a real gift for sarcasm i like him said foaly they tumbled out on to the lawn the alarm was well and truly raised now and guards poured from the various doors like beads from a ruptured beanbag go crazy foaly said holly and take out their vehicles too yes sir maam said foaly and began firing holly ran flat out pulling the imp behind her there was no time to consider his physical abilities either he kept up or he got dragged the laser pencil on her helmet flashed out burst after burst swivelling in wide arcs to cover the approaching guards holly felt the weapons heat on the crown of her head and resolved to mention the helmets supposedly revolutionary cooling system to foaly if they ever made it out of this the centaur was too busy for chat now all holly could hear through her headset was grunting and whinnying as foaly concentrated on his job he was not concerned about pinpoint accuracy any more there were too many things to shoot he sent out scything fans of energy that socked half a dozen guards per burst the guards would be perfectly fine in half an hour though some might experience headaches hair loss irritability loss of bowel control and other assorted side effects for a few days foaly targeted the fourwheel drives next firing several pulses into each petrol tank the bmws exploded in sequence turning spectacular fiery cartwheels the force of the blast cupped holly and no like a giant hand scooting them on their way a little faster hollys helmet protected her from the noise but poor nos head would ring for quite a while thick black smoke billowed from cracked engines and prowled across the tended garden more effective than any smoke grenade holly and no raced just ahead of the smoke line towards the main gates gates holly panted into her microphone i see them said foaly melting the wroughtiron barriers right off their hinges they collapsed to the ground with a big bell bong a rented mpv skidded to a halt outside the pillars and the passenger door slid open artemis was inside reaching out to no come on he said urgently get in arrgh said no a human holly leaped inside the vehicle dragging no with her its ok she said switching off her shield to conserve the little that was left hes a friend no clung to hollys back trying not to throw up he glanced towards the front of the mpv where butler sat what about him please tell me hes a friend too holly grinned climbing on to a seat yes hes a friend the very best butler yanked the gear stick into drive buckle up boys and girls were about to be in a car chase the sun was setting as butler expertly steered the car round the natural chicanes of the route de vence the road was hewn from the mountainside with stone villas teetering above and the gorge du loup yawning below it took a skilled driver to negotiate the bends at speed but butler had once driven an al fahd armoured vehicle through a crowded cairo market so the alpine roads were not too much of a challenge for him as it turned out there was no car chase the paradizo fleet lay in flaming mangled inverted heaps in the chateau driveway there was not so much as a moped left intact to tail the getaway car butler checked the rearview mirror constantly and only allowed himself a satisfied grin when they passed through the toll station at cagnes sur mer were clear he pronounced accelerating into the motorways fast lane theres not a vehicle intact on that estate including little beaus toy car artemis smiled giddy with success perhaps we should have left them mister days marvellous booster holly noticed that no was happily examining his seat belt buckle up she said slotting the buckle into its catch buckle said no clasp clip fastener why are you with these humans theyre going to help you explained holly gently no had a million questions and knew exactly how to phrase every one of them but for the moment words took a back seat to pictures and no s square impish jaw dropped further and further as he stared through the tinted glass absorbing the wonders of the modern motorway holly took the opportunity to catch up with events doodah and mulch got away ok yes confirmed artemis foaly was anxious to have the shuttle returned as he had taken it without clearance we shouldnt be more than a few hours behind them by the time you get to the shuttle port the shutdown should be lifted i wouldnt be surprised if youve earned yourself a medal holly job spectacularly well done there are still loose ends true but nothing an lep mindwipe team cant take care of there is no physical evidence that anything other than humans caused this devastation holly leaned back against the seat im forgetting something youre forgetting the demons their spell is disintegrating their island will be lost in time will be or has been they drift in and out of time making contact like a bouncing ball no picked up on one word disintegrating hybras is doomed said artemis frankly your home will shortly be dragged through the time tunnel along with everything on it when i say shortly i mean at our end at your end it could have already happened or maybe it will happen in a million years he extended his hand and by the way my name is artemis fowl no took the hand nibbling the forefinger as was the demon custom i am number one imp isnt there something we can do to save hybras hardly replied artemis retrieving his finger and checking it for bite marks the only way to save hybras is to bring it back to earth under controlled circumstances sadly the only people who could have done that were the warlocks and they are all dead no chewed his lip em well im not too sure but i might be a warlock i can speak in tongues artemis sat forward straining his seat belt speaking in tongues could be merely an aptitude what else can you do again not positive about this but i may have possibly turned wood to stone the gargoyles touch now that is interestingyou know number one theres something about you those markings you seem familiar to me artemis frowned irritated that he couldnt quite place the memory we havent met before i would certainly remember nevertheless there is something these markings are quite common especially the forehead hex demons often think they know me now about saving hybras artemis nodded of course the best course of action is to get you below ground i only dabble in magical theory foaly has live experts just dying to examine you i feel confident that the lep can come up with a plan to save your island really butler interrupted from the front of the car saving artemis from answering we have a bit of a situation at chateau paradizo he said tapping the screen of a compact laptop suckered to the dashboard maybe youd better take a look the bodyguard passed the computer over his shoulder the screen was divided into a dozen boxes the security feed from chateau paradizo still being supplied by foalys data twist artemis balanced the laptop on his knees his bright eyes flickering across the screen oh dear he said thoughtfully this is not good holly swapped seats so she could see the screen not good at all she said no was not too worried about the computer as far as he was concerned it was just a little box not good he mused accessing the dictionary in his head a synonym for bad artemis did not look up from the screen thats exactly right number one this is bad very bad chapter kong the king chateau paradizo minerva paradizo was simply furious that odious fowl boy had somehow stolen her research subject from right under her nose and after all the money papa had spent on security even hiring that despicable mister kong sometimes minerva wondered if all males were boors except papa of course the grounds were a mess master fowl had left quite a trail of destruction in his wake the cars were so much scrap metal the lawns were ploughed deep enough to plant vegetables and the stink of smoke and oil had penetrated every corner of every room only a hurried phone call to the police station in vence and a few improvised fabrications about a generator accident had prevented the arrival of a police car once the fires were under control minerva called a staff meeting on the patio juan soto the security chief her father gaspard and of course billy kong were in attendance mister kong seemed more agitated than usual demons muttered the malibu native true all true i have a responsibility to my brother finish what he started if minerva had been paying attention to billy kongs words she might have noticed a touch of the ominous about them but minerva was busy worrying about her own problems and in minervas opinion her own problems were far more important than anyone elses can we focus here everyone you may have noticed that my project is in crisis gaspard paradizo had just about had it with minervas project so far he had indulged her to the tune of one and a half million euros but now his entire estate had been trashed it really was too much minerva cherie he said smoothing back his silver hair i think we need to take a step back from this perhaps quit while were not too far behind quit papa quit while artemis fowl conducts a parallel project i think not gaspard spoke again this time with a little iron in his tone you think not minerva minerva blushed sorry papa i am infuriated thats all this irish boy swans in here with his troops and just like that ruins all our work it is unbearable no gaspard was seated as they all were at a wroughtiron table on the rear patio overlooking the pool he pushed back his chair and circled the table to his daughters seat from her vantage point there was a spectacular view over the wooded gorge and down into antibes nobody was very interested in the view on this evening i think minerva he said hunkering down beside her that we have gone too far in this matter there are otherworldly forces at work here danger follows these creatures and i can no longer allow you to place yourself or others in harms way we fought a noble fight and i am so proud of you that my heart may burst but now this must become a government matter it cant papa said minerva petulantly we have no records no sources nothing all our computer files and disks were destroyedthey even drilled the safe and burned everything in it i think artemis fowl crashed google and yahoo its hopeless how would it look a little girl turning up at the department of defence wittering on about monsters in the basement i need evidence gaspard stood his knees cracking evidence little one these are not criminals i watched you talk with our visitor he was alert intelligent he had done nothing wrong he was not an animal it is one thing to present the nobel committee with proof of an invasion through time but quite another to hound innocent sentient creatures but papa minerva pleaded one more try i need a month to rebuild my time tunnel model then i can make a materialization prediction gaspard kissed his daughter on the forehead look into your heart my little genius what does it tell you to do minerva scowled look into my heart honestly papa i am not a care bear please cherie said her father you know i love you and i respect your genius but just for once couldnt we go with the pony option couldnt i just get justin timberguy to play at your birthday party minerva fumed for several moments but she knew papa was right she had no business detaining intelligent creatures it was cruelty nothing less especially when they intended no harm but she could not just give up minerva silently resolved that artemis fowl would be her next project she would find out all about the irish boy and what he knew of demons very well papa she sighed for you i will forego my nobel prize this year at any rate next year will be different she thought when i know what artemis fowl knows there are whole worlds just beyond my grasp gaspard embraced his daughter warmly good it is for the best the surgeon returned to his seat now mister soto damage report the spanish security chief consulted his clipboard i have only a preliminary report monsieur paradizo i suspect we will be finding damage for many weeks the vehicles are completely destroyed thankfully we do have warzone insurance so we should have new cars within five working days there is shrapnel in the pool one piece pierced the skimmer and the wall so we have a leak and no filtration i know a man in tourrettes sur loup very reasonable and he can keep his mouth shut how about the men soto shook his head i dont know what they hit us with some kind of ray gun like martians anyway most of the men are up and about a few have headaches no other side effects except for thierry who has spent the past half an hour in the toilet we hear the odd scream suddenly billy kong emerged from his mumbling daydream slamming his palm on to the glasstopped iron table no this will not do absolutely not i need another demon gaspard frowned that unhappy experiment is over i should never have allowed it i was blinded by pride and ambition there will be no more demons in this house unacceptable said kong as though he were the employer and not the employee erics work must be completed i owe him that much now listen here mister said soto sternly what you find unacceptable is hardly an issue you and your men were subcontracted to do a job and that job does not include pronouncements on what is acceptable and what is not as he spoke kong checked his hair in the small mirror he carried everywhere you need to understand a few things paradizo first you are not in charge here not really not since my men and i joined your little group second i dont generally work on this side of the law my speciality is taking whatever i want by any means necessary i only signed on for babysitting duty because i owe these demons a little payback a lot of payback actually i know little minerva just wanted to take photos of her guests and ask them a lot of psych questions but i have my own plan for them something a little more painful gaspard turned his head towards soto mister soto do you have a response to this outrageous statement i do indeed blustered juan soto how dare you speak to monsieur paradizo in this fashion you are an employee here that is all as a matter of fact you are no longer an employee your contract is terminated you have one hour to vacate your room and be off the premises billy kongs grin was as dangerous as a sharks or else what or else my guards will remove you i would remind you that there are only four men in your group and five times that number in mine kong winked at him perhaps but my four are the best he flipped his jacket lapel to reveal a small clipon microphone i am moving up the schedule he said into the mike open the horse soto was puzzled what was this idiot talking about horses where did you get that microphone is that from the strongbox channels are to be kept clear for official transmissions but minerva caught the iliad reference opening the horse could only refer to the wooden horse of troy kong had planted traitors in the camp papa she said urgently we must leave leave this is my house i have agreed to almost everything you have asked of me cherie but this is ridiculous minerva pushed back her chair racing round the table please papa we are in danger here soto tutted mademoiselle is in no danger my men will protect you perhaps the strain of the day has made you irritable maybe you should take a nap minerva scowled in frustration cant you see what is happening here mister kong has given a signal to his men possibly they are already in charge he has come among us as a wolf in sheeps clothing gaspard paradizo was well aware of his daughters intelligence soto is this possible impossible declared juan soto but behind his enraged blushes was a tinge of pallor something about kongs grinning calmness unnerved him and truth be told he was not quite the soldier that his resume declared him to be true he had spent a year with the spanish peacekeeping force in namibia but hed been attached to a journalist for the entire tour and had never participated in any action he had got by in this job with mere bluster and a rudimentary knowledge of weaponry and tactics but if someone were to come along who actually knew what he was talking about soto reached to his belt snicking off a walkietalkie impossible he repeated but to reassure you i will double the guard and instruct my team to be on alert he clicked the talk button report in pairs from the top soto released the button filling the air with static the empty hiss seemed more ominous than a ghosts howl this went on for several seconds soto tried valiantly to maintain a jaunty confidence but was betrayed by a bead of sweat rolling down his forehead equipment malfunction he said weakly billy kong shook his head two shots he said into his lapel mike barely a second later two sharp cracks echoed across the estate kong grinned confirmation he said im in control here soto had often wondered how he would react if faced with actual danger earlier when he had believed that they were under siege he had panicked slightly but followed procedure this was different soto went for his gun a practised pistol man could do this without looking down soto was not practised enough by the time he glanced towards his holster kong had already leaped on to the table and knocked soto unconscious the security chief keeled over backwards with a dainty sigh kong sat atop the table elbows resting on knees i need that demon back he said casually drawing a stiletto blade from a secret pocket in the sleeve of his jacket how do we find him gaspard paradizo smothered minerva in his arms protecting every inch of his daughter if you hurt her kong billy kong rolled his eyes no time for negotiations doctor he twirled the blade between his fingertips then snapped his wrist flicking the stiletto at gaspard the weapons handle thunked against the doctors forehead and he fell away from minerva like a discarded coat minerva knelt cradling her fathers head papa wake up papa for a moment she was a little girl then her intellect kicked in she checked her fathers pulse and tapped the point of impact with her index and middle fingers you are lucky mister kong not to be facing a murder charge kong shrugged ive faced them before its amazing how easy it is to elude the authorities it costs exactly ten thousand dollars three for the face job two for new papers and five for a really good hacker to create a computer past for you nevertheless one more halfrevolution of your blade and my father would be dead and not merely unconscious kong pulled a second blade from his sleeve pocket theres still time now tell me how we go about finding our little friend minerva stood facing kong her fists clenched defiantly listen to me idiot that demon is gone i have no doubt that his benefactors plucked the silver bullet from his leg as soon as they had him in the car he is back on his island forget about him kong frowned it makes sense thats what i would do well ok then when is the next materialization minerva should have been terrified her ability to do anything besides witter and sob should have deserted her after all her father was lying unconscious and the man who had put him in that state was sitting on her patio table brandishing a knife but minerva paradizo was no ordinary twelveyearold she had always displayed remarkable composure in times of stress so even though she was scared minerva was more than capable of communicating her scorn to billy kong where have you been for the past thirty minutes she asked then clicked her fingers of course asleep i believe you people call it neutralized and by a tiny demoness too well let me fill you in on whats happened our entire operation has been neutralized i have no research no calculations and no subject i am starting from scratch in fact i wish i was starting from scratch starting from scratch would be a dream come true last time i was handed the timetunnel calculations this time i have to work them out by myself now dont get me wrong i could do it i am a genius after all but it will take at least seventeen months at the very least comprenezvous monsieur kong billy kong understood all right he understood that this little pain in the rear was trying to blind him with science seventeen months eh how long if you had some incentive incentive wont change the laws of science kong leaped down from the table landing soundlessly on the balls of his feet i thought that was your speciality changing the laws of science wasnt this project all about proving how every other scientist in the world is a dummy except you its not that simple kong began flipping his knife catching it without so much as a glance at the blade end over end it twirled a silver fan in the air hypnotic im making it simple i think you can get me a demon and i think you can do it in less than seventeen months so heres what i am going to do he leaned down and heaved juan sotos chair upright the security chief slumped forward on to the table i am going to hurt mister soto simple as that there is nothing you can do to stop that happening this is a demonstration of my earnestness it connects you with the reality of your situation and then you know i mean business so after that you start talking and if you dont start talking then we move on to lucky contestant number two minerva had no doubt that contestant number two was her father please mister kong there is no need for any of this i am telling you the truth oh its please now is it said kong in mock surprise and mister kong too what happened to idiot and moron dont kill him hes a nice man he has a family kong grabbed a bunch of sotos hair yanking his head back the chiefs adams apple stuck out like a plum hes an incompetent snarled kong look how easily your demon escaped see how simple it was for me to take over let him live pleaded minerva my father has money kong sighed youre just not getting it are you for a smart girl you can be pretty stupid a lot of the time i dont want money i want a demon now stop talking and pay attention there is no point in trying to negotiate minervas heart sank as she realized just how far out of her depth she actually was in less than an hour she had crossed over to a world of darkness and cruelty and her own arrogance had led her to it please she said she struggled to maintain her composure please kong adjusted his grip on the knife dont look away now little girl watch and remember whos boss minerva could not avert her eyes her gaze was trapped by this terrible tableau it was like a scene from a scary movie complete with its own soundtrack minerva frowned real life did not have a soundtrack there was music coming from somewhere the somewhere proved to be kongs trouser pocket his polyphonic phone was playing thetoreador song from carmen kong pulled the phone from his pocket who is this he snapped my name is not important said a youthful voice the important thing is that i have something you want how did you get this number i have a friend replied the mystery caller he knows all the numbers now to business i believe youre in the market for a demon minutes earlier butler had pulled off the motorway at the airport exit and crammed himself into the back seat beside artemis and holly they had watched the drama unfold in the chateau paradizo on their tiny laptop artemis gripped his knees tight i cant allow this i wont allow it holly placed a hand over his we have no choice artemis were clear now this is not our fight i cant risk exposing number one artemiss frown cut a furrow from his hairline to the bridge of his nose i know of course but still how can this not be my fight he glanced sharply at butler will kong kill that man without a doubt replied the bodyguard in his mind its already done artemis rubbed his eyes suddenly fatigued i am responsible indirectly i cant have a mans death on my conscience holly you do what you have to do but i need to save those people conscience said no what a lovely word the sh in the middle it was plain that the imp was not actually listening to the conversation just picking up on certain words the incongruity of this simple statement made artemis look across his eyes rested for a moment on no s chest markings and suddenly he knew where he had seen them before a plan hit him like a bolt of lightning holly do you trust me holly groaned artemis dont ask me that i just know one of your outrageous plans is coming do you trust me yes holly sighed i do more than anyone well then trust me to get us all out of this i will explain later holly was torn this decision could affect the rest of her life and the imps too and the effect could be to shorten them dramatically ok artemis but ill be watching artemis spoke into his ringphone foaly can you put me through to mister kongs mobile phone not a problem replied the centaur from section hq but its going to be the last thing i do for you sool has tracked my line out in thirty seconds im going to be shut down and youll be on your own i understand put me through butler gripped artemiss shoulder if you call him then he has the upper hand kong will want to choose where to meet i know where we should meet i just have to convince mister kong that the rendezvous point is his idea artemis closed his fist covering the phone quiet its ringing who is this snapped kong my name is not important said artemis the important thing is that i have something you want how did you get this number i have a friend replied the mystery caller he knows all the numbers now to business i believe youre in the market for a demon so you must be the great artemis fowl minervas idol i am so sick of you smart kids why cant you just boost cars or steal stuff like normal kids we do steal stuff just bigger stuff now are you interested in my demon or not i could be said kong what do you have in mind a straight trade i pick a public place and we swap my demon for your girl youre not picking anything kid i pick the rendezvous point you called me remember what do you want with this girl anyway her life said artemis simply i do not like murder or murderers you and your crew walk out of there with one hostage and we do a swap its a simple transaction dont tell me youve never released a hostage before im an old hand kid ive been picking up ransoms for years good im glad we can do business now why dont you name your preferred location ill be wearing a burgundy tie pay attention to that there are a hundred and one ways this could go wrong if it does the police could tie one of us up for a long time in the getaway car holly frowned quizzically at artemis it wasnt like him to chatter he calmed her with a look and a wave of his hand ok said kong i just thought of somewhere you know taipei in taiwan said artemis one of the worlds tallest buildings you are not serious thats on the far side of the world i am deadly serious taipei is my second home i know it well you will have a tough enough time getting there by the deadline so there will be no tricks we will exchange on the observation deck at twelve noon two days from now if you dont show then the girl takes the express elevator down if you see what i mean i see ill be there good dont come alone bring the ugly guy with you or the female i dont care i only need one we have already released the female ok the guy then you see how easy it is to deal with me im a reasonable man unless im crossed so dont cross me dont worry said artemis i wont and he said it with such conviction that if you didnt know him you would absolutely believe it chapter a long way down taipei taiwan taipei is among the tallest buildings in the world some say it is the tallest if the sixtymetre spire can be counted but others argue that a spire is not a building and so taipei can technically only be called the tallest structure in the world in any event there were four buildings in construction two in asia one in africa and the fourth in saudi arabia with their sights set on the worlds tallest building crown so taipeis claim to fame could be a fleeting one artemis and company landed in chiang kaishek international airport barely three hours before the deadline in a rented lear jet and though butler was a registered pilot qualified for day and night flying in various aircraft it was artemis who flew most of the way flying helped him think he claimed also no one would interrupt while he put the finishing touches to his audacious plan artemis was fully aware of the risks involved with this particular scheme the pivotal element was purely theoretical and the rest was highly unlikely he briefed the others on the details in the back of a rented lexus on the fortyminute drive from the airport to downtown taipei the entire group looked drained even though they had eaten and rested on the plane only no was in high spirits everywhere he looked there were new wonders to be gaped at and he could not imagine that anyone would be able to injure him while he was under butlers protection the bad news is that we are running close to the deadline said artemis so there will be no time to set a trap and the good news artemis said holly grumpily she was grumpy for a few reasons she was dressed as a human girl because artemis had asked her to save her magic for when it would be needed she had managed to boost her magical energy by burying a sealed acorn she kept round her neck but there had been no full moon so her power reserves were limited also she was completely shut off from the people and to top it all she had no doubt that ark sool would have her up on charges if any of them did manage to survive the tradeoff after all she had brought no halfway across the world instead of escorting him safely to haven city the good news is that kong cant be too far ahead of us so it is unlikely he had time to set up any traps either the lexus entered the xinyi district and taipei rose from the cityscape like a giant bamboo shoot the buildings around it seemed to shrink back in awe butler craned his head back to see the top of the fivehundredplusmetre building we never do anything small do we why cant we for once have a meeting in a starbucks i didnt pick this building said artemis it picked us fate has brought us here he tapped butler on the shoulder and the bodyguard pulled over into the first space he could find it took forever taipei morning traffic was thick and slowmoving and spewed smoke like an irritated dragon many of the thousands of pedestrians and cyclists had smog masks strapped across their faces when the vehicle had stopped artemis continued his briefing taipei is a miracle of modern engineering the architects took their inspiration from the humble bamboo but this shape alone would not keep the skyscraper steady in the event of an earthquake or high winds so the designers built it on a frame of concretefilled steelboxed super columns and installed a sevenhundred tonne steel ball as a mass damper pendulum to absorb the force of the wind ingenious the pendulum swings instead of the building its become quite the tourist attraction you can even watch it from the observation deck the owners have covered the damper with fifteen centimetres of solid silver which has been etched by the famous taiwanese artist alexander chou thanks for the fineart lesson interrupted holly now how about you let us in on your plan i want to get this over with and take off this ridiculous tracksuit its so shiny i feel sure i can be picked up on satellite i dont much like this outfit either complained no who was dressed in a bonnet and an orange floral muumuu orange he had decided was definitely not for him your outfit is the least of your worries noted holly im guessing that were about to hand you over to a bloodthirsty hit man eh artemis that we are confirmed artemis but only for a few seconds there will be little or no danger to you and if my suspicions are correct it is just possible that we may save hybras go back to me being in danger for a few seconds said no his thick brow folding in a frown in hybras a few seconds can last a very long time not here said artemis in what he hoped was a reassuring tone here a jew seconds is how long it will take you to open your hand no opened his fingers a couple of times experimentally thats still pretty long any way to cut it down not really if we do it means sacrificing minerva well she did tie me to a chair no glanced round at the shocked faces what im joking of course ill do it but no more orange please artemis smiled but it did not quite reach his eyes very well no more orange now the plan it is in two parts if the first part doesnt work then the second is redundant redundant said no almost unconsciously not needed superfluous exactly so ill explain that when necessary what about the first part asked holly in the first part we meet a vicious hit man and his band of thugs and he will expect us to hand over number one so what do we do we hand over number one said artemis he turned to the slightly nervous imp how do you like the plan so far well i dont like the first bit and i dont know the last bit so im really hoping the middle bit is exceptional dont worry said artemis it istaipei the group took a highspeed elevator from taipei s cavernous lobby to the observation floor holly and no had technically been given permission to enter the building by a small plaque over the main door which simply urged visitors to come and go as they pleased and seeing as she did not feel the urge to throw up in the elevator holly guessed that the plaque counted as an invitation toshiba elevators said artemis reading from a pamphlet he had picked up at information these are the fastest elevators in the world we are moving at eighteen metres per second so it shouldnt take much more than half a minute to reach the eightyninth floor artemis consulted his watch when the doors dinged open hmm right on time impressive engineering i may get one of these for the house they stepped out into the observation area which had a restaurant at the far end from this lofty vantage point visitors could walk all the way round the floor and shoot video of the panoramic view from this height it was even possible to see china across the taiwan strait for a moment the group forgot their worries and allowed themselves to be awestruck by the grace of this enormous structure the sky was outside the window and blended almost seamlessly with the sea on the horizon no was especially dumbfounded he turned in small circles the muumuu swishing round his legs less of the pirouetting little man advised butler the first to get his mind back on the job youre showing your legs and pull that bonnet down over your face no obliged though he was not happy with the bonnet it was shapeless and saggy and made his head look like a bag of washing good luck holly said artemis into thin air we will meet you on the twentythird floor get this done as quickly as you can holly whispered into his ear i dont have enough magic for a long shield im barely invisible as it is understood said artemis from the side of his mouth the small band walked slowly towards the bar area and took a table below the enormous mass damper suspended a metre above the eightyninth floor the sevenhundred tonne ball was a sight to behold like an indoor moon its surface etched with traditional yuanzhumin drawings this is the legend of nian explained artemis casually while butler scanned the room a ferocious beast that would feed on human flesh each new years eve to scare nian away torches were lit and firecrackers were set off because nian was known to fear the colour red thus the splashes of red paint it seems likely from the pictures that nian was actually a troll chou must have based his work on contemporary accounts a waitress came to their table li ho bo said artemis can we have a pot of oolong tea organic if you have it the waitress blinked at artemis then looked up at butler who was still standing you are mister fowl she asked in excellent english i am master fowl said artemis tapping the table for attention do you have something for me the waitress passed him a napkin from the gentleman along the bar she said artemis glanced down the arc of the metal railing and buffer system which kept patrons away from the mass damper and more importantly kept the mass damper away from them billy kong was seated a dozen tables down waggling his eyebrows in their direction he was not alone no one else was eyebrowwaggling but three men were at the table with him and several others were dotted around the bar area minerva was on kongs knee he held her fast by the forearm her shoulders were tense but there was defiance in the set of her mouth well artemis said to butler at least twelve replied the bodyguard billy must have friends in taiwan none of them invisible thank goodness said artemis opening the napkin send the creature to the reserved table read the message on the napkin i will send the girl no tricks or people will get hurt he passed the napkin to butler what do you think butler gave the message a summary glance i think he wont try anything here too many cameras if the security doesnt get him on film a tourist will if kong goes for a doublecross it will be outside and by then it should be too late so we hope the waitress returned with a bamboo tray bearing a clay pot of tea and three glasses artemis took his time pouring himself some of the steaming liquid how are you feeling number one my leg hurts a bit the painkiller is wearing off ill ask butler to give you another shot later are you ready to go everything will be fine i assure you all i have to do is open my hand as soon as were in the elevator thats it do you want me to distract the bad man with some witty banter like you do with holly no that wont be necessary just open your hand should i look scared that would be appropriate good shouldnt be a problem butler was functioning in full action mode generally he reined himself in walking with a slight stoop to avoid drawing attention but now he stood tall and tensed ready to spring into action his gaze was fierce and muscles bulged in his neck he caught billy kongs gaze and zeroed in on his eyeballs even across a crowded room the hostility was almost palpable a couple of more psychically sensitive bystanders suddenly felt anxious and cast their eyes about for the nearest restroom when he was finished staring down billy kong butler knelt to give final instructions to no all you have to do is walk down to that table with the reserved sign wait until minerva gets there then continue on to kong if they hustle you out straight away count to twenty then open your hand if they wait for us to leave open your hand when the elevator doors have closed understand i understand everything in any language you care to speak in are you set no took a deep breath he could feel his tail vibrating anxiously he had been in a bit of a daze since the time tunnel how could anyone take all of this in skyscrapers for heavens sake buildings that actually scraped the sky im set he said off you go then good luck no began his long lonely walk back into captivity scores of humans thronged around him excited sweating chewing things pointing machines at each other those would be cameras i suppose the noon sun flashed through the ceilingtofloor windows catching on the silver of the mass damper lighting it up like a disco ball the tabletops loomed just above head height waiters and waitresses bustled past with loaded trays glasses fell children screamed too many people thought no i miss demons even abbot well ok maybe not abbot no reached the reserved table he had to stand on tippytoes to see the folded piece of card with the word printed on it he lifted the flap on his bonnet to get a clear look he was beginning to realize that a muumuu and bonnet were not typical mud child garb as artemis had told him this is a terrible disguise i look like a freak surely someone will see that i am not human i wish i could shield like holly unfortunately even if no could control his burgeoning magical powers shielding had never been a weapon in the demon warlock arsenal no took a step to the right squinting past the glare of the giant mass damper minerva was on her way down taking small careful steps towards the reserved table behind her kong leaned forward in his seat toes tapping with excitement and anticipation he was like a dog on a leash with the scent of a fox in his nose minerva arrived she lifted the brim of nos bonnet to check it was him its not my bonnet said no and this is certainly not my muumuu minerva took his hand before the abduction she had been eighty per cent genius and twenty per cent twelveyearold girl now it was about fiftyfifty im sorry for everything for tying you up and the rest i thought you would try to eat me were not all savages said no and my wrists did hurt for ages but i forgive you i suppose as long as your tyingup days are over yes i promise minerva looked over nos head towards artemiss table why is he helping me do you know no shrugged im not sure holly our friend said it was something about puberty apparently youre pretty though to be honest i cant see it myself their conversation was interrupted by a whistle from further down the bar billy kong was growing impatient the exparadizo employee beckoned no on with his index finger i should go leave depart minerva nodded ok be careful i will see you soon where is it in your hand yes said no automatically then how did you know minerva walked on slowly genius cant help it this place is littered with genii thought no i just hope mister kong isnt another one he continued on his way being careful to keep his feet and hands inside the muumuu the last thing he wanted to do was cause a panic by exposing his grey stumpy digits although perhaps the humans would bow down and adore him after all he was incredibly handsome compared to their own gangly males billy kong was all smiles when no reached the table on his face a smile looked like the first symptom of a disease his hair was spiked in perfect points even in the middle of a kidnapping kong still made time for hair good grooming says a lot about a person welcome back demon he said grabbing a hank of the muumuu so nice to see you if it is you if it is me said no confused me is all i can be excuse me if i dont take your word for it snorted kong tugging back the bonnets frill for a quick peek at no s face if that fowl kid is half as smart as ive heard then hes sure to be trying something kong examined the imps face poking the plate on his forehead pulling back the lips to check the pink gums and square white teeth finally he traced the rune on nos forehead with a finger to make sure it wasnt painted on satisfied pretty much i guess little artemis didnt have time to do a switch i ran him too hard you ran us all too hard complained no we had to fly here in a machine i saw the moon close up youre breaking my heart demon after what you did to my brother youre lucky to be alive something i hope to remedy in the next few minutes no twisted his head to catch a glimpse of the elevators artemis butler and minerva were two steps away from the doors dont look at them they cant help you nobody can help you kong clicked his fingers and a muscular man joined them at the table he was hefting a large metal suitcase in case youre wondering this is a bomb you know what a bomb is dont you bomb said no explosive incendiary device his eyes widened but that could hurt someone a lot of someones exactly not humans though demons i am going to strap this on to you set the timer then send you back to your island the blast should at the very least put a big dent in the demon population you wont be crossing over here for your little nighttime hunts for quite a while i wont do it said no actually stamping his foot kong laughed are you sure youre a demon from what i hear the last one was more demonic i am a demon a warlock demon kong leaned close enough for no to smell his citrus aftershave well little mister warlock maybe you can turn this bomb into a bunch of flowers but i doubt it i dont have to do anything because you cant make me go back to hybras kong took a set of handcuffs from his pocket on the contrary i know exactly what to do i picked up a thing or two in the chateau all we have to do is dig that silver slug out of your leg and hybras will suck you home no glanced again towards the elevator the doors were closing on his new friends you mean this silver slug he asked showing kong what had been concealed in his hand he took it out breathed billy kong fowl took out the slug took it out agreed no extracted removed then he dropped the silver nugget and disappeared holly had been crouched on the mass damper watching events unfold so far everything had gone according to plan minerva had reached artemis and butler had hustled them both to the elevator at the other end of the bar billy kong was doing his whole grinning psycho bit when this was all over that mud man would have to be mindwiped there would be quite a few loose ends to clear up actually not by her though she was not lep any more after this she would be lucky to be section holly tapped a button on her wrist computer zooming in on no the imp raised his left hand the signal this was it time to test theories it was either hello again or goodbye forever artemiss plan was a risky one because his calculations were theoretical but it was the only chance to save the demon island and artemis had been right so far if holly had to rely on someones theories she would prefer those theories to be artemis fowls as holly watched no drop the silver slug and disappear she could not resist snapping a photo of kongs face with her helmet camera his reaction was priceless they would have a good laugh over that later then she activated her wings rising above the giant silver ball watching for signs seconds later a faint blue electrical rectangle began spinning at the silver balls crown exactly where artemis had known it would no was coming back just as artemis had predicted such a large mass of silver within three metres should interrupt no s journey home it should cause a momentary materialization at the summit where the dampers energy field is most concentrated you holly have to be there to make sure this momentary materialization becomes more permanent on the mass damper no s shape was visible inside the glowing rectangle he seemed a little confused as though half asleep one arm snaked through into this world grasping at reality it was enough for holly she darted down and clamped a silver bracelet round no s grey wrist the ghostly fingers wiggled then solidified solidity sped along nos arm like grey paint rescuing him from limbo in seconds where there had only been space now crouched a shivering creature did i go asked the little imp am i back yes and yes said holly now stay quiet and still we have to get you out of here the mass damper swung slowly dissipating the wind power buffeting taipei holly leaned into the sway grabbed a hold of no and took off vertically careful to keep her cargo shielded by the sevenhundredtonne silver ball the next floor up was another observation floor but it was closed for decoration a single workman was slicing carpet for a corner section and he did not seem surprised to see a muumuuclad imp come sailing over the railing hey he said its an imp in a muumuu you know something imp no landed on the floor with a thump no he said cautiously tell me something i am not a bit surprised to see you said the man in fact you are so unremarkable that i am going to forget all about you as soon as youve gone no picked himself up straightening his bonnet youve had a talk with him i see holly switched off her shield speckling into view i gave him a blast of the mesmer she peered over the railing down into the restaurant come here number one youll enjoy this no placed his fingers against the glass kong and his cronies were creating chaos below blundering towards the elevators kong was particularly perturbed barging tourists from his path and overturning tables we probably dont have time for this said no probably not agreed holly neither fairy moved hey look said the workman another fairy how utterly unremarkable only when the toshiba elevator doors had closed behind billy kong and his crew did holly turn to leave where to now asked no wiping a happytear from his eye now we go to stage two replied holly calling the elevator time to save hybras never a dull moment said no scurrying into the metal box hey my first cliche artemis and butler had watched minerva cross the restaurant towards them she bore herself with considerable courage under the circumstances her chin was up and she had a determined look in her eye butler can i ask you something said artemis butler was trying to keep an eye on every single person in the restaurant im a little busy at the moment artemis nothing taxing just a yes or no answer is it normal during puberty to feel these blasted feelings of attraction at stressful times during a ransom drop for instance shes pretty isnt she extremely and funny too remember that quark joke i do we must have a talk about jokes someday perhaps minerva could sit in and in response to your question it is normal the more stressful the situation the more your body pumps out the hormones good normal then back to business minerva didnt rush she picked her way around tourists and tables as she walked steadily towards them when she drew level butler placed a guiding and protective hand on her back get kidnapped every day do you he growled steering her to the elevator artemis followed glancing back over his shoulder to make sure they were not being pursued kong was not even looking at them so happy was he with his prize the elevator opened and the trio stepped inside on the elevator wall the floor light was rapidly winking downwards artemis held out his hand to minerva artemis fowl the second pleased to meet you finally minerva shook the hand warmly minerva paradizo likewise you gave up your demon for me i do appreciate it she blushed slightly the elevator slowed to a smooth stop and the steel doors slid open with barely a hiss minerva peeked out this is not the lobby why arent we leaving artemis stepped out on to the fortieth floor our work here is not finished i need to get our demon back and its about time you knew what you almost went up against chapter heart of stone taipei fortieth floor kimsichiog gallery artemis strode through the kimsichiog gallery lobby flanked by butler and minerva were in an art gallery said minerva do we really have time for art artemis halted surprised theres always time for art he said but were here for a very special piece of art which is artemis pointed at painted silk banners hanging at regular intervals from the ceiling each banner was emblazoned with a single dramatic spiralling rune i follow what is happening in the art world this exhibition is of particular interest to me the centrepiece is the remains of a fantastic sculpture a semicircle of strange dancing creatures maybe ten thousand years old believed to have been found off the shore of ireland and yet here it is in taiwan being exhibited by an american oil company artemis why are we here i need to get home to my father dont you recognize the rune havent you seen it somewhere minerva remembered immediately mais ouil certainement it is the rune from the demons forehead the very same artemis snapped his fingers and continued walking exactly when i met number one i knew his markings were familiar it took me a while to remember where i had seen them before but once i knew then it occurred to me that maybe this sculpture was not a sculpture at all minervas brain raced ahead it was the ring of warlocks from the original time spell precisely what if they were not blasted into space what if one of them had the quick thinking to use the gargoyles touch to turn them all to stone and if number one is a warlock then he is the only one who can reanimate them very good minerva you catch on quickly young quick and arrogant you remind me of someone who could that be beats me said butler rolling his eyes but how did you set this up the french girl wondered the meeting site was kongs idea i heard him on the phone artemis smiled at his own cleverness while he was thinking about it i said ill be wearing a burgundy tie pay attention to that there are a hundred and one ways this could go wrong if it does the police could tie one of us up for a long time do you see minerva plucked at a curl thoughtfully mon dieu you used the power of suggestion tie pay a hundred and one tie one or what kongs subconscious heard taipei taiwan brilliant artemis extraordinary and coming from me that means something it was brilliant said artemis with characteristic lack of modesty allied to the fact that kongs second home is taiwan i was reasonably confident that it would work there was a harriedlooking man at the gallerys reception desk he was dressed in a neon blue suit and his head was completely shaven except for a spiral of stubble in the shape of nos rune he spoke in rapid taiwanese into a bluetooth headset clipped to his ear no no salmon is not good enough squid and lobster are what we ordered you have them here by eight oclock or i will come down there slice you up and serve you as sushi instead trouble with the caterers said artemis pleasantly in taiwanese when the man had disconnected yes replied the man the exhibition is opening tonight and the man stopped because he had looked up to see who he was talking to and spotted butler well wow big i mean hello i am mister lin the curator here can i help you we were hoping for a private preview of the exhibition said artemis specifically the dancing figures mister lin was so surprised he could do little more than bluster what a what private no no no impossible out of the question this is important art look at my head look i dont just do this for any old exhibition i realize that but my friend here the large one would be extremely happy if you could let us in for a minute mister lin opened his mouth to answer but something down the hall caught his attention what is that is that a muumuu artemis didnt bother to look oh yes we have disguised our fairy friend as a child in a muumuu mister lin frowned and the spiral on his head moved fairy friend oh really who are you people are you from pop art today is this one of dougie hemlers postmodernist stunts no hes a real fairy a demon warlock to be precise the one behind him flying is an elf flying you tell dougie hemler from me that there isnt a chance in then he spotted holly hovering over nos headoh oh agreed artemis thats a fair reaction now can we go in its extremely important are you going to ruin the exhibition probably artemis admitted mister lins lip quivered as he spoke then i cant let you in holly darted forward collapsing her helmet visor i think you can let us in she said her voice layered with magic because these three humans are your oldest friends you invited them for a sneak preview and what about you two dont worry about us were not even here were just inspiration for your next exhibition so why dont you buzz us all in mister lin flapped a hand at holly why would i worry about you youre not even here just some silly idea flying round my head as for you three guys i am so glad you could make it you dont need to video us prompted holly why dont you shut down the gallery cameras ill just switch off the gallery cameras give you guys a little privacy good idea the curator had turned his attention to the pile of posters on his desk before the security door closed behind artemis and his group the exhibition hall was ultramodern with dark wooden floors and slatted blinds the walls were hung with photographs giant blowups of the dancing figures in the centre of the room the figures themselves were raised on a dais to make their detail easier to view there were so many spotlights on them that there was barely a shadow on the stone no absently pulled off his bonnet approaching the exhibit in a daze as though he had been mesmerized and not the curator he climbed on to the dais stroking the stone skin of the first figure warlocks he whispered brothers the sculpture was beautiful in its detail and yet horrific in its subject matter it consisted of four creatures ranged in a broken semicircle in the act of dancing or recoiling from something they were small squat fairies like no with thrusting jaws barrel chests and stumpy tails their bodies limbs and foreheads were covered with swirling runes the demons were all holding hands and the fourth held on to the severed hand of the next in line the circle was broken said no something went wrong artemis climbed on to the dais beside him can you bring them back bring them back said no startled from what i know of the gargoyles touch it can transform living things to stone and back again you have the touch can you use it no rubbed his palms nervously i may have the touch you know maybe and thats a big maybe i turned a wooden skewer to stone at least i think it was stone maybe it was just coated with ash i was under a lot of pressure everybody was watching you know how it is maybe you dont how many of you have even been in imp school none right artemis gripped his shoulder youre babbling number one you need to concentrate yes of course concentrate focus think good now see if you can bring them back its the only way to save hybras holly shook her head way to keep the pressure off genius minerva was circling the exhibit in a daze not unlike her former captives these statues are actual demons they have been among us all this time i should have seen it but abbot looked nothing like this holly landed beside the girl up close there are entire species that you know nothing about you almost helped to wipe out one of them you were lucky if that had happened a dozen artemis fowls would not have been enough to rescue you from the fairy police i see i said sorry already can we move on holly frowned at her glad to see youve forgiven yourself so quickly harbouring feelings of guilt can have a negative effect on mental health child geniuses growled holly genii said minerva on the dais no was laying hands on one of the petrified demons so back in hybras i just kind of held the skewer and got excited then it started i wasnt trying to turn it into stone could you get excited now asked artemis what just like that i dont know i feel a bit sick to be honest i think the muumuu is giving me a headache it really is bright maybe if butler gave you a fright its not the same thing i need some real pressure i know mister butler wouldnt actually kill me i wouldnt be too sure oh ha ha youre a rum one artemis fowl i can see im going to have to stay on my toes around you butler was checking his pistol when he heard noises in the corridor he ran to the security door and peered out through the small rectangle of toughened glass weve got company he declared cocking his pistol kong found us the bodyguard put a single round into the electronic lock frying the chip and sealing the door its not going to take them long to open that door we need to wake up those demons and get out of here now artemis squeezed no s shoulder nodding at the security door that enough pressure for you on the other side of the security door kong and his men were halted by the sight of a smoking keypad dammit swore kong he busted the lock were going to have to shoot our way in theres no time for planning don you have the case don held up the suitcase right here good if by some miracle there is a demon in there clip the case on to its little wrist good and tight i dont want to miss another chance will do we have grenades boss we could blow the door no snapped kong i need minerva and i dont want her injured anyone hurts her i hurt them understood everybody understood nothing complicated about it inside the gallery artemis was getting a little anxious he had hoped that kong would leave the building immediately but the hit man must have spotted one of the exhibition posters in the elevator and come to the same conclusion that artemis himself had anything he asked no who was vaguely rubbing a statues arm not yet im trying artemis patted his shoulder try a little harder i have no desire to get involved in a firefight in a highrise building at the very least we would all end up in a taiwanese prison ok thought no concentrate reach into the stone he held the stone warlocks finger tightly and tried to feel something from the little he knew about warlocks he guessed that this was probably qwan the elder magician the stone figures head was circled by a simple band with a spiral motif at the front the sign of leadership how terrible it must have been no reflected to see your home dematerialize and be left behind to know it was all your ownfault it was not my fault snapped a voice in no s head it was that stupid demon nzall now are you going to get me out of here or not no almost fainted his breath came in short explosive gasps and his heart seemed to hike upwards in his chest come on young warlock release me i have been waiting for a long long time the voice the presence was inside the sculpture it was qwan of course its qwan youre holding my hand who did you think it was youre not a simpleton are you just my luck wait ten thousand years and then a simpleton turns up i am not a simpleton blurted no of course not said artemis encouragingly just do your best i will instruct butler to hold kong back for as long as he can no bit his lip and nodded if he spoke aloud it could get confusing and this situation was confusing enough without him adding to it he would try thoughtpower qwan was speaking in his mind maybe it would work the other way of course it works qwan sent and what is all that nonsense about cooked food just release me from this prison no winced trying mentally to black out his dreams of a cooked banquet i dont know how to set you free he thought i dont know if i can of course you can responded qwan you have enough magic in you to teach a troll to ploy an instrument just let it out how i have no idea how qwan was silent for a moment while he took a quick peek into nos memories oh i see you are a complete novice no training of any kind just as well really without expert tuition you could have blown up half of hybras very well i will give you a little nudge in the right direction i cant do much from here but maybe can get your power flowing it will get easier after this once you have been in contact with a warlock some of his knowledge is passed on to you no could have sworn that the stone fingers round his own tightened a fraction but that could just have been his imagination what was definitely not in his imagination was the sudden feeling of cold loss that sped along his arm as though life itself were being sucked from him dont worry young warlock im simply siphoning off a little magic to get the sparks running it feels terrible but that will not last it did feel terrible no imagined that dying piece by piece would feel something like this which in a way was what was happening and in such a situation the body will try to defend itself by seeing off the intruder the magic that had lain dormant inside no until recently suddenly exploded in his brain and gave chase to the invader to no it felt as though he suddenly had an entire new spectrum of vision he had been blind before but now he could see through walls of course it was not really some kind of supervision it was an understanding of his own abilities the magic flowed through him like liquid fire chasing impurities out through his pores venting steam through his orifices and setting the runes on his body aglow good lad sent qwan now let it go chase me out no found that he was able to do exactly that to control the magical flow he sent it after qwans tendril through his own fingers and into qwans the dead feeling was replaced by a buzzing of power he began to vibrate and so did the statue shedding wafers of stone like a dead snakeskin the old warlocks fingers were solid no more but living breathing skin they held on to no tightly keeping the connection solid thats it lad youre doing it i am doing it thought no incredulously this is really happening artemis and holly looked on in amazement as the magic spread through qwans body sloughing the stone from his limbs with pistolshot cracks and orange flame life claimed qwans hand then his arm then his torso stone fell from his chin and mouth allowing the warlock to heave his first breath in ten millennia bright blue eyes squinted against the light and shut tightly and still the magic ran on blasting every last shard of stone from qwans body but there it stopped when the sparks of nos power reached the next warlock in line they simply fizzled and died what about the others asked no surely he could free them too qwan hacked and coughed for several moments before he answered dead he said then collapsed in the rubble on the other side of the gallery security door kong was emptying a third clip from his machine pistol into the keypad the door wont hold much longer said butler any second now can you slow them down asked artemis shouldnt be a problem i dont want to leave any bodies here artemis i imagine the police are already on their way maybe you could just scare them a bit butler grinned my pleasure the shooting stopped and the security door drooped slightly on its hinges butler ripped the door open smartly yanking billy kong inside then jammed the door closed again hello billy he said pinning the smaller man to the wall kong was too demented to be scared he lashed out with a series of blows any one of which would have been fatal to a normal per son they bounced off butler like a fly bouncing off atigertank thats not to say they didnt hurt kongs trained hands felt like heated brands where they impacted butlers only reaction to the pain was a slight tightening round the corners of his mouth holly he said pull said holly aiming her neutrino at a point in space butler catapulted billy kong straight up and holly plucked him out of the air with a blast from her weapon kong spun across the floor still throwing spasmodic punches the snakes head is out of action said artemis lets hope the rest will follow suit minerva decided to take advantage of billy kongs unconsciousness to indulge in some payback she stalked over to her prone kidnapper you mister kong are nothing but a thug she said kicking him in the leg young lady said butler sharply move away he may not be completely out if my father has as much as a hair out of place continued minerva oblivious to butlers warnings i will personally ensure that you spend the maximum time in prison kong cracked open a weeping eye thats no way to talk to your staff he croaked and wrapped steely fingers round her ankle minerva realized that she had made a drastic mistake and decided that the best course of action was to scream as shrilly as possible which she did butler was torn his duty was to protect artemis not minerva but through years of working with artemis and indeed holly he had unconsciously adopted the role of general protector whenever somebody was in danger he helped them to get out of it and this foolish girl was certainly in danger mortal danger why is it he wondered that the smart ones always think that theyre invincible and so butler made a decision the consequences of which would haunt his dreams and waking hours for years to come as a professional bodyguard he knew the futility of secondguessing his own actions but in the nights ahead he would often sit by the fire with his head in his hands and replay the moment in his mind wishing that he had acted differently whatever way he played it out the results were tragic but at least they would not have been tragic for artemis so butler acted he took four smart steps away from the door to disentangle minerva from kongs grasp it was a simple thing the man was barely semiconscious he seemed to be operating on some kind of psychotic energy butler simply stepped down hard on his wrist then rapped him sharply between the eyes with the knuckle of his index finger kongs eyes rolled back in his head and his fingers relaxed like the legs of a dying spider minerva stepped smartly out of kongs range that was very foolish i apologize she mumbled its a little late for that reprimanded butler now will you please take cover the entire miniepisode took about four seconds but in that four seconds a lot happened on the other side of the security door don who was holding the bomb and who had recently been punched for no good reason by his boss decided to win kongs favour by bursting into the gallery and taking on the giant in there he put his shoulder to the door at the exact moment that butler stepped away at the other side and to his own surprise went tumbling head first into the room followed quickly by four more of kongs henchmen brandishing an assortment of weapons holly who was covering the door with her neutrino was not unduly worried she began to worry when a grenade rolled out of the tangle of men and tapped against her foot it would be easy enough for her to escape the explosion but artemis and nl would be well within the blast radius thinkfast there was a solution but it was costly in terms of equipment she bolstered her weapon whipped off her helmet and jammed it down over the grenade holding it there with her own weight this was a trick she had employed before with mixed results she had hoped it wouldnt become a habit she squatted there like a frog on a toadstool for what seemed like a long time but couldnt have been more than a few seconds she noticed from the corner of her eye that a thug with a silver case was slapping the man who had rolled the grenade perhaps using lethal force had been against orders the grenade exploded blasting holly into a sharp arc the helmet absorbed most of the shock and all of the shrapnel but there was still enough force to shatter both of hollys shinbones and fracture one femur she landed on artemiss back like a sack of rocks ow she said and passed out artemis and no were attempting to revive qwan hes alive said artemis checking the warlocks pulse steady heartbeat he should come out of it soon you keep a strong contact with him or he could disappear no cradled the old demons head he called me a warlock he said tearfully i am not alone time enough for a talkshow moment later said artemis brusquely we need to get you out of here kongs men were in the gallery now and shots were being fired artemis was confident that butler and holly could take care of a few thugs but this confidence took a blow when there was a sudden explosion and a battered holly landed on his back her body was instantly enveloped in a cocoon of blue light sparks dropped from the cocoon like falling stars pinpointing the most severe injuries artemis crawled out from beneath her laying his recuperating friend gently on the floor beside qwan kongs men were now embroiled with butler and probably regretting choosing this line of work he tore into them like a bowling ball into a pack of quivering pins one made it past butler a tall man with a tattooed neck and an aluminium case artemis guessed that this case probably did not contain a selection of asian spices and realized that he would have to take action himself while he was wondering exactly what it was he could do the man sent him sprawling by the time he made it back to hollys side his friend was sitting up groggily and there was a suitcase handcuffed to her wrist the man who had delivered the case had returned to the fray where he had lasted less than a second before butler took him out of it again artemis knelt by hollys side are you all right holly smiled but it was an effort just about thanks to the magic im out though not a drop left so i would advise everyone to stay healthy until i can complete my ritual she shook her wrist jangling the chain whats in the case artemis seemed paler than usual i would guess nothing pleasant he flicked the clips and lifted the lid and i would be right its a bomb big and complicated they sneaked it past security somehow through an area still under construction i would guess holly blinked herself alert shaking her head until the pain woke her up ok bomb can you see a timer eight minutes and counting can you disarm it artemis pursed his lips perhaps i need to open the casing and get into the works before i know for sure it could be a straight detonator or we could have all kinds of decoys qwan struggled to his elbows coughing up large globs of dust and spit what im flesh and bone after ten thousand years and now youre telling me a bomb is going to blow me to a million pieces this is qwan explained no hes the most powerful warlock in the magic circle im the only one now said qwan i couldnt save the rest just us two left now lad can you petrify the bomb asked holly it will take several minutes before my magic is up and running anyway the gargoyles touch only works on organic matter plants and animals a bomb is full of manmade compounds artemis raised an eyebrow you know about bombs i was petrified not dead i could see what was happening around me the stories i could tell you you wouldnt believe where tourists stick gum butler was piling unconscious bodies against the security doors we have to get out of here he called the police are in the hallway artemis stood and took half a dozen steps away from the group closing his eyes artemis this is no time to fall apart chided minerva crawling from behind a display case we need a plan shh young lady said butler hes thinking artemis gave himself twenty seconds to rack his brains what he came up with was very far from perfect very well holly you must fly us out of here holly did a few sums in her head it will take two trips maybe three no time for that the bomb must go first there are a lot of people in this building i must go with the bomb as there is a chance i can defuse it and the fairies must come too it is imperative that they are not taken into custody hybras would be lost i cant allow this objected butler i have a duty to your parents artemis was stern with his protector i am giving you a new duty he said look after minerva keep her safe until we can rendezvous let holly fly out over the sea and drop the bomb argued butler we can mount a rescue organization later it will be too late if we dont get these fairies out of here the eyes of the world will be on taipei and anyway the local seas are thronged with fishing boats this is the only way i will not allow humans or fairies to die when i might have prevented it butler would not give up listen to yourself you sound like a like a good guy theres nothing in this for you artemis had no time for emotions in the words of h p woodman old friend time is ticking on and so we must be gone holly tie us to your belt all except butler and minerva holly nodded still slightly shellshocked she reeled out a number of pitons from her belt wishing she had been issued one of foalys moonbelts which generated a lograv field around everything attached to it under the arms she instructed no then clip it back on to the loop butler helped artemis with his strap this is it artemis ive had it i swear when we get home i am retiring im older than i look and i feel older than i am no more plotting promise me artemis forced a smile i am simply flying to the next building if i cannot defuse the bomb then holly can fly it out to sea and endeavour to find a safe spot they both knew that artemis was lying if he could not defuse the bomb there would be no time to find a safe drop point here said butler handing him a flat leather wallet my picks so you can at least get into the works thank you old friend holly was loaded to the chin no and qwan clung to her waist while artemis was cinched to the front ok everyone ready i wish my magic would come back grumbled qwan id turn myself into a statue again terrified said no freaking planking up the creek colloquialisms said artemis very good butler closed the case one building across thats as far as you need to go get that panel off and go straight for the explosive itself rip out the detonator if you have to understood ok i wont say goodbye just good luck i will see you as soon as i can talk us out of here thirty minutes if that up to that point minerva had hung back looking shamefaced now she came forward im sorry artemis i shouldnt have gone near mister kong butler lifted her bodily aside no you shouldnt but theres no time for apologies now just stand by the door and look innocent but i innocent now minerva obliged wisely realizing that this was not the time for arguing ok holly said artemis lift off check said holly activating her backpack the wings struggled with the extra weight for a moment and there was something about the engine vibration that holly didnt like but gradually her rig took the strain and lifted all four of them off the floor ok she said i think were good butler nudged the flying group towards a window this was all so risky he couldnt believe that he was letting it happen but there was no time to deliberate it was do or die he reached up yanking down on the windows security catch the entire twometre pane swung wide allowing the high altitude wind to scream into the building suddenly everyone was deafened and under attack from the elements it was hard to see anyone and even harder to hear them holly floated the group outside and they would have been whipped away had butler not held on for a second go with the wind he shouted to holly releasing his grip make your descent gradual holly nodded her wing motor skipped a beat and they dropped two metres artemiss stomach lurched butler he called his voice thin and childlike in the wind yes artemis what if something goes wrong wait for me no matter how it looks i will return i will bring them all back butler nearly jumped out after them what are you planning artemis what are you going to do artemis called back but the wind caught his words and his bodyguard could only stand framed by steel and glass shouting into the wind they dropped quickly a bit more quickly than holly would have liked the wings cant take it she realized not the weight and the wind were not going to make it she rapped a knuckle on artemiss head artemis she shouted i know shouted the irish boy too much weight if they fell now the bomb would detonate in the middle of taipei that was unacceptable there was only one thing to do artemis had not even mentioned this option to butler as he knew the bodyguard would reject it no matter how sound his own reasoning before artemis had time to act on his theory hollys wings spluttered jerked and died they fell in ragged free fall like a sack of anchors head over heels dangerously close to the skyscraper wall artemiss eyes were scalded by wind his limbs were folded back to breaking point by rushing air and his cheeks were ballooned to comical proportions though there was nothing funny about falling hundreds of metres to a certain death no said artemiss iron core i will not let this be the end with a grim and physical determination that he must have picked up from butler artemis raised his arms and grabbed no s arm the object he sought was right there almost in his face and yet it seemed impossible to reach impossible or not must reach it it was like trying to push against the skin of a giant balloon but push artemis did the ground rushed up from below smaller skyscrapers jutting up like spears and still artemis pushed finally his fingers closed round nos silver bracelet goodbye world he thought one way or another and he ripped the bracelet off flinging it into the air now the demonkind were no longer anchored to this dimension for a second there was no obvious reaction to this but then just as they were passing between the first of the lower skyscrapers a revolving purple trapezoid opened in the sky and swallowed them as neatly as a kid catching a cheerio in his mouth butler staggered back from the window trying to process what he had seen hollys wings had failed that much was clear but then what what it dawned on him suddenly artemis must have had a secondary plan that boy always did artemis wouldnt go to the bathroom without a backup so they werent dead there was a good chance of that they had just disappeared into the demon dimension he would have to keep telling himself that until he believed it butler noticed that minerva was crying theyre all dead arent they because of me butler placed a hand on her shoulder if they were all dead it would be because of you but theyre not artemis has everything under control now chin up we have to talk our way out of here daughter minerva frowned daughter butler winked though he felt anything but cheery yes daughter seconds later a squad of taiwanese regular police heaved open the door flooding the room with blue and grey uniforms butler found himself looking down the barrels of a dozen police special pistols most of these barrels were wobbling slightly no you dolts squealed mr lin threading his way through the policemen slapping at their gun arms not that one he is my good friend those other ones the unconscious ones they are the ones who broke in here they knocked me down it is a miracle my friend and his daughter prompted butler and his daughter were not harmed then the curator noticed his demolished exhibit and faked a faint when no one rushed to aid him he picked himself up went off into a corner and had a little cry an inspector who wore his gun cowboystyle ambled across to butler you did this no not me we were hiding behind a crate they blew up the sculpture then started fighting among themselves do you have any idea why these people would want to destroy a sculpture butler shrugged i think they think theyre anarchists who knows with these people they have no id said the inspector not one of them i find that a bit strange butler smiled bitterly after all billy kong had done he would only be prosecuted for property damage of course they could mention the kidnapping but that would lead to weeks possibly months of red tape in taiwan and butler did not particularly want anyone looking too deeply into his past or indeed the selection of false passports in his jacket pocket then something struck him something about kong from a conversation back in nice kong used a kitchen knife on his friend foaly had said theres still a warrant out for him there under the name jonah lee kong was wanted for murder in taiwan butler realized and there was no statute of limitations on murder i heard them talking to that one said butler pointing to the supine billy kong they called him mister lee or jonah he was the boss the inspector was interested oh really did you hear anything else sometimes the smallest detail can be important butler frowned thinking about it one of them said something i dont even know what it means go on urged the inspector he said let me think he said youre not such a tough guy jonah you havent notched four barrel in years what does that mean notching your barrel the inspector pulled a mobile phone from his pocket it means that man is a murder suspect he hit one then speed dial base chan here i need you to run the name jonah lee through records go back a few years he closed the phone thanks mister arnott said butler franklin arnott new york city he had been using the arnott passport for several years it was genuinely rumpled thanks mister arnott you may just have caught a murderer butler blinked a murderer wow do you hear that eloise daddy caught a murderer well done daddy said eloise looking unhappy with daddy for some reason the inspector turned to pursue his inquiries then stopped the curator said there was another person a boy a friend of yours yes and no hes my son arty i dont see him around he just stepped out but hell be back are you sure butlers eyes lost their focus yes im sure he told me chapter out of time the journey between dimensions was more violent than artemis remembered there was no time to reflect on various scenery changes and barely time for his senses to register sights sounds or temperature changes they were ripped from their own dimension and dragged through wormholes of space and time with only their consciousnesses intact only once did they materialize for the briefest second the landscape was grey bleak and pockmarked and in the distance artemis could see a blue planet camouflaged by cloud cover im on the moon thought artemis then they were gone again drawn by the lure of hybras it was an unnatural feeling this outofbody outofmind travel how am i still aware thought artemis how is any of this possible and stranger still when he concentrated artemis could feel the thoughts of the others swirling around him it was mostly broad emotions such as fear or excitement but after a bit of mental twiddling artemis detected specific thoughts too there was holly wondering if her weapon would arrive intact typical soldier and there was no fretting incessantly not about the journey itself but about someone who would be waiting for him in hybras abbot a demon named abbot artemis reached out and found qwan floating in the ether his mind was formidable juggling complex computations and philosophical puzzles you are keeping the mind active young human artemiss consciousness realized that this thought was directed at him the warlock had felt his clumsy probe artemis could feel a difference between his mind and the others they had something different an alien energy it was difficult to explain a feeling without senses but for some reason it seemed to be blue a blue plasma electric and alive artemis allowed this rich feeling to flow through his mind and was instantly jolted by its energymagic he realized magic is in the mind now this was something worth knowing artemis retreated to his own mindspace but he took a sample of the blue plasma with him you never know when a touch of magic would come in useful they materialized on hybras inside the crater itself their arrival was accompanied by a flash of displaced energy the group lay on the sootblackened slopes panting and steaming the ground beneath them was warm to the touch and the acrid stink of sulphur stung their nostrils the euphoria of materialization soon dissipated artemis breathed experimentally the air from his mouth blowing up small dust eddies volcanic gas made his eyes water and flat flakes of ash instantly coated every exposed patch of skin this could be hell he commented hell or hybras said no climbing to his knees i got some of this ash on a tunic before it never comes out holly was up too running a systems check on her equipment my neutrino is fine but i cant get a lock on a communications signal were on our own and i seem to have lost the bomb artemis kneeled his knees cracking through the ash crust releasing the heat below he glanced at his watch and caught sight of his own face his hair was grey with ash and for a second he thought he was looking at his father a thought struck him i look like my father a father i may never see again mother butler i have only one friend left holly he said let me look at you holly did not look up from her wrist computer no time right now artemis artemis padded across to her walking gingerly on the thin crust holly let me look at you he said again holding her shoulders something in artemiss voice made holly stop what she was doing and pay attention this was not a tone artemis fowl used very often it could almost class as tenderness i just need to make sure youre still you things get mixed up between dimensions on my last trip i switched fingers he held up his hand for her to see strange i know but you seem to be fine all present and correct something flashed in the corner of artemiss eye there was a metal case half buried in the ash further up the crater wall the bomb sighed artemis i thought wed lost it in transit there was a flash when we landed qwan hurried across to the bomb no that was energy displacement mostly mine magic is almost another being it flows where it will some of mine did not flow back to me in time and ignited on reentry i am happy to say that the rest of my power is fired up and ready to go artemis was struck by how much of this prehistoric beings language was similar to nasa jargon no wonder we dont have a chance against the fairies he thought they were solving dimensional equations when we were still knocking stones together artemis helped the warlock to heave the bomb from the ashs grip the timer had been knocked for six by the timejump and now read over five thousand hours finally a stroke of luck artemis used butlers picks to examine the bombs workings maybe he could disarm it if he had a few months a couple of computers and some laser tools without those things there was about as much chance of him disarming this weapon as there was of a squirrel making a paper aeroplane this bomb is perfectly operational he said to qwan only the timer was affected the warlock stroked his beard that makes sense that instrument is relatively simple compared to the complexity of our bodies the dimension tunnel would have no trouble reassembling it the timer is another matter it will be affected by any timeflares we run across here it could blow at any second or never not never thought artemis i may not be able to disarm this thing but i can certainly blow it when i need to holly peered at the deadly device is there any way we can dispose of it qwan shook his head inanimate objects cannot travel unaccompanied in the time tunnel we on the other hand could get sucked back in at any moment we need to get some silver on us immediately holly glanced at artemis maybe some of us want to get sucked back in maybe you do said qwan but under certain conditions if you just let yourselves go who knows where youll end up or when your natural space and time will attract you but with the spell deteriorating you could arrive encased in rock a mile below the surface or stranded on the moon this was a sobering thought it was one thing to have a quick tourists look at the surface of the moon it was quite another to be stuck there forever not that you would know anything about it after the first minute so were stuck here said holly come on artemis you have a plan you always have a plan the others gathered round artemis there was something about him that made people assume that he was the leader perhaps it was the way he assumed it himself also in this instance he was the tallest person in the group he smiled briefly so this is how butler feels all the time we all have our reasons for wanting to go back he began holly and i have left loved ones behind friends and family we would dearly love to see again number one and qwan you need to get your people out of this dimension the spell is unravelling and soon nowhere on this island will be safe if my calculations are correct and i feel certain that they are then not even silver can anchor you here for much longer now you can go when the spell dictates or we can decide when to make the jump qwan did his sums in his head not possible it took seven warlocks and a volcano to move the island here to get us back i would need seven magical beings warlocks preferably and of course a live volcano which we dont have does it have to be a volcano wouldnt any energy source do theoretically agreed qwan so youre saying we could use the bomb its possible highly unlikely but possible i still need seven magical beings but the spell is already cast argued artemis the infrastructure is there couldnt you do it with fewer qwan wagged a finger at artemis you are a smart mud boy yes maybe i could do it with fewer of course we would not know until we arrived how many five five at the absolute least holly ground her teeth we only have three and number ones a novice so we need to find two demons with magic on this island impossible snapped qwan once an imp warps thats the end of any magic they might have only warlocks like myself and number one do not warp so we keep our magic artemis brushed ash from his jacket our first priority is to get out of this crater and find some silver i suggest we leave the bomb here the temperature is not enough to ignite it and if it does explode the volcano will absorb some of the force if we are going to find some other magical creature we will undoubtedly have a better chance outside this crater at any rate the sulphur is giving me a headache artemis did not wait for agreement he turned and made for the crater lip after a moment the others followed struggling with each footfall through the crust of ash it reminded artemis of a giant sand dune hed trudged up with his father once here falling would have harsher consequences it was a difficult and treacherous hike the ash concealed grooves in the rock and small crevasses that vented warm air from the volcano colourful fungi grew in clusters around these vents and they glowed in the crater shadows like coral night lights nobody spoke much during the climb no muttered his way through large tracts of the dictionary but the others realized that this was his way of keeping his chin up artemis glanced upwards occasionally the sky was dawn red and glowed above him like a lake of blood thats a cheery metaphor thought artemis maybe it says something about my character that a lake of blood is the only image i can come up with no s build was best suited for the steep climb he had a low centre of gravity and could rest on his stumpy tail if need be his thick feet anchored him securely and armoured plates covering his body protected him from sparks or bruising in the event of a fall qwan was clearly suffering the old warlock had been a statue for the past ten thousand years and was still working the kinks out of his bones magic soothed the process somewhat but even magic could not completely erase the pain he winced each time his foot punctured the soot crust finally the group reached the summit if time had passed it was impossible to tell how much the sky still had the same red tinge and all timepieces had virtually stopped holly jogged the last few steps then raised her right hand fingers closed in a fist that means halt artemis told the others its a military thing human soldiers use the exact same sign holly poked her head above the rim for a moment then returned to the group what does it mean if there are a lot of demons on their way up the mountain qwan smiled it means our brother demons saw the flash of our arrival and are coming to greet us and what does it mean if they are all armed with crossbows hmm mused qwan that could be a touch more serious how bad can they be asked artemis weve faced trolls together its fine said holly powering up her handgun theyre not so big were going to be fine really artemis frowned holly only bothered reassuring him when they were in deep trouble that bad he said holly whistled shaking her head you have no idea chapter leader of the pack the island of hybras while artemis and company had been zooming around the time tunnel leon abbot had been in council with the pride elders council was where all the big decisions were made or more accurately where abbot made all the big decisions the others thought they were participating but leon abbot had a way of bringing them round to his way of thinking if only they knew he thought biting the inside of his cheek to prevent a smug grin spreading across his face they would eat me alive but they can never know because there is nobody left alive to tell them that dolt number one was the last and hes gone what a pity abbot had something big for planned for today a big departure for the pride the dawn of a new era the leon abbot era he looked down the table at his fellow demons sucking the bones from a bucket of recently live rabbits that he had laid on for the meeting he despised the other council members every one they were weak stupid creatures ruled by their baser appetites what they needed was leadership no arguments no debates just his word was law and that was that of course under normal circumstances the other demons might not share his vision of the future in fact if he suggested it then they would most likely do to him what they were currently doing to the rabbits but these were not normal circumstances he had certain advantages when it came to negotiating with the council at the far end of the table hadley shrivelington basset a recent addition to the council stood and growled loudly the signal that he wished to speak in truth basset worried abbot slightly he was proving a little resistant to abbots regular powers of persuasion and some of the others were beginning to listen to him basset would have to be handled soon basset growled again cupping both hands round his mouth to ensure that the sound travelled to the head of the table i would speak leon abbot i would have you listen abbot sighed wearily waving at the demon to go ahead the young ones certainly loved their formality things are happening that worry me abbot things are not as they should be with the pride there were murmurs of assent from round the table not to worry the others would soon change their tune we are known by human names we venerate a human book i find this sickening are we to become human altogether i have explained this basset perhaps a million times are you so dullwitted that my words do not penetrate your skull basset growled low in his throat these were fighting words and pride leader or not abbot would soon find those words rammed down his throat let me try one more time continued abbot plonking his boots on the table a further insult to basset we learn the human ways so we can better understand them and so more easily defeat them we read the book we practise with the crossbow we bear the names basset would not be cowed i have heard these words a million times and each time they seem ridiculous to me we do not give each other rabbit names when we hunt rabbit we do not live in foxholes to hunt the fox we can learn from the book and the bow but we are demon not human my family name was gristle now thats a real demon name not this stupid hadley shrivelington basset it was a good argument and well presented maybe in different circumstances abbot would have applauded and recruited the young demon as a lieutenant but lieutenants grew up to be challengers and that was one thing abbot did not want abbot stood walking slowly down the length of the table gazing into the eyes of each council member in turn at first their eyes blazed with defiance but as abbot began to speak this fire faded to be replaced by a dull sheen of obedience you are right of course said abbot running a talon along one curved horn an arc of sparks followed the path of his nail everything you say is exactly right the names that ridiculous book the crossbow learning the language of english its all a joke bassets lips curled back over pointed white teeth and his tawny eyes narrowed you admit this abbot you hear him admit it before the others had grunted their approval of the young bucks challenge but now it was as if the fight had gone out of them all they could do was stare at the table as if the answers to lifes questions were etched into the wood grain the truth is basset continued abbot drawing ever nearer that were never going back home this is our home now but you said i know i said that the spell would end and we would be sucked back to where we came from and who knows it may even be true but i have no idea what will actually happen all i know is that for as long as we are here i intend to be in charge basset was stunned there will be no great battle but weve been training for so long distraction said abbot waving his fingers like a magician smoke and spells it gave the troops something to concentrate on to what on asked basset puzzled concentrate you moron think about as long as theres a war to be planned demons are happy i provided the war and i showed them how to win so naturally i am a saviour you gave us the crossbow abbot had to stop and laugh this basset really was a prize fool he could almost pass for a gnome the crossbow he panted at last when his mirth had petered away the crossbow the mud men have weapons that shoot death they have iron birds that fly dropping exploding eggs and there are millions of them millions all they would have to do is drop one egg on our little island and we would disappear and this time there would be no coming back basset did not know whether to attack or flee all these revelations were hurting his brain and all the other council members could do was sit there drooling it was almost as if they were under a spell come on said abbot mockingly youre getting there wring out that sponge of a brain you have bewitched the council full marks crowed abbot give that demon a raw rabbit bbut that cant be stammered basset demons are not magical creatures except the warlocks and warlocks do not warp abbot spread his arms wide and i am so obviously a magnificently warped creature does your brain hurt is this all too much for you basset basset pulled a long sword from its scabbard my name is gristle he roared lunging at the pride leader abbot batted the blade aside with his forearm then pounced on his opponent abbot may have been a liar and a manipulator but he was also a fearsome warrior basset may as well have been a dove attacking an eagle abbot drove the smaller demon to the stone floor then squatted on his chest ignoring the blows basset drove into his armoured plates is that the best you can do little one i have had better tumbles with my dog he grabbed bassets head between his hands and squeezed until the younger demons eyes bulged now i could kill you said abbot and the thought gave him obvious pleasure but you are a popular buck among the imps and they would pester me with questions so i will let you live after a fashion your free will shall belong to me basset shouldnt have been able to speak but he managed to moan one word never abbot squeezed harder never never you say but dont you know that never comes quickly here in hybras then abbot did what no warped demon should be able to do he summoned magic from inside himself and let it shine through his eyes you are mine he said to basset and his voice was layered with magic and irresistible the others were so conditioned that they succumbed to just a tinge of the mesmer in his voice but for bassets fresh young mind abbot was calling forth every spark of magic in his system magic that he had stolen magic that by fairy law was never to be used to mesmerize another fairy bassets face was turned red and his forehead plate cracked you are mine repeated abbot staring straight into bassets captive eyes you will never question me again to bassets credit he fought the enchantment for several seconds until the magics power actually burst a blood vessel in his eye then as the blood spread across the orange sclera of his eye bassets resolve faded to be replaced by docile dullness i am yours he intoned i will never question you again abbot closed his eyes for a moment drawing the magic back into himself when he opened them again he was all smiles thats good i am so glad to hear that basset i mean your option was quick and painful death so youre better off as a mindless lapdog anyway he climbed to his feet and graciously helped basset to his youve had a fall he explained in a doctor patient voice and im helping you to your feet basset blinked dreamily i will never question you again oh never mind all that now just sit down and do whatever i say i am yours said basset abbot slapped his cheek gently and the others said we wouldnt get along abbot returned to his own chair at the head of the lodge the chair was highbacked and made from various animal parts he settled into it paddling the armrests with his palms i love this chair he said actually its more of a throne than a chair which brings me to our main business here today abbot reached under a leather flap in the chair and pulled out a roughly fashioned bronze crown i think its about time the council declared me king for life he said fixing the crown on his head this new kingforlife idea would be a tough sell a demon pride was always ruled over by the fittest and it was a very temporary position abbot had only survived as long as he had by mesmerizing anyone who dared challenge him most of the cquncil had been under abbots spell for so long that they accepted the suggestion as if it were a royal decree but some of the younger ones shuddered with violent spasms as their true beliefs wrestled with this new repugnant idea their struggles didnt last long abbots suggestion spread like a virus through their conscious and subconscious subduing revolution wherever it was found abbot adjusted his crown slightly enough debate all in favour say graaarghl graaargh howled the demons battering the table with gauntlets and swords all hail king leon prompted abbot all hail king leon mimicked the council like trained parrots the adulation was interrupted by a soldier demon who burst through the lodges flap theres a there was a big abbot whipped off the crown the general population wasnt ready for that yet theres a what he demanded a big what the soldier paused catching his breath he realized suddenly that hed better communicate the bigness of what had happened on the mountain or else abbot was liable to behead him for interrupting the meeting there was a big flash a big flash that didnt sound big enough let me start again a huge flash of light came from the volcano two of the hunting party were nearby they say someone came through a group four beings abbot frowned beings two demons maybe but the other two the hunter doesnt know what they are this was serious abbot knew it these beings could be humans or worse still surviving warlocks if it was a warlock he would surely guess abbots secret all it would take was one demon with some real power and his hold on the pride would be gone this situation had to be contained very well the council will investigate nobody else goes up there the soldiers adams apple bobbed nervously as if he was about to bear bad news its too late master abbot the entire pride is climbing the volcano abbot was halfway to the door before the soldier finished his sentence follow me he shouted to the other demons and bring your weapons graaargh roared the spellbound council members artemis was surprised at how calm he felt you would think that a teenage human would be terrified at the sight of a pride of demons climbing towards him but artemis was more nervous than terrified and more curious than nervous he glanced backwards over his shoulder into the crater they had just climbed out of the pride comes before a fall he said softly then smiled at his own joke holly overheard you certainly pick your moment to develop a sense of humour usually i would be planning but this is out of my hands qwan is in charge now no led them along the rim of the crater towards a low rocky ledge there was a wooden rod jammed into the ground beside the ledge and hooked over the rod were dozens of silver bangles most tarnished and sootcaked no wiggled a bunch over the top of the rod dimension jumpers leave these here he explained passing them out just in case they make it back no one ever did until now except leon abbot of course qwan slipped a bangle on to his wrist dimension jumping is suicide without silver a demon will never be able to stay in one place for more than a few seconds they will drift between times and dimensions until they are killed by exposure or starvation magic is the only reason were here i am amazed this abbot person made it back what is his demon name no squinted down the mountain pathway you can ask him your self thats him the big one elbowing his way to the head of the group holly squinted down at the pride leader the one with the curved horns and big sword she asked is he smiling no thats abbot it was a strange reunion there was no hugging no champagne and no tearyeyed reminiscing instead there were bared teeth drawn swords and threatening behaviour the latest batch of imps were especially eager to skewer the newcomers and prove their valour artemis was the number one target in the group imagine an actual live human here on hybras he didnt look so tough artemis and company had stayed put on the ledge waiting for the demons to come to them they didnt have to wait long the imps arrived first breathless from the climb and just dying to kill something if it hadnt been for qwan artemis would have been ripped to shreds on the spot in fairness holly had something to do with keeping artemis alive too she tagged the first halfdozen imps with a charge from her neutrino strong enough to send them scurrying back to what they thought was a safe distance after that qwan managed to hold their attention by conjuring a multicoloured dancing monkey in the air soon every demon who was able to climb the mountain had done so and they were all staring at the magical monkey even no was entranced what is that qwan fluttered his fingers causing the monkey to somersault its a simple magical construct instead of allowing the sparks to roam on instinct i marshal them into a recognizable form it takes time and effort but in time you will have this microcontrol too no said no i mean what is that qwan sighed its a monkey as their numbers grew the demons became more and more agitated the warriors crashed horns in a show of strength they bashed each others chest plates with their forearms and made a big show of sharpening their swords on stones i miss butler said artemis me too said holly scanning the crowd for the greatest threat it wasnt easy to decide every demon in the crowd seemed as though he was on the verge of hurling himself at the new arrivals holly had seen threedimensional models of demons of course but she had never seen the real thing the models were accurate enough but they couldnt capture the bloodlust in the creatures eyes or the eerie whines that curled out of their noses as battle fever possessed them abbot barged through to the front of the group and holly instantly trained her weapon on his chest qwan said abbot obviously amazed youre alive i thought the warlocks were all dead except the one that helped you said no before he could stop himself abbot took a step back well yes except that one qwan closed his fist and the monkey disappeared i know you he said slowly searching for the memories you were at taillte you were a dissenter abbot drew himself up thats right i am abbot the dissenter we never should have come here we should have met the humans headon the warlocks betrayed us he levelled his sword at qwan you betrayed us the other demons growled and rattled their weapons abbot took a moment to study the other members of the group a human thats a human you have brought the enemy to our door how long before the rest of them follow in their metal birds metal birds said artemis in gnommish what metal birds all we have are crossbows remember there followed a collective ooh as the demons realized that this human spoke their language albeit with an accent abbot decided to change the subject this boy was picking holes in his story and you brought an elf too warlock armed with a magical weapon the elves betrayed us at taillte qwan was getting bored with all this posturing i know everybody betrayed you at taillte why dont you give the order youre working up to you want us dead give the order and see if our brother demons will attack the only being who can save them abbot realized that he was on very dangerous ground this poisonous little bunch had to be dealt with quickly and permanently you want to die so much so be it you can die he pointed his sword at the small group and was on the verge of roaring kill them or perhaps death to the traitors when qwan snapped his fingers he did this in a very showy way setting off a magical miniexplosion i remember you now your name isnt abbot youre nzall the idiot who ruined the time spell but you seem different those red markings abbot flinched as if struck a few of the older demons sniggered abbots demon name wasnt brought up very much abbot was a little embarrassed by it not surprisingly since nzall meant little horn in the old demon cant it is you nzall its all coming back to me now you and that other moron bludwin you were against the time spell you wanted to fight it out with the humans i still do roared abbot overcompensating after the mention of his true name theres one right here we can start with him qwan was angry now for the first time since he came back to life we had it all worked out we had a circle of seven in the volcano the lava was rising and everything was under control then you and bludwin hopped out from behind a rock and broke the circle abbots laugh was hollow this never happened you have been away too long warlock you have gone mad qwans eyes burned with blue sparks and magic rippled along the length of his arms i have been a statue for ten thousand years because of you nobody believes a word of this warlock i believe it said no and there were some in the demon camp who believed it too it was in their eyes you tried to murder the warlocks continued qwan accusingly there was some commotion and bludwin went into the volcano his energy tainted the spell then you dragged my apprentice qweffor into the lava too both of you went in i saw it qwan frowned trying to piece it all together but you didnt die you didnt die because the spell had already started the magic transported you away before the lava could melt your bones but where did qweffor go where did you go no knew the answer to that question he went into the future he told our secrets to the humans in exchange for one of their storybooks and an ancient weapon from a museum abbot pointed the sword at him i was going to let you live impling no felt a knot of rage in his stomach like you let me live the last time you told me to jump into the crater you mesmerized me abbot was in a tough spot he could order the council to attack but that would leave many questions unanswered and he couldnt mesmerize everybody but if he let qwan keep talking every one of his secrets could be exposed what he needed was some time to think unfortunately time was something he did not have he would have to use his wits and weapons to get out of this situation i mesmerized you dont be ridiculous demons dont have magic we abhor magic abbot shook his head in disbelief what am i even doing explaining myself to a runt like you shut your mouth number one or ill stitch it shut and throw you into the volcano qwan did not appreciate his new apprentice being threatened i have had enough of you nzall you would threaten warlocks number one as you call him has more power inside him than you will ever have abbot laughed for once you are right old warlock i have no power inside me not a single spark of magic what i do have is the power of my fist and the strength of the pride behind me artemis was growing tired of this bickering we dont have time for this he said stepping out from behind qwan the time spell is unravelling and we need to make preparations for the journey home for that journey we need all the magic we can get including yours nzall or abbot or whatever your name is i dont argue with humans growled abbot but if i did i might repeat that i dont have any magic oh come on scoffed artemis i know the side effects of the mesmer including ragged pupils and bloodshot eyes some of your friends here have been mesmerized so much they barely have pupils any more and where did i get this magic you stole it in the time tunnel i imagine you and qweffor were literally melted together by the combination of lava and magic when you emerged in earths recent past you managed to hold on to some warlock magic this was a bit of a stretch for everyone present abbot realized that he wouldnt need the mesmer to convince anybody that the humans theory was ridiculous he could destroy this humans argument before destroying the human abbot made a great show of scoffing at artemis he did the whole big tribe leader bit running his nails along the curves of his horns and barking out short bursts of laughter pretty soon almost everyone else was laughing along so human said abbot when the furore had died down i stole magic in the time tunnel you must be losing your mind mud boy maybe thats because im about to order my imps to skin your bones and suck the marrow from them even if what you say were possible how would you know how would a human know and abbot grinned smugly certain that no satisfactory answer could possibly be forthcoming artemis fowl grinned right back at him and pointed his index finger at the sky actually it was his middle finger due to the timetunnel switch from the tip of this finger sprang a small blue spark which exploded like a tiny firework i know magic can be stolen said artemis because i stole some myself this piece of melodrama was greeted by a moment of stunned silence then qwan cackled loudly i said you were smart mud boy i was wrong you are exceptional even in the time tunnel you were plotting stole a little magic did you artemis shrugged closing his fingers on the sparks it was floating around i wondered what would happen if i embraced it qwan squinted at him now you know you are changed a magical creature like us i hope you will use your gift wisely just what we need moaned holly artemis fowl with magical powers i believe that if we count mister nzall here that makes five magical beings enough to reverse the time spell abbot was sunk and he knew it the other demons were looking at him curiously wondering if he had been manipulating them magically even a few of the mesmerized council were struggling to shake off their mental chains it was only a matter of minutes before his dreams of kingship floated forever out of his reach there was only one option left to him kill them all he roared not quite as fiercely as he would have liked imps you have free rein the mesmerized council members lurched into action not quite as graceful in battle as they would normally be the imps were so delighted to be given a chance to kill something with only two legs that they barged forward with unconfined glee blood and guts howled one and they all took up the cry it was not particularly eloquent but it got the message across holly was not particularly worried her neutrino could fire as fast as she could aim and with a wide beam setting she could stun the entire line of demons and imps before they could do any damage in theory she elbowed artemis aside took a stand and began firing the beams erupted from the pistol in a spreading cone pattern blasting the demons off their feet and keeping them down for at least ten minutes except for the ones that were getting back up immediately which seemed to be most of them even the imps were shaking off the blasts as if they were mere gusts of wind holly frowned this should not be happening and she didnt dare raise the setting for fear of doing permanent damage something she would not risk under any circumstances qwan she said my beams not having much effect any ideas holly knew that warlocks werent much use in combat situations it was against their credo to harm and they would only do so in the most dire situations by the time qwan overcame his pacifist nature it would be too late while qwan scratched his chin holly kept firing each pulse brought down a bunch of demons but they were back on their feet in seconds if the council has been mesmerized i can heal them concluded qwan but the brain is delicate i need direct contact no time for that said holly loosing another burst artemis have you got anything artemis had his hand on his stomach t really need to use a bathroom a second ago i was fine but now holly really wished her wings were operational if she could just get a birds eye view on the targets it would be much easier bathroom artemis is this really the time one demon made it past the laser bursts close enough to smell holly ducked under his swinging mace kicking him in the chest the air left his lungs in a whoof and the demon went down gasping for breath i need the bathroom and your neutrino is having barely any effect time is speeding up were in a surge artemis grabbed hollys shoulder causing a burst to sail off high and wide i need to get to the bomb it could explode at any moment holly shrugged him off safety tip artemis dont jiggle me when im firing qwan can you buy us some time time said qwan smiling you know its ironic that we need time because holly ground her teeth why did she always have to end up with the intellectuals no had been equal parts terrified and thoughtful during the attack terrified for the obvious reasons dismemberment painful death etc but also thoughtful he was a warlock there must be something he could do before he left the island he would have been stunned into inactivity by the suddenness and ferocity of this attack now it wasnt even the worst thing hed faced those security mud men in the chateau the big ones with the suits and fire sticks no could see them in his head as clearly as though they were here instead of allowing the sparks to roam on instinct i marshal them into a recognizable form no concentrated on the human figures in his memory wrapping them with magic bringing them forth he felt them solidifying as though the blood in his forehead were freezing when the pressure became too much for his forehead he expelled it into reality conjuring up ghostly images of a dozen human mercenaries blasting away with automatic weapons it was a spectacular sight even abbot reared back the rest more than reared back they turned and ran nice qwan good thinking said artemis qwan was puzzled you can read my thoughts oh you mean the soldiers that was not me number one is a very powerful little warlock in ten years he could move this island on his own abbot was left standing ten paces from the group with his sword in his hand and a hailstorm of blue bullets cascading around him in fairness to the pride leader he stood his ground facing certain death the demon way with a sword in his hand and a snarl on his face qwan shook his head just look at that its that kind of idiocy that got us into trouble in the first place abbot had some experience with magic and he soon realized that these new humans and their missiles were mere illusions come back you fools he shouted after his soldiers they cant hurt you artemis tapped hollys shoulder sorry to jiggle you again but we need to get back to the bomb all of us and if possible lure abbot down there too holly put several bursts into abbots chest to buy them a couple of minutes the pride leader flew backwards as though a giant had pounded his chest with a mallet ok lets go artemis you go ahead ill hold them off from the rear they scrambled back into the crater skidding on their heels through the ash crust they made faster progress on the way down but it was just as treacherous it was hardest for holly because she was moving backwards ready to take a potshot at anyone who poked so much as a hair over the crater rim it was a scene from a fiveyearolds nightmare acrid smells that burned the eyes and throat a surface that sucked at the feet a red sky and the sound of breath and heartbeats not to mention the constant fear that the demons were coming things were about to get worse the release of qwans displaced magical energy had accelerated the deterioration of the time spell and it was on the point of collapsing entirely unfortunately this would happen in reverse order starting on hybras artemis knew this but he hadnt had a spare second to run any calculations soon he guessed it would happen soon and who could tell when soon was during a time surge artemis realized that it was more than a guess he knew the collapse of the tunnel was imminent he could feel it he was in touch with magic now he was part of it and it was part of him artemis pulled qwans arm round his shoulder urging him forward quickly we need to hurry the old warlock nodded you feel it chaos in the air look at number one artemis glanced behind no was on their heels but his brow was furrowed with pain and he knuckled his forehead hes sensitive gasped qwan puberty suddenly human puberty didnt seem so bad holly was in trouble her years of training and experience hadnt prepared her for the moment when she would be retreating into a volcano guarding a human and two members of a supposedly extinct species during a time surge the surge was playing havoc with her bodily functions but it was also having an effect on her gunfire she was laying down a covering fire on the ridge but a cluster of blasts disappeared in midair where do those shots go holly wondered briefly into the past groups of ghost images fizzled into existence for a brief moment giving the illusion that there were twice as many demons as there had been added to this she was suddenly struck with hunger cramps and she could swear her fingernails were growing abbots demons came fast and not in a tight group as holly had hoped they had ranged themselves along the rim and came over the top in a coordinated wave it was a fearsome sight dozens of warriors bounding over the lip their markings glowing in the red light teeth bared horns quivering and bloodcurdling battle cries echoing around the crater walls this was not like fighting trolls trolls had some basic smarts but these demons were organized and battle ready already they knew to spread out and avoid the laser bursts holly picked out the pride leader hello there abbot she thought whatever happens here youre going home with a headache she loosed three bolts at him two disappeared but one connected sending abbot tumbling into the dirt holly did her best widening the spread as much as possible setting the trigger on automatic if shed had her full combat pack then there wouldnt have been a problem a few flash grenades at the right moment would have stunned the entire wave of demons and a pulse assault rifle could have held them back for a few hundred years if necessary as it was she had one handgun no backup and a time surge gobbling half her rays it seemed an impossible task to slow down abbot and his goons long enough for artemis to reach the bomb and even if she did manage it what then the demons kept coming bent low and bobbing they loosed bolts from their crossbows on the run none of which were affected by the surge of course they wouldnt be the rays from her neutrino were calibrated to have a short life once they made contact with air they would dissipate after five seconds unless specifically reset to hold together for longer thankfully the bolts were falling short but not as short as they had been a few moments earlier time was running out in more ways than one a group of especially daredevil imps made it past hollys arc of fire their method of travel was foolhardy and suicidal only idiot luck saved them from crushed skulls using a hide shield as a sled three of them skidded down the craters inner slope being tossed hither and thither by rocks and changes in gradient one second they were fifty metres away and the next holly could smell the sweat glistening on their brow plates holly swung her gun barrel towards them but it was too late she could never make it and even if she did the others would use the distraction to make ground the imps were leering at her lips pulled back over sharp pointed teeth one was especially agitated and had some kind of slime flowing from his pores the imps seemed to hang suspended in the air for the longest time and then something happened the air pulsed and reality momentarily split into coloured pixels like a faulty computer screen holly felt sick to her stomach and the imps winked out of existence taking a twometre diameter tube of the crater with them holly fell back from the hole which collapsed in on itself no fell to his knees and threw up magic he gasped breaking down the lure of earth is stronger than silver now no one is safe artemis and qwan were in slightly better shape but only slightly i am older and have more control over my empathy said qwan thats why i didnt throw up and having said that he threw up artemis didnt even give the old warlock time to recover himself there was no time time was surging and unravelling at the same time come on he said forward holly backpedalled to her feet pulling no to his behind them on the slopes the demons froze at the sight of the disappearing imps but now were advancing again with renewed determination no doubt they believed that holly was responsible for the disappearance of their little brothers temporal booms echoed around the island as chunks of hybras spun into the time tunnel some would materialize on earth and some in space it was doubtful that any demons unlucky enough to be transported would survive not without concentrated magic to forge a compass for them artemis dragged himself the last few steps to the bomb dropping to his knees beside it he wiped ash from the readout with his sleeve then spent a while studying it nodding along with the flickering of its digital timer the numbers of the timer were behaving seemingly erratically jumping forward slowing down and even backing up slightly but artemis knew that there would be a pattern in here somewhere magic was simply another form of energy and energy conformed to certain rules it was simply a matter of watching the timer and counting it took a while longer than they could afford but eventually artemis spotted the repeat he ran the numbers quickly in his head i see it he shouted to qwan who was on his knees beside him its mainly forward an hour per second for a count of forty followed by a deceleration to thirty minutes per second for a count of eighteen then a slight jump backwards in time one minute per second back for a count of two then it repeats qwan smiled weakly what was the first one again artemis stood heaving the bomb from its cradle of ash and fungus never mind you need to prepare to transport this place ill move this bomb to wherever you need it very well smart mud boy but we still only have four magical beings we need nzall holly backed into the group still firing ill see what i can do qwan nodded i have faith in you captain then again i am a trusting person and look where that got me where do you want this qwan considered we need to form a circle round it so somewhere flat look that level spot there artemis began dragging the bomb towards the indicated spot it wasnt so far and then they could all stand round in a ring and watch it explode everyone had their jobs to do now and the chances of their tasks coming to fruition were slightly less than the chances of a dwarfgoblin marriage ever taking place and a goblin would rather eat his own feet than marry a dwarf artemis had to position the bomb and qwan were in charge of spellcasting and holly had the unenviable tasks of keeping them all alive and persuading abbot to join their group and all this while the island was disintegrating around them the volcano was literally being torn apart huge segments vanished into space like parts of a giant threedimensional jigsaw in minutes there would be nothing left to transport qwan took nos hand in his own leading him to the small level spot ok young fellow that thing you did up there with the soldiers that was good i was impressed but this is the big time i know youre in pain thats just because you are sensitive to the spells breakdown but you have to ignore that we have an island to move no felt his tail vibrate nervously an island an entire island qwan winked and everyone on it no pressure what do we do i only need one thing from you call up your magic every drop let it pass through me and ill do the rest that sounded easy enough but calling up magic when there were arrows flying and chunks of the countryside disappearing was about as easy as going to the toilet on command with a dozen people watching who all hated you no closed his eyes and thought magical thoughts magic come on magic he tried to open the same doors in his mind as he had when he had conjured up the human soldiers to his surprise he found the magic came easier now as if it was ready to come out the cage had been opened and the beast was free no felt the power surge through his arms animating him like a puppet whoa there big fellow said qwan no need to blow my head off put a leash on it until its time to go the old warlock shouted to artemis his thin voice almost whipped away by sonic booms how long artemis was dragging the bomb with some difficulty digging his heels into the crust and heaving he couldnt help thinking that butler would have simply slung the bomb and its casing over one shoulder and hefted it on to the plateau count to three hundred maybe two ninetynine providing the deterioration remains constant which it should qwan had stopped listening after the words three hundred he gripped nos hands tightly five minutes and were going home time to start the mantra qwan closed his eyes and bobbled his head from side to side muttering in the ancient demon tongue no could feel the power of the words shaping the magic into rising circles of blue fire around them he held on to his new mentor and joined in repeating the mantra as if his life depended on it which of course it did holly had a new mission now somehow she had to draw abbot into their little group and persuade him to join the magic circle it seemed judging by the way he was waving his fancy sword highly unlikely that he would do this voluntarily the demon attack was mostly in disarray now what with large tracts of the surroundings flashing off into another dimension but abbot and his council members were as dogged as ever forging ahead with barely a pause when some of their number disappeared holly held her fire wondering what was the best way to communicate with the pride leader she was a trained negotiator and suspected from her own observations and what no had told her that abbot had acquired situational narcissism he was completely in love with himself and his own importance in the community narcissists would often chose to die rather than accept what they saw as demotion to abbot holly would represent someone who was trying to remove him as pride leader and therefore someone to be dealt with immediately great thought holly no matter what dimension youre in theres a bigheaded male trying to take over the world the demons were advancing in a ragged line abbot was at the head waving his fancy sword urging his mesmerized troops forward the red sky was splitting into interwoven tendrils behind his head the world as abbot knew it was ending but still he would not give up his position death for all before disgrace for him call off your warriors abbot shouted holly we can talk about this abbot did not reply as such not unless howling and waving a sword could count as a reply the demons were spreading out even more now flanking her and avoiding being sucked off into another dimension all in one group abbot skidded ahead digging his heels through the crust of ash leaning his torso back to avoid tumbling he was completely coated in ash now even his rams horns were grey grey maelstroms trailed behind him as each lurch forward threw up a thousand flakes theres nothing i can do thought holly this guy wouldnt listen to his own mother if he knew who his mother was there was no way out she would have to up the charge and knock him senseless for a couple of hours qwan would have to put abbot in the magic circle unconscious sorry she said and flicked up the power setting above the pistols thumbrest holly aimed with practised accuracy the beam which pulsed from the neutrinos barrel was a more dangerous red now and should knock abbot head over heels a couple of times ill try not to enjoy that sight thought holly it was a sight she never got to enjoy for at that precise moment the time surge reversed for a count of two the beam disappeared into the past and holly felt like throwing up as her atoms were scrambled once again by time quandary she caught a glimpse of her ghostly past self less than a metre to her right outoffocus past versions of the demons scrambled behind them like speed trails then the past was gone for another minute abbot was still coming dangerously close now holly reckoned she had time for another shot and with any luck the demon council would lose their singularity of purpose with their leader out of the picture she adjusted her aim then the world shattered before her like a broken mirror a curved section of the earth rose above her like a tidal wave then dematerialized in a glittering flurry of sparks holly caught a glimpse of alternate dimensions through the gaps there was sun and space and enormous multitentacled creatures the sheer amount of magic present in the air squeezed hollys head like a vice she vaguely noted groaning behind her as artemis and the others succumbed to the magical overload but she could not succumb some of the demons may have been sucked up into the time tunnel but there could be more left the air shimmered and settled rivulets of dust and rock spilled from midair huge chasms yawned all around with nothing below but red space there was more emptiness now than land most of the demons were gone most but not all abbot alone was left grinning maniacally his sword extended before him hello elf he said and plunged the sword into hollys chest holly felt the steel slide through the delicate membrane of elfin skin between the eighth and ninth ribs and lodge a millimetre below her heart it was cold as ice and more painful than words can describe she fell backwards slipping off the slick blade crashing through the crust of ash blood poured out of her like water from a ruptured vessel her own heart did gravitys work emptying her veins with every beat magic she gasped through the pain abbot was jubilant magic cannot help you elf ive been working on this sword for a long time in case the warlocks ever showed up theres enough enchantment in this steel to stop an entire magic circle he shook the sword as he talked spittle sprayed from his mouth and hollys blood dripped from the blade splattering lines on the ash holly coughed the action felt like it was splitting her in two magic could not help her here there was only one person who could artemis she said her voice weak and thin artemis help me artemis fowl glanced her way briefly then returned his gaze to the bombs timer leaving holly short to die on the ground which she did chapter home again home again artemis was hauling the bomb when the big shift came the magical overspill hit him like a rugby tackle driving him to his knees for a moment his senses were completely overloaded and he was left gasping in a vacuum sight was first to return distorted by tears and stars he checked the bombs timer three minutes to go providing the pattern did not disintegrate he glanced to his left where qwan and nl were returning to the business of conjuring while over his right shoulder holly was holding whatever demons were left all around the world was vibrating itself out of this existence the noise was hellacious and the smell coated the inside of his nostrils the bomb was heavy enough to make artemiss knuckles crack and not for the first time he wished butler was at his side to take the strain but he wasnt at his side and wouldnt be again if artemis did not get going it was a simple plan move the box to the plateau object a to point b there was no sense in thinking about it then holly got stabbed and the plan got a lot more complicated artemis saw the blade going in out of the corner of his eye and worse still he heard the sound it made a clean snick like a key going into a lock this cant be real he thought we have been through too much together for holly to be taken so quickly the sound the sword made coming out of holly was hideous beyond imagination artemis knew that he would take that sound to his own grave abbot was gloating now magic cannot help you elf ive been working on this sword for a long time artemis sank to his haunches fighting the urge to crawl to hollys side magic could not help holly but perhaps a combination of magic and science could he forced himself to ignore the spurts of deep red blood seeping from her wound there was nothing in holly shorts future but death her current future but the future could be changed no and qwan had not seen the assault they were deep in concentration building the blue rings abbot was moving towards them now the tip of his sword dripped blood on the ash like a leaky pen joining the dots to his next victims holly spoke her last artemis she said artemis help me artemis glanced at her once briefly he shouldnt have the sight of his friend dying almost threw off his count and right now the count was the most important thing holly died without a friend to hold her hand artemis felt her go another gift of the magic he kept on counting brushing away the tears on his cheeks keep counting thats all that matters artemis rose walking swiftly to his fallen friend abbot saw him go he pointed the sword in artemiss direction youre next mud boy first the warlocks then you once you are gone things will return to how they were artemis ignored him nodding along with the count in his head making sure not to rush the count must be accurate or all was lost abbot elbowed his way between qwan and no they were so focused that they barely realized that he was there with two strokes of his cursed sword the job was done no fell backwards blue magic trailing from his fingers qwan did not fall because the tip of abbots sword was keeping him upright artemis did not look into hollys eyes he could not instead he prised the handgun from her hand and pointed it away from him be careful now timing is everything abbot yanked his sword from qwans chest and the small body slumped lifelessly to the ground three dead in less time than it would take to tie a shoelace artemis ignored the last breaths and the rhythmic crunching of ash that told him abbot was coming not that the demon was trying to hide it im back here human why dont you see if you can turn round in time artemis searched the volcano floor around holly for footprints there were many but only two side by side where abbot had stood as he struck all the while he counted remembering his own calculations an hour per second for a count of forty followed by a deceleration to thirty minutes per second for a count of eighteen then a slight jump backwards in time one minute per second back for a count of two then it repeats maybe ill keep you chuckled abbot prodding artemiss back with his sword itd be nice to have a pet human around i could teach you tricks i have a trick for you said artemis and he fired a single blast from the gun the blast exited the barrel and then was whipped one minute into the past just as artemis had calculated it would be it faded from the present and emerged just in time to strike the ghostly image of abbot as he drew back his sword to thrust it into holly the abbot of one minute ago was lifted and tossed against the crater wall the presenttime abbot had barely time to say what happened before he winked out of existence no longer flesh merely unrealized possibility you didnt kill my friends replied artemis though he was talking to himself that never happened artemis glanced down nervously holly was no longer there thank god another quick glance told him that qwan and no were back building their magic circle as if nothing had happened of course not nothing did happen artemis concentrated on the memory picturing abbot spinning through the air he wrapped the incident in magic to preserve it remember he told himself what he had just done now never had to be done and so wasnt done except of course he had done it time quandaries such as these should be forgotten for the sake of sanity but artemis was loathe to surrender any of his memories hey said a familiar voice dont you have a job to do artemis it was holly she was hogtying abbot with his own bootlaces artemis could only stare at her and smile he still felt the pain of her death but that would heal quickly now that she was alive again holly caught him smiling artemis could you get that box on to the plateau its a simple plan artemis smiled some more then shook himself yes of course put the box on the plateau holly had been dead and now she was alive artemiss hand tingled with the phantom memory of a gun it may or may not have held moments before there will be consequences for this he thought you cant alter events in time and be unaffected but whatever the consequences are i will bear them because the alternative is too terrible he returned to his mission dragging the bomb the final metres to the plateau he kneeled then put his shoulder into the casing slotting the bomb between qwan and nos legs no didnt even notice that artemis was there the little apprentice warlocks eyes were solid blue now flush with magic the runes on his chest glowed then began to move swirling like snakes slithering upwards to his neck and swirling on his forehead like an enchanted catherine wheel artemis give me a hand with this it was holly struggling to roll abbots unconscious body across the bumpy crater with each revolution the demons horns got snagged in the earth ploughing a small furrow artemis plodded across to her legs aching from the climb and descent he grabbed one horn and heaved holly took the other did you shoot him artemis asked holly shrugged i dont know maybe it got a bit hazy there for a minute must be the time spell must be said artemis relieved that holly didnt remember what had happened nobody should have to remember dying though he would be interested to find out what exactly came next time was running every which way including out one way or another the island of hybras was not going to be here much longer either the time spell would take it in pieces or qwan would get a grip of the bombs energy and transport them back to earth artemis and holly dragged abbot into the circle dumping him at qwans feet sorry hes out said holly it was that or dead difficult choice with this one said qwan grabbing one of abbots horns artemis took the other and between them they pulled abbot into a kneeling position there were now five in the circle i had been hoping for five warlocks grumbled qwan one warlock one apprentice an elf a human and a snoring egomaniac were not exactly what i had in mind this makes things a little more complicated what can we do asked artemis qwan shuddered and a blue film passed across his eyes darvit he swore this young one is powerful i cant hold him in much longer two more minutes of this and hes going to melt our brains inside our skulls i saw that once fluid boiling right out of the ears horrible qwan what can we do sorry im a little stressed here ok heres how its supposed to work im going to lift us off with juniors help when the device explodes ill convert the energy to magic captain short youre in charge of the where artemis youre in charge of the when where said holly when said artemis simultaneously qwan gripped abbots horn so tightly it creaked you know where this island goes holly picture the spot artemis let your time call to you allow it to reel you in we cannot go back to our time that would cause so many quandaries that the planet would probably just drop into a lower orbit and fry everything on it i accept that said artemis but allow it to reel me in i prefer some facts and figures how about trajectories spatial addresses qwan was on his way into a trance no science just magic feel your way home artemis fowl artemis frowned disgruntled feeling his way was not how he generally did things people who felt their way without hard scientific facts generally wound up broke or dead but what choice did he have it was easier for holly magic had always been a part of her life it had been her minor in college and all lep officers had to take regular inservice courses in seconds her eyes were clouded with blue sparks and her inner magic had added a blue ring to the pulsing circles around them visualize it thought artemis see where you want to go or rather when you want to arrive he tried but even though the magic was in him it was not of him the fairies were lost in the spell casting but artemis fowl could only gaze at the huge bomb at their feet and marvel that they were waiting for it to explode a bit late for doubts now after all the whole harness the bombs power notion was your idea it was true he had conjured a few sparks earlier but that was different he had done it without thinking the sparks had been a flourish to make his point here his magic could be what kept everyone on this island alive artemis studied each member of the circle in turn qwan and no vibrated with unnatural speed their eyes were blue and markings spun on their foreheads like minicyclones hollys magic vented through her fingers coating her hand in an almost liquid blue light abbot of course was unconscious but his horns glowed blue and continuous streams of sparks shot from them cascading over the group like a rock bands special effect in fact this entire episode would not look out of place in a music video around them the island was suffering its own trauma the time tunnels continued meltdown snatched up increasingly larger plots whisking them off to other dimensions the crackling hoops of power round them fused to form a magical hemisphere it was not perfect though gaps flowed across its surface threatening the integrity of the entire structure im the problem thought artemis i am not contributing artemis felt himself on the verge of panic whenever this feeling claimed him he ordered his mind to change gear and slip into a meditative mood he did this now feeling his heart slow and the impossible craziness around him slip away he concentrated on one thing hollys hand in his clutching his fingers with life and energy hollys fingers twitched sending magical tendrils along artemiss arm in his relaxed state he was receptive and her magic sparked his own drawing it from his brain he felt the magic ignite in his nerve endings filling him up elevating his consciousness to another place it was a euphoric experience artemis realized there were sections of his brain opening up that hadnt been used by humans for millennia he also realized that humans must have had their own magic once but had forgotten how to use it ready asked qwan but not aloud they were sharing consciousness now as they had been in the tunnel but this was a clearer experience like digital compared to radio waves ready replied the others thought waves overlapping in a kind of mental harmony but there was disharmony too and struggle its not enough thought qwan i cant seal the hemisphere i need more from abbot the others pushed as hard as they could but none of them had any more magic to give abbot would kill them all in his sleep hello whos there said a new voice which was something you dont expect in a closed magic circle even if it is your first one along with the voice came a series of memories great battles betrayal and a plunge into a fiery volcano qweffor said qwan is that you boy qwan can it be you are you trapped here too qweffor the apprentice hauled into the volcano by abbot back on earth qwan instantly understood what must have happened no were in the magic circle once more i need your power now oh gods master qwan its been so long you wouldnt believe what this demon eats power qweffor now we can talk at the other end oh ok sorry nice to hear a warlocks thoughts again after so long i thought power sorry on the way moments later a strong pulse of power hummed through the circle the magical hemisphere sealed becoming a solid shield of light qwan redirected a small chunk of magic down to encircle the bomb itself a highpitched whistle emanated from the little golden sphere high c thought artemis absently focus admonished qwan take us to your time artemis focused on the important things he had left behind and realized that they were all people mother father butler foaly and mulch possessions that he had believed important now meant nothing except maybe his collection of impressionist art leave out the art artemis warned holly or well end up in the twentieth century nineteenth replied artemis but i take your point it may seem that all this bickering was a waste of valuable time but it took place instantaneously a million multisensory messages were exchanged along magical pathways which made fibreoptic cables look about as efficient as two cans and a piece of string memories opinions and secrets were laid bare for all to see interesting noted artemis if i could recreate this i could revolutionize the communications business you were a statue said qweffor am i reading this right at the circles centre the bombs timer was clicking towards zero in a single second the timer swept through the final hour on the clock when the timer hit zero a charge was sent to various detonators including three dummies to a block of plastic explosive the size of a small television set here it comes sent qwan the bomb exploded transforming the casing from a metal box into a million supersonic darts the inner shield stopped the darts dead but absorbed their kinetic energy adding it to the outer shield i saw that thought artemis impressed very clever and he had seen it somehow some kind of lateral vision that allowed everyone to view events at their own pace and from whatever point of view they preferred it also allowed his mind to concentrate fully on his home time while also appreciating the spectacle artemis decided to move his third eye outside the circle whatever happened to this island was certain to be pretty spectacular the explosion released the power of an electrical storm into a space the size of a fourman tent everything inside the space should have been vaporized but the flame and shock waves were contained by the small golden sphere they roiled about in there punching through in several places wherever this happened the errant force was attracted to the blue rings of power and stuck to them like flashes of cloudtoground lightning artemis watched some of these flashes shoot straight through his body and out the other side but he was not injured on the contrary he felt energized stronger qwans spell is keeping me safe he thought its simple physics energy cannot be destroyed so hes converting it to another form magic it was a spectacular sight the bombs energy fuelled the magic inside the circle until the rolling orange flames were tamed by blue ones gradually the bombs power was consumed and transformed by sorcery the rings glowed with a blinding blue light and the figures inside the circle seemed to be composed from pure power they shimmered insubstantially as the reverse time spell took hold of them suddenly the blue rings pulsed injecting a shock wave of magic into the island itself transparency spread like water on the surface and below pulse followed pulse until the transparency spread beyond the crater to the demons in their village it must have seemed like the volcano was being eaten by the magic the nothingness spread with each pulse leaving only shimmering golden sparks where solid land was moments before the dematerialization reached the shore and beyond to the ten metres of ocean carried here with the island soon there was nothing left but the circle of magic floating blue in the red rippled space of limbo qwan reached out to them concentrate now artemis and holly take us home artemis squeezed hollys hand tightly this was as close as they could ever be their minds were one artemis turned and stared at his friend with blue eyes holly was staring back and she was smiling i remember she said aloud you saved me artemis smiled back it never happened he said and then their minds and bodies were split right down to subatomic level and whisked across galaxies and millennia space and time did not have any recognizable form it was not like flying in a balloon over a timeline and saying look theres the twentyfirst century take us down there everything was impressions and feelings artemis had to shut out the desires of the hundreds of demons around him and concentrate on his own internal compass his mind would feel a longing for its own natural time and he would just have to follow it the longing felt vaguely like a light warming his mind when he turned in its direction good thought qwan head towards the light is that a joke artemis asked no replied qwan i dont make jokes when there are hundreds of lives in the balance good policy thought artemis and turned towards the light holly was concentrating on where to land the island she was finding this incredibly easy she had always treasured her aboveground memories and now could call them up with amazing clarity she remembered a school tour to the site where hybras had been in her minds eye she could see the undulating beach gold and shining in the summer sunlight she could see the bluegrey glint on a dolphins back as it breached the waves to greet its fairy visitors she could see the silverflecked blackness of the water in what humans called saint georges channel the light of all these memories warmed her face good sent qwan move i know move towards the light artemis was trying to put this experience into words for his diary but he was finding it difficult a novel experience for him i think ill just concentrate on finding my own time he thought good idea thought qwan so you turned yourself into a statue that was qweffor again dying to catch up oh for heavens sake grumbled qwan see for yourself and he sent the relevant memories across to his old apprentice everyone in the tunnel was treated to a cinematic rendering of the initial creation of the time tunnel ten thousand years ago in their minds eye seven warlocks hovered above the very mouth of an active volcano protected from the heat by a magical circle this was an altogether more impressive affair than the improvised magic circle artemis had previously witnessed these warlocks were a confident impressive crowd swathed in elaborate robes their magical circle was actually a sphere of multicoloured light whats more they did not need to get their boots dirty in the ash they hovered seven metres above the volcano mouth chanting in deep bass tones they poured bolt after bolt of magic into the magma until it began bubbling and convulsing as the warlocks concentrated on inducing the volcano abbot and his partner bludwin crept out from behind a rocky outcrop further up and even though demon hides can endure great heat both were sweating profusely with barely a pause to realize how moronic and shortsighted their plan was the saboteurs leaped from the outcrop down towards the circle below bludwin who was blessed with the twin gifts of idiocy and misfortune missed every warlock in the circle and plunged flailing into the hissing lava his body slightly raised the temperature of the surface lava not significantly but enough to taint the spell abbot connected with qweffor dragging him out of the circle and to the lip of the volcano abbots hide immediately began steaming and poor qweffor still in a magical stupor was as helpless as a newborn under his weight all of this happened at the worst possible time the spell was loose in the volcano now and the warlocks could no more stop it than a mouse could hold back the sea a magically enhanced pillar of solid lava spewed red orange and magnificent from the volcano straight into the inverted cauldron of blue magic grimacing and in obvious distress the warlocks converted the molten rock into pure power pumping the energy back into the ground abbot and qweffor were caught simultaneously by the lava and the magical backwash qweffor already in an insubstantial magical state collapsed into a bodyshaped cluster of stars which were then absorbed into abbots body abbot twisted in agony tearing at his own skin for a brief moment then he was smothered in a deluge of magic and disappeared the warlocks maintained the spell for as long as they could until most of the island had been transported to another dimension but the lava kept coming from deep beneath the earth and with the circle broken they could not contain its savage might it swatted them aside like a bear would swat annoying insects the stricken warlocks spiralled through the air in a rough line smoke trailing behind them from their flaming robes their island was gone their magic was spent and the ocean below was ready to crush their bones there was only one chance for survival qwan called on his last sparks of magic and cast a gargoyle spell the most basic of all warlock talents in midair the warlocks were petrified and they fell in a tumbling line into the bubbling ocean far below one died instantly when his head snapped off two more lost arms and legs and shock killed the rest all except qwan who had known what was coming they sank to the bottom of saint georges channel where they would shelter generations of spider crabs for several thousand years for several thousand years thought qweffor maybe being stuck inside abbot wasnt so bad where is abbot now asked artemis hes inside me replied the apprentice trying to get out good thought qwan i want a word with him chapter point of impact this time the materialization was a painful process being separated from a thousand consciousnesses left artemis with a deep sense of loss for the first time in his life he had completely belonged he knew everyone and they knew him there would always be a bond between them all though the specifics of others memories were already fading artemis felt like an adhesive plaster that had been ripped off an enormous limb and flung on the ground he lay on the earth shivering sharing consciousness had felt so right that now it was as if he had just lost the use of several senses including balance he opened his eyes squinting through the sunlight sunlight they were on earth though where and when remained to be seen artemis rolled on to his stomach then struggled slowly to all fours the others lay in the crater disorientated like him but alive judging by the moans and groans he himself felt fine except for a darting pain in his left eye his vision was sharp but slightly yellowed as though he was wearing pale sunglasses holly the soldier was already on her feet coughing the ash from her lungs when her airways were clear she helped artemis to his feet she winked at artemis blue sky we did it artemis nodded perhapsthe wink drew his attention to her left eye it seemed as though they hadnt made it through the tunnel unaltered look at me holly do you notice anything different this isnt anything to do with puberty is it said holly smiling then she noticed your eyes theyve changed one blue and one hazel artemis smiled you too we swapped in transit just the eye as far as i can make out holly thought about this for a moment then ran her hands over her head and body everythings in place thank goodness except now i have a human eye it could have been a lot worse said artemis you could have been travelling with mulch holly winced now that you mention it a solitary blue dot of magic sparkled inside hollys new eyeball reducing it in size slightly thats better she sighed i had a blinder of a headache your new eye must be too small why dont you use your illgotten magic to fix it artemis tried closed his eyes and concentrated but nothing happened it seems as though the transplant did not take i must have used all i had in the tunnel holly punched his shoulder lightly maybe you passed it on to me i feel great that time tunnel was like a magical mud bath maybe its just as well that you lost your magic the last thing the people need is a magical criminal mastermind running around above ground a pity sighed artemis the possibilities were endless here said holly taking his head in her hands let me fix you up her fingertip glowed blue and artemis felt his new eye expand slightly in his socket a single tear ran down his cheek and the headache disappeared a pity i was unable to do it myself being magical for even a short while was simply magical artemis smiled exactly thank you holly holly smiled back its the least i can do for someone who brought me back to life qwan and no were on their feet the old warlock was trying not to look too smug and no was wiggling his tail experimentally you never know what that tunnel will do to you he explained i lost half a finger last time it was my favourite finger too rarely in my tunnels said qwan my tunnels are works of beauty if the other warlocks were alive they would give me a medal where is qweffor by the way qweffor was buried up to his waist in an ash mound head down qwan and no hauled him out by the boots he lay spluttering and snorting on the ground do you need a handkerchief asked no all that ash and mucus coming out of your nose is horrible qweffor wiped his eyes with the back of his hand shut up runt no took a step backwards which would prove not to be quite enough runt he squeaked youre not qweffor youre nzall abbot roared the demon reaching up and grasping no by the throat the name is abbot holly had her gun out and powered up before abbot finished his sentence let him go abbot she shouted you cant escape theres nowhere to escape to your world is gone the expride leader was actually crying i know its gone this runt took it from me now i will take his life from him holly sent a warning shot over abbots head the next one is between your eyes demon abbot hefted no using him as a shield shoot now elf put us both out of our misery a change had come over no initially he had been snivelling standard no behaviour but now the tears were drying on his cheeks and his eyes were hard every time things are going right for me abbot ruins it he thought i am so fed up of this demon i wish he was gone this was a big breakthrough for no usually when he found himself in a bad situation no wished himself away this time he was wishing someone else would disappear enough was finally enough so no broke through a lifetime of conditioning and talked back to abbot i want to speak to qweffor he said in a trembling voice qweffors gone shouted abbot spraying spittle on nos neck all that is left is his magic my magic i want to speak to qweffor repeated his hostage with a little more volume for abbot this latest insubordination was the wind that burst the dwarfs bumflap even though he was bereft of land and lackeys abbot decided that he would not bear impudence from an imp he tossed no upwards spinning him in the air and gripping his shoulders as the imp descended no came down face to face with abbot the demons horns brushing his ears abbots eyes were wide and crazy and his teeth were slick with saliva youre not long for life little runt if abbot had been paying closer attention to his captive he might have noticed that nls eyes were filmed with blue and his markings glowed and shimmered but as usual abbot was only interested in his own plight no wriggled his hands upwards grabbing abbot by the horns how dare you said abbot incredulously touching a demons horns was tantamount to a challenge no stared into his captors eyes i said i want to talk to qweffor abbot heard him that time because the voice wasnt nos it was a voice of pure magic layered with undeniable power abbot blinked ill eh see if hes in it was too late for compliance no wasnt about to rein in his power now he sent a magical probe into abbots brain via the horns the horns glowed bright blue and then began shedding large brittle flakes careful with the horns said abbot blearily then his eyes rolled back in his head the ladies love the horns no rooted round in abbots head for a while until he found qweffor sleeping in a dark corner in a place scientists would call the limbic system the problem realized no is that there is only room in every head for one consciousness abbot needs to go somewhere else and so with this instinctive knowledge and absolutely no expertise no fed qweffors consciousness until it expanded occupying the entire brain it was not a perfect fit and poor qweffor would suffer from twitches and sudden loss of bowel control at public functions a syndrome which would become known as abbots revenge but at least he was in control of a body most of the time after several years and three hearings fairy warlocks would manage to rehouse abbots consciousness in a lower life form a guinea pig to be precise the guinea pigs own consciousness was soon subjugated by abbots warlock interns would often amuse themselves by throwing tiny swords into the pigs pen and crack up watching the little piggy trying to pick them up qweffor blinked abbots eyes thanks number one he said placing the smaller warlock on the ground hes always been too strong for me but now hes gone im free qweffor studied his new arms and i have muscles holly lowered her gun resting a hand on her thigh that must be it surely our troubles are over artemis felt the earth tilt a fraction below them he dropped to one knee laying the flat of his hands on the ground i hate to say this holly but i think were sinking the sinking thing turned out not to be as serious as it sounded of course it was serious after all an island was sinking but there was help at hand holly realized this when her barely functional wrist computer was suddenly flooded with crackling lep chatter the sky is a projection she thought theyre waiting for us suddenly where there had been nothing hundreds of fairy vehicles appeared in the air above the island emergency services air ambulances flew in decreasing circles searching for landing spots huge demolition platforms were guided down by tugpods and an lep shuttle dropped straight into the volcano the pod had the slick lines of a teardrop and a nonreflective surface that made it difficult to see even with the shield powered down they were expecting us said artemis unsurprised i thought as much no sneezed thank goodness i am so fed up of this volcano its going to take a month to get this crater stink out of my plates no no said qwan linking his new apprentice you can vent your pores magically its a very handy talent holly waved her arms to attract the shuttle though there was no need the carriers scanners would have already scanned categorized and checked the lep database for a match for each one of them the shuttle spun and reversed down to them tail first its jets blasted moving furrows in the ash wow said qwan those ships are fabulous the people have been busy a lot has happened in ten thousand years said holly holding up her palms to show the pilot she was not holding a weapon again probably not necessary but with ark sool in command of the lep nothing could be taken for granted four grappler hooks shot from the corners of the shuttle smashing through the crater crust into the rock below once they had a solid grip they reeled the craft in for a landing the rear door slid across and foaly came trotting down the ramp dressed in a customtailored fourlegged lep jumpsuit he skidded down the incline to holly digging his back hooves through the crust holly he said hugging her tightly you made it back i knew you would holly hugged the centaur back and i knew youd be here waiting foaly reached an arm round artemiss shoulders well when artemis fowl says hell be back you know its going to take a lot more than space and time to stop him foaly shook hands with no and qwan i see you brought quite a few guests holly smiled her teeth white against a face of streaked ash hundreds anyone we need to worry about no a few have been mesmerized but a couple of sessions in therapy should straighten that ok ill pass it on said the centaur now we have to cut the reunion short and board immediately we have thirty minutes to sink this island and pack up this entire facility facility thought artemis theyve had time to set up a facility just how long have we been away they climbed the ramp and strapped themselves into gelpadded bucket seats in the sparsely furnished rear there were no comforts here just seats and gun racks a medic fairy scanned them all in turn then shot a cocktail of inoculations and germ killers into their arms just in case hybras had brewed up any mutant diseases over the past ten thousand years a true professional the medic did not bat an eye examining qwan and no even though hed never met their like before foaly sat beside holly i cant tell you how good it feels to see you holly i requested this assignment im on leave from section eight this entire facility is my design biggest single project i ever worked on designed for a thirtyminute walkaway i knew youd make it back holly thought about that statement for a moment she was an assignment the shuttle reeled in the grippers and peeled away from the crater wall in seconds they breached the mouth like a bullet from a gun the vibration was enough to rattle teeth for the first few seconds then the stabilization fins snicked out the side and calmed the ride down i am glad to see the end of that volcano said no trying to appear casual even though he was flying around in a metal teardrop after all this was not his first flight foaly laid the heel of his hand on the porthole rim peering downwards you really are seeing the last of it as soon as we have everybody off the island those demolition rigs are going to turn the laser cutters on it were going to slice it up and then remotedeflate the buoys underneath let er down slow that way no tidal waves the water displacement alone was enough to send a few big rollers in towards dublin but we boiled em up from space once the island is down we can pack up the shield and go home oh said no who hadnt understood much of what had been said artemis looked out of the porthole at his elbow on the island below demons were being guided into shuttles by rescue teams once the crafts took off they switched on their shields and shimmered from view you gave us quite a scare holly laughed foaly coming back twenty miles off target like that we had to light a fire under our pilots to get over here and get the projection up luckily its early in the morning and the tide is low weve got about half an hour before the first fishing boats get out here i see said holly slowly big budget stuff sool must have been spitting fire foaly snorted sool he can spit what he wants out of whatever end he wants he got drummed out of the force a couple of years ago do you realize that traitor wanted to let the entire eighth family die off the moron actually said as much in a memo holly gripped the arms of her seat a couple of years ago how long have we been gone foaly snapped his fingers oh uh yeah i wasnt supposed to just blurt it out sorry i mean its not serious like a thousand years or anything how long foaly demanded holly the centaur thought about it for a moment ok youve been gone for nearly three years qwan reached over and slapped artemiss shoulder three years nice going mud boy you must have one hell of a brain to get us that close i wasnt expecting to see this side of the century artemis was stunned three years his parents hadnt seen him for three years what torture had he put them through how could he ever make up for it foaly was trying to fill the shocked silence with information mulch has kept the pi firm ticking over well more than that actually its thriving he signed up a new partneryoull never guess who doodah day another criminal turned dogooder wait till he hears youre back he calls me every day i have a pain in my tail trying to explain quantum physics to that dwarf holly reached across and took artemiss hand theres only one way to look at this artemis think of all the lives youve saved thats worth a few years surely artemis could only stare straight ahead dying in the transfer would have been a grade one disaster this was surely a grade two what could he say how could he explain himself i need to get home he said sounding for once like an actual fourteenyearold foaly would you tell the pilot where i live the centaur chuckled like every law enforcement agent under the world doesnt know where artemis fowl lives anyway no need to go that far someone is wailing for you on shore hes been there for quite a while artemis placed his forehead against the porthole he felt so tired suddenly as though he had actually been awake for three years how could he even begin to explain events to his parents he knew how they must be feeling exactly how he felt when his father had gone missing perhaps he had already been declared dead as his father had been and even though his return would bring happiness that pain would always be there underneath the surface foaly was talking to the demons whos this little guy he asked tickling no under the chin that little guy is number one said qwan hes the most powerful warlock on the planet he could fry your brain by accident say if you were tickling him under the chin and he got irritated the centaur withdrew his finger sharpish i see i like him were going to get along just fine why are you called number one is that a nickname no felt the magic inside him comfortable like heated veins it was my imp name but now i think ill keep it qwan was surprised what you dont want the qw name thats traditional we havent had a qwandri in a while what about qwerty no shook his head i am number one the name used to mark me out as different now it makes me unique i have no idea where we are or where were going but i already feel more at home than i ever have foaly rolled his eyes excuse me while i get a tissue honestly i thought you demons were warlike and stoic this little guy sounds like one of those cheap romance novels the little guy who could fry your brain qwan reminded him one of those cheap romance novels that i happen to adore said foaly backing away slowly no smiled contentedly he was alive and he had helped to save the island finally he knew his place in the universe now that abbot was taken care of he could live his life the way he wanted to and the first thing he would do when things had settled down would be to track down the demoness with the red markings very much like his own and see if maybe she would share a meal with him a cooked meal it could be that they had a lot to talk about the shuttle slipped through the shield into the morning sky the jagged rocks of the irish coast jutted out from waves sunspeckled by the early light it was going to be a fine day there were trace clouds to the north but nothing that could keep people inside for long there was a group of houses clustered around an inlet and in the horseshoe harbour fishermen were already on the sand setting up their nets this is your stop artemis said foaly well drop you behind the quay wall ill give you a call in a few days for debriefing the centaur reached out a hand laying it on artemiss shoulder the people thank you for your efforts but you know that everything you have learned is confidential not even your parents artemis youll have to think of something besides the truth to tell them of course said artemis good i didnt have to say it i know anyway the man you want is in the little cottage with the window boxes say hello from me artemis nodded numbly i will the pilot swung in low tucking the shuttle out of sight behind a deserted ramshackle stone building when he was certain that there was nobody in the sight lines the pilot hit a green light over the rear door holly helped artemis out of his chair we never get to hang out she said artemis half chuckled i know theres always a crisis if its not goblin gangs its timetravelling demons holly kissed him on the cheek that was probably dangerous you being a pubescent volcano ive got it under control just about holly pointed to her new blue eye well always be a part of each other now artemis tapped the cheek below his fairy hazel eye ill keep an eye out for you was that a joke my goodness you are changing artemis was a little dazed well apparently im almost eighteen god help us all artemis fowl eligible to vote artemis chuckled ive been voting for years he tapped his ringphone call you later i have a feeling well have a lot to talk about they hugged briefly but tightly then artemis walked down the ramp he took three steps and looked back but there was nothing there but sea and sky artemis fowl made for strange early morning viewing in the village of duncade a lone teenager in a tattered suit leaving a trail of ash behind him as he climbed through a stone stile and half stumbled along the quay front there was a small group ahead of him leaning on a concrete bollard one shaggily bearded fisherman was telling a wild story about a sixmetre wave he had seen during the night which had simply evaporated before it reached the shore he told the story well complete with big arm gestures and whooshing noises the other men nodded to his face while behind his back winking and making drinky drinky motions with their hands artemis ignored them walking further down the quay front to the cottage with window boxes window boxes who would have thought there was a keypad on the door it looked out of place in such a rustic setting but artemis would have expected no less he keyed in his own birthday zero one zero nine deactivating the lock and interior alarm it was dark inside curtains drawn lights off artemis stepped inside to a spartan living area with functional kitchen one chair and a sturdy wooden table there was no television but rudimentary shelves had been erected to store hundreds of books on various subjects as artemiss eyes adjusted to the gloom he could make out some of the titles gormenghast the art of war and gone with the wind being among them you are full of surprises old friend murmured artemis reaching out to touch the spine of moby dick as he traced the embossed title a small red dot of light appeared on his fingertip you know what that is said a low rumbling voice behind him if thunder could speak then this would be its voice artemis nodded this was no time for outbursts or sudden moves good then you know what happens if you do anything to upset me another nod excellent youre doing very well now lace your fingers behind your head and turn round artemis did as he was told and found himself facing a huge man with a full beard and long hair drawn back in a ponytail both were flecked with grey the mans face was familiar but different there were more lines round the eyes and a deep frown slash between them butler said artemis are you behind all that hair butler stepped back as though struck his eyes widened and he swallowed rapidly suddenly parched artemis is it youre the wrong age i always thought the time tunnel old friend explained artemis i saw you only yesterday butler was not yet convinced he moved quickly to the curtains and in his haste pulled them rail and all away from the wall the red light of sunrise flooded the small room butler turned to his young guest and took the boys face in his hands with massive thumbs he wiped the grime from round artemiss eyes what he saw in those eyes almost buckled his knees artemis it is you i had begun to think no no i knew you would come back and then again with more belief i knew it i always knew it the bodyguard wrapped artemis in arms strong enough to break a bears back artemis could have sworn he heard sobs but when butler released him he was his usual stoic self sorry about the beard and the hair artemis i was blending in with the natives how was your eh trip artemis felt the sting of tears in his own eyes um eventful if it hadnt been for holly we never would have made it butler studied artemiss face something is different my god your eyes oh yes i have one of hollys now its complicated butler nodded we can swap stories later there are calls to be made calls said artemis more than one butler plucked a cordless phone from its cradle there are your parents of course but i should call minerva too artemis was surprised pleasantly so minerva yes shes been over here several times almost every school holiday in fact weve become good friends shes the one who started me reading fiction i see butler pointed the phone aerial at artemis its artemis this and artemis that she has really built you up to be something special youre going to have to work hard not to disappoint her artemis swallowed he had been hoping for a break not more challenges of course shes grown up a bit even if you havent continued butler and quite the beauty sharp as a samurai sword too theres a young lady who could give you a run for your money at chess then again thought artemis nothing like a challenge to keep the brain active but that could come later my parents you just missed them they were here yesterday for the weekend they stay in the local guest house whenever they can butler laid a hand on artemiss shoulder these last few years its been terrible for them i told them everything artemis i had to do they believe you butler shrugged some days they do mostly my fairy stories just add to their pain they think ive been driven mad with guilt and even though youre back things will never be the same again it would take a miracle to erase my stories and their suffering artemis nodded slowly a miracle he lifted his hand on the palm there was a slight graze from his climb over the quayside stile artemis concentrated and five blue sparks of magic leaped from his fingertips and zeroed in on the graze wiping it out like a cloth wiping dirt he had more magic left than he had pretended maybe we can arrange a miracle butler was beyond further amazement thats a new trick he said laconically i picked up a little more than an eye in the time tunnel i see said butler just dont do it around the twins dont worry said artemis i wont then his brain computed what butler had actually said what twins butler punched in the fowl manor phone number smiling maybe time stood still for you big brother but it didnt for the rest of us artemis stumbled to the rooms only chair and sank into it big brother he thought and then twins yaer
