geoffrey jenkins a grue of ice the albatross foot drake passage i shook my head sailhardy was wrong the thin sharp stiletto of wind did not even ruffle the surface of the sea it was slight it was there though sailhardy unlashed the mainsails crude fastening his hands were as rough as the knotted wood of the whaleboats ribs the boom carrying the sail slatted untidily way dropped off the deep thirtyfoot craft she settled into her own reflection yellow to yellow blue to blue white to white the islanders garish sense of paint did nothing to conceal the sweet lines of the boat south shetlands i countered sailhardy didnt seem to hear me he crooked a knee into the starboard forward rowlock his action was unstudied but there was a pointers tenseness in it i found another lead sinker for my special net among the long oars on the gratings i knotted it lazily to a hundredfathom line coiled on the bottomboards sailhardys taut caution seemed out of place i suppose fishermen are fishermen the world over and my enjoyment in sending down my special nylon net to the depths of the ocean here on the fringes of the southern ice continent for tiny plankton seacreatures was as keen as it would have been in casting a fly six thousand miles away in scotland sailhardys lean shoulders shrugged under the faded redorange windbreaker his was the inborn alertness which made a man survive the seaenemy in these antarctic waters more pitiless than anywhere else in the world i was fishing and it lulled me out of feeling that i was a man with a mission let alone a scientist of the royal society of london no bruce he began i grinned at him as i dropped the heavy lead sinker over the side the use of my christian name still came a little hard off his tongue after all a lowerdeck man does not call his captain by his christian name not in the royal navy anyway for two long bitter years sailhardy had been my leading torpedoman aboard hms scott during the war my job as commander of his majestys south shetlands naval force based on deception island five hundred miles south of the southernmost tip of south america had been to guard the sea passage between the pacific ocean and the south atlanticthe drake passage it was the favourite route for germanarmed merchant raiders uboats and japanese submarines they chose it because its fogbound waters continually lashed by gales made it impossible to find a ship even if you were within five miles of it i knew the drake passage only too well the name sang in my mind like a gale through the futtock shrouds of an old clipper it was maybe fifteen years since i had last seen its wild waters from the bridge of my small destroyer but its screaming hellfiends of wind and ice still bit into my memory sailhardys tenseness this quiet sunny afternoon on the fringes of the wild ocean we had once guarded was a living memory too of the inborn seavigilance of a tristan islander man against the sea in these southern waters we both knew that the cards were stacked against the man i assumed my captains voice leading torpedoman sailhardy i couldnt help myself i grinned at him again his eyes were as far away as the horizon relax i said you look as if you were trying to see all the way to the south pole i wish i could he said then id know what sort of a gale is due to hit us i gestured towards the quiet scene the big island lay some miles astern of the boat and two smaller ones were visible above the horizon ahead they made a triangle with unequal sides roughly ten and twenty miles long the big island was closest to us nothing is going to hit us i said lazily nothing at all sailhardy glanced back at the big island his home as if to take strength from its sombre cliffs the watch never goes below on tristan da cunha he said with a curious intonation that is why we islanders have survived theres a great storm behind this little wind i too turned and looked at the nearby island a giant flock of cape pigeons made a white socket of light against its towering throne of darkness matching their whiteness a crown of snow rimmed the islands foot extinct volcano tristan da cunha the loneliest inhabited island in the world it lies with its two tiny neighbours whose summits i could just see ahead midway between africa and south america on a line between cape town and montevideo and an almost equal distance of two thousand miles from the nearest tip of the antarctic ice continent before and immediately after napoleons time tristan da cunha was an important base for british and american sealing ships making for the huntinggrounds of the frozen south its first three permanent settlers half a century before the civil war were in fact american sailors during napoleons exile on st helena miles to the northeast the british stationed a garrison on tristan and the remains of that garrison plus the americans formed the stock from which the islands present inhabitants have sprung for nearly a century and a half the island remained cut off from the world except for a rare visiting ship during the war i had brought to tristan from cape town a force of royal navy and south african air force men to man a radio station from tristan i had taken my small task force under hms scott two thousand miles to the south and had based in on deception island a flooded volcanic crater on the edge of the ice continent the two neighbours of tristan i could see ahead now were nightingale and inaccessible islands in every direction beyond them for thousands of square miles lay completely empty sea the cape pigeons in splendid white resilience made for the haven of tristan da cunha sailhardy unhooked the triangle of foresail forward of the mast as if to emphasise the danger he feared i could not take his forebodings seriously it was all too peaceful i was to learnsoonhow much of my icelore i had lost im a scientist i replied easily ive got a posh title to prove itholder of the royal societys travelling studentship in oceanography and limnology you do the sailing he caught my mood and grinned back i remember i was nearly sick with fright when you took me aboard hms scott from tristan during the war naval captains were god to me who ever told you to address me as professorcaptain that day i laughed one of the midshipmen he said he told me the captain had been a professor of science in peacetime before commanding the ship he grinned at his own discomfiture so you had to be professorcaptain i wasnt a professor i said never have been id merely made special studies in oceanography i was too young anyway to be a professor you were twentyseven then he said that makes you fortytwo now i remembered his hesitation a few minutes before about my christian name ill bet that the day you walked on to my bridge you never thought you would be calling me bruce i said bruce he paused a moment and then went on you would have remained captain wetherby to me all my life if it hadnt been for what you said that day you came back to tristan after the war thats twelve years ago now we tristan islanders live a hard life we live off the sea except for a couple of acres of potato patches and some apple trees and maybe a hundred cattle and sheep you had the world at your feet after the war youd had a brilliant wartime career and a brilliant university career before that i remember how you stepped off the freighter out in the roadstead mine was the first boat there i didnt know you were coming captain wetherby i said ill never forget your reply no sailhardy this is bruce captain wetherby went down with the raider ive come back to the things i want sailhardy tristan the southern ocean i played it lightly you forget i said i wanted your boat too i smiled he gave a low laugh tristans long isolation from the world has left the islanders a curious heritageeven today their speech is a strange mixture of english west country speech shot through with the twang of longdead new england whalermen drawn out and enduring as the west wind drift my boat he said that is to ask everything from a tristan islander we are the poorest people in the world a boat like this makes me one of the richest men on the island a boat you said you would need a boat to try and find one of the greatest sea mysteries sailhardy stowed the mainsail and his eye ran affectionately over the whaleboat with its six long oars lashed to the bottom gratings just as the viking longboats gave greenland the kayak the new bedford whalers left the secret of their fast seaworthy chasers to tristan and the islanders born and bred to the sea added to that knowledge until today the tristan whaleboat is as indigenous to the lonely island as a baldie to leith or a sixern to the shetlands there is almost no wood on tristan so the islanders make them of canvas the wood for the ribs as precious and as scarce as fine goldcomes from the stunted windlashed apple trees that cling for an existence under walls alongside the stone houses which are sunk half underground like hebridean crofters cottages to escape the gales i noticed that the forward portside strake of sailhardys boat was splintered it would remain so just because there was no timber to spare for repairs the boats are daubedone can hardly call it paintedin bright garish colours of yellow blue and white it is for a purely functional purpose to waterproof the canvas and they splash on whatever paint they can find or beg from the occasional ship the boats are the finest seagoing craft in the world i would go anywhere with a crew of ten tristan boatmen and a tristan whaleboat the boatmen have been apprenticed the hard way by the great seas and they have learned to bring in the whaleboats to tristans rough shingle beaches and rockstrewn cliffs in a way which even to my sailors eye is uncanny a hunk of kelp as thick as a mans body and perhaps twenty feet long drifted past we were about five miles from tristan which is ringed by a huge barrier of kelp inside that barrier the sea is tamed by the fronded fetters to a grey sullenness sea mystery in that moment i wished that the drifting length of kelp was the pointer to the mystery i had come thousands of miles to try and find rather than the minute plankton my special net was seeking hundreds of feet below the surface sailhardy seemed to anticipate my thoughts any luck he asked i shook my head the albatross foot it had a selling title one of the learned gentlemen of the royal society had said and he was right that strange almost mesmeric name was woven into the fabric of my war years with sailhardy with tristan da cunha little had i thought the day sailhardy had come aboard my destroyer in the tristan anchorage that he and the albatross foot were to become the star which i had followed actively downhorizon for a dozen years before that i had lived with the magic of the name for a further six science had never heard of the albatross foot nor had i despite my advanced researches before the war into oceanography sailhardy had told me it was the inmost secret of the tristan islanders they maintained it was a gigantic warm current which swept down in springnot every spring but at irregular intervalsbetween africa and south america bearing countless billions of the microscopic sea creatures called plankton which are the food of everything in the southern ocean from the smallest fish to the whale the islanders called it the albatross foot so sailhardy had said because the current resembled in macrocosm the warm double vein in an albatross foot with which the great bird hatches its eggs the only warm thing in an albatross nest in subzero temperatures is that lifegiving warm vein lifegiving it was said sailhardy in the truest sense because it brought in early summer the basic planktonlife for all other life to the frozen seas round tristan and by its warmth dispersed the ice drake passage repeated sailhardy theres a gale coming and its from the drake passage i smell it its not coming from the south shetlands at all his voice with its strange fascinating accent had a curious clarity of modula tion as if he had learned the trick of talking against a storm without having to raise his voice the flat calm was broken only by an occasional catspaw of wind does it matter i asked he looked at me sternly bruce he said youve been away from the southern ocean too long youve forgotten you came back to tristan that once after the waryou stayed a whole year until the next shipbut for the rest of the time youve been in cape town and london i laughed a man must live sailhardy even an oceanographer i came back to tristan after the war and spent every penny of my wartime gratuity trying to find the albatross foot you know how many days of that year did we spend at sea together you and i in this very boat he came over to the stern and unshipped the high clumsy tiller as if to reiterate his warning of an impending storm it wasnt long enough he said it took three years before the albatross foot came again you should have waited i want proof i said i want plankton i want eightyeight million plankton he pulled the battered navystyle cap back from the redbrown balaclava cap beneath and looked speculatively at me eightyeight million i grinned at him my special net will hold exactly one quart of seawater and one quart of seawater in the concentration i need to prove the albatross foot will contain eightyeight million of the little soandsos whenand if we ever do find them you shall see what a little beauty a plankton really is under the microscope its octagonal with a magnificent sixstarred centre the middle is round and is all fluted and grained like machined silver wire youd better hurry and get that net up he said he reached out and took the hard collar of my buttonedup anorak jacket and rubbed it against the cloth by my throat listen he said listen if it were dry youd hear it squeak that would mean your storm is from the south shetlands but it doesnt its wet it means its from the drake passage i could see it in his face he was willing the storma storm of which i could see not the slightest signto come he wanted to pit the whaleboat against a full gale in the southern ocean he looked to his right to the southwest first and then to his left to the southeast then he swung round and gazed at tristan itself dominated by the old snowcapped volcano and slightly masked by cloud like a miniature version of the famous table mountain tablecloth at cape town masthead he said so softly that i had to strain to hear tristan da cunha the masthead of the world i ran my eye over the lean figure i knew he was my own age but the attrition of wind sea and ice had weathered his face to an age anywhere between forty and sixty and a masthead must have a lookout i joked that is why i took you with me during the war what did i know of the southern ocean then i wanted a man with all the sealore of this ocean at his fingertips i was as scared as hell of losing my ships before i even got a sight of a raider i found my mansailhardy i nearly let you down the very first time we entered deception harbour he said quietly do you remember neptunes bellows i still get the heebiejeebies when i think of it i grinned thank god i brought you on the bridge neptunes bellows is just about right said sailhardy the way the wind rips through the gap it caught old hms scotts bows i filled in dear heaven the way her bows whipped in towards those rocks i could still see the way sailhardy had taken hold of the situation as the flagship teetered on the edge of destruction in the narrow gap which leads into the deeper anchoragethe flooded volcanic craterbeyond it was that afternoon i said slowly that you told me about the albatross foot deception harbour had been full of bergy bits of ice they had come in crabwise through neptunes bellows and started to freeze together in the inner anchorage it seemed quite clear to me what would happen my small force was about to be frozen solid in the harbour as i had seen it it would have remained bottled up there for the next six months unable to move while the uboats and raiders sneaked past in the drake passage destroyers and frigates are not sturdy ships like whale catchers the ice would have damaged them severely there were no installations or dockyards to repair them as the harbour started to freeze i had climbed the cliff entrance and had been appalled at the gigantic phalanx of solid ice moving through the strait between deception and the mainland some of it was turning aside from the main body into deception harbour if enough didit would have meant death to my whole task force sailhardy had stood with me gazing at the fantastic sight the albatross foot he had exclaimed softly the warm current was sweeping past tristan as we left the other day it will be here in a day or two it will cut that ice up like a hot knife through butter it did i watched in amazement as sailhardys strange story of the warm lifebringing current came true the great moving battalions of ice and even the landfast ice on the mainland wilted before the attack of the albatross foot in a world where everything was frozen the albatross foot was the only warm thing i blessed the day i had brought the islander with me my squadron was saved during the next two years sailhardy told me many things about the strange current of tristan da cunhacompletely fascinating to an oceanographer like myself but it was war and we had workgrim workto do and there was not time or opportunity to carry out even the preliminaries to the study i wished to make of the albatross foot after the squadron had been saved sailhardy had enjoyed a privileged position on the bridge of hms scott i dont think jimmy the one ever got used to my being on the bridge smiled sailhardy as if reading my thoughts regular royal navy i said the form old boy everything according to tradition even the admiral at the cape never got used to me a mere volunteer sailor being given a strategic command i was in the same category as yourself not a hundred per cent a weekend sailor an upstart an islander and a cambridge scientistit was just too much for some of the old school of regulars to stomach yes exclaimed sailhardy hotly their goddamned prejudice jimmy the one asked me once what does your captainyou were always my captainknow of running a ship the regular way i hadnt heard this one and what did you say i asked i said replied sailhardy vehemently the wetherbys have explored and been in these waters for a century or more hes a wetherby and a sailor first and a scientist at cambridge second the wetherbys goddamned ships were the first to discover the antarctic mainland and a wetherby ship anchored in deception harbour itself while napoleon was alive i grinned what did jimmy the one say to that sailhardy gave his low laugh he said if you ever use the expression goddamned on my bridge again ill put you on a charge sailhardy was sitting on the rough thwart he seemed to have forgotten his fears about a storm the whaleboat rolled easily in the slight swell at least the admiral made a hell of a fuss of your being purely a volunteer reserve man when he dished out the dso after you sank the german raider sailhardys words dissolved my holiday feeling maybe it was the memory of the meteors deadly inch salvos bracketing my small ship as i went in with torpedoes my guns were useless against the raiders they had neither the range nor the calibre to match hers sailhardy i said incisively as you know ive been back on tristan for only a couple of days weve scarcely seen each other until now what with my having to make social calls to almost every home on the island and the weatherstation men into the bargain foot i looked hard at him i believe there is another albatross you believewhat he asked incredulously listen i said during the war you and i went over every shred of evidence every accompanying phenomenon from whales to weather about the albatross foot the tristan one what do you meanthe tristan one he asked the albatross foot belongs to tristan it is tristan we sank the german raider near bouvet island i replied from tristan that is about two thousand miles bouvet if ever sailhardys wartime words to my first lieutenant about the wetherbys held true it was in regard to bouvet island sixteen hundred miles south of cape town towards the south pole and slightly to the east of the greenwich meridian lies an island it is about five miles long and slightly over four across it is the only point of land between cape town and the ice continent there are no other islands no other land bouvet rivalling tristans claim to be the loneliest inhabited island in the world is the loneliest uninhabited island men have not succeeded in landing more than half a dozen times on bouvet it lies deeper into the heart of the roaring forties than ordinary ships ever go even the daring clipper captains of the past would seldom venture into such high galelashed icestrewn latitudes a wetherby ship had been there before napoleon died on st helena i had seen bouvet once from the deck of a fighting ship in action the waters of bouvet had brought me glory in sinking the meteor one of the wars deadliest armed raiders bouvet i said slowly to sailhardy wed cleared hms scott for action i was on the bridge of course you couldnt see what i could the meteor was getting our rangequick she was good that raider kohlers gunnery officer was in a class by himself from the bridge we could just see bouvet in sight behind the raider every eye was on her i took one last look round before opening fire wed dodged round a big icefield to the south we all heard meteors guns open up it wasnt guns sailhardy in time meteor s guns were way ahead of the fall of shot sailhardy stared what are you saying bruce it was the thunder of ice breaking up i replied not guns everyone aboard hms scott was so intent on the raider that they didnt notice the time lag i did i also saw you saw what bruce i saw a great spurt of fragments as the ice started to break up like the day it broke up in deception harbour the day you told me about the albatross foot then why i shrugged who would believe a story like that strain of going into action they say putting my hobbyhorse to the front i couldnt prove it any more than i can prove the presence of the albatross foot round tristan i couldnt even suggest it scientifically that is not until a year ago what do you mean he breathed you know my story i said briefly when the war was done i brought hms scott back to tristan to take home the radio station men i was demobbed i did everything to get back to tristan the first freighter back was two years later i was aboard you know i spent that year with you searching for the albatross foot i spent every penny i had you know the resultnil i went back to the scott polar research institute at cambridge three years ago they sent me to south africa to act as liaison officer to the expeditions going south a shore job but at least there was no land between me and the antarctic sailhardy grinned except bouvet except bouvet i used to listen endlessly to the radio talk of the whalers down south then a year ago a short message from a norwegian catcher to her factory ship told me what i wanted to hear what did she say he asked her name was kos i said she was about two hundred miles south of bouvet she said i have never seen anything like this the ice is breaking up as far as the eye can see its exploding before our eyes i had waited all the years since the meteor sank for something like that sailhardy did the factory ship realise its significance sailhardy asked excitedly i thought it wise to suppress her reply to the skipper of kos when i flew back to london to try and persuade the royal society to give me the chance of investigating the albatross foot i said wryly what did she say finsen said the factory ship if you dont lay off the bloody booze before breakfast ill give you a shore job cutting up whales guts i replied he grinned the royal society wouldnt have cared for that it was difficult enough to persuade them that there was any substance in the story of the albatross foot it took a hell of a lot of talk this scholarship runs for one year and its not worth muchonly a thousand pounds i ve already lost two and a half months getting to tristan i was just plain lucky that the south africans were sending out a relief ship to the radio station but bouvet sailhardy demanded i shrugged but bouvet i echoed they wouldnt hear of it no ships go there it would have meant a special charter a special expedition neither the royal society nor myself could raise tens of thousands of pounds for anything on that scale no sailhardy even if i prove the tristan prong of the albatross foot i cant ever hope to prove the bouvet one you could try and collect reports from the catchers far south he began rather helplessly you can imagine the reaction of tough catcher captains cant you i said it isnt practical my theory is simple two great warm currents strike down towards bouvet one from the atlantic side and the other from the indian ocean side of africa and link up in the neighbourhood of bouvet the atlantic one is ours here at tristan thats the theory anyway the combined warm currents then break open the packice which forms in winter between bouvet and the antarctic mainland it not only breaks it upit clears the sea for four hundred and fifty miles it is in fact the whole mechanism which holds the antarctic ice at bay it is as important to south america south africa and australia as the gulf stream is to the united states its the most exciting thing that happens in the worlds oceans the most dramatic it is completely unknown i tugged at the line to my net a hell of a lot depends on this one little net otherwise it is likely to remain completely unknown i started to haul in the deeplevel net it came up something kicked feebly it must have been a fish because it came out of the sea it had a peculiar flat head and a protruding beak the etiolated tail looked as if it had been put through a mangle the underlying colour was lead but near the surface the skin was a phosphorescent shocking pink the eyes my exclamation brought sailhardy over the fishs eyes pointed in one direction onlyupwards it was horrible it gazed as if in supplication it was about eighteen inches long i held it at arms length and i saw that the eyes were fixed to look permanently upwards sailhardy stopped me from throwing it overboard he took it and held it affectionately the upturned dying eyes winced in the sun this is it bruce he said quietly the thing writhed in his grip this is an abyssal fish he went on it comes from the deeps he looks upto see his food above him he lives only on plankton plankton i exclaimed there wasnt a sign of plankton he went as taut as a jib sheet in a blow his eyes were on something near the kelp barrier of tristan longfin he said with satisfaction longfin and bluefin there was nothing in sight except tristan which seemed hazier clouds were starting to lock round the old volcano what is it man i exclaimed tunny he replied tunny there was a momentary flash from the surface of the sea near the kelp barrier that was the forward fin of a tunny he said crisply his aft dorsal fin stays erect but the forward one he can fold and unfold at will he does so when he wants to make a quick turn he shoots it upright for a moment and swings round hard on it the tunny wouldnt be doing it unless they were feedingand feeding hard that means the albatross foot i said my god sailhardy here it comes he said excitedly look bruce look at the seals theyre grabbing the tunny it was more dramatic than i had ever imagined it to be as the warm current swept round the southern point of tristan the sea boiled with the commotion as the seals fought the longfin sailhardy looked wistfully at the staccato glints if we had some japanese longlines wed be able to bring them up from as deep as seventy fathoms he said i still want eightyeight million plankton in my net i grinned you wont have to wait long he replied maybe half an hour theres no hurry it will go on like this for weeks weeks when i was twelve he said we nearly all died of starvation on tristan you know how it iswithout fish we couldnt live the kelp got some sort of disease and the crawfish disappeared the islanders rely on the inshore crawfish and deepwater blue fish as a perennial source of food with seabirds eggs and mollymawk chicks it is their main diet i could imagine the weekbyweek cutting of their starvation rations we stuck it for a year sailhardy went on then it camethe albatross foot i was so weak i could scarcely pull an oar we hauled in some of the biggest bluefin that day i have ever seensome of them up to two hundred and fifty pounds we were standing with our backs to the west watching the current and its creatures sweep towards us it hit us then sailhardys guard was down the southern ocean waits for that in a man we had overlooked the unsleeping menace thank god sailhardy had untied the mainsail halliard from the boats ribs the force of the wind seemed to pick up the light craft and toss it bodily sideways against the unyielding sea i started to shout a warning sailhardy never heard i swung to face ita searing breathrobbing mask of spindrift salt and foam choked me something scaly hit me it could have been a dead bird or fish i spat out its briny clamminess tristan vanished i could not see sailhardy the wind reached inside my windbreaker i fought against being lifted i tried to fall down but the wind held me upright like a man falling free in space i hooked one foot under the tiller the boat seemed to lift with me i was torn loose as i went over the side a noose and bowline slid over my chest i found myself dragged against the daubed canvas side of the boat i still couldnt see sailhardy he was crouched away from the wind under the bulwarks i grabbed the gunwale sailhardys arm reached over and held me a jerk and the bowline was a steel band round my chest then i was gasping on the gratings sailhardy knelt beside me an inch of water sloshed in the bottom of the boat it was useless trying to speak even to shout in the brief time it had taken him to get me aboard his oceanbred survival instincts were at work the same titanic challenge of the storm had been thrown at the men of new england when they had broken open the ice continent in their clumsy stinking new bedford sealers a century and a half ago on their way they had rested at tristan and sired seachasteners like sailhardy he fought the wild object which i identified as the mainsail i saw the sweat break out on his forehead as he held the bucking thing he half knelt his arm about it the animated fabric jumped and thrust to break his iron hold i lay and retched salt water the splintered strake worked along the cracks i was numb with shock and the tumult i saw what was frustrating sailhardy and tilting our lives in the balance the mainsail halliards ran through holes bored through the mast one had snarled up and the islander could not get at it i edged along the gratings and got my fingers to it it whipped free in a moment sailhardy had the sail captive and lashed a bight of rope round it the boat lay over on its port side the sea poured in sailhardy gestured me to bale i snatched up a homemade pottery bowl containing our mealthe cooked mollymawk chicks floated pathetically in the rising waters i baled frantically then as if stunned by its own disbursement of force the gale cut off were right behind the line of inaccessible island and it s making a kind of huge slipstream said sailhardy the normal modulation of his speech was doubly startling in the quiet in a moment well catch it again get the water out of her for the sake of all that is holy although it was still light where we were it was dark half a mile away we soared sickeningly and fell into the troughs of the swell sailhardy looked grave we must run for nightingale island he said inaccessible is right into the teeth of the storm and weve been blown too far ever to hope to regain tristan again what if we miss nightingale i said the light was brindled by flowing spume ahead if we keep afloat we could be blown for a thousand miles before the gale eases he replied theres five gallons of water and a few mollymawk chicks to eat he looked sombre if i miss the beach at nightingale im going to spill her over and drown us both its better that way from my knees as i baled i looked up into the lean face i knew he meant it reef that foresail right down he said tersely we may be lucky and get another lull thats the way they come from the drake passage the rag of sail slatted in the trough of each wave and parachuted at the crest the slipstream ended the gale hit us again like a piston how sailhardy steered in that wild vociferation of untrammelled force i do not know the boat arced towards the sky in wild genuflexions i held on to the mast and tried to manage the fragment of sail which kept her upright i knew then why sailors speak with a special note in their voices about a tristan whaleboat she was superb even in my fear i felt some of sailhardys exhilaration at the storms challenge under his hands the frightened composition of wood and canvas wheeled up to the top of each comber and then in the welter at the top sailhardy held her as she shied and started to break away the descent was terrifying sailhardy threw an arm forward pointing there a sinister tower ringing death from the tocsin which clanged round its black cliffs was nightingale island white gouts burst from its cliffs like signal guns as the water climbed in aweprovoking slow motion up the black granite behind a barrier of kelp and seabamboo was the beach the boat swung heavenwards sailhardy wrenched one arm from the tiller and threw it across his eyes something black hit him the boat out of control started a toboggan run down the wave sailhardy regained control i was crawling to his assistance but stopped short the bird was shiny black with fiery bloodshot eyes it looked like something conjured up by a sick mind to match the contortion of nature about us i gazed unbelievingly there was something wrong it had no wings sailhardy was shouting and grinning there was a ragged hole in his mouth where a tooth had been knocked out island cock he yelled luck its as old as the d o d o t h e w i n d b l e w i t c l e a n o f f t h e i s l a n d l u c k y lucky lucky we would need every bit of luck i thought grimly looking around the birds oversize talons gripped the gratings the flightless rail the bird that cant fly and lives in burrows in the ground its in the same category as the new zealand kiwi i had no interest in ornithological curiosities at that moment sailhardy began his run in for the beach at the base of a thousandfoot cliff i could see the offwhite streak of broken shingle which passes by the name of beach in these waters he shouted and i shifted the rag of sail the whaleboat slewed to port there was more drift on her now sailhardy fought to keep her head up into the gale water poured over the side i baled the pitchblack bird moved his grip and glared unwinkingly at me with his drunks eyes sailhardy shouted something and indicated the sail the wind blew his words away but i knew what he meant either he had funked it or there was some danger i was not aware of he intended to go about i flicked the sail free the whaleboat began her next sickening plunge then it was quiet on every hand was the evidence of the gales dissoluteness from the low level of the boat the sea was a terrifying sight suds and spume lay six inches deep on the jerking surface of the water nightingale island soared appeared and disappeared as the waves obstructed our view it was quiet i heard the aircraft engine overhead the whalespotter the engine coughed the sound was as incongruous as the presence of the hovering helicopter tristan is too remote from the world ever to have seen an aircraft the south african air force men i took to the island during the war were not fliers but radio personnel helicopter i exclaimed where the hell it comes from though i wouldnt know sailhardys strong hands were on the tiller he guided the boat through the next crest before replying the main body of the storm isnt here yet he said if it was that helicopter would be blown from here to bouvet the black machine its fat belly emphasised by orange paint came closer the colours gave it away black and red seen easiest against the ice she was intended to operate over ice shes a whalespotter i said sailhardy jerked his head upwards id say it was fairly calm still at five thousand feet wont be for long though thats a damn brave pilot i said i wouldnt care to fly in this lot even if it is clearer farther up the helicopter manoeuvred it was clear it had not seen the whaleboat shes searching i said puzzled it cant be for whales no factoryship skipper would fly off an aircraft in weather like this sailhardy was anxious any moment the storm will hit us then i dont give a fig for our chances or the helicopters the machines movement became decisive she started to drop towards the whaleboat the pilot had seen us it couldnt be searching for us i started to say there were no ships at tristan when we left the anchorage this morning sailhardy reached out and scratched the head of the strange bird whatever that aircraft is about this chick certainly brought us luck he smiled we havent been rescued yet i said look at the sea its one thing to have a helicopter overhead and another to pull you up from a swell like this he nodded were rising and falling forty feet at a time he said i reckon it cant be done as if to refute him the machine came down with a rush directly over our heads its rotors drowned speech from a winch on its side a rope snaked down the pilots judgement was superb the rope was about three feet above the boat but slightly to one side before i had time to grab it we nosedived into the trough the helicopter waited we shot upwards with the next sea my heart was in my mouth i thought the sea would touch the westland i saw the pilot behind perspex there was a rapid movement of the controls the machine edged out of reach the pilot waited his moment so did sailhardy the whaleboat rose the line snaked again it hit one of the thwarts with a thump i grabbed missed and something rushed past me a flutter was all i was aware of sailhardy burst out laughing up our lifeline was clambering foot over foot the island cock with remarkable speed he reached the helicopter window and dived in the westland was snatched away by a gust of wind it missed us by about fifty yards on the next run sailhardy watched the southwest with growing concern it hopeless he shouted as the machine roared overhead again he w a s w r o n g t h e p i l o t w a s rea l l y g o o d t h e l i n e clatter aboard i snatched it but sailhardy knocked my hand away the boat yawed wildly what the hell i began it l l tear you i n hal f i f you even manage to get i t around you he replied the jerk as it lifts will be too much before they get you aboard youll be dead its our only chance i retorted heatedly we cant make the beach the machine came right down low this time without making any attempt to drop a line a man with a megaphone shouted at us dont you want to be rescued i left it to sailhardy his galecheating modulation would be audible too risky he yelled cut a man in half the helicopter rose steeply as if in disgust at the top of a wave sailhardy took a sweeping glance at the southwest he pointed the boats nose at nightingale its coming up quickly he said the beach is our only chance get that sail upquick as the whaleboat gathered way the helicopter dropped right down over us the window opened again get that mast down shouted the voice it sounded slightly foreign cooperate were taking the whole boat for a buggyride i knocked out the wooden wedge holding the mast and thrust it under the thwart to me anything seemed better than the break for the beach sailhardy shrugged this time a second rope dropped from the rear cabin window in addition to the one from the winch i saw what was intended the two ropes would have to be secured within seconds as the craft of the air and the craft of the sea came togetherif their respective pilots could achieve that hairsbreadth synchronisation sailhardys lean brown hands on the tiller seemed to move almost in advance of his eyes which searched for an easier patch a less broken wavetop we rose the helicopter hovered at an angle to our drift at the very top of the crest his hands tugged at the worn tiller ropes and laid the boat beamon she hung uncertainly and he held her there she did not take the next plunge which would have torn us from the rescuers the pilots reaction was equally swift he dropped to within fifteen feet one rope fell aft and the other forward of the mast i whipped mine round the metal skid of the foresail with a running knot i couldnt see what sailhardy was about but if he did not succeed the whaleboat would be upended at the next lift by the very rope i had secured and both of us would be emptied into the water the bow started to lift sailhardys reaction times were incredible in the few brief seconds the rope had lain within his reach he had slipped it round the odd tiller plank which projects athwartships on all tristan whaleboats the wave dropped away there was no sickening plunge as before the boat was airborne the pilot lifted the helicopter gently the weight of the suspended whaleboat seemed to steady it like a bee carrying a pebble pulled level with the bow the pilot was working his winches with the same nicety of judgement he had shown in the rescue the boat was drawn towards the aluminium belly within a couple of feet the winches stopped and a window opened we climbed through a hand steadied me through the entrance the interior was in maroon quilting dark as the storm in the southwest welcome aboard herr kapitan said the man i should have remembered the cocksureness and the slight sneer of the germanic gutturals his hair was blond and overlong the steadying grip toothat wasnt learned anywhere except in bringing a man over the sidethe side of a ship not an aircraft thank you i said it was a magnificent piece of rescue work he shrugged and nodded forward to the cockpit not me to thank he said up there i parted the quilting and stood behind the pilots seat tiny beads of sweat lay on the leather shoulders of the flying suit the pilot did not look round the island cock was perched on the compass mounting gripping it with its oversize talons i saw a pair of eyes in the rearview mirror above the birds perch they were a womans eyes women simply dont exist in the southern ocean they have been known like black icebergs there are it is true womens names in antarcticamarie byrd land edith ronne land sabrina coast but the women were not there they were at home i could not credit what i saw i stepped forward the thanks dying on my lips in surprise i looked look at her the face framed by the black leather helmet and its intercom wires the eyes were the strangest and the most beautiful i had ever seen they were the colour of the sea i thought later i knew they were not like the south african flower which ha g no colour in itself but takes its turquoise from the refraction of white light within its own heart so hers reflected what she was seeingthe sea and the angry storm the pupils were like the central spot of that same strange flower almost greenblack by virtue of some other intriguing juxtaposition of fabric and light please take that bird off the compass she said be flying on instruments alone in a moment the modulation in sailhardys voice was an acquired control i felt the same about hers why i could not guess i gripped a metal stay with one hand and prised the bird off the compass she looked past me weighing up the storm i was at a complete loss this bird is terribly lucky i started to say there is no such thing she replied judgment is everything to pick us up like thatyour judgment was spoton i said her eyes looked at the sea and through them the sea looked back at me there was no warmth in them so was your boatmans she replied sailhardy and i are most grateful sailhardy she said what a name you can practically smell tar in the rigging sailhardy balanced himself with his sailors grace in the small cabin she turned to him you know these waters well i do maam he replied what are our chances against that lot the islander shrugged it dependson you maam carl she called he came through to the cockpit whats it like back there in the anchorage what does the factory ship say starting to roll like a drunken fiddlers bitch thats what i thought she said she jerked her head towards me captain wetherby carl pirow radio operator oh and sailhardy boatman her staccato offhand manner grated on me were now all known to one anotherexcept one said helen upton she said as if it were no more important than the piece of metal she held in her hand whalespotter she craned forward what is that over thereabout two hundred and seventy degrees inaccessible island yes maam replied sailhardy thank you sailhardy she said she looked at him for the first time sailhardywhat obviously the royal navy wants formal introductions thats all maam he replied just sailhardy you must have a surname she said sailhardyno more replied the islander she shrugged its enough i suppose his eyes shifted embarrassed away from hers to the horizon he stiffened ship he exclaimed he screwed up his eyes a small one maybe a catcher your eyes are as good as your boatmanship she said thats praise indeed from helen upton i thought she was as impersonal as the instruments around her it must be one of them making for the rendezvous said pirow see if you can get her on the blower carl she said ask where the others are to me the horizon was blank i dont see a thing i said she pulled my arm and pointed her heavy woollen sweater did not smell bitter of sheep grease like a mans but there was that curious shutoff mustiness which all garments acquire in the south the setting sun dyed the onrushing banks of cloud against them inaccessible island took on an even more sinister air its flat black silhouette seemed to cower away from the coming onslaught by contrast nightingales cliffs were splashed with great patches of early summer pelargoniums incongruously bright in the last light i saw no ship then i caught what might have been the flash of a tunnys dorsal finor a catcher it could be i said dubiously come come captain wetherby she said she might have said it the same way if one of the rotors had failed her are you as sceptical about your oceanic discoveries captain wetherby herr kapitan oceanic discoveries she knew who i was and she must have an idea of what i was doing off tristan my sarcasm bounced off her impersonal air but it left me vaguely uneasy about how much she knew im an expert on waterfleas i said is that oceanography or limnology she asked bruce wetherby exroyal navy holder of the royal societys travelling studentship in oceanology and limnology what was a whalespotter doing out in weather like this searching for someone whose interest was as abstruse as mine limnology i replied taken aback waterfleas mean water is getting old you never find them in young water oceanwise too there are waterfleas it means seas are old she started to shrug it off as her left shoulder lifted and she moved slightly in her seat a flicker of pain passed across her face her voice was toneless youre wasting your time in the southern ocean then its old already the americans say its a hundred million years old rain drummed on the perspex like a spanish dancers heels her hand on the controls seemed to have the same economy of motion as sailhardys on the tiller ropes carl she said quickly get aft and lash that whaleboat securely you too captain wetherby winch it right up so its as high as it will go she turned incisively to sailhardy how deep is that boat of yours i dont want it hanging below the undercart as i come in to land four feetand some maybe five he replied might make it she said as if it didnt really matter if it comes to the worst ill dump it no maam sailhardy burst out not my boat she put on the instrument lights and ran her eyes over them carefully she flicked a sharp glance at him she had heard the protest in his voice right then ill try and land with that damn great thing hampering me therell be a heaving deck and youve heard that the factory ship is rolling heavily it wont be childs play i hesitated before going to the winches the whaleboat seemed scarcely worth it even if was everything in the way of riches that sailhardy had its a captains decision i said to her if its going to mean four peoples lives then jettison it the eyes seemed as uninviting as the cold sea i am the captain she said curtly my decision has been made i land with sailhardys boat lashed to the machine i started to reply she overrode it carlget aft and lash the boat this isnt a warships bridge captain wetherby and i cant force you to help but it does lessen the risk if you do thank you maam said sailhardy softly she would be his friend for life miss upton i said i have every faith in your ability after the way you rescued us then get aft and do what i ask she snapped carl she turned away as if i had been so much supercargo when you have done tell my father i have wetherby in one piece uninjured ask him if i should try and find the other catchers and bring them in to the rendezvous i dont know who your father is or what he wants with me i said angrily tell him i have wetherby she banked sharply and cut my words short ask him yourself she said he sent me to find you and find you i did my job is done when i deliver you to him aboard the antarctica pirow said as if it were remarkable not to know sir frederick upton is the biggest whaling man in the business you must have heard of him i havent i replied and i cant imagine why he should want to send his daughter out in one hell of a storm to bring in someone who was doing nothing more than look for plankton i almost missed her aside waterfleas maam said sailhardy the storm will last for days you must get back to your base now as hard as you can she seemed disposed to listen to him even if i located every catcher of the five theres not much i could do to bring them to the anchorage she pondered tell my father carl ill be coming straight back ask him to have captain bjerko hold the factory ship as steady as he can in the anchorage i went aft with pirow the whaleboat was swinging from the two ropes and bumping against the fuselage we drew the boat up as far as we could it did not lie under the belly of the machine as the winches were higher up than the level of the landing wheels i thought of the heaving deck of the factory ship anchored in tristans open roadstead and shuddered it would need all helen uptons skill to land as i saw it she would have to come in keeping the starboard side the side opposite the boat lower than the port side so as not to smash the keel against the deck at the same time she would have to hold the tail high and keep it so i looped a length of rope round one of the rough thwarts and pulled the boat hard against the side of the machine pirow did the same the boats destiny had now become one with the helicopterand ours pirow went to the radio i preferred to stay with him rather than go up forward into the unfriendly cockpit whatever sir frederick upton wanted he had scarcely sent her on a social mission i stood in the maroonquilted cabin at a loss something gnawed at my subconscious pirow was talking to the catchers i listened with half an ear an ear grown weary over the years at cape town of the endless radio chatter of the ships far south what was it repeat said one of the catchers pirow was calling repeat again repeat his transmitting was excellent if my mind had not been on the girl and the risk she was running maybe i would have noticed my subconscious told me that something was offbeat why did the catcher keep asking him to repeat i parted the quilting into the cockpit helen upton was talking to sailhardy while she held the bucking machine with a light snaffle my undefined uneasiness about pirows signalling prickled my curiosity about the girl also what had made her become a whalespotter in the first place even the russian ships down south never use women pilots it is the hardest life requiring a high degree of observation and skill plus long hours of accurate searching she had risked her life apparently at her fathers instruction to find sailhardy and myself why i reckoned a factory ship must cost a day to run and to come to tristan far away from the whaling grounds meant that sir frederick must really have burned money apparently in order to find me why hardhearted whaling tycoons are not that interested in plankton keep well out as you come round the point before the roadstead sailhardy was telling her a sudden gust might throw us against the cliffs she altered course slightly and edged into the teeth of the wind the island cock was back on his perch but no longer masking the compass from her view the van of the storm swathed the volcanic peak of tristan the islands water supply is born in the old crater which strangely never freezes even in the hardest weather under the machines belly i could see the great fields of kelp in the sea stretching out tentacles like a mightmare octopus in the dying light to the east sea and sky melted into a glory of turquoise in the west the great battalions of cloud came racing up we pulled clear of the headland by tristans anchorage a waterfall made a steel scar down the cliffside starboard forty helen upton asked sailhardy sixty he said every bit of sixty the cliff will gi completely blank out the sun in a minute turn sixty degrees she smiled wryly the first time i had seen any animation of her face i didnt need to be told flying was her whole life landing on instruments aye replied sailhardy aye maam the sun went as we wheeled round herald point into falmouth bay the anchorage helen upton clicked on the machines spotlight and swung in a broad circle round the ridge as if in reply floodlights splashed the factory ships deck she was bigevery bit of tons i could not imagine how we could land among the steel wires which held up the double funnel aft and the cumbersome masts the deck seemed a conglomeration of valves and bollards with almost no clear space pipes as thick as a mans thigh crisscrossed the deck forward of the bridge among them were huge steel boxes surmounted by matching butterfly nuts i could not guess what they were for carl she said rapidly into the intercom tell captain bjerko i cant see with all those lightstheyre blinding me say im coming in from the stern when im fifty yards away put out the lights ill come in on the spot alone after that sailhardys knuckles were tightly clenched round the cabin stay bring her into the lee of the ship maam he urged she looked at him swiftly and nodded she started a wide circle past the bows antarctica had steam up the two high stacks port and starboard belched smoke higher even than they were two ventilators we lost height as we came into the vessels lee then everything went black the stacks were putting up a smokescreen equal to a destroyers luff maam urged sailhardy helen upton laughedand the laugh sounded as if it had not been used for a long time sailor she exclaimed i cant lull an aircraft but her hands were already busy at the controls we followed the smoke downwind and then pulled clear she made a new approach to the factory ship the machine neared the stern the slipway grating through which whales are hauled was picked up by the bright floodlights it looked as ominous as traitors gate at the tower of london i felt my breath draw in as we came in low the lights cut the helicopter spotlight stabbed out we would never get through the rigging to the patch of clear deck bring her head round a little maam breathed sail hardy he shot a glance the way we had reached the anchorage t h e re s a big gust coming her hand s answered him the two were in complete accord it was the master in one element responding to the master in another the sea and the air she pulled the stick back hard and whipped the throttle wide we scraped past one of the high ventilators circling again jesus whispered pirow carl called the girl in a level voice tell captain bjerko to light the flensing platform only ill try there this time pirows radio key chattered as we swept round again again too the nervetearing approach from the stern the wind was stronger now it must have been gusting fifty knots or more traitors gate came up to meet us the machine canted as helen upton lifted the port side the side with the boat lashed to it high the tail too was high i heard sailhardys intake of breath we slid crabwise round the middle gantry like a wounded dragonfly a peckle of rain blurred the perspex it was too late to pull away this time we were committed the starboard wheel touched the deck the boat side and tail remained high she gunned the rotor at the tail it swung slowly deliberately into the wind she placed it delicately so delicately i scarcely felt the bump on one of the big steel boxes she let the boat side of the machine cant gently to the deck flicking the throttle we stood square on the rainslicked deck she sighed softly and rested her hands for a moment on the nowdead controls men were already lashing the machine to the big bollards i licked my lips you have to miss only once i said she sat there immobile not speaking i reckon she was rolling twenty degrees each way sailhardy pondered you were magnificent maam the strange eyes seemed to be filled with the hard glare of the floodlights carl she said take captain wetherby to my father he wants him urgently and sailhardy we climbed on to the heaving deck she made no attempt to rise as we left careful said pirow a factory ship has more places to break your neck than any other ship i know the powerful lights threw everything into taut relief above my head a huge piece of curved grooved iron looked bigger than it really was it had a hook with projections and was secured to the gantry by hawsers as thick as my arm when we reached the bridge companionway i remembered my things in the boat there are some of my instruments and charts in the boat i told pirow ill go back for them tell sir frederick ill be right along i swung myself up into the cockpit i stopped short helen upton was clinging on to the central cabin stay half in and half out of her seat her face was as white as the floodlights she was trying to pull herself on to her feet the island cock stared at her i went forward take it easy i said lowering her into the seat im not surprised after that landing her eyes were full of pain why did you have to come back and see me she halfchoked why did you have to see me that landing i began she waved me quiet it wasnt the landing she got out biting her lips its me dont be polite youve seen me i dont understand i said she spoke so softly i could scarcely hear the winches i forgot usually i use one of them to haul me up after a long spell of flying it gets my hip you see theres a bullet in it i just limp a bit ordinarily when the flying is tough it gets me once im on my feet im all right i always send everyone away your father shouldnt allow you he doesnt know and wont know unless you tell him she replied he must not know never help me up please she pulled off the flying helmet against the stark light and stormdarkened night her hair could not have been more effectively posed it was fair and short and curly dented round her forehead with the pressure of the leather i put an arm round her she leaned heavily against me for the first steps along the deck and then walked slowly with a slight limp past the bridge to a large chartroomcumoffice behind the desk sat a man a light was at his left shoulder etching the features his face was made of metal the secret of the blue whale incredulity mixed with revulsion stopped me as i saw the grey mask the effect was more startling when he rose and the pewter crinkled into a smile i could see the laughterlines at the corners of his mouth and eyes there seemed to be no division between the line of his strangelycoloured forehead and his short curly grey hair he was short and stocky with a sailors eyes the change from what i thought would be a deadpan into a warm welcoming smile left me at a loss helen kissed his cheek well daddy i found your man he took my hand and shook it cordially ive spent a lot of time and money on you bruce im glad to have you safely aboard his immediate use of my christian name did not offend me as it would have with almost anyone else your daughter did a magnificent piece of rescue work i said i scarcely expected to see the inside of a warm ships cabin tonight he glanced keenly at me from what i know i dont think a night at sea in an open boat would hold much terror for you good girl helen i knew youd find him she did not seem to hear the eyes so filled with distress in the cockpit were composed they were even warm through taking on the colour of the cabins panelling her unspoken attitude was that splitsecond timing and consummate skill were all in the days work it was clear that upton expected little less than that i fumbled for something to say the mask disconcerted me he laughed it gets you down the first time doesnt it i never notice it any more mine is no beauty but you should have seen the chap with the silver pan my god he shone like a balloonsputnik im afraid i dont understand i faltered i looked to helen for help she was busy rubbing oil off the back of her left hand she might as well not have been there she was so remote from our conversation of course you dont said upton in his rapidfire way you can have the medical term for it if you likeargyria i got it from fooling around with rare metals in sweden what happens is that the metal actually passes into your system the doctor chappie with the silver face had been using silver nitrate he was so selfconscious we were in the same sanatorium in stockholm my eyes had accustomed themselves to the light the cabin was as distinctive as the man one whole wall was taken up by a map of antarctica and no ordinary map it was in relief and the land contours had been demarcated by intricately inlaid pieces of whalebone the long spur of graham land which juts out from the ice continent towards cape horn was exquisitely fashioned as eyecatching as the map itself were scale models of the ships which had opened up the south they had been carved by a master replicas of clumsy eighteenthcentury british menowar of tough british sealers the originals of which had oaken planks thick enough to withstand packice and roundshot of the finerlined new bedford whalers of the first steamers aided by sails of the armoured icebreakers of today they clustered mainly round where i had operated from during the war for graham land was the first part of the continent proper to be found near my base at deception was an old brig and i could read her name williams it was in her that captain william smith discovered the south shetlands in it was captain smith who raced to chile to a british naval officer captain shireff who realised that the drake passage was the key to naval power between the atlantic and the pacific it had been true in napoleons time it had been true in my lifetime too i had guarded that passage for two years near my old base too was a tiny american brig named hersilia james p sheffield had sailed from connecticut to look for a dreamthe legendary fabulous islands called the auroras he failed but his young second mate nat palmer made history by being the first man to put a foot ashore on the antarctic mainland a britisher captain bransfield holds the distinctiona few days only before palmerof being the first man to sight and chart the coast of the antarctic mainland clustered round the long peninsula too were other ships with strange names vostok and morny russian among the first ever in those waters captain cooks immortal hms resolution which got nearer to the coast of west antarctica than any ship since astrolabe and zelee french hms erebus and terror british shackletons endurance a pitiful wreck crushed in the ice in the weddell sea that great bite out of antarctica which adjoins graham land was shown the epochmaking penetration a hundred and forty years ago by the british captain james weddell in his little ship lane no ship has ever navigated the weddell sea as far as weddell in the same longitude weddell was amazed that there was no ice at all almost within sight of the ice continent the intrepid captain turned back in clear seas all subsequent attempts to pierce the thousands of square miles of solid ice have failed the map showing weddells historic voyagein clear seas which should have been icebrought the reason home to me right then the albatross foot the storm made the factory ship lean at her anchors drake passage the golden hind sir francis drakes flagship was on the map fighting her way round cape horn there was almost a physical resemblance between the man in front of me and the famous elizabethan i wondered if drake had found his tiny cabin aboard the golden hind big enough for his spirit this wasnt for uptons sit down he said he couldnt seem to get the words out quickly enough theres not another map like that anywhere are you wet get him a drink helen she hauled you up out of the boat i could go along with upton i thought i didnt know what he wanted me for but among the toughcharactered men the antarctic throws up upton stood out helen went across to the drinks cabinet captain wetherby believes it was luck he had a strange bird with him it hasnt got any wings and he says nightingale island is the only place in the world where theyre found the rescue was a matter of luck there was an odd selfrejection about her i interrupted it wasnt luckit was spoton skilled judgment she rescued the whole boat whats more her landing with it lashed to the side out there on the flensing platform was masterly lucky for me since all my instruments and charts are in the boat he looked at me keenly theyre safe these things of yours y e s i r e p l i e d i w e n t b a c k t o s e e a f t e r w e h a d landed helen stood with the drink in her hand her eyes fixed on me they were alive with distress she was begging me not to say what happened its a strange bird she said in an even voice it makes little appeal at first it has no flight she splashed more spirits into the glass without taking her eyes from me i dont expect it sings perhaps somewhere there is a message in its disdain and isolation i could not fathom her ask sailhardy i said ill go and fetch my things from the boat upton shook his head he pressed a button on his desk a sailor came in he spoke rapidly to the man in norwegian cant lose personal property he said in the same jerky way he clicked off the desk lamp and put on the general cabin lights it was all southern ocean and luxury a chunk of baleen held down the charts he had been studying the central chandelier was made of four seal skulls skilfully matched and joined his chair was sealskin stretched over dark timber pirow came in with sailhardy upton nodded perfunctorily at the islander when will the gunnercaptain boys be here he asked pirow pirow grinned all of them in time for a drink you can bet on that theyre about as tough a bunch as you could hope to meet in a months sail round south georgia helen stood with the drink she was pouring for me in her hand upton went across to the cabinet a heavy gust of wind shook the factory ship i felt uncomfortable she just stood there with the drink im glad we got in before that started i said i had a good pilot she addressed herself to sailhardy sailhardy asked upton his hand on a glass the islander did not seem to hear him he was as far away as helen i think he half regretted not being out in the gale upton repeated the invitation sailhardy shook his head i like a drink but food is more important on tristan one is only tantalised by alcohol upton shrugged he took my drink from helen water in your brandy ive just come from the cape full cellar of your national drink for the record im not a south african i said ive lived there for the past three years i was born within sight of the english channel last of a long line of wetherbyssailors explorers hopeless businessmen helen pointed to a group of islands on the map near graham land and to a model ship the wetherbys did more than any private firm in the history of the exploration of the southern continent i would like to know what drove t h e m t o i t s h e j a b b e d a f i n g e r a t t h e m o d e l t h e sprightly she lingered over the name the first wetherbys favourite ship it slipped outharmlessly i thought then there was another and their names are always linked i said the lively and the sprightly yes she said the lively and the sprightly you can find them at any place between the drake passage and bouvet i said uptons keen glance seemed more than to study my appreciation of the fine brandy he had handed me he slapped together a double dry martini for helen he took a beautifully blown bottle from the cabinet in everything he did upton was the supreme showman the bottle contained no liquid he shook out of it a couple of long pretzellike sticks he took a tiny coffee spoon from a drawer and carefully scraped it full put the softish scrapings into a glass and added iced water he took a metal decanter and put it next to the glass pouring in a stiff slug of brandy he set it alight blew out the spurt of blue flame raised the decanter and sipped quickly first from the iced water and then from the hot brandy ive been around i said but ive never seen a drink like that before upton laughed i must do this at some place in the antarctic where theyll find a name for it the ingredients are scarcely usual erebus and terror i interjected you know the two volcanic peaks in the ross seabelching fire and smoke from the ice he roared with laughter god bruce what a name for guarana and buccaneers brandyerebus and terror it shall be pirow sipped his schnapps reflectively sailhardys thoughts were still outside in the storm it was the calm selfpossessed way helen said it that made me wonder if she was not anything more than a cog in the whirring personal machine which was upton overshadowed by him integrated whether she liked it or not in his pursuits i dont think daddy ever got over playing pirates she said flaming brandybuccaneers brandy they called it on the spanish main morgan drank it daughter filling in the gaps i thought that wasnt the whole answer though no daughter tortures herself with a bullet in her hip nor develops such flying skill just because daddy says so yet her knowledge of the southern ocean matched his map you dont pick up knowledge like hers about the wetherbys in the local library is guarana also something from the spanish main i couldnt keep the irony out of my voice not quite but near enough he replied in bolivia the guarana drink is called white water he held up what looked like a strip of dried meatbiltong as they call it in south africa this is dried dough made from a creeper which grows near the amazon its about three times as strong as the strongest coffee wonderful stimulant no hangover leaves the mind clear none of the deadening effects of alcohol everything is brighter better bigger brighter better bigger that could sum up the man i thought walter will want to bring the catchers in said pirow who was walter anyway i wondered it was all very well to give this extroverted display for my benefit but what did upton want with me where did catcher skippers fit into the picture tristan is far from the whale huntinggrounds i suddenly distrusted the whole setup sailhardy turned from the galeporthole he was bristling with suspicion ive never known catchers to meet at tristan he said upton was on the defensive ill rendezvous anywhere in the southern ocean i damnwell like the toughest skippers in south georgia would not come all this way for peanuts sailhardy retorted pirow said upton sharply go and signal walter i want a definite time of arrival quick now the mans nervous tension permeated the room what was it all about why the urgency in a wind wild enough to blow away an anemoneter plankton he said briefly tell me about plankton bruce hes been studying up on me i thought i didnt like it any more than helens knowledge of the wetherby explorations i wasnt going to be steamrollered all creatures that in the southern ocean do dwell sing to bruce wetherby with a cheerful voice i came back uptons face did not flushit couldntbut there was a pinky tinge to the pewter which made it look formidable the eyes were unnaturally bright before he could reply however the norwegian sailor he had sent to the boat for my charts and instruments came in and dumped the oilskin bag containing them on the desk the interruption gave him time to control himself and he held his voice steady plankton are like people in a crowd they mill around like hellwithin strict limits yet the general direction remains the same plankton might sing to you but might they not also point to something the inference was excellent i was to know later that guarana widens the associations he had not had time to hear from the islanders about the albatross foot the royal society would certainly not have told him look i said the royal society gave me a scholarship to investigate what i think is an unknown major ocean current with certain odd characteristics i told him about the albatross foot it has no significance either commercially or militarily upton was as tense as a boxer coming out of his corner the albatross foot what a name did you find it yes said sailhardy captain wetherby found it all right just the beginningsi should qualify that i said i was starting to get the proof i wanted when the storm came nevertheless i feel certain i found one prong one prong he echoed what do you mean one prong i told him my theory of the two prongs of warm current joining near bouvet helen took no part in the conversation she was fiddling with something on the map he slapped his right fist into his left palm plankton current put these facts together and my god see what they add up to sailhardy went back to his porthole this sort of talk was beyond him i wasnt sure whether it was not beyond me too it has no significance i began like to have a look at that other prong of the albatross foot he was tripping over his words he was so excited you can free ride in this ship its on the house ill take you to bouvet he did not wait for me to reply k r i l l m y g o d k r i l l krill i wilted under his bulldozing speech thats whales food the staple diet of whaleskrill he went on you tell me a current appears plankton appear billions upon billions of them food for the little shrimplike things we call krill food for every living thing in the southern ocean ive seen krill by the million fall like china tealeaves out of a whales guts when he was cut open i managed to get in what this has to do with the albatross foot except in a general way i wouldnt know krill live on them dont they he raced on things breed young must have food the lifegiving currents meet near bouvet bouvet was at the heart of the wetherby story discovered by a frenchman it was lost sight of its position uncertain in the wild seas for nearly a century an american sealing captain benjamin morrell made the first of the halfdozen known landings on its wild shores then in john wetherby sent captain norris to locate bouvet what norris found near bouvet has become one of the seas great mysteries sometimes they said old john wetherby could be seen pacing the thames by the roaring forties wharf in a storm calling captain norris to come back from the seadead to tell the world what he had seen near bouvet helen was watching me thoughtfully you look as if you had seen a ghost men have ghosts and so have islands i replied so have the wetherbys i the last of the wetherbys had also been drawn inexorably to the waters of bouvet off the island i had sunk the notorious raider meteor i liked upton but everything was moving too fast for me i dont follow what you are saying about krill and whales sir frederick i said your offer about bouvet is all i could wish for why did you come looking for me at tristan why me you havent come all this way just for the pleasure of indulging my oceanic whims time means money to you what do you want from me he grinned even modern business pirates have their quixotic moments thats no answer and you know it i replied i quote the admiralty and the royal society he went on captain wetherby is one of the most brilliant and experienced sailors the antarctic has seen since lars christensen broke open the ice continent thirty years ago he added crisply i want your knowledge of the southern ocean i want your knowledge of its currents i want your sailors skill i want sailhardys knowhow if you want seamanship you can buy it aplenty among the whalers in south georgia i replied youve refuted that argument yourself youve got whaling skippers on their way here now shut that door helen he said turn the key his movements were jerkier still what do you know about the blue whale its the most profitable kind to hunt i suppose a single one must weight a hundred and fifty tons and be every bit of a hundred feet long he said rapidly the blue whale has been killed off by the hundred thousand youd have expected that the most elementary fact about it would have been known by now where it breeds the norwegians first under lars christensen have been searching for that for half a century its never been found what has this to do with me i asked im not interested in whales blue or otherwise he went on as if he had not heard me to any whaling concern the knowledge of the whereabouts of the breedingground of the blue whale would be the biggest breakthrough since the harpoongun he faced me you told me tonight i stared at him i have not even mentioned the blue whale let alone its breedingground his words tumbled over each other like a pressure ridge of ice building up south of bouvet where the two prongs of the albatross foot jointhat is where it is youve put a million pounds in my pocket i still dont understand i said rather helplessly the albatross foot he turned the name over dont you seeplankton means krill and krill means foodfood for whales vast concentrations of krill scores of square miles of themfood for young whales blue whales you must know that youre oversimplifying sir frederick i said a seasons catch of blue whales is limited by the international whaling association to about eighteen thousand you cant hunt undersized whales even if you knew their breedingground upton strode angrily across towards the map but before he got there turned on his heel and tore open a drawer he threw a pile of papers on the desk somewhere there he said thickly is a copy of the laws of oleron the wicked pink tinge across the pewter skin was the most ominous dangersign i have ever seen in a man i have never heard of the laws of oleron i said sailhardy looked confused i dont give a damn that you havent he went on thickly i quote through the inspiration of these ancient laws and the common brotherhood of mariners throughout the world men are able safely to pass on their lawful occasions that was said eight centuries ago nowhere have more men died or come to a violent end than on the sea brotherhoodbah i simply do not know what you are talking about i said listen he said cocking his head thats a southern ocean gale outside and these bloody fools he slapped his hand down on the papers are trying to put a halter round its neck a flicker of a smile passed across helens face her controlled voice showed nothing of it what my father has got there captain wetherby is a copy of the new antarctic treaty hes trying to tell you he doesnt like it there is only one unexplored continent left he said that is antarctica it was discovered by individualists it is as big as the united states and europe together it is the one continent left for mans free spirit to break open what happens he banged the papers again government committees sit ten thousand miles away and decide its future it is not as bad as that i interjected listen he said antarctica has a population of about four hundred menall of them governmentalcommittee stooges with not a drop of red blood among them they live in preheated prefabricated prelined huts and take the predetermined sissy readings theyre so bloody proud of what has this to do with the breedingground of the blue whale i asked he brushed my question aside because they havent got the guts of an ice algae twelve of these nations have got together and signed this shameful thing called the antarctic treaty banning all activity but scientific investigation for peaceful purposes andgods death the possibility of opening up a tourist trade to the south pole he tossed off his guarana drink at a gulp its the negation of the human spirit bruce every one of those four hundred men scattered about antarctica is a stooge hes part of a committee a weather organisation or listen this is how they spend their time he read out from random papers which he snatched up directional sensitivity of neutron monitors shortterm decreases in cosmic ray eastwest asymmetry decreases at high southern latitude glaciogeomorphological features he threw it down on the floor in disgust i picked it up it was something about a scientific symposium on the antarctic held in buenos aires upton pulled himself together he picked up a long ruler and went across to the map suddenly he grinned i could not help warming to the man its a funny thing to be in love with a continent anything one loves must be different thats the way it is with me some bright lad in the us navy has worked out a formula to predict the number of icebergs you will find in the north atlantic in summer there arent any formulas in the antarctic you can put a halter and bridle on the arctic but not thank god on the antarctic i too went across to the map i picked out bouvet the cut of the jib of the two models given pride of place in the islands discovery the lively and the sprightly was unmistakable to my sailors eves you may well look upton said bitterly in this treaty the norwegians have inserted a clause laying down a ban of two hundred miles on hunting whales round bouvet he snatched up a pair of dividers placed one point on bouvet and sketched a circle see the ice mainland opposite bouvet is also norwegian its about four hundred and fifty miles from the island so with a territorial limit of two hundred stretching towards bouvet from the mainland and also stretching from bouvet towards the ice it means that theres only fifty miles in which you can legally hunt a whale put simply norway has closed onequarter of the entire ocean between antarctica and south africa to whaling why lars christensen surmised and i know now that somewhere in that wild waste of waters is the breedingground of the blue whale is a territorial limit of two hundred miles usual for this sort of thing i asked there was damn near a war when iceland imposed a mere twelvemile territorial limit ban on ordinary fishing he answered upton made the whole thing sound plausible he was going after the blue whale because i had pointed the way to the goal that whalermen had dreamed of for centuries and i wanted to go after that other prong of the albatross foot i said slowly if the albatross foot is within twelve miles of bouvet i want nothing to do with your operation if it is outside the twelvemile limit which i consider fair for any territorialwaters claim then well pool ideas fair enough he shook my hand thats the spirit of the sprightly he exclaimed helen turned to sailhardy are you coming sailor he did not look at her i shall go with captain wetherby the eyes became luminous for a moment that is a very neat distinction there was a knock at the door and she unlocked it to pirow walter signals hes just coming round the point into the anchorage he said hell be alongside any minute in the aurora the man with the immaculate hand it is a wild night outside this anchorage said the big man in the streaming oilskins upton did not seem to mind when he shook the water from his souwester on to the cabins fine carpet the waves come forty feet high tonight thats nothing new to you walter upton replied jocularly or to captain wetherby here he introduced us gunnercaptain walter is the finest harpooner in the southern ocean i disliked walter at sight he looked the sort of sailor for a night like this his great hand as he gripped mine was scaled over from the kick of the harpoongun and matched his massive frame he stank of whale and schnapps with an overlay of weatherproofing he was halfshaveni was never to see him otherwise so you find your man eh sir frederick he said there was a suggestiveness about my mind upton had told me about the blue whale walter was obviously the type to carry out such a project yet what had been imponderables to them before they found me seemed now to fit neatly too neatlyinto the pattern where are the others asked upton i kept them close to the aurora all the way from south georgia walter replied in fact within w t range you know what these catcher skippers are likethey spot a whale and go chasing after it and before you know where you are you are chasing him no theyll all be in within half an hour good said upton i want to brief them as soon as they come in where is pirow asked walter was i imagining it or was there also some innuendo in the way the tough skipper said it the question and the answer were harmless enough in themselves where do you think said upton as always in the radio room that pirow said walter thoughtfully he should have married a radio set he thrust his big jaw towards sailhardy who is this heh sailhardy i said a tristan islander ah hell said the big norwegian tristan islander shipwrecks and black women sailhardy came across the cabin towards walter the only outward sign of his anger was a curious flicking of his left small finger into the palm of his hand i knew sailhardys strength upton intervened walter doesnt mean it for you sonofabitch said sailhardy come boys went on upton you both need a drink i told you not for me glowered sailhardy a cape horner for me grinned walter a full cape homer upton splashed half a glass of schnapps and tipped a pint of stout into it two more men in oilskins pushed open the cabin door reidar bull catcher crozet said one klarius hanssen catcher kerguelen said the other their economy of words as they identified themselves and their snips was typical to them the ship and the skipper were synonymous they eyed the luxurious cabin enviously i knew what their own quarters were like a metal box containing a hard bunk continuously soaked through leaking bulkheads it was better to be on the bridge they were naming their drinks as lars brunvoll arrived brunvoll catcher chimay he introduced himself i laughed when walter told me the name of your ship said upton chimayiceberg dont you see enough ice brunvoll the skipper was at his ease immediately were still missing one though mikklesen said walter where is he brunvoll he was tying up as i came over he replied the door open and mikklesen came in he did not look like the others as if he had been lashed together with steel wire he was of medium height with a thin pinched nose and the clearest of blue eyes i am mikklesen of the falkland he said you are sir frederick upton he was the odd man out just as the islands after which his catcher was named belong more to south america than to antarctica at a sign from her father helen left the skippers sat uneasily on the fine furnishings their concession to the social gathering was to open their oilskins without taking them off they were as tough as a narwhals tusk upton did his trick with the flaming brandy and raised the metal tankard with its blue flame to them skoll to the finest whalermen in the southern ocean only walter responded the others stared selfconsciously into their drinks during the next few minutes i admired uptons handling of the skippers they were out of their element upton wanted them for something they knew it and he knew that they knew to have put a foot wrong would have sent them all on their way upton blew out the flame and gulped down the hot spirit they looked surprised he grinned at them as he threw in another dollopof brandy surely i dont have to show whalermen how to drink spirits he asked obediently they upended their glasses he raised his tankard to the blaahval here it comes i thought with that toast to the blue whale blaahval echoed the norwegians captains upton began peter walter has asked you to come and join me here at tristan to talk business they eyed him silently i could see they were not impressed you dont get men to voyage two thousand miles in partial radio silence just to talk business not ordinary business mikklesen broke in sir frederick before we go further who is paying for our fuel to get here i am upton replied you will draw all food fuel and suppliesliquor if you likefrom this ship anything you want they murmured approval then upton played it rough the knockdown for rough men he gestured at me the professor here has found it he knows where the blue whale breeds each turned and eyed me with a long appraising look as if searching an uncertain horizon that mixed with a kind of iconoclastic wonder i started to speak but upton went on you captains will hunt the blue whale with me in its very breedingground hanssen said thickly where is it sir frederick upton laughed and punched him on the shoulder you bastard hanssen he turned to the others he says to me where is it just like that the greatest mystery of all time for whalermen and he says where is it hed got his audience the norwegians roared with laughter sailhardy whispered to me bruce lets get out of this setup its all wrong upton didnt miss his cue with us either only the professor knows he told them you see he has been a captain in the royal navy you know what they are they never talk mikklesens eyes were so clear they were devoid of expression captain wetherby of hms scott he asked yes the man who sank the raider meteor yes they still talk about it when men get together he said he came over and shook my hand i was close east of bouvet in my falkland i heard the signals they were clear not in codehe was a clever one that meteor the twisting and the turning he yapped over the air like a mongrel in a fight from your ship there wasnothing then silence i knew you had got him then upton was abstracted i became a punchline in his act captain wetherby distinguished service order he said a professor of the sea in peacetime and a man of death in wartime it was so sentenious that i nearly laughed in his face the captains did not think so solemnly each shook me by the hand upton went on captain wetherby knows and he has promised to take us there what is it worth sir frederick asked hanssen this ship will hold about two hundred and twenty thousand barrels of oil he replied thats worth about three million pounds mikklesen chipped in to you yes sir frederick but not to the men who will do the work theres a hundred thousand pounds net for each of you in this upton went on net ill pay all expenses and as i said i provide all fuel all equipment he didnt wait bull bull nodded quickly hanssen aye brunvoll yes m ikklesen the skipper of the falkland hesitated for a moment i thought he might be going to refuse he did not look at upton but at some point on the great map near bouvet as if it could help him to a decision i have never had so much money he replied slowly t h a t s n o t a n a n s w e r j o k e d u p t o n y e s h e didnt wait but started to fill up the glasses talking rapidly this calls for a celebration we sail in the morning keep close to the factory ship pirow will pass my orders to you on the wt mikklesen waited until his glass was full it is not as easy as that sir frederick he said the other skippers stared at mikklesen in surprise we agree to go with youif so where it might be anywhere between here and australiaor beyond upton frowned it is not as far as that a couple of thousand miles you have my assurance on that mikklesen shook his head i sweated for twenty years to buy my own ship there must be safeguards the safeguards are one hundred thousand pounds in cash snapped upton is this a legal or an illegal expedition pressed the vikingeyed man will i lose my ship why ask us to rendezvous at tristan i have never heard of whalers gathering here before he said pointedly why didnt you bring your nice big ship and meet us where we belong in south georgia i had to meet captain wetherby here upton began listen i interrupted forget captain wetherby the war has been over a long time mikklesen smiled no captain seas and wars do not forget their captains he confronted upton have you a permit from the international whaling association upton was on the defensive i will explain more to you mikklesen pressed on do we fish where we should not what countrys waters eh is this a second onassis and the olympic challenger will we also be bombed and arrested there is a territorial limit of two hundred miles which has been laid down which is completely unreasonable and no nation would really adhere to it if said upton mikklesen certainly was on the ball so we fish in my own countrys territorial waters he asked with a thin smile we fish for the thing every norwegian whalerman has dreamed of since he first heard the crash of a harpoongun or since he fiensed his first whale the breedingground of the blue whale upton tried again technically i say we will be inside territorial waters with the knowledge i have i cannot risk a maritime court action it would give everything away it is bouvet is it not sir frederick not so captain wetherby inside norwegian territorial waters off bouvet it is bouvet blast you roared upton but by god mikklesen you can search until you are as blue as a blue whale but you wont find the breedinggroundnot without wetherby mikklesens answer was quick that i know every season for thirty years i have sailed near bouvet i have never found it i try every time walter broke in we are fishermen and two hundred miles for a territorial limit is damn stupid twelve miles maybe the other captains except mikklesen grunted approval we are hunters went on walter we hunt where the game is you cannot draw lines across the ocean and say keep out where would we be if the british did what norway has done and kept us away from south georgia and the south shetlands we norwegians first thought of the breedingground mikklesen retorted angrily it belongs to norway even if two hundred miles is a stupid limit and as a whalerman i agree that it is upton saw his opening you are a hunter first or a patriot first captain mikklesen will norway offer you a hundred and twenty thousand pounds like i will a hundred and twenty thousand pounds echoed mikklesen a moment ago it was a hundred thousand pounds upton did not sense his mistake with mikklesen in bidding up i did and mikklesens grudging agreement should have warned upton thats the new price he laughed so that everybody feels quite happy this secret belongs to norway not to one man or one expedition said mikklesen doggedly i thought more of your spirit of enterprise said upton does that mean you are not joining us ill come he replied sullenly for a hundred and twenty thousand pounds now i must get back aboard my ship he gave me a further long glance as if to satisfy himself he had really seen someone who had located a secret so precious to norway and went some of these boys like jam on it laughed upton he turned to me hell feel differently once he sees the sea red with dead whales they just cannot resist it you know mikklesens departure lifted the air of tension over the gathering i had heard of the drinking prowess of south georgia whalermen but even so the way they downed their cape homers astonished me but then they were also drinking dreams of their upton became one of them as the strong liquor and his camaraderie loosed their tongues fanning ridge walter was booming its the best landmark on south georgia as you come up from the southwest damn me ive seen it from as far away as fifty miles on a clear day nonsense said lars brunvoll why come from the southwest anyway walter let out an oath i wouldnt have been coming at all if it hadnt been for the emergency huts the americans put up on stonington island stonington island hanssen echoed thats to hell down the graham land peninsula way in marguerite bay too true walter replied i was caught by one of those violent gusts which come down the glacier near neny island in other words smiled upton you thanked god and the norwegians who first set up the emergency depots they call roverhullets throughout the antarctic and its islands it was the scots who started the idea on laurie island in the south orkneys sixty years ago began reidar bull i stood aside as the argument developed as only sailors and whalermen can argue mikklesens shrewd formulation of the illegality of the proposed expedition worried me there could be no doubt that in terms of the antarctic treaty which twelve of the major powers with possessions and interests in antarctica including britain the united states and norway had signed we were infringing norwegian territorial waters if we were caught upton might buy or talk his way out of trouble but for me it would be different i a royal society researcher would acquire a lifelong stigma for throwing in my lot with an expedition whose one and only purpose was gain uptons gain in fact the whole business could lead to a small shooting war if norway got tough that is exactly what had happened when onassis allegedly flouted the twohundredmile offshore whaling limit declared by peru ecuador and chile in his olympic challenger expedition as mikklesen had pointed out had been bombed by the peruvian air force and seized by the peruvian navy that had created a major diplomatic incident and the ships had been released only on payment of indemnity by lloyds the breedingground of the blue whale was far more important to norway than onassis mere infringement of whaling limits that was where the parallel between the olympic challenger expedition and uptons ended had the olympic challenger had on board an oceanographer like me who could have nailed down a killercurrent the peruvians call el ninoa warm less saline stream which blitzes the lifeflow of the peru current and kills fish whales and seabirds by the million off the coast of south americathe knowledge in itself would have been worth that indemnity many times over the albatross foot represented a mighty challenge what i asked myself as the catcher skippers grew more noisy if a similar challenge had been rejected by the man who only since world war i had revolutionised all ideas on the great gulf stream itself he was laughed to scorn but he proved his theory until ten years ago the united states was unaware that yet a second great gulf stream known as the cromwell current swept in to its shores this time from the pacific again it was one mans persistence pitted against all contemporary scorn which proved that a milewide column of water equal to the flow of the nile amazon mississippi st lawrence yellow and congo rivers together multiplied several thousand times washed the pacific coast of the united states here at my fingertips lay the possibility of a discovery as great as either of these if not greater the whole of the worlds whaling industry would be affected by knowledge of my current that i argued with myself could bring conservation on a global scale of the disappearing schools of whales in the southern ocean even if upton killed off a few hundred in pinning down that knowledge for me there was too a vital military aspect of the albatross foot in hms scott i had sunk a uboat deep in the southern ocean toward the ice she had surfaced before she sank and i recovered her log for submarines knowledge of water temperature and salinity is vital i had been surprised at the data the log had shown of the area where i now knew the albatross foot must be it was a picture of current and countercurrent of rapid temperature changes in the boundary layer between surface water and the main body of the sea itself which we oceanographers call the thermocline a study of the waters round bouvet would yield new and invaluable operational information for atomic submarines guarding the vital sea route round the cape of good hope how else but through upton would i ever get near bouvet it had been difficult enough to persuade scientists at the royal society to let me investigate the tristan prong of the albatross foot no government or scientific organisation would be prepared to spend tens of thousands of pounds on an expedition to the wild waters of bouvet merely to test an unsubstantiated theory the answer was uptons expedition must not be located to me that meant only one thingi must take command sailhardy and i knew every trick of the southern ocean we had learned it the hard way i grinned a little wryly to myself now that the decision had been formulated i was deliberately seeking out the worst seas in the world among whose fogs i would hide the factory ship and catchers from whatever ships norway might have there while i sought within my circular area of probability as the misslemen say of the target at cape canaveral the missing prong of the albatross foot sailhardy moved away from the porthole when upton tried again to press a drink on him and came over to me frowning deeply bruce he said we can get to tristan even in this gale lets get outnow i submerged my own misgivings why this is a onceinalifetime opportunity for me to get to bouvet as you know look replied the islander weve been shanghaied politely but none the less shanghaied upton has sailed all the way from cape town to tristan in order to tell you that your plankton discoveries will help him discover the breedingground of the blue whale fair enoughthey probably will then what are you objecting to i asked his methods his timing everything he replied he could have written you a letter asking you to go to see him in england or flown you there from cape town for that matter true the letter might take six months to reach you but six months are not important for something that has been searched for for half a century it must have cost five thousand pounds a day to bring this ship to tristan when he gets here he sends his daughter off into one hell of a storm to find you it all points to one thing you must be valuablevery valuable indeedto him he told us he could net a straight three million pounds its a big expedition isnt it yes if he finds this breedingground youd expect this factory ship to be mightly busy wouldnt you yes pirow and i walked through the crews quarters when we landed to put his gear in his cabin he said slowly there are only enough men to cope with a moderate catch i smelt a rat at once so i asked the chief flenser about biomycin biomycin is the latest american way of preserving a whaleyou know normally the meat and fat of a whale is quite useless about eighteen hours after the kill unless preserved with biomycin you can then keep them up to forty hours youd expect them to be cutting up whales on an assemblyline basis if upton found the breedingground yet theres no biomycin aboard and tiny almost skeleton flensing crews to cut them up upton may be a bit oldfashioned in his methods i started to say what have you got in that bag of yours sailhardy demanded indicating the oilskin bag which the sailor had brought from the whaleboat charts seatemperature readingsthat sort of thing what charts admiralty charts of tristan gough the south shetlands you can buy them anywhere oh and an old chart and log which came to me when wetherbys folded up its about its probably the first of the waters round bouvet bouvet breathed sailhardy the cabin door flew open pirow stood there a radio message in his hand it was the disciplined attitude of the man his deference to upton his superior and his taut bearing that made me recognise him in a flash the man with the immaculate hand i looked in silent wonder across the noisy room at the geoffrey jenkins a grue of ice man who had lured so many british and allied ships and men to their deaths during world war ii carl pirow radio operator of the german raider meteor was a very different proposition now from the oildrenched wretch they had brought aboard hms scott after i had gone in with torpedoes while the meteors inch salvoes blanketed my ship i considered pirow the most dangerous single man the war at sea had thrown up against the royal navy the man with the immaculate hand we called him and the merchant navy took over the nickname in awe because of his uncanny ability to imitate any type of ships radio transmission when i had started my long search for the meteor i discovered that every ship whether merchantman or warship has it own idiosyncrasies in transmitting there are as many ways of sending as there are radio operators i looked across at his handsyes they were still beautifully manicured as the wartime legend recounted it was said that captain kohler of the meteor had first called him the man with the immaculate hand the german navy passed it on to their propoganda radio the royal navy perpetuated it as we hunted month after month in the southern ocean while the meteor struck again and again a chill struck through me even in the warm drinkladen atmosphere of the factory ships cabin as i remembered the standard distresssignal i had heard so many times often blurred and incomplete as the raiders shells smashed home from the ships placed under my charge in the wastes of the southern ocean first the frightened qqq i am being attacked invariably followed by rout i am being shelled by a warship i jerked myself back into the present and crossed the room to pirow i looked at him steadily is that a message from seekriegsleitung that its so urgent for a moment his glance faltered as i dropped into the jargon of the operational staff of the german navy high command and then he laughed i wondered how long it would be before you recognised me herr kapitan there was a spurt of anger behind the pale eyes which made the calm poise of the master technicianfaker more sinister it was no thanks to that stupid clot of a radio operator of yours that you came in with the torpedoes the last thing kapitan zur see kohler said to me was i wonder if the british torpedoes will run true ours always gave trouble bruce said upton peremptorily he drew me aside here he thrust the signal into my hand he wasnt drunk the caffeine in his strange tipple offset the effects of the alcohol the pink flush of anger was there though i read the signal written in pirows neat postoffice handwriting urgent repeat urgent mikklesen skipper whalecatcher falkland to norwegian destroyer thorshammer via tristan da cunha meteorological station british sir frederick upton has discovered breedingground blue whale inside norwegian territorial waters vicinity bouvet island upton has no permits expedition factory ship and four norwegian catchers starting ex tristan dawn tomorrow suggest appro priate action under it was the reply thorshammer to mikklesen m e s s a g e a c k n o w l e d g e d h e a d i n g a l l p o s s i b l e s p e e d f o r tristan await my orders there upton jerked his head at the group of captains walter walter read it slowly the bastard he started to say the bloody twofaced bastard shut up snapped upton in a low voice keep those boys drinking carl come to the radio office weve got plenty of time and the southern ocean is a big place pirow gave his halfsmile halfsneer except that thorshammer is about twenty miles awayjust the other side of nightingale island how do you know rapped out upton i got a df bearing on her said the man with the immaculate hand shell be here in an hour thorshammers message threw my doubts into sharp relief either i would go now with upton or get ashore with no hope of ever seeing bouvet the presence of the man with the immaculate hand had shaken me what was a brilliant if perverted radio operator like pirow doing with an expedition like this you dont need radio to hunt whales and wireless traffic in the antarctic as i knew from my long vigil at cape town listening to it consisted mainly of weather reports and catchers reports all of it deadly dull pirow was there for some sinister purpose that i knew was it his mastertalent in deception that upton wanted or some knowledge from his days aboard the meteor in either event the blue whale story was simply a cover but a cover for what on the surface one could not fault uptons story except that it was a little too slick even the lack of biomycin on board was not decisivewhalermen are naturally conservative and slow to adopt new ideas but why did upton want me so urgently what knowledge or partknowledge did i share with pirow assuming that the blue whale story was a fabrication or a blind despite the risk i knew what i had to do i must assume command and go the knowledge of what upton pirow and walter were really about might prove my justification if the norwegians caught me i turned to upton we cant talk here lets get to pirows office upton started to object when sailhardy came too but i waved it aside we skirted the bridge to get to the radio office i was struck by the radio set it was a powerful instrument and the tuning dials were twice the size of any i had seen upton pirow sailhardy and i crowded into the small space sir frederick i said i now have a condition for coming to bouvet i must have sole and complete command of this ship and the catchers must operate under my orders upton shot a quick glance at pirow ill be damned why this sudden assumption of responsibility you can make up your mind and it will have to be quick i said thorshammer cant be here in an hour with this sea running she cant make more than fifteen knots i know thorshammer is one of the new british whitby class they sold to norway shes bigevery bit of two thousand tons even so i feel sorry for anyone in her tonight itll be coming green right up to the bridge western approaches stuff but shell catch you before you ever see bouvet unless you are in command he said he didnt wait h e p i c k e d u p p i r o w s t e l e p h o n e b r i d g e h e s a i d captain bjerko from now captain wetherby will take over command of this ship you will act on his orders and give him the fullest cooperation he turned to me satisfied i nodded get on with it carl do something about it pirow looked at me with that halfsmile i have your permission herr kapitan i nodded and he sat down at his transmitting key the thoughtful pause with the hand held high was pure rubinstein it was not a gesture to the three of us who stood round him at the key it was the thoughtmustering prelude of the artist he was projecting himself into his medium the left hand came down by the side of the key with the thumb and first finger splayed the third and fourth slightly crooked the right hand felt delicately for the key live now as he put on the transmitting switch he paused and looked up at me it was a south african who sent mikklesens message he said he sent breedinggrond instead of breedingground he was an afrikanerhe spelled ground as it is spelt in afrikaans one must therefore send like an afrikanerdeliberately thoroughly one must search out in his makeup the essential puritan and one must manifest it in ones sending he depressed the key i read the morse as he sent carl pirow as such was no more this was the man with the immaculate hand and these were the hands of a superb corrupt artist mikklesen to thorshammer via tristan meteorological station upton and catchers upanchoring the old thrill of the chase welled up inside me despite my forebodings the course herr kapitan the course i must not break or they will guess deception course the layout of tristan da cunha and the anchorage rose to my minds eye thorshammer was approaching from the southwest i must blanket her radar behind the cliffs which towered along the line of hottentot gulch at the back of the settlement blanket her to give my fleet a flying start and then double back i would keep the catchers with the factory ship inside the kelp line round by jews point and blacksand beachthat would put the island and its peak between thorshammer and us until i could run the factory ship straight at him in the storm i would break out from the southern tip of the island just as he started to come by anchorstock point on the other side towards the roadstead hed never think of using his radar to scan the south when he believed his quarry to the north and east in this weather i could slip past him within half a mile three hundred degrees i said pirow tapped out the figures you and i would have made a great team herr kapitan finish that the way mikklesen might i added am awaiting your further orders anchored in nine fathoms off julia reef julia point bearing degrees upton was visibly excited walter must know but not the others he said theyre risking their necks just the same as walter i began they wont if they know theres a warship only twenty miles away i need those skippers theyll simply evaporate if they hear about thorshammer all my doubts came rushing in uptons concealment of the danger underlined the importance of his mission very well i said slowly but they wont be very thrilled at upanchoring in a blow like this thrilled or not thrilled theyll do just what i tell them any special briefing for them bruce ill leave the explaining to youas much as you care to explain i said i want them to keep in my lee about a quarter of a mile apart on the port quarter of the antarctica well sneak past thorshammer not very far from where helen rescued sailhardy and me if i know anything about the radar scanner of the thorshammer class he wont want to swing it more than is necessary in this wind there must be no sudden opening up of the catchers engines theyll give a sudden spurt of flame in the darkness if they do the convoy will work up speed graduallynine knots at first then eleven for twenty minutes and then up to the maximum we can make into the gale pirows receiver started to chatter thorshammer to mikklesen keep me informed heavy weather makes interception difficult will use searchlights and starshells keep clear of uptons fleet will he hell i growled maybe the southern ocean brings out the essential man the eternal hunter for all the ennui the frustration of the long intervening years of study and research fell away i had a ship under me i was at sea on a night as wild as the creation upton must have managed the skippers and from the bridge i saw the halfdrunken truculent men make their way by dinghy to their ships and in less than half the time it would take thorshammer to intercept us my small fleet was at sea the gale hit us with a vicious left hook as we swung clear of stonyhill point the southern extremity of the island and took the full force of the storm after the shelter of tristans lee the kent clearview screen in front of the big bridge telegraph seemed to check for a moment in its quick orbit the only light was the main engine revolution indicator out of sight of whatever searching eyes there might be in thorshammer the squadron was blacked out on my orders to the mystification of the skippers i was not used to such luxury on a ships bridge the nine large windows exposed one to the eyes of the night and every time the fancy clock which struck the time by ships bells gave its melodious chime i jumped i went over to the telegraph on the port wing of the bridge and rang for more revolutions the rays patent revolution indicator quickened its tempo w e m a d e f o r t h o r s h a m m e r i s p o k e t o t h e l o o k o u t through the telephone by the starboard doorway see anything lookout the coarse voice came back nothing sir niks niks at all i doublechecked on the bridge to see that everything was in order im glad im not on a destroyers bridge tonight i said to upton raw steel raw subzero what if thorshammer spots us asked upton she wont i replied no said pirow who glanced at his sleeked hair in the reflection of the small light she wont not with captain wetherby in command the bridge phone rang lookout sir aurora coming in very close tell her to sheer off i told pirow make quite sure the signalling lamp doesnt point thorsharnmers way he smiled thinly at my precaution superfluous to someone like himself antarctica yawed and trembled under a violent squall sailhardy whom i had ordered to the small brass wheel held her beautifully the chernikeef log chuckled to itself we waited silent tense they say the eyes see best ten degrees off centre mine caught the telltail flicker of light away to starboard it wasnt a ship sailhardy spun the wheel it seemed ages before antarctica started to come round get my night glasses from the cabinquick i told the norwegian quartermaster whose place sailhardy had taken upton handed me the bridge binoculars i took one look at the name standard british glasses are useless at night i said i wonder how many ships were sunk during the war through not seeing a raider because of poor glasses the man returned and handed me my own pirow smiled at upton raiders glasses zeiss sevenfold magnification they took months to perfect a single pair of binoculars for one of our raider captains the herr kapitan wetherby has all the answers the night drew in under their power but i could not trace the momentary light which had alerted me i opened one of the bridge windows we are in raiders waters i said meteor used to rendezvous with neptune off tristan uboats too i almost surprised one his oil hoses were still in the water galeimpelled rain deluged through the opening ice said sailhardy ice i smell it ice bruce very close i smell it too said helen i had not heard her come to the bridge the gale held an indefinable smell there is nothing like it anywhere else not in arctic ice even in the southern ocean the smell of it passes into mens clothing the lookout in the swaying barrel on a catchers mast knows that faintly wet indescribable smell as his deadliest enemy and the companion of his labours we did not have to wait the night was torn by a splendour of white light the incandescent burst was manmade thorshammer had also seen what i had glimpsed she had promised to use starshells the great iceberg was in two dimensions it must have been two or three miles long and a thousand feet high from antarcticas bridge it was strange and beautiful under the slowlydescending parachute of the starshell towards its lefthand extremity as if superimposed forward of the main body of the tabular berg was a gigantic anvil soaring nearly its entire height it seemed almost disembodied from the rest disembodied in colour too anchored for half a mile in a solid platform over which the sea spouted it was deep green where the blade of the anvil flared it was yellow almost amber at the summit the island of ice embayed itself near the righthand cliff and i could see in the ephemeral light a tiny lake of blue water dominated by fluted grooved cliffs on either side the weather face of the stupendous berg was hard and clear the lee was blurred by a tumble of disintegrating spicules of ice feathering their way on the gale my god exclaimed upton then he remembered thorshammer shell see us turn away turn away no i retorted shes on the other side of the berg it will block out anything this side she cant miss us with her radar upton said pirow disagreed that berg is breeding enough radar angels to fox anyone radar angels he asked the ice especially when it is disintegrating produces all sorts of unaccountable echoes on a radar he said we call them angels the starshell was doused darkness clamped down helen was still next to me it is the sort of thing one remembers all ones life i didnt know icebergs came so far north it was probably ten times that size off cape horn i said from the starboard wing of the bridge i stared astern of thorshammer there was no sign not even a funnel glow by which to pick her up in the blackness i came back and shut the window signal the catchers with the aldis i told pirow steer i checked in my mind steer one hundred degrees eight knots helen was shivering sailhardy spun the wheel my order had told him everything steady as she goes aye aye sir antarctica plunged southwards one hundred degrees said helen destination i looked deep into her eyes bouvet island the island that never was for three days antarctica and the four catchers fought their way to the south through the storm now on the fourth morning the wind had dropped but there was a tremendous swell running from the southwest the heart of the gale had passed to the north and east and was on its way to spread snow on the distant high plateaux of the south african mainland i was on the bridge and sailhardy at the wheel a growler stood out on the starboard bow the four catchers formed a ragged rearguard to the factory ship nearest was walters aurora she seemed to ride better than the others she stuck her bow blunt and aggressive like a boxers nose into the swell a tarpaulin masked the deadly purpose of the harpoongun forward she sank down on our port beam as if kneeling to the plunging factory ship and took it green up to the cluster of winches below the bridge all i could see was her masthead above the rollers i watched the whip of the long flexible mast which looked like an outsize fishing rod because of its cables to the harpoon water poured off her deck in triangular streams as she rose channelled by the threecornered bollards anchoring the whaling cables the sea had changed from the clear blue of tristans waters to a dirtythreatening grey the fleet was now well to the south of shipping routes and striking across the path of the roaring forties the heavy tophamper of the factory ship the four massive gantries the big bollards by the rails and the heavy steel cables supporting the masts were drenched in spray a wandering albatross whose wingspan i guessed to be twelve feet tipped the wind effortlessly from under his wings and hung above the stern like a white boomerang his presence copyrighted the south of the other three catchers chimay lay out to starboard and crozet and kerguelen further away gave me on the bridge no more than an occasional glimpse of the thick winch wires and lashing blocks which reached almost to the height of their crowsnests while they steamed beamon to the seas someone built that ship good remarked sailhardy smiths dock co middlesbrough i said absently they build the best my mind was not on auroras seaworthiness although professionally i admired the way the rounded bows of the catcher came up and their flare fought the sea one moment her cruiser stern plunged so deep i wondered if it would ever come up again the next she shook her whole fifteenfoot depth free in an explosion of spray the wicked handles of the harpoongun stuck out of the weathered tarpaulin like death in hand cuffs i was worried after the departure from tristan and the fleets successful evasion of thorshammer upton had taken over command from me despite his assurances before we had left the anchorage with bjerko playing stooge to him he had immediately altered the course to one which was causing me the gravest concern upton had also been asking questions about the charts i had mentioned at our first meeting at first his probings had been guarded but now they were more open and persistent the exhilaration of dodging thorshammer had given way in my mind to gnawing fears about my complicity in uptons schemes nor had those doubts been lessened by pirows smooth radio deception of the norwegian warship and uptons refusal to tell the other skippers except walter that thors hammer was hot on our trail we were now striking the fringe of the wild seas where i would have to seek the other prong of the albatross foot and the sight of the great seas rolling up from the ice continent dampened my first flush of enthusiasm despite the success of the tristan escape it seemed an almost impossible task to seek to find anything in an ocean as savage as this my apprehension had not been helped by sailhardy two days out from tristan he had told me that the flensing crews spent their time playing cards tween decks and that no attempt was being made to get the factory ship shipshape for the impending record catch he maintained that uptons interest in me centred on the old chart in my oilskin case so that i had brought the chart up from my cabin to study through the long hours of watch at night my own suspicions revolved round some partknowledge pirow and i might share from our wartime operations and i thought upton was aiming to dovetail the two interrelated pieces of knowledge held separately by pirow and myself once we got to bouvet helen too remained a mystery to me on the few occasions she had appeared on the bridge she had been even more distant and withdrawn than before her questions to me were i felt consciously professional regarding weather but i had noticed a decided uneasiness in her as the fleet neared colder waters now this morning as i stood on the bridge shortly after sunrise my doubts crystallised i had gone below to my cabin during the night and although i could not pin down anything specific i felt it had been searched i had the old chart on the bridge the oilskin bag which served as a chartcase was almost as i had left itbut not quite it was one of those indefinable thingsan awareness more than a fact that it was not as i had left it i pulled the folded square of parchment from the inner pocket of my thick reefer jacket it crackled as i unfolded i t t o s t u d y i t o n c e a g a i n t o t r y a n d f a t h o m u p t o n s objective for gods sake bruce sailhardy exclaimed put that damn thing away what if upton or pirow come here youre seeing shadows sailhardy i said this old thing simply cant mean what you think it might neither upton nor pirow will come to the bridge as early as this take the wheel a moment he said while i did he locked the bridge doors leading to uptons cabin and the radio office weve been over this a score of times in the past three days i said im damned if i can see what an oldand inaccuratemap of bouvet island in has to do with a socalled whaling expedition in the old parchment was intersected by wavy lines with a shape like a chinese maple leaf in the centre both margins were marked with tiny crosses from the righthand top corner meandering irregularly towards the mapleleaf shape in the middle was a line below the line and opposite one of the quaint marginal crosses which said degrees south were three dots and a little further down another dot which was labelled rock is novelty had long since been lost upon me the chart had come to me shortly after the war when the firm of wetherbys had eventually folded up it was the log and track chart of the wetherby sealer sprightly which had rediscovered bouvet island in her master captain george norris had not only charted the island but had also sketched it thats not all and you know it retorted sailhardy and i think upton guesses that too you mean thompson island i said derisively yes replied sailhardy i mean just thatthompson island my thoughts went back to the day upon empty day i had trailed up and down the great staircase at the headquarters of the royal geographical society near the albert hall in london the days upon days spent sitting outside someones office at the admiralty waiting to be fobbed off and sent to yet another office the stale smell of the greenland kayak on the geographical society staircase was synonymous in my mind with the endless questioning my endless frustration among the disbelieving experts they did not want to believe any more than the admiralty wanted to believe what i had seen i wondered if my innermost reason for accepting uptons offer to go to bouvet had been less of a desire on my part to nail down the albatross foot and more an attempt to vindicate myself the royal geographical society and the admiralty had both said leave it alone leave it alone when captain norris had rediscovered bouvet island after it had been lost for nearly a century he had also found something bouvet had not an island fifteen leagues or fortyfive miles northnortheast of bouvet captain norris positioned it his own original log lay open in front of me thompson island had never been found againofficially captain norris discovery provoked the liveliest controversy for over a century and a quarter nations have lavished millions on ships specially equipped to find thompson island ahead of the field were the norwegians who specifically explored the seas round bouvet in the late s under the great lars christensen the british rrs discovery searchedthompson was not found before that german american and french expeditions had likewise failed sailhardy took his eyes from the compass in front of him it was fully a minute before he spoke you are the only living man to have seen thompson island yes i said but theres no need to dramatise it like that i know i saw an island as we went into action against the meteor it was near bouvet no one will believe i sighted land i was told the same thing as captain norris when thompson could not be found againeither i had seen a big iceberg and mistaken it for land or else it was simply water sky yellowish reflected light over a big shelf of ice murmured sailhardy an antarctic man like yourself doesnt make that sort of mistake no i said if i were one of the catcher skippers i would like to have used a very rude phrase to the armchair critics who rejected what i had to say curious they said almost the same to captain norris the admiralty said hed seen a large iceberg and the streaks which he described on the cliffs were simply barnacles sailhardy looked at me reproachfully you know the history of thompson island minutely you know how great sailors from sir james clark ross to lars christensen have searched for thompson island and failed and yet you deliberately play it down in relation to upton it ranks with the island where sir francis drake sheltered the golden hind off cape horn and which has never been seen again as one of the greatest of sea mysteries the vital phrase is in relation to upton i said he is neither a sailor nor an explorer no replied sailhardy hes got a flashy act as a modernday buccaneer thats not all i said underneath he is ruthless hes after thompson island said sailhardy doggedly i shook my head if hed wanted to discover thompson island he would not have gone about it in this holeandcorner way i said a man in his position could telephone a london newspaper and say he was endowing a special expedition to search for the great ocean mystery thompson island etcetera etcetera there would be no lack of takers you dont have to string a fleet of catchers along with you anyway to look for an island one ship would do keep that chart out of the way thats all i ask said the islander what possible value could thompson island have to upton i went on i have seen it its simply the tip of an undersea mountain range jutting out into the worst seas in the world theres nowhere like it anywhere gales snow ice gigantic seas day in day out year in year out he wants that log said sailhardy take a look i assure you theres nothing he looked at me strangely you are the only living man to have seen thompson island there are only three others in history one of them was captain norris i smiled at his earnestness one of the three was francis allen an american sealer who started a line of islanders on tristanand you are of that line thompson island was the wetherbys i told myself it was the old john wetherbys because his favourite captain had discovered it for himand lost it to the world it was mine the last of the wetherbys because i had found it again after four generations or very nearly since it had slipped away into the ice and fog with the same spectrelike elusiveness as it had done with norris sailhardy was in it too and i could almost recall by heart the deposition made to the franklin institute by the man with whom sailhardys greatgrandfather had sailed captain joseph fuller of new london now lighthousekeeper at stonington served in the united states navy during the civil war and afterwards repeatedly went sealing and sea elephant hunting in the antarcticin in the francis allen he saw bouvet island and he saw thompson island bearing about northeast from bouvet but he could not land on either on account of the ice wind and fog joseph fuller named his ship francis allen after his friend and mate francis allen only i had seen thompson since sailhardy went tense his keen ears had heard someone coming he jerked his head at the wheel take it he hissed give me that damn thing before i could object he folded the log of the sprightly and thrust it inside his windbreaker with equal swiftness he unlocked the doors he was just in time upton came through he looked curiously at me are you the quartermaster as well as the captain bruce i shrugged we may need two men at the wheel the way were going something was eating into him he was morose preoccupied what the hell do you mean this fleet is putting its nose into troublebig trouble i replied sailhardy took the wheel again if you mean youre afraid of one little fisheries protection destroyer im afraid of the biggest destroyer there isice i said i must know where thorshammer is and what course she is steering our course is dead wrong i want to get to the north uptons face went pink youll stay on this course and keep out of the way of the thorshammer pirows last df bearing on her showed we were steering diverging courses we should be out of range of her seaplane pirows bearing was two days ago i said anything could have happened since upton picked up the bridge phone carl bridge at once bring bjerko with you he came back to me so youre frightened of a little weatherthe great captain wetherby yes i am i replied when i am steering directly into the heart of the atmospheric machine which provides the energy for the storms of the roaring forties nonsense snapped upton walter agrees with me it will be stormy but you are well used to that listen i said i originally set course after we had given thorshammer the slip at tristan to approach bouvet from the north pirow got his df bearings on thorshammer i wanted to stay just beyond radar range but you put her on this course in order to approach bouvet from the south and west i say it is suicide thorshammer has a seaplane retorted upton dont forget that id like to see anyone take off in the kind of storm weve had i replied thorshammers only got an old he for searchingpirow heard that over the air its radius is not much more than a hundred and fifty miles anyway pirow and the gauche captain bjerko came to the bridge carl said upton have you got a bearing on thors hammer pirow shook his head this part of the world is hell for radio thirty years ago lars christensen found that bouvet was a radio deadspot as we call it i cant get any good signals from thorshammer upton was edgy you mean you cant get enough of her sending for a df bearing pirows lip curled i can get a bearing if a ship sends eleven letters i proved it to the german decryption service so you dont know what course thorshammer is steering no i tried to cash in on uptons nervous uncertainty even this big factory ship isnt good enough to stand up to what were heading for i have been in the southern ocean many times said bjerko this ship is good youve never steered this course or tried to make bouvet from the south and west i replied bouvet is the heart of a fantastic dynamic weather machine which tosses off more energy into the sea and wind than an atomic e x p l o s i o n i c o u l d e x p l a i n i t a l l i n t e r m s o f w h a t i s euphemistically called the millibar anomalies of the westerlies but what it boils down to is that bouvet acts as a kind of highvoltage booster station to weather which already has two thousand miles of punch behind it it is a wild hell of driving water fog ice and icebergs all racing at a hundred knots to god knows where i repeat it is suicide to approach bouvet the way we are doing particularly in early november early november echoed bjerko that is the best time in antarctica it is the start of the summer the ice meltspoof it is gone walter says the same added upton and i say simply this i went on this ship will be nipped in the ice and sunk if we approach bouvet the way we are doing now my dear fellow when the sea is starting to warm up upton began i cut him short on the edge of the continental packice the sea temperature is always just above freezing point at this time it stays sountil bouvet just south of bouvet it rockets upton shrugged im not interested in a lecture on sea temperatures i want to know about thorshammer i ignored him into that freezing or nearfreezing sea i believe cuts the other prong of the albatross foot i have only seen the results not the cause it is with the southern lights the most spectacular of many wonderful sights in the southern ocean in late october and early november you get an explosive warming in the stratosphere shortly after the sun appears over the south pole this coupled with the inrush of the albatross foot produces a fantastic fallout of energy and weather that is what i am warning you about these are a sick mans fears said bjerko theres a giant glacier in the sea where we are going i said the packice disintegrates northwards towards bouvet from the antarctic mainland yet the tip of this vast tongue of iceit is four hundred miles from the mainland remains untouched it has a life of its own it draws its life from the atmospheric machine im talking about round bouvet the albatross foot and the glacier conspire there is a grand battle between warm and cold bouvet lies in noman sland nosailorssea i would call it in a sea of slush and bergy bits suddenly it freezes like a vice bouvet makes its own particular brand of packice within hours before you can escape the sea is frozen solid i warn you if you take this ship the way we are going now the ice will close and tear her guts out shell be nipped along the waterline and be crushed to death wait said upton he was back in a minute the document he handed me sent a tremor of apprehension through me harmless in itselfmy weather knowledge and kohlers would probably add up to the same thingit proved beyond doubt that my fears and sailhardys about the true purpose of uptons expedition were well founded i read it aloud so that sailhardy too would see its significance kapitan zur see kohleroberkommando der marine i took my eyes from the heading and watched pirow as i translated for the islander captain kohler to high command german navy top secret raider meteors climatological report on bouvet island area in other words upton had delved deepas deep as a topsecret documentin order to get information about bouvet or was it about thompson island had kohler the seawolf not gone down under my fire upton might have had no use for bruce wetherby my face must have given me away but upton misread it all men have their price he said jauntily even for top secrets was pirows price the knowledge of uptons objective i asked myself i glanced at the opening sentences in order to compose my thoughts situation with a westerly movement visibility poor in early summer fog and cloud frequency increases i did not need kohler to tell me about bouvets weather secret and vital though it was to uboats and raiders the way we were headed meant certain disaster but to reveal the fleets position to thorshammer if that were possible would mean ignominy for me that is why i did not analyse the underlying motive of pirows suggestion it seemed at the time as if might provide a way out of my dilemma or information on which to base my future course of action why does not the herr kapitan take the helicopter and see for himself where thorshammer is steering its hopeless for me to try and get a bearing on her yes i said if i knew that i might still avoid bouvets deathdealing ice youll come i asked pirow he shook his head go on trying for a bearing one might be lucky i can be of more use aboard this ship my ready acceptance of the suggestion seemed to restore uptons geniality he tried to be conciliatory but what he said only added to my suspicions it will put you at your ease about bouvet he said once you know thorshammers course you will feel happier ill tell you what bruceif we take a bit of a pasting well lie up for a day or two at bouvet theres the one landingplace in the southwest norris sounded out the bollevika anchorage and its still the best norris sounded out the bollevika anchorage if he knew about norris and bouvet then he must know about thompson i could not help feeling it was an oblique bidin other words show me norris chart there seemed to be a shade of disappointment about both upton and pirow when i replied will you ask helen to fly off as soon as possible then i want sailhardy to come with me within a quarter of an hour the helicopter had risen from the flensing platform of the factory ship into the rearguard fragments of cloud that rushed to the north and east to join the main body of the storm the bucking of the ships far below was evidence of the wild weather which had left the swell behind i was in the copilots seat sailhardy stood helen swung the machine in a broad circle round the fleet it was a superb horizon its iridescence was mirrored in her eyes like thai silk the strange bird from nightingale clung to the compass platform that lucky bird of yours wont budge from my cockpit she said ive named her suzie wong shes like an african state i said shes grown up to modern ways too quickly my quip sent helen right back into herself i could not make her out the pressure is tentwenty millibars she said stabbing at the wetanddrybulb thermometer whose rubber tube dis appeared into the slipstream outside is that normal in the wake of a migrating anticyclone cell captain wetherby i glanced into the withdrawn face whose high fine cheekbones were emphasised by the leather helmet engine oil had insinuated itself in tiny cracks between her knuckles they were fine hands i told myself almost in justification of her neglect of them and they lay easily confidently on the controls she was wearing a fleecelined leather flying jacket and a pair of crumpled woollen slacks thrust into saltstained moccasin halfboots it is normal i replied absently why call her suzie wong i thought she wasnt going to reply she took so long shes a bit out of the ordinarysomething like the circumstancessomething like what course please i spread the big chart awkwardly i pointed is that where you think thorshammer will be sailhardy i had circled an area to the northnorthwest maybe half a degree further north replied the islander thorshammer is icewise bruce shell get more benefit from the warmer water by keeping a shade further north shell also get clearer visibility she wants to find us remember i ringed a new circle fine sailhardy said three hundred degrees i told helen as she brought the machine round and steadied on course i looked back south she said without looking at me you always look south dont you the question took me aback after her resort to abstruse weather jargon i had been quite willing to treat her as a pair of competent hands only now she was slipping a curious psychological punch under my guard this particular day the south has more meaning for me than usual i said i told her about bouvets weather the glacier in the sea and the danger she listened in silence i told her how the sea would freeze she asked one question only does that mean that we all could be stranded on the ice yes she turned swiftly to me a quick burst of terror unalloyed terrorilluminated the strange eyes for a moment then she leant forward and touched the island cock then ill go for your lucky bird captain wetherby he voice was husky with tension i pulled a package from my pocket cigarette i dont smoke she swallowed hard sailhardy pointed forward whale she could not hide the relief in her voice at being among her professional pursuits a tiny obelisk graced the sea to mark perhaps another whalegrave in the trackless waters blue whale she corrected him all whale spouts look alike to me i replied they are not alike she said getting a grip on her voice the blue whale is the easiest to spotthe plume of condensation grows as its spout rises a fin backs is tall and narrow the sperm whale gives himself away every timehe shoots it out at an oblique angle would you like a picture of it she asked she didnt wait for me to reply but hurried on her eyes became animated and for the first time since meeting her i felt aware of a personality behind the accomplished flier ive got a cameratwo in fact i begged them from the japanese who were down at ongul island last season theres a fairchild kc for the vertical and a williamson f for the oblique she started to dip towards the whales spout my words came automatically and i regretted them as i spoke keep course steady as she goes the eyes snuffed out like a lamp steering three hundred degrees she repeated tonelessly w e f l e w o n s t e a d i l y f o r t h e n e x t t w o h o u r s h e l e n remained silent completely withdrawn sailhardy and i exchanged technicalities and when he went through to check the extra fuel we had loaded in drums aft i fiddled with the radio it was however as pirow had said all i could get was some jumble from the american base at mcmurdo sound after another twenty minutes flying we were on the fringe of the area where i thought i would find thorshammer we had overtaken part of the storm clouds and i became anxious as i peered through the perspex now clear now obscured sailhardy turned his head this way and that searching if thorshammer was to be seen he would spot her this is going to be very tricky i said if we stay at this height the odds are well miss thorshammer if we duck under the cloud cover we lose our height advantage and our ability to see her before she sees us the orange and black will make this machine stand out like a sore thumb said sailhardy what both of you have overlooked is thorshammers radar remarked helen no i said ive thought of nothing else since she left tristan but im not particularly worried thorshammer hasnt set about trailing us as i would have done shes been quite open about itby that i mean she hasnt kept radio silence like our fleet she is not to know we have an expert like pirow aboard if it werent for the radio dead spot thered have been no need to make this flight we may find pretty soon that were close enough to get a df bearing on her moreover she doesnt know we have a helicopter mikklesen never saw one and thorshammer left tristan in too much of a hurry to discuss things with mikklesenin fact we dont know that she even anchored at the island shell still be using her radarshed be crazy if she didnt replied helen very soon im going to ask you to take us right down to sealevel and im going to try and get a df bearing on thorshammer i replied radar will pick up nothing at zero feet as you well know so we wont be detected were almost at the area where i think well find her thorshammer certainly wont be expecting us to come looking for her bruce exclaimed sailhardy a ship bearing green threeoh get her down i rapped out get her down to sealevel quick i saw nothing and by the time i had tried to focus on the spot sailhardy indicated the machine was dropping like a lifti saw nothing said helen i knew sailhardys eyesight how far was she do you reckon i could see forty miles on a day like this he replied i caught the flash steer thirty degrees i told helen im going to try and get a bearing on her the sea came up to meet the helicopter we skimmed the wavetops at that minimum height the huge swells were no longer ironed out as a few minutes before helens eyes took on their colour a pale turquoise flecked with deep ginger it was hopeless trying to locate the destroyer by radio perhaps pirow could have made some sense out of the jumble that jarred my ears but i could not even identify thors hammer after five minutes i gave it up and went up forward to the pilots seat sailhardy was craning to see i reckoned however that our height now was no more than that of an average crowsnest and although the day was clear below the broken cloud the horizon was hazy with the aftermath of the storm which would cut even sailhardys keen eyesight to about ten miles i think there must be some sort of solar disturbance interfering with the radar as well as the bouvet dead spot i said that means thorshammers radar is pretty useless anyway well be up on her in less than half an hour if we keep this course said helen providing it was thorshammer sailhardy saw it was a ship asserted the islander i simply must know her course i said theres only one way under these conditions and that is to observe thorshammer ice right ahead said sailhardy helen nodded agreement sea clutter nothing very big but some quite sizeable growlers even from our low altitude i could see the long line of broken packice strung out in the wake of the storm marching in orderly columns as the gale thrust them along look i said thats how well observe thorshammer what do you mean sailhardy asked the simplicity of the idea made me laugh well creep along in the helicopter until were reasonably close to thors hammer i replied then well land on one of those big growlerson the side away from thorshammer we can sit and watch her pass helen bit her lip it wont work captain wetherby as close as that thorshammer cant fail to pick us up by radar i shook my head it doesnt need pirow to tell me that even under favourable conditions it is very difficult to get a radar echo from an iceberg particularly if theyre weathered smooth like these the iceberg itself wont even show on the screen let alone us she looked at me and i was astonished to see the anguish in her eyes no im sure thorshammer sailhardy looked surprised at her reaction its nothing to land on ice maam and after the way you rescued us she turned so abruptly to the controls that for a moment i thought the machine would hit the top of the next swell she was breathing quickly ill land anywhere but but i could not fathom her her fear of putting the helicopter down on a stable platform like a small iceberg offered no problems for a flier of her proved competence i dismissed the idea that somehow her reluctance might tie in with my suspicions about her father how privy was she to whatever his schemes were she had said nothing that would have revealed that she knew anything either of pirows background if youre afraid i started the strange eyes were alive with inner pain im not afraid of landing she pulled herself together but i could see the perspiration along the line of the leather helmet she swallowed hard which growler i glanced at sailhardy he shrugged at her agitation not yet eh bruce ten minutes more i asked him and he nodded helen pulled herself upright in her seat she neither spoke nor looked at us her face was drawn and white she was so tense that i wondered if i should not call the whole thing off could she make a landing in the state of nerves she obviously was in the stakes were too big to turn back now the sea clutter thickened as we flew on i admired helens skill as she dodged between the growlers keeping the machine just above the waves some of the bigger pieces of ice towered twenty to thirty feet above us as we passed i saw the one i wanted it was tabular but there was a small plateau sloping slightly towards us while the top was as straight as a ruler the helicopter could land on the shelf and sailhardy and i would plot the destroyers course from the summit i pointed there helen flew straight on almost as if she had not heard we swept along towards the ice now looming close the plateau was steeper than i had anticipated the perspiration splashed from her forehead on to her leather flying jacket she pulled the controls we rose slightly and checked then like a fly clinging to a wall we hung on the little plateau magnificent i said i stopped short at the sight of her face it was alive with terror her eyes were riveted on the ice her hands were shaking almost out of control as she cut the throttles the engine died maam exclaimed sailhardy what it it maam i sensed rather than felt a new danger the helicopter started to slide backwards towards the sea about twenty feet below helen sat transfixed get the engine going i shouted she just sat staring i swung round to sailhardy quick you grab one wheel and ill get the other the two of us can hold her we threw ourselves out of the cockpit and grabbed the undercarriage the machine was lighter than i thought heels rammed against the ice sailhardy and i kept the machine on the plateau miss upton i shouted for gods sake what the hell is she up to ask sailhardy shes scared stiff i said what at i wouldnt know can you hold this machine by yourself i eased my grip tentatively but the helicopter started to slew round it would need both of us to keep her where she was miss upton i yelled propping the strut against my shoulder and half kneeling half crouching to see past the cabin door swinging in the wind try using her christian name breathed sailhardy heavily it may make her snap out of it helen i called helen i had forgotten for the moment that she could not get out of her seat quickly in perhaps three minutes she appeared at the doorway she looked round her like a sleepwalker she scarcely seemed to notice sailhardy and me her eyes full of agony had taken on the greenblue hue of the ice helen i said sharply pull yourself together theres no danger she looked at me without speaking pull yourself together i repeated sailhardy and i can hold her here quite easily get my glasses and go up to the summit take a compass and give me four or five bearings thorshammer must be pretty close she went inside like an automaton and returned my glasses dangling loosely from a strap at her wrist she looked down at the ice her face was deathly come on i said its a bit cold but theres nothing to worry about she stumbled awkwardly hesitated and threw herself down on the ice she landed on her knees she sagged forward and lay face downwards convulsive sobs shaking her she slid slowly toward me i caught her against the wheel helen i repeated what on earth she lay with her head resting on the ice it isnt on earth thats the whole trouble she said brokenly you made me land on iceon ice do you hear icewhat has ice got to do with it she still did not lift her head ive got a bulleta german bulletin my hip i told you you said bullet i replied but what a german bullet has to do with your crackup when you see ice i wouldnt know for three days i lay in a ditch with ice and snow with a german bullet in my hip she got out he died but i lived i wish to god i had died too listen i said youre completely broken up and its something to do with ice and a german bullet itll keep meanwhile get up there to the summit of the iceberg and get a couple of bearings on thorshammer she sat up her face was ghastly she looked in turn at sailhardy and me everything in your world is straightforward uncomplicated if neither of you understands i still have got to say it even my father doesnt know about the bulletand never will to him i am the brilliant flier to be depended on in any circumstances he didnt hesitate to send me off in the storm to find you he knew i would find you i did i what is it about the ice i asked gently despite its agony the face was in its own way without any makeup rather beautiful in its animation there was a touch of colour under the right cheekbone where it had rested on the ice i had to try and get her to go up and observe thors hammer when the germans invaded norway my brother and i were with my father in stockholm where he was busy on his experiments with metalsthe time when his face was affected she said gradually getting a grip on her voice we set off in two parties my brother and i were in one and my father in the other with some norwegians who were taking us to trondheim the british ships were still there our party was intercepted by a nazi ski patrol it was getting dark i remember racing down a long slope the two of us there was a burst of fire from an automatic pistol we were both hit i in the hip and he in the chest it took two days for him to die we huddled together in a ditch in the ice and snow as the life ran out of him i was conscious only now and then five days later i woke in a norwegian house there was gangrene in my hip the doctor fought for weeks to save me when i was well enough they smuggled me out to england the day before i arrived my mother was killed in an air raid a nerve twitched in her face she sat up and looked at me i am terrified of the ice then what are you doing in the antarcticthere is no need she cut me short there is every need why do you think i fly a helicopter in these surroundings when i could lead a pleasant easy life in london my fathers schemes give me the outletthe outlet i need to challenge the ice it is something innatephysical as well as in my mind i must master the ice i am the only woman pilot in antarctica ive flown over ice hovered over it gradually got closer and closer and each time it was a living hell but a conquest i was winning outuntil now i wasnt ready ive never had the courage to land on it the incline of the ice shelf brought her against me with my free hand i picked up the binoculars and handed them to her heres another chapter of that challenge for a moment i thought she would draw back then she rose on her haunches it did not escape me the way you looked at my hands she smiled faintly other things have been in abeyance you see while i fought it out with my jailer she looked about here as if seeing things for the first time no wonder my father finds it easy to include me in his schemes i nodded at the glasses those could be the key to the door she tried to rise but could not then she leaned hard on my shoulder and got to her feet special glasses arent they brucefor seeing in darkness she started away from us but sailhardy called her back the compass maam you dont want to have to come back and fetch it itll be tough going once to the top she stood looking down at the islander and me braced against the ice to hold the machine thank you bruce and thank you sailhardy she said slowly there are more things than ice in the southern ocean slowly painfully with a physical and mental torment we could only guess she clawed her way to the summit of the growler when her voice came back to give us the first bearing it was as colourless as plainsong thorshammer bearing eightoh degrees eight miles at fiveminute intervals she repeated a fresh bearing in half an hour she came back to the machine her face was white but for the first time since i had known her the eyes were vital ill start the engine and you can come aboard she said she laughed softly what a pilot im glad you are the only witnesses she revved the engine the rotors swung and we climbed aboard while she held the machine gently against the little plateau we gave thorshammer another clear quarter of an hour before threading our way back through the growlers at zero feet towards the fleet once we were certain that we were beyond range of thorshammers radio we picked up our altitude although helen flew in silence the tension was gone and several times she leaned forward and stroked suzie wong clinging to the compass platform and said something which i could not distinguish above the roar of the rotors it was sailhardy who spotted the catcher fleet first as we pulled round in a wide approach circle to the factory ship he tensed and pointed bruce auroral lookjust aft the bridge the twin muzzles pointed skywards walter was on the russian convoys he said i nodded grimly no wonder he survived im going to have a closer look at what mr bloody walter has rigged up there can do i asked helen she nodded she brought the helicopter to hover twenty feet above the barrels of the antiaircraft gun it was the most sinister piece of improvised ackack armament i have ever seen a heavy slowfiring watercooled spandau was mounted sidebyside with an air cooled rapidfiring hotchkiss from the base plate to the height of a mans chest was a heavy swivel mounting screwed into it on a hexagonal plate fore and aft were two narwhal tusks forming a bow of about three feet in height at head level the two weapons swung on a crossbar about an inch and a half thick drums and belts of ammunition were already in place there was also a double harness like a car safety belt for each gun it was a killerweapon for use by two men the helmsman waved cheerfully but there was no sign of walter sailhardy and i looked at each other there was no need to say it the spandauhotchkiss confirmed everything about upton and the chart was the key as if reading my own thoughts sailhardy drew back out of helens line of vision he put his hand into his windbreaker where he had concealed the chart and looked inquiringly at me i nodded upton must not find it on either of us if he got tough sailhardy looked round tentatively behind helens seat the interior quilting was loose from the skin of the machine it was the best we could do there were only a few minutes before we would be down sailhardy edged behind me and tucked the folded square of parchment behind the quilting we landed sailhardy and i went to my cabin i was scarcely surprised when i opened the door to find upton pirow and walter the place had been ransacked walter held a luger in his hand the log of the sprightly i felt sure the luger was pirows though it was walter who pointed it at my chest pirow was on his knees at my chartcase uptons eyes were bright and hard as if he had been on the guarana i talked quickly to distract walter so that sailhardy could jump him so norris sounded the bollevika anchorage i sneered breedingground of the blue whalebah a blue whales dorsal fin i sensed sailhardy start to move i threw myself sideways at walter the crash of the shot deafened me i struck him a wicked blow in the kidneys he gasped but he was strong and cunning he dodged to prevent my crowding him and fired again as sailhardy grabbed at his hand the bullet screamed off the steel wall walter ducked picked up a heavy lead sinker i had used for my plankton net and swung it with a sickening thump against the islanders heart sailhardy collapsed while the big norwegian turned to come at me with a running crouch luger in one hand and sinker in the other i struck him with all my force under the right ear with my forearm i heard the gun clatter but at the same time my feet were whipped from under me pirowthe bastard i thought as i fell walter caught me a glancing blow across the left side of my face with the sinker i lay on the floor sick with the pain pirow grabbed the gun i saw walters seaboot come up to kick me unconscious but i had no strength to roll clear upton stopped him steady peter he ordered we need him i do not care for this british captain who fights foul like a south georgia whalerman he said thickly rubbing his neck nor his bloody islander let me finish both of them well find the chart on one of them for sure he seems to know anyway said pirow he kept the luger on me get up wetherby snapped upton it was the first time he had not used my christian name go over him peter and if he hasnt got it then the islander walters paws tore at my clothes while pirow covered me with the luger when he had finished searching me walter turned over the unconscious sailhardy roughly and searched him its not on them he said its here somewhereit must beupton grasped the lapels of my reefer jacket there was a curious air of exhilaration and menace about him although the name had never been mentioned between us in relation to the chart each knew tacitly what the other had in mind where is captain norris chart where is it man i jerked my head at the chartcase in there it is notive been through everything interrupted pirow hes lying of course hes lying snapping upton i would too if i had anything as priceless as captain norris original log and chart of thompson island thompson island i exclaimed there you have it thompson island the formidable pink flush suffused the pewter i was weak from walters blow but even so i was surprised at uptons outburst of nearmania strength he shook me like a rat yes blast all the wetherbys and their secretive captain norris he snarled eight words for everything in my life the log and track chart of the sprightly norris rot his soul he faked upor your precious john wetherby faked upa duplicate for the admiraltys benefit its useless as everybody knows what i want is norris original youve got it and by god i mean to have it at any price whatsoever do you understand any price whatsoever my mind raced to the chart i knew every minute detail of it there was nothing of any value to a man like upton he must have some other knowledge about thompson island apart from the chart but to which the chart was nevertheless complementary i had to find out what it was ill take this ship apart rivet by rivet to find the chart upton went on savagely i believed him he rounded on me will you take me to thompson island i evaded a direct answer how should i know where thompson is youve got norris chart and that shows the true position of thompson island i saw the fallacy of what upton was saying what i and i alone knew was that captain norris chart was priceless up to a point beyond that point the centuriesold secret of the lost island was one mans onlymine kohler must have known too pirow obviously did not will you take me to thompson according to the chart upton rasped even walter stood back at uptons anger no no he replied well see walter the islander you know what to do walters seaboot crunched into sailhardys face pirow stood grinning walter raised his boot to kick again norris chartwithout mewasnt worth risking sailhardys life it was obvious that upton considered sailhardy expendable stop i shouted stop where is it demanded upton walter i said softly never let me find you alone particularly if i have a fiensing knife in my hand remember that the big skipper looked uneasy but upton seemed beside himself i thought i still might find out what he knew that i did not about thompson island ill take you to where the chart says providing you tell me what you are looking for on thompson island i said we could do a deal i knew in advance what his share would be from a bargain like thatsquare miles of open sea hed receive the same share if he trusted to the chart by him self without me i thought wryly to myself i was somewhat in the same position as old john wetherby after norris original discovery had started the world talking except that in my case it was my life and sailhardys that were at stake john wetherby had faked a chart when the admiralty had insisted he had kept back his superior knowledge by virtue of norris original now in my mindit was not written down was the knowledge which superseded the information of the norris chart i could afford to let upton have the original chart he had obviously seen the fake at the admiralty no deal snapped upton on lesser matters maybe but not on this think quickly walter has an educated boot and what is one bloody tristan islander more or less i played for time or one bruce wetherby more or less upton gave a brittle laugh in principle yes in practice it is harder to get rid of a royal society man than an unknown islander walter grinned all sorts of accidents happen on factory ships with all the machinery and knives strange things he glanced at sailhardys battered face who would know whether it was a boot or a falling tackle block which smashed in his face if its a question of disposing of one body or two i began shut up i upton snarled dont talk round it its the chart or he gestured at the unconscious form on the floor it is in the helicopter cabin i said its tucked away behind the quilting near the pilots seat god help you if youre lying he said walter get up to the machinequick bring it here upton and pirow both drew back to the doorway as walter left pirow kept the luger trained on me i felt like a battered bull whale after a deepsea duel so the whole business of the blue whale was a bluff i asked slowly upton had regained some of his composure not entirely not entirely then why the hell drag along four catchersyou wanted fiveto look for thompson island its beyond me what quality of doom did thompson hold john wetherby had died mouthing the name norris and his famous sprightly had gone to their eventual deaths in the wastes round thompson after returning following the first discovery when and where no one knew joseph fuller had been drowned at his stonington lighthouse francis allen had been lost in the ice with the ship bearing his name now thompson was driving to nearmania and murder a whaling tycoon who could apparently reap no benefit from its rediscovery and why was it so valuable that upton would allow nothing to stand in the way the blue whale story was ideal cover he explained i had to have a string of shipsyou remember nelsons frigates before trafalgar the catchers were to serve the same purpose in scouring the waters round bouvet for thompson they were to be my eyes that was before i knew you had the chart if nelson had had a helicopter he would not have needed a string of frigates i replied he grinned touche but i have read kohlers weather study of bouvet if its not blowing a bloody gale its fog and if its not fog its total cloud and if its not total cloud its an impossible sea an american coastguard cutter flew a helicopter near bouvet a couple of years ago they damn near lost it after only half an hour in the air i dont have to tell you about bouvets weather if you didnt know i had norris chart why bring me into it not even i could wheedle out of the admiralty your secret report on the sinking of the meteor he said but i know that you sighted land as you went into action once i knew you had the chart that naturally became redundant the two things are the same i averted my eyes so as not to give myself away let him go on thinking they were the same hed never find thompson island his way if he went on regarding sailhardy and me as expendable my knowledge might well buy our lives the door burst open walter and helen tried to push through at the same time walter held the folded chart triumphantly his right hand was smeared with blood helen gave a gasp as she saw sailhardy on the floor she looked in disbelief at pirow and the gun and at me her face was flushed with anger daddy what on earth she indicated walter speaking rapidly what right has this lout to break into my cabin and tear down the fittings like a madman it is my machine and what i say goes he grabbed the quilting and tore it to pieces bruce bruce he killed suzie wong you bastard walter i said who the hell is suzie wong demanded upton my goodluck birdthis oaf killed her she repeated what right has he i wrung the bloody things neck said walter it is unimportant it flies at me when i look for the chart upton did not seem to hear her he stood mesmerised by the parchment walter held in his hand get out he told her roughly get out one miserable bird does not matter nor would a lifefor this he took the chart from walter get out he said if you want to cool off and mourn your bloody bird go and fly your precious helicopter in circles helen stook back stunned by his outburst his megalomania sickened me she backed to the door yes that is just what i will do she said in quiet anger i dont know what you all are up to but remember i have seen this little scene even if no one else of the crew has she shut the door but i do not think upton even noticed in less than a minute i heard the machine take off upton unfolded the chart then he stabbed his finger again and again at a little circle from which the wandering line of the sprightlys track radiated thompson island thompson island he turned on me the fury was gone and the eyes seemed even brighter he could not control his hands he pointed at the corner of the parchment where there was a marginal note novemberdecember the log and track of the sprightly he whispered thompson island pirow edged round keeping the automatic trained on me theres bouvet too there are norris soundings of the bollevika anchorage upton could scarcely get the words out as he fumbled to decipher norris writing december the thirteenth log of the sprightly pm saw a small low island bear w miles rocks in a cluster bear nw another rock nw nearly level with the waters edge this island is in lat long this island we have named thompsons la bears nne leagues from bouvet island three rocks we named the chinnies se or miles off thompsons la and another small rock miles south of them upton was silent for a long time so that is where thompson island is he exclaimed at last fifteen leagues or fortyfive miles northnortheast of bouvet for the next halfhour upton relapsed into long abstracted silences as if he had forgotten the presence of the three of us altogethersilences broken now and again by a volley of words it was then that i first seriously doubted the mans sanity the only sounds were sailhardys unconscious moans we dared not break in upon the silences once upton turned the parchment over and over god imagine that little ship sprightly of norris at two oclock in the afternoon coming out of the fog and being confronted with the island now it is mine he fell into a long silence as if he were reliving norris great discovery then he came over to me eyes bright and grabbed me by the shoulder completely carried away by what was going on in his own mind tell me man does it look the way norris sayssmall and low how could it ever be confused with bouvet which is all cliffs and peaks did you see it like that tell me i saw it like that i said i saw thompson island i am the only man living to have seen it he looked thoughtfully at me the only man living he echoed i remember the ice the dirty grey sky the shroud of fog uptons next words added to my doubts about his mind he traced with a finger with almost reverential care the old sealers track past thompson island and its rocky outcrops heavenly blue he said heavenly blue the tannoy loudspeaker above my bunk came alive with its disembodied crackle bridge here bridge here sir frederick upton stand by for a repeat from radio office of an urgent message upton had been thorough hed told the bridge he would be in my cabin before leaving so that he would not be out of touch while he searched my things something inside me cleared like a lift of fog when i heard helens voice for it told me she had had no part in her fathers scheme for thompson island she came over the loudspeaker clearly which meant she must have been fairly close to the fleet in view of the radio interference at any distance h for helen do you hear me h for helen helicopter nrwh calling factory ship antarctica upton wheeled on pirow get up to the radio office jam her swamp her do any damn thing but get her off the airquick i felt somehow that the normal overtones in her voice were for methe way she might think royal navy formality ran under stress but her excitement overrode everything h for helen position approx fiftysix degrees south one degree west pirow stopped in his tracks whitefaced plain language transmission thorshammer cant miss it dear god in heaven shouted upton stop her carl perhaps the radio interference is too bad for thorshammer to hear no snapped pirow never some temporary sunspot fade but nothing like as bad as i made out to the herr kapitan to get him off the ship bouvets dead spot began upton dead spot for equipment thirty years ago but not now pirow replied helens voice cut in i cant see the end of them there are thousands and thousands of them there are blue whales everywhere i have found the breedingground of the blue whale big small bulls cows calves ive never seen any thing like it blast the girl roared upton blast blast blast just at this moment of moments everyone between here and south georgia must have heard our positionincluding thorshammer pirow stood as if undecided the luger in his hand helens bombshell had put them off their guard but i missed my opportunity give me that gun went on upton get to your radio do something pirow hurried off but upton and walter remained behind theyll be safe enough if we lock them in here for the moment said upton how long will it be before that bloody islander comes round an hour maybe two shrugged walter what does it matter anyway yes echoed upton what does it matter anyway its wetherby who is the problem he smiled without humour i thought i was up against something in the great captain wetherby of wartime fame i didnt even get a run for my money one kick in the face of his friend and the whole show was over come peter the door crashed to and i heard the lock turn i knelt down and tried to do something about sailhardys face it was a savage wound and he would carry the scars to the end of his life the way upton talked he did not intend either sailhardy s life or mine to reach its natural span i looked round the cabin but escape seemed hopeless my cabin was situated at the end of the corridor beyond the solid steel bulkhead were the big compartments for processing the whales the porthole was there but short of jumping into the sea it offered no escape for me my own danger was not uppermost in my mind i was thinking of helen and i hated upton for his part in moulding her fashioning her whole existence to be the instrument of his dream thompson island it was typical of the man that he had not confided his secret to her but in the shock of her own escape long ago in norway the lack of a mother had so influenced hernot unwillingly i told myself but that was her part of the story unknown to himto be the brilliant but oulless automaton i had first met i could not get out of my mind the transformation i had witnessed on the ice and the vital attractive personality i had seen as she had stood in this very cabin doorway saiihardy stirred but did not regain consciousness i tore off part of my sleeve and made an improvised bandage i waited after about half an hour i heard the roar of the helicopters rotors overhead as helen came in to land in less than five minutes there was a knock at the cabin door i did not reply bruce helen called bruce are you all right yes i called helen for gods sake get me a gun or a knife and let me out of here my father seems beside himself she called softly i gave him the slip for a moment i heard the sound of her footsteps running back along the corridor i nearly jumped out of my skin as the tannoy spoke axm canberra international antarctic weather analysis centre wmo code fm fortyfive on the zero zero gmt analysis i looked in astonishment at the grilled space above the bulkhead upton and pirow must have forgotten to switch off the repeater from the radio shack then i heard uptons voice nothing but bloody weather reports thats all there ever is from the antarctic pirows voice intent came through i told you let a ship send eleven letters and ill find her thorshammer is silent it doesnt surprise me i heard walter say christ after all weve done to keep our position dark upton was rattled his voice was harsh with anxiety try and get thorshammer carl change frequency do any damn thing the herr kapitan wetherby should be here came pirows cool voice well try eighteen and twentyfour metres raiders frequency there was a pause then uptons voice broke in what is it carl have you got her thorshammer replied pirow shes flown off the seaplane i heard the crash of a telephone receiver being picked up bjerko snapped upton alter course turn away south and west full speed ahead i felt the pulse of the factory ship start to quicken under the cabin floor that wont help at all said pirow the seaplane will be using radar anyway thorshammer took a hell of a risk flying her off in this sea it just shows how important she considers us said walter theres nothing we can do now to avoid being caught dont throw in the bloody towel before youre even hit said upton curtly im not beaten by a long chalk by all thats holy i heard him say slowly wetherby has been of more use than he thinks well keep our previous course well hide away in the heart of his socalled atmospheric machine if its anything like he says therell be so much fog and ice that thorshammer will never find us and in that weather she wont be able to use her seaplane my heart sank as i heard him pick up the telephone and order bjerko to return to our former course the ship had scarcely had time to settle on the south and west course we were now racing towards our doom as fast as the screws could turn by the vibration i could tell that the antarcticas engines were being pushed to the limit in my minds eye i saw that deceptively calm sea damped by the ice as the crystals formed and thickening to a viscousporridgelike consistency the loss of speed as a ship fought against the massive drag of the sea starting to freeze the great bank of fog which was the invariable accompaniment of the freezeup and finally the rapid coagulation of water into jaws of ice which would clamp like a vice round the ship and crush her to death anything from the seaplane asked upton yes said pirow steering straight here she cant miss shell be overhead in less than a couple of hours peter came uptons voice when do you think at our present speed we will be in wetherbys danger area maybe twelve hours replied we could avoid thorshammer intercepting us herself today and during the darkness tonight we could dodge her went on upton by early tomorrow the weather will probably start to become pretty bad with thorshammer minus the seaplane we have a sporting chance minus the seaplane echoed pirow uptons voice was brittle when he spoke after a pause even allowing for the quality of the loudspeaker your spandauhotchkiss is a very fine weapon peter pirows voice held a thrillwhether of dismay or astonishment i could not tell youll get walter to shoot down a planea naval planein cold blood in peacetime i could tell from the way upton said it that he had just thought it up and novelty of the idea appealed to him no not walter captain wetherby will shoat down thors hammers seaplane i went closer to the loudspeaker grille to make sure i was not dreaming it was a closedcircuit affair between the cabin and the radio office but the voices were as close as if they had been talking next door and reaching me through an open ventilator the diabolical ingenuity of uptons mind revealed itself as he went on we now have the chart and both wetherby and the islander are only in the way he said sailhardy is easy to dispose of walter will rough him up a bit more and hell be found tomorrow morning or the morning after lying under one of the big tackles aft poor fellow theyll say the tackle came adrift in the gale and its whole two tons fell on him walter interjected someone else will have to do the job specially since itll be at night i cant shuffle backwards and forwards from aurora in a small boat with a tiny engine in these seas it was bad enough today if the weather becomes anything like wetherby says itll be impossible it is not vital said upton ill smash him up myself the herr kapitan wetherby is the one to be afraid of said pirow i wondered wryly if he was thinking of the meteors end i want to see you force him to shoot down thorshammers plane so do i said walter the voices receded and i jumped up and jammed my ear against the loudspeaker i heard only a word here and there luger take him across to aurora clear them out of the way of course theyre your crew walter lash his wrists one each side of the trigger uptons voice and the others sank into an incomprehensible mutter what in gods name was upton about i asked myself it was obvious from the scraps of conversation i had heard that i was to be tied to the spandauhotchkiss and be made to take the blame for shooting down the seaplane how then i saw walter would take one harness and i would be lashed into the otherit must have been the crew upton had been referring to about clearing them out of the way in the sort of seas we were encountering the only members of the crew who would be about would be those strictly on duty a handful of men who could easily be ordered out of the way the gun itself was situated aft the wheelhouse and the helmsman would not be able to see what was going on without leaving his post i guessed walter would come to take me across to aurora from my cabin hed stick the luger in his pocket and be at my back the voice became stronger as the three men moved about the radio office i could pick up uptons words faint at first and then stronger other harness wetherby will be helpless shoot the bloody thing down and dont fluff it do you hear walter there was a surly mutter and then pirows voice was clear it is clever sir frederick so wetherby takes all the blame if thorshammer should catch us i lost the end of uptons sentence but the beginning sent me cold the blameand the bullet through the head with the luger cut him loose i could see it in my minds eye a burst from the spandauhotchkiss from walter which would send the seaplane into the sea a bullet for me and then a fake rescue attempt walter shouting to the helmsman to alter course to the crashed plane knowing full well that the cold water would kill them in three minutes and then walter explaining how he had been obliged to shoot me to stop my madness with the gun the pieces fitted together with diabolical cunning the voices became so faint i had to strain to hear what about the other skippers asked pirow they wont like it they may turn against you turnto whom asked upton confidently thors hammer dont be crazy can you see them simply handing themselves over to thorshammer never theyre in this thing too deep already and theyll be deeper in still after the seaplane has been shot down i heard a mirthless chuckle if you miss the seaplane peter ill come after you with a luger myself i looked at the unconscious man on the floor sailhardy and i had been in some tight spots during the war but this looked tougher than any of them i could see only one way to save our lives and that was to tell upton the real secret of thompson island the bargain would be purely onesided for upton would certainly never tell me now what he was really after on thompson island it would be a plain barter for our lives with upton raking in all the winnings the tannoy repeated the slam of the radio office door after the crunch of footsteps it remained alive but silent except for an occasional splutter of morse pirow must have been left alone on watch an hour dragged by and then another half sailhardy moaned and stirred from time to time but did not come round a kick like walters would have killed anyone less tough than the islander my only ally outside the cabin seemed to be helen would she though having been so long under her fathers sway assist me even if she wanted to i strained every sense to hear her footsteps outside but everything remained silent another five minutes dragged by the tannoy broke into life i heard a door open and almost at the same moment uptons voice yes carl yes i could not help admiring the brilliant dispassionate professionalism of the man with the immaculate hand seaplane reporting ship contacts to thorshammer five ship contacts on her radar shes picked up the fleet breathed upton shes picked us up pirows voice was impersonal no sighting reports only radar contacts he spoke slowly telling me he was reading back the seaplanes signals to the destroyer as she came in t o w a r d s o u r f l e e t r a d a r c o n t a c t f i v e s h i p s t w o z e r o zero degrees surface wind fortyfour knots there was a pause then he resumed preparing to orbit fleet as soon as make visual sighting will run in and turn on target roger a tinge of irony crept into pirows voice thorshammer replies roger signal fleets position and course i tensed as i heard uptons words peter he said fetch wetherby and get over to aurora you know what to do youre sure you will be ok in the boat by yourself im ok i heard walter grunt have someone start the engine while i collect wetherby i have one hand on the tiller and other on the luger heh good man replied upton i heard the heavy clump of walters seaboots as he left the radio office to come down to my cabin the weakest link in uptons disposal plan for me seemed to be the time i would be alone in the boat with walter crossing to aurora he would be fully on the alert but he would not know i had overheard them i told myself i must also get out of the cabin as quickly as i could before walter realised the tannoy was switched on i prayed that neither upton nor pirow would speak while walter was in the cabin the door swung open the luger looked like a plaything in his massive fist come he said i want no tricks from you you royal navy bastard he started to move towards sailhardy but he backed as i walked quickly to the entrance you swine i replied i think youve killed him good he replied then there is no need to look closer he shut the door the tannoy had kept silent i walked away from the cabin door and then stopped in the long corridor i faced walter up on deck he snarled no tricks i am an excitable man with a gun we go to my ship now not until i have spoken to sir frederick upton i said no he retorted i learned against the steel wall i knew their plan they could not dispose of me down here if youre so keen to get me to your ship hammer me unconscious like sailhardy i sneered go ahead walter looked nonplussed if it was me i would shoot you here he blustered why must you see sir frederick go and jump over the side i said either i see sir frederick or i stay here ok he conceded after a pause we go to the companionway there where theres a telephone no speaking on deck you can tell sir frederick what you want to say there was an emergency telephone by the companionway leading up to the main deck i rang the bridge and asked for sir frederick upton his voice came back vibrant full of good humour i cut short his bonbomie listen upton i said ive been thinking over this thompson island business uptons voice went cold no whining wetherby you playeddamn badly i might sayand lost the chart is mine it stays so that chart is not nearly as valuable as you seem to think i started to say i assure you you wont find thompson island in the position on the chart the key is missing i alone know where thompson island is ill take you there in exchange for an unconditional safeconduct back to cape town for sailhardy and myself unharmed and with the run of the ship upton laughed so loud i had to keep the phone away from my ear it is really incredible he said first my daughter become starryeyed because the great captain wetherby makes her land on an icefloe god alone knows why but it is so what sort of line you shot i wouldnt know then you yourself come along with a cockandbull story about the chart being wrong and you being the only person who knows where thompson is situated balderdash ill go further i said let us take the fleet to where the chart says thompson is if it is there you can turn me over to thorshammer and ill take the rap for all this business if not then upton gave his answer characteristically the receiver at the other end was slammed down walter gestured with the luger up on deck quick theres not much time we go to aurora i had no option i walked ahead of him once we had reached the deck he kept close behind me the luger hidden out of sight in his jacket pocket once i caught a sideways glimpse of the halfshaven face i could see that walter was all set for his killing orgy for he was grinning slightly and the face was alive with a kind of sadistic joy he would not need any excuse to kill me auroras boat hung in the davits engine running walter m o t i o n e d m e a h e a d m o c k i n g l y a f t e r y o u c a p t a i n wetherby two stolid norwegian sailors were at the boatfalls there was nothing to do but obey i climbed aboard and the two sailors dropped the boat skilfully into the sea walter threw in the gear with one hand keeping the other on the concealed luger as we gathered way he held the tiller and the luger as i had overheard him tell upton he would the tiny craft bucked in the swell to throw myself at walter would have meant upsetting the boat and drowning both of us aurora had lost way and i saw the measure of walters seamanship as he brought the tiny boat alongside the low bulwarks of the catcher jump captain grinned walter jump for your mel i ll be right behind you i jumped as we swung level with the bulwarks coming down heavily on the deck walter had judged it to a nicety he did not even wait for the next wave he too jumped rope in hand while two of his crew secured the boat despite his bulk he was on his feet as agilely as a cat he grinned again and stripped off his jacket thrusting the luger into his trousers pocket under the thick black woollen sweater his chest seemed more massive than before he shouted something in norwegian to the two men on deck who disappeared below you are a fighting man captain he leered now you see my own special ackack gun in action heh you even sit in one of its harness he laughed again i said nothing his face went heavy with anger all right you royal navy bastard get up there ahead of me as i started to go up the bridge ladder walter snarled something at the first mate who also went below above decks the only person visible was the helmsman and the lookout in the crows nest walter bellowed at him too i glanced upwards at the lookout i saw a tiny flash of silver in the sky far out to port walter saw it too walter half thrust me up the last few rungs on the steel ladder leading from the bridge to the gun platform at the top out of the helmsmans sight he pulled out the luger the brutal face was tense into the hotchkiss harness quick we havent much time he grabbed me by the neck of my jacket with his left hand and savagely rammed the harness down over my head and shoulders once i was in its straitjacket grip he came round and deftly threw a loop of rope round the trigger guard but not about the swivel bar leaving my arms at half stretch to the trigger with my face hard up against the sight walter pushed the luger loosely into his waistband and slipped quickly into the harness of the spandau he swung the double weapon round taking me with it i could see the seaplane passing over the outermost ship of the fleet the crozet still fully five miles away from the factory ship the hotchkiss long metal sight was at full extension above the cooling ribs in the middle of the weapon walters right eye was screwed up against the rubbermounted sight at the rear of the spandau and i could see the line of his teeth as he kept his left eye firmly closed our faces were only nine inches apart his breath was foul with stale schnapps his right hand was on the trigger beneath the long curve of the narwhal tusks the seaplane started to make a long dive towardsthe factory ship it came into my sights although i was expecting it the heavy roundaminute burst of the spandau took my breath away cordite fumes blew back the two weapons were beautifully synchronised and as walter swung the spandau to keep his sights on the seaplane so mine held steady on it i saw my chance if i too joined in the firing using my left hand to pull the hotchkiss trigger i could not help having my right wrist hard up against the spent cartridge ejectment outlet the hotchkiss fires fourteen hundred rounds a minute thought and action came simultaneously i pulled the trigger pushing my right wrist against the outlet the searing blast of whitehot gas snapped the rope i yelled with pain as it scorched my wrist at the same moment i threw full weight against the harness to drag the double weapon down a double stream of tracerlighted lead arced through the sky wide of the seaplane i cut my fire jamming my left knee against the centre metal support of the gun to win control from walter the tracers flew wide of the plane in a golden orbit using all his strength walter swung the double weapon back round against my hold sighting on the aircraft the heavy bullets from the spandau tore into its flimsy fuselage the machine fluttered down towards aurora yawed wildly passed almost between the big gantries of the factory ship and fell into the sea beyond the splash looked like the combined spout of a family of blue whales my hands were already at walters throat as he fought to get clear of his harness i kicked his feet from under him as he fumbled i was still held in the straitjacket grip of the hotchkiss harness walter fell rolled dragged himself on one elbow pulling the luger from his waistband he raised the automatic to fire i swivelled the twin interlocked muzzles to their maximum depression fixed on walter stark terror leapt into his face i fired the spray of bullets ripped into the deck plating turning everything into a blinding hell of redhot ricochets and noise walter was too close even at maximum depression the guns although firing straight at him could not reach down far enough the stream of bullets was passing over him the deck was shredded but walter was unharmed he launched himself forward under the swath of death grabbed the silent spandau by the chain which runs from its watercooler backwards and swung the double weapon backwards so that the barrels pointed wildly skywards i hung off my feet above the gut platform looking at the antarctica the helicopter was rising from the flensing platform i shouted insanely impotently at helen walter raised the luger and fired terror struck through me at what i saw below me it was the sea it had turned to honey i knew what it meant no sailors sea i gasped for breath i was drowning in the bland jellylike stuff which i had seen below me from auroras gun platform wavering between consciousness and unconsciousness i snatched a lungful of air the honey jelly had tried to drown my ship once my soggy mind said and now it was trying to drown me i gulped down some more air its lifegiving oxygen cleared my brain momentarily i saw that the pale mercuric oxide yellow light was not honey jelly nor was i in the sea as in my semiconscious state i had imagined the colour of the light was reflected from the ceiling and it was the ceiling of my cabin aboard antarctica i fought again for air i remembered hanging from the hotchkiss harness and beneath me in the sea there seemed to be a substance floating everywhere like silky jelly below auroras rail the sea had been covered with it some of the individual slabs being up to two feet square at the moment came the recollection of walter firing the luger into my face the agony of the recollection and of what the honey jelly meant broke my semiconsciousness i jerked myself upright in my bunk the cabin swam round me and as i put my hand to my head i felt the bandages take it easy bruce said helen i had not seen her in the pale diffused light i wondered how long i had lain unconscious hearing her speak too brought a new surge of recollection walter had fired the luger and almost at the same moment i had felt the gouge of pain in my head from the bullet i remembered falling out of the harness into the sea the honeyjelly sea and then the roar of the helicopters rotors overhead and the unutterable relief of feeling the machines horsecollar rescue gear snatch me from the icy sea i had been in the water less than a minute for the second time helen had shown her superb skill by saving my life all the rest was blank helen i got out how long have i been here what time is it its hours since i picked you out of the sea she said its early afternoon early afternoon i echoed the strange light showed it must be turning dark up top in the early afternoon i knew there could be almost no hope of saving antarctica now my eyes slewed to the gyrorepeater i tried to get out of my bunk but helen held me back my head seemed to split with pain i scarcely recognised my own voice helen get on to the voicepipe for gods sake tell bjerko to alter course were steering right into it its death i tell you she looked at me with her strange eyes which were full of shadows in the pale light there are a lot of things i want to hearfrom you and you alone brucebefore i start worrying about our course i can wait but the course cant i said i told you about the danger of being nipped in the ice the honey jelly in the sea was the outrider of the packice and that yellow light outside means were running into the second advance guardfog she shook her head if that is so it is too late anyway youre wounded and i want to know why i saw you being held up at pistolpoint and i want to know why i saw you fall from walters ackack weapon into the sea minutes before i watched that same weapon shoot down a defenceless seaplane after i had picked you up i tried to find the seaplane or its crew but it had already sunk why are you wounded i realised that the heavy luger bullet must have shattered off the casing of the spandau and that the fragments had knocked me senseless walter had missed mebut only just the bandage had stopped the blood so the wound could not be deep i hauled myself over the side of the bunk and called the bridge on the voicepipe helen made to attempt to stop me this time but sat immobile watching me bjerko i said wetherby here this course is suicide we might still get clear on another steer i glanced at the gyrorepeater sixoh full speed ahead there was a pause and i heard bjerko say something when the norwegian captain replied there was a note of sarcasm in his voice i thank you for your advice captain wetherby and so does sir frederick upton sir frederick says you have had a nasty experience and you need rest the ship is in good hands good hands i started to exclaim but the instrument clicked off were steering eightfive degrees i said to helen bjerko says i trailed off at her shrug i asked how you came to be wounded she said levelly i stumbled to the bunk and half sat half lay on it i told her in detail about norris chart the ransacking of my cabin the fragments of the plot i had overheard on the tannoy and how my fears had been realised when walter had lashed me to the spandauhotchkiss and tried to kill me she listened without saying a word her only outward sign of agitation showed when i mentioned her fathers mysterious interest in thompson island and his instructions to walter to get rid of me when i landed in the helicopter with you unconscious my father told me that walter had been through to him on the wt walter my father said told him that you had gone berserk aboard aurora at the sight of the ackack gun it happens my father says a man like yourself has some dormant killerinstinct left over from the war he sees a weapon like the spandauhotchkiss all his wartime agonies come alive again he isnt really responsible yet he is a killer all the same walter says it happened on the russian convoys too and how does walter account for this i said fingering the bloodstained bandage he says you were hit by an exploding spandau shell splinter after you had turned the gun into the deck for some unexplained reason he considers he was lucky to get away with his life and what do you think i asked i stared at her there was something different about her i noticed then that she was no longer wearing her leather flying kit but a warm dress of mulberry as deep as the colour we had seen together in the sea her answer suddenly became of great importance to me only hours ago the importance would have lain in my having an ally now i could have watched the light change through her eyes for hours had i not known that each darker shadow from outside brought antarctica one step nearer her end the pale yellow glow which seemed to heighten the fine line of her cheekbones and illuminate the strange eyes wasdeath something of the southern ocean has passed into my father into walter into you into sailhardy she said quietly as if exercising all the control she had built up in the past kill or be killed now you give me your reasonthompson island that isnt an answer to my question i said no she said the answer perhaps is that i am sitting here have been sitting here for hourswaiting for a man everyone considers a coldblooded murderer to come round my father swore i wouldnt be allowed to but she smiled faintly here i am i also know that when i saw you fall off the gun into the sea something died inside me i might have lived three minutes in the cold i said i know that she answered i also know that the person who couldnt muster courage to land on an icefloe died when you sent me up to watch thorshammer that could not have brought you up alive out of the sea do you believe i had some sort of blackout and shot down a defenceless seaplane i pressed again she replied obliquely i gave the fleets position away deliberately to thorshammer when i saw the blue whales what i exclaimed you were in effect turning your father over to the norwegian authorities deliberately yes she said so you saw too without even knowing that it was thompson island that was behind all this guarana buccaneers brandythese are the accoutrements of a ruthless killer i underestimated the bond between her father and herself she was on her feet in an instant how dare you how dare you i admire my father and i intend to protect him i gave the fleets position away to prevent him coming to further harm if were inside norwegian territorial watersso what my father can afford a fine even a stiff one he hasnt killed a solitary whale thorshammer can arrest us my father may have gone a bit astray in his enthusiasm to find the breedingground of the blue whale so much so that he is prepared to shoot down a seaplane and kill two innocent lads in it either walter or you or both shot down the seaplane not my father she flashed back no wonder pirow says herr kapitan what do you know about pirow i asked she looked surprised hes a firstclass radio operator thats all i told her about the man with the immaculate hand she sat down her eyes wide what are you trying to say bruce ive said it i replied thompson island what do you know about thompson island why does your father want so desperately to find thompson island her face was drawn in the odd light id never heard of thompson island until you mentioned it your father is quite prepared to kill off sailhardy and myself now he has the chart i said i have tried to tell him the chart is useless by itself you dont know it but i am the only living man to have seen thompson island i alone know where thompson island is it is not where the chart says she got up impulsively and held her hand across my mouth bruce for gods sake dont some unknown rock sticking out into an icy ocean suddenly becomes a killer and the thing that dominates all our lives im frightened something wicked and enormous is building up even the sky is ghastly look it getting quite dark your father is building up the evil i said he has got to be stopped perhaps that is why i gave our position away from the helicopter she replied thoughtfully i didnt know any of this you have told me but intuitively i felt my father a flicker of fear passed through her eyes helen i said gently dont you see all this means one thing and one thing onlyyour father must be protected against himself she came and stood above me as i halflay on the bunk she reached out and took my hands in hers they were cold youre saying youre saying my father is mad i talked round it when a leading interest becomes an obsession as it has with your father it is only one stage further to a state of monomania i dont know enough about what has led up to this expedition nor do i know what your fathers obsessional interest is but i do know that it centres on thompson island however no one goes to the lengths he has done just in order to rediscover an island which admittedly is one of the seas great mysteries i have tried to find out what your father is after i failed i am only seeing effect without the cause and i grinned wryly one of the effects was damn nearly my death i feel so alone in this she said i have only you to turn to try and think back i said how did this expedition come to be fitted out did something sudden happen did your father say anything he was crazy about rare metals helen replied you see what happened to his face he threw himself into that research with everything he had that was twentyodd years ago i said wait she said there was something now you come to mention it both he and i have made trips to the antarctic for about five years now he was never like he is now though he enjoyed the voyages and he was always full of interest always asking everyone we met about unusual places and discoveries thompson island i suggested i never heard him mention it she said ive often heard him speak about bouvet i i what was the something i persisted it wasnt here in the antarctic at all she said it was back in london perhaps about eighteen months ago i remember he came home one evening and i could see he was very excited he said he had bought out an old sealing firm and he had found some interesting things amongst some old a thrill of disbelief passed through my mind two years previously the firm of wetherbys had finally passed out of existence i knew however that it had been bought by a small company called stewarts whaling company upton had not figured as far as i knew what was the name of the sealing firm i asked she shook her head i dont know i wasnt really interested all i remember is that he spent most of the evening examining some things that looked like bullseyes bullseyes you know those black sweets with the white streaks in them and then after that everything seemed to go with a rush he was here there and everywhere negotiating for ships stores maps and so on he practically organised this whole expedition himself i presumed it was just another trip south she went on and smiled you see bruce i wasnt the same person then as i amhave becomenow my own reaction was that my challenge was to met and i geared myself both physically and mentally to meet it most of my time was spent flying doing tricky landings being in the air when the weather was at its worst until now i never thought of this expedition except as being strictly subjective in relation to myself and my problems my father gave me everything i wanted encouraged me in every way you never saw the bullseyes again no he never said what they were no he spent a good deal of time at the admiralty and later he flew to germany he was there a couple of weeks and pirow he joined the ship the day before we sailed i have had no reason to suspect him until you told me who he was to me he was simply a firstclass radio operator where is sailhardy i asked is he still alive hes in irons locked in one of the cabins opposite i patched him up as best i could how does your father allow you to have keys to these cabins i asked surely he might fear you would release us or at least get possession of the keys she shook her head i appointed myself nurse to both of you my father shouted and swore but obviously thought you were both so far gone that you would not be a threat to anyone it would have been different had he known i sent off the message about our position deliberately he couldnt stop me nursing you without giving away his real intentions about you im only the nurse in their eyes you see she smiled faintly he still sees me as i was how was sailhardy hurt i told her and she shuddered dear god there has been enough violence already what are we to do your father has got to be restrained i said that means i must get control of this ship i shallif you will help what are you going to do she asked wideeyed youre not not planning to harm my father no i replied but i wont promise about walter i got down from the bunk my legs felt a lot steadier i want a fiensing knife and a hacksaw youll find plenty of both in the racks in there i nodded to the bulkhead beyond which lay the whaleprocessing compartments are you sure there are no guards on the doors no bruce were stopping the ship is stopping antarcticas heartbeat slowed yes i said this ship has made her number for the last time at lloyds she wont last long now what are you saying bruce the yellow stuff in the sea i replied honey jelly of the southern ocean it means that the ice is right on top of us i dont understand it looked like floating pumice to me it wasnt pumice helen it was millions upon millions of tiny little creatures called ostrocods they come from a thousand maybe two thousand fathoms deep you mean to say they are living creatures she asked incredulously those clusters of honeycoloured jelly theyre dead i said thats why they are on the surface it is also why i say the ice is here listen last year when the liner corinthic sailed nine hundred miles through a sea of honeycoloured stuff near pitcairn island in the pacific the papers dressed it up as the number one sea mystery of the year i still dont get the significance of it she said it doesnt matter a damn whether or not millions of ostrocods live or die i explained what is significant and especially to this ship at this momentis that they died suddenly and they died because the cold killed them they had been born in the first place when the antarctic winter came to an end the spring brought warmth now the cold has returned and the return of the coldmeans ice i said ice bouvets own packice but the ice is five hundred miles away she protested the dangerous ice is safe and sound now on the antarctic mainland for the summer which is just starting i told you what we were heading into i replied this is it when i first saw the honeysea from auroras gun i reckoned antarctica was on the outer wing of a gigantic crescent of ice that is the way the bouvet pack forms there are two huge wings anything up to a hundred miles apart the rapid freeze spreads from wing to wing like a running fuse once it starts when i saw the way we were steering i yelled at bjerko to turn sixty degreesin other words due eastat full speed to avoid the freezeup between the wings were finished are you sure im surer of this helen i replied than of anything except some inner feelings at the moment she turned away take a look at the barometer i added she got up and faced the glass in open disbelief it cant fall twenty millibars in the three hours youve been here a pressure drop like that would mean a storm to end the world i smiled grimly ive seen it do better just south of where we are it went down twentyseven millibars in six hours during the war i saw it happen the bottom is dropping out of the weather geoffrey jenkins a grue of ice she paced up and down im frightened bruce frightened of whats happening to us to the weather frightened of whats happening about my father what now the weather atom bomb is being primed i said theres nothing to do but await the explosion the simplest way to visualise it is that two extreme air masses are about to join battle we are now awaiting the onslaught bruce she exclaimed youyou of all people just cant sit back fatalistically and await death were at a standstill but theres no swell no wind even we have thrown ourselves into the heart of the machine that makes the worst weather in the world i said i once got clear of a similar situation in hms scott in these very waters it took a destroyer and every bit of her thirty knots to get clear this is literally the calm before the storm and that storm will rage for a week or more across four thousand miles of empty ocean and smash anything that lies in its path you cant just write off five ships like this she said beyond the porthole it was growing darker five ships i had been thinking in terms of one by heavens helen five ships i knowill bring the catchers in in line astern and keep an ice lead open even if it starts to freeze round antarctica the catchers are smaller more mobile with a shallower draughtit will be tricky but it can be done i saw in my minds eye how i could take antarctica out sternfirst along a lead through the ice which the catchers would patrol at their best speed possible to keep the thick sea from coagulating before i could get the factory ship clear ill want your help with the helicopter too i told her think you can manage in this sort of halffog she smiled its just this sort of situation ive been grooming myself for for years i looked for my seaboots i grinned at her who changed me this is a new pair of polar socks a faint flush spread beneath the fine cheekbones your seaboots are under the bunk they werent very wet i dried your sweater its in that drawer with your shirts i looked at her as i pulled the polonecked coldcheating sweater over my head we have got to be quick ill carry these boots so the others wont hear me coming we must free sailhardy first wait a moment while i get the hacksaw and the knife she said ill i stood back from the entrance as she opened the door carefully and looked up and down the corridor she disappeared and was back within three minutes with the things i had asked for it wasnt a hacksaw but a baleen saw for whale tusks but it would do together we crossed the still corridor the fog seemed everywhere even the lights seemed dimmer helen unlocked sailhardys door the cabin was dark and the switch gave a click as i turned it on the electric light bulb had been removed i groped and found the islander its bruce i whispered there was a faint clink from his manacles how are you man i asked his reply was stilted as if he had difficulty in articulating okay bruce boy are you free yes i said and i outlined my plan first i said we would overpower pirow in the radio shack and then break suddenly on to the bridge and seize upton and bjerko i hadnt worked out how to get hold of walter and with her wicked weapon aurora would be a handful helen interrupted what about walter though hell be on the bridge too how did he get aboard i asked while you were unconscious my father ordered me to fetch him from aurora that is very good said sailhardy the menace in his voice sent a shiver through me hes mine bruce mine are you strong enough to tackle him i asked anxiously i dont want anything more to happen leave him to me boy came the voice in the darkness now get these damned things off my wrists i felt for his wrists and started to saw why are we stopped bruce he asked honeysea i said my god he exclaimed i heard the sharp intake of his breath has the ice closed on her yet no i said sketching my plan to save the factory ship is there still any water sky asked sailhardy i think so i said i couldnt see too well from my porthole water sky asked helen what is that big leaden patches in the fog where the sky should be i said it means that below it there are open leads of water unfrozen sea it shows its reflection against the sky the saw cut through the centre section of the manacles were wasting time he said we still have a sporting chance of saving our skins leave pirow to me i said in the dim corridor outside sailhardy looked like an avenging fiend there was a mask of dried blood over his face and his teeth glinted raggedly the steel was still round his wrists and a piece of cut chain hung down from each come i said to helen keep well behind us out of harms way look after yourself for gods sake she whispered in single file myself leading sailhardy behind and helen in the rear we went silently up the steel ladder to pirows radio office we dodged through uptons empty big cabin pirows door was closed putting down my seaboots i held the long knife in my right hand and opened the door quickly with my left pirow wore his headphones his back to us i put the point of the knife against his neck i said softly in german the man with the immaculate hand sailhardy moved like a panther to pirows right perhaps it was his initial terror at the sight of the bloodied islander that made him say so much herr kapitan he mouthed herr kapitan i do not know i swear it heavenly blue that is all i know it is sir fredericks secret not mine i dont know heavenly bluewhat pirow i noted the quick flash of comprehension in his eyes when he saw the knifethrust wasnt coming then and there he started to fumble for words the immaculate hand edged over to the morse key i reversed the knife and struck his knuckles with the handle he rose to his feet white with pain come i said youll go up first on the bridge ill be right behind you and youll catch the first bullet if your friend walter starts shooting helen was white too as we threaded our way back through uptons cabin i put pirow in the lead up the short ladder to the bridge sailhardy was almost alongside me his eagerness made me feel almost sorry for what was coming to walter we emerged silently on to the bridge my knifepoint touching pirows back walter was standing near the helm indicator trying to see out into the fog upton was close to the starboard wing both were engrossed walter i called i held pirow in front of me with my left hand as a shield the thickset norwegian swung round upton and bjerko stood rooted to the spot sailhardys left thumb tapped against his palm with that idiosyncrasy of his which preceded physical action walter cast one startled glance at my knife he whipped the luger out but was still fumbling with the safetycatch when sailhardy slid forward and struck him with the sawnoff manacle he screamed with pain as the shackle bit his wrist i leaped forward and snatched the automatic from where it had fallen on the gratings knife and luger in hand i guarded the four men before i could say anything there was a heavy bump forward by the bows the indeterminate definition went from the light we were out of the fog in place of the veillike watery obscurity of a moment before the light was clear and hard the razoredged bank of fog lay immediately astern it was forward that we gazed transfixed the sun hung like a bloodfilled grape underneath the whole world was blue a cold grue of terror it would have been less terrifying if antarctica had rushed headon through the fog and destroyed herself against the massive icecliff which rose before us as it was the bump of her bow against the ice held the menace of a longdrawnout death the sudden drop of the fogcurtain astern heightened the aweprovoking spectacle which lay before our eyes the fact that i had warned upton against just this did not mitigate my own fear the same fear as had once made me thrust the bridge telegraph of hms scott to full speed aheadanything anything to escape with all the thrust of her great turbines from the same platelike crystals of ice called by whalermen frazil crystals which now hung halfsubmerged in the sea everywhere plates of ice which come together with uncanny speed and form the ice belt which is bouvets killer antarctica seemed to have touched against the central buttress of the encircling semicircle of packice nowhere was any white ice to be seen to port the cliff blocked out all view but to starboard the field was low perhaps only twenty feet above the level of the sea a vast agglomeration of blue hummocks and pressure ridges stretched away into the distance as far as the eye could see within a hundred yards of the iceedge was a huge domed mound smoothed and fashioned by the wind and a series of lesser mounds stretched away behind the ice was all shades and variations of blueazure where the parody of a sun struck down royal blue where the fluted striated cliffs to port overhung the leadenblue sea at our backs lay the bank of strontiumyellow fog the knife i held had turned aconite the air off the blue icefield was as raw and sharp as the blade itself i wanted to cough as it took me by the throat the human antagonisms which had been present a moment before were swamped by what the southern ocean had conjured up before our startled eyes the blue light gave pirows shocked white face the pallor of a ghost there seemed almost no need to guard upton walter and pirow they were so overcome by what they saw this is it i said to upton i warned you but you wouldnt listen his eyes were very bright and the way he spoke made me surer of his mental state i had a gun and a knife in my hand but he addressed me with the same easy inescapable charm as on our first meeting bruce boy he said you wouldnt be here if i didnt think you the finest sailor in the southern ocean i should have listened but its all yours now put those damned toys away this is what matters for the moment he jerked his head at the icefield his smile in the pewter mask was grotesque reflecting the blue antarctica was bumping gently against the icecliff in the still sea she was in no danger from the movement beyond the buckling of a few plates in her bows her danger lay in the millions of small spicules or thin plates of ice floating in the sea in the first stage of freezing soon they would lock together and add to the cliffs hillocks and ridges before us and in that process crush the big factory ships steel plates the offshore mass of bergy bits growlers sludge and pancake ice was witness of how quickly the sea was freezing the curious upturned edges of the pancake ice were already kissing and coalescing into evergrowing acres of thin ice for the moment there was a strange stillness broken only by a faint tinkling as the icerind splintered against antarcticas sides i remembered that deadly tinkle as i had shaken hms scott clear it had paralleled the distant sound of her engineroom telepraphs antarcticas bows could still cut through the iceplates but in a couple of hours they would freeze ironhard i knew that the intensity of the cold which now gripped us was changing even the crystal structure of the metal of the weapons i held soon they would become brittle as glass so would antarcticas plates making the task of the icevice easier still by now i thought upton must have read the annotation on the back of captain norris log norris was a sensitive manhis sketches of the lost thompson island showed that what he had written to complement the laconic decklog version of his discovery revealed his terror at seeing the same icekiller as we were seeing now norris had known then it meant death and who knows to what eventual ghastly end he and his gallant sprightly went i could recall by heart what norris had written the impress of fear was so vivid upon his words i s a w t h o m p s o n i s l a n d o n t h e m i d a f t e r n o o n o f december there was fog floating ice and a force gale from the northwest there was the island long and low in the foreground and a high peak more distantly the crew of the sprightly gazed awestruck at t h i s u n k n o w n h a v e n o f r e f u g e a m i d s t s e a s w h i c h b y contrast with their wild tumult made its icebound shores s e e m l i k e p a r a d i s e t h e g i a n t g l a c i e r w h i c h c a p p e d thompson island like a nightmare caul continued into the sea as a solid tongue of steelblue ice linking a gigantic unbroken icefleld on the southern horizon the grotesque nature of this single massive tongue like that of a malicefilled and possessive viper from the unknown regions of the pole struck a cold grue of terror into my men used even as they were to the hardships and evils of the wild southern ocean a cold grue of terror norris had used the scots word in all its force and the grue the thrill of naked fear which ran through me as i gazed at the blue icefield was as primordial as the birth of the killerpack yes i said to upton its saving our skins that matters most i spoke to sailhardy put them upton walter and bjerko in irons in uptons cabin the same with pirow in his radio office chain him near his transmitting key i may need him later sailhardy came over to me to take the luger at the same moment our ears were stunned by an immense thunder it was the icefield every rivet in the ship trembled a cluster of skua gulls rose in white detonation from the foot of the blue cliff the reverberation roared through the yellow fog helen buried her head against my thick sweater across the flat side of the icefield i saw a new mound ejaculate itself rustyrose as some hidden pressureforce threw up ice the size of st pauls cathedral bouvets conquistador with his sword of ice was coming at us if the ship were nipped we could still get stores ashore on the icepack but we would not survive as shackleton and others had done their ice had stayed solid i knew that bouvets pack when the albatross foot reached it would dissolve and leave us to drown we would die either of exposure on the ice or of drowning when the lifegiving warmth came i had to save antarctica i told myself before the challenge itself would have been enough but now i looked down at the fair hair against my shoulder i found myself shouting i was so deaf pirow signal the catchers tell them to form up in line astern and come through there i pointed at the plumes of vapour ghosting above the blue ice forming in the sea the way antarctica had come tell them to rush it and keep the lead open each one is to go full astern within three cables lengths of this ship i ll then go full astern and try and break out understood yes herr kapitan sailhardy ushered the prisoners away walter cursing under his breath and holding his injured wrist h e l e n d r e w h e r s e l f a w a y f r o m m e g o d i t l o o k s hopeless there are still open leads of water i said look at the clouds there above the icefieldsee the dark patches thats water sky which means that somewhere even in that lot there is some sea which is not frozen solidyet she shuddered the frostsmoke or vapour plumes which the whalermen call the barber could guide us to salvation yet my first job was to get the head of the factory ship clear of the icebuttress and keep the sea reasonably icefree at the stern even if the ice closed i thought rapidly we might escape the fate of the factory ship if i brought the catchers in to surround her with their shallow draught they might pop like peas in a pod out of the clutches of the ice without fatal damage whereas antarctica would be trapped because of her greater depth it was worth risking as a last resort there were however more immediate things to do aboard antarctica in the piercing cold i must get the water drained from the deck mains and have a steam hose run through them to clear the draincocks or else they would burst soon leaving us without a water supply i must also have the rudder strengthened with wire pendants to prevent its being unshipped as we crashed sternfirst through the ice my mind raced on i hoped that antarctica had been fitted out by someone icewise and that she had a propeller with removable blades for we seemed almost certain to damage one of the blades on projecting pieces of ice in getting clear breaking propeller blades was i knew from hard experience the commonest damage when trying in a situation like ours to extricate a ship from being nipped bruce said helen what do you intend to do with them particularly my father are you going to hand them over to thorshammer that question will have to wait i replied the ice is the danger go and get yourself as warmly dressed as you can pack something small let the valuables go if you have them a pair of warm gloves might be more use in the long run youre going to to abandon ship without even a fight she asked the fight is on i said quick now come back here sailhardy returned to the bridge he smiled grimly as he looked about him shes sick this ship sick with the cold get aft and trim her down well by the stern i ordered rig some steel wire pendants to the rudderhead from both quarters my god i indicated the echosounding equipment it showed fifteen fathomsin the middle of the southern ocean it meant that the cold was so intense that even the antifreeze in the transmitter and receiver tanks had started to freeze the ice was closing on antarctica quicker than i thought sailhardy let out a long whistle get steam through the mains i snapped down the bridge telephone to the maindeck scarcely had i said it when there was a scream of metal immediately below the bridge the winch through which the steam had to pass gave a quarterturn as the head of steam tried to burst through then the heavy piping already frozen inside ripped along its whole length as if it had been opened by a huge unseen tinopener helen came back to the bridge wearing a heavy coat of sealeopard skin she heard the scream of the metal but without speaking thrust my heavy gloves reefer jacket cap seaboots and duffel coat into my hands dragging them on i raced to the port wing of the bridge and looked at the sea it was viscous now as it froze sailhardy i said get down on the maindeck first before you rig the tackles have them bring iceaxes crowbars boathooks and poles up from below you know the drill get every man on the rails with poles and try and keep her sides free of ice then get a boat and dynamite and blow the ice at intervals of twenty yards asternwe must keep it open aye aye bruce he said tersely a moment later he was among the men if any man could save the ship through my lastditch drill he could helen was gazing astern the fog is rolling back bruce but i dont see the catchers its ominous that it should roll back it means the cold is spreading i replied i picked up the phone to pirow pirow what the hell is happening to the catchers his voice was cool professional no reply to my signals herr kapitan theyre talking between themselves on the w t sailhardys call from the maindeck interrupted what size charges bruce make them up into pieces of twenty pounds apiece i told him fuse em right up short i returned to pirow pirow im going full astern in a moment i may go hellbent into an iceberg whats the score with the radar too much subrefraction he replied levelly well be right on top of anything before i can locate it the normal detection range means nothing in conditions like this helen came with me to the starboard wing of the bridge i wanted if possible to see what was happening between the main body of the ice and ourselves as i leant over i saw i gripped her arm look i said a long underwater spur had grown out from the cliffside towards the ship it was perhaps ten feet long four others like the teeth of a steamshovel reached out at intervals further aft what is it bruce those spurs i replied i cant wait now any one of them will rip off a blade of the screw in this cold each blade is twice as brittle as normal one touch and it will splinter i raced back to the engineroom telephone chief engineer said the voice chief i said theres a lot of trouble theres sludge and brash ice everywhere in ten minutes your condenser inlets are going to choke before that i want everything your engines can give me understand get a steam hose to the condensers so that theres hot water circulating round them and for your own sake see theres no condensation in the main steam pipes or else youll be blown to hell in a moment ill be going alternately full ahead and full astern to shake her free if the inlets block with sludge i cant wait to stop can do aye said the scots voice can do is five minutes enough just i replied ill ring down i called sailhardy on deck belay the dynamite i said get the tackles rigged if you can i want you on the bridge in five minutes i turned to helen gazing whitefaced about her there was no sign of the catchers in her sealeopard coat she looked like one of those dead things i had seen so often on the icy outcrops of graham land do you want me to fly off the helicopter she started to say when suddenly she coughed i felt the sharp dagger of wind too it came softly furtively from the south i felt its sinister touch by the slight condensation on the inside of my duffel coat the wind was the last stage of the bouvet pack it would advance the iceedge more rapidly still towards the factory ship it was also the precursor a the storm which i knew would follow the freezeup the wind i said quickly i cant give the chief even his five minutes now i rang sailhardy and ordered him back to the bridge the islander joined helen and me the shoulder of his coat was streaked with red rust where he had slung himself over the ships quarter in a vain effort to rig the rudderhead tackles a white streak of frozen spray was daubed alongside the red the south wind bruce there was almost no need for him to say it he too had felt its message i nodded to the port wing of the bridge and together we looked down at the sleazy sea catching some of the suns attenuated light it had turned to a pale gelatinous coagulating mass sailhardy exclaimed helen seeing the look on our faces you and bruce together you two maam he said gentlythe long vowels were in his voice if this ship is adying you can be sure of one thing under captain bruce wetherby shell die the hard way he pointed across to the dark blue cliff where the ice rind had become young ice anything from a couple of inches to half a foot thick helen took the lapels of my duffel coat in her hands at first when i lay in that snowfilled ditch after the germans had shot me i prayed i prayed to god i prayed with every formal and informal prayer i knew i ran out of prayers after my brother had died i just lay there without hope almost without thought now the strange eyes were luminous and she shuddered as she looked at the icefield now i want to live then i did not if my prayers had names at this moment they would be bruce wetherby and sailhardy the islander i could find no words as i watched the lightblue rustypink and steelrosein her eyes it was sailhardy who spoke aye maam praying words dont help you any here in the southern ocean prayerwords dont break the ice like an icebreaker and at this moment id give all the jesuloverof mysoul for a northwest wind and two degrees on the mercury a cold grue of terror i relived norris fear as i saw the distant watersmoke start to throw up its dazed meridians into the dusty pinkblue light the transparent membranes surrounding the brains nervecentres contract and contort their spidersweb as a blow approachesthat is how i felt as i watched them and waited for the coming blow from the killerpack bruce helen started to say but i strode across to the bridge telegraph sailhardy i said the wheel full ahead i rang port twenty i told the islander as he took over from the norwegian quartermaster if she responds at all i picked up the phone to pirow pirow what are the catchers doing why arent they coming to help us theyre not answering my signals herr kapitan he replied send stand by to render immediate assistance factory ship in grave danger i heard the rapid tap of his key as he called up the catchers he was back on the phone in a moment no reply herr kapitan what the hell are they playing at they cant leave us like this have you got them on the radar again i admired the cool professional detachment of the man with the immaculate hand five radar contactsship contactsbearing eightoh degrees receding theyre deserting us i asked incredulously yes herr kapitan how far astern fourfive miles maybe are they moving yes herr kapitan fast twelve knots i reckon that meant they were in clear water beyond the deadly grip of the icecrescent pirow went on coolly shall i give a mayday call herr k a p i t a n i t m e a n s t h o r s h a m m e r w i l l h e a r i t t o o mayday a ships last desperate call for help yes i said as i put down the earpiece i heard the start of the distress call mayday mayday antarctica started to judder but she scarcely moved it was like handling a ferrari with a slipping clutch the screws thrashed sailhardy spun the spokes his look of despair told me everything i must try and shake her free astern i called the engineroom chief i sorry about this full astern there was a muffled oath ever hear of torsional stresses in shafting laddie but hed already shouted my order the shaft i slammed down the earpiece unexpectedly the great ship moved quickly astern as she did so a growler seemed to pop up in her wake perhaps the thrust of the screws had dislodged it from the main body of the icefield starboard i yelled hard astarboard sailhardy the islander couldnt make it the sea was seventenths ice it cloyed round the ship killing her manoeuvrability a sickening thump shook every rivet the rudderhead must have taken the force of the blow as antarctica crashed into the growler under full power she yawed wildly and tore in a crazy semicircle sternfirst at the cliff at the same moment i saw a long weal of splinters as the hummocked wall of ice could no longer stand the pressure which had built up in the icefield behind it broke off the roar of the avalanche drowned my shouted commands to sailhardy the great raft of stuff half a mile long and a quarter thick towered and then losing its balance untidily toppled and tossed the icerind high into the air in a thousand fragments the deadening power of the ice could not stop the huge wave which now rocketed towards the ship i rang full ahead to try and miss the wall of ice coming at the stern it may have been an underwater ram from the cliff or simply another growler but i felt the propeller go in a scream of tangled metal which rose above the thunder of the ice as the blades stripped i felt through the bridge plates the race of the engines and the shattering of the main shaft already weakened by the cold the explosion from the engineroom followed almost at the same moment i rushed to the starboard wing of the bridge with helen the plating was ripped and through the hole where he had been catapulted was the mangled corpse of a greaser who a minute before had been a man through the ships side pulsed sprays of boiling oil from the cylinder whose casing had burst helen was not looking at the scene of destruction but along the maindeck god she whispered dear god look reeling along the deck came the oilblind man his arms were held wide the nose lips and eyes had been filed away by the flaming oil and the charred tongue bubbled against the roof of his sawnoff mouth he fumbled blindly at the rail of the bridge companionway and then as if the slightest touch had sent another thrill of agony through him he turned and stumbled over the side the curdling sea held back the splash he sank only about ten feet under the surface arms and legs wide the wave struck the doomed ship pouring in through the engineroom gap gouts of whitehot oil pulsed once or twice the fumes condensed whitely the ship canted over ten degrees as she started to fill shall i try and get the pumps going bruce asked sailhardy dazedly i did not recognise my own voice no need shell freeze solid now she wont sink the ice has got her it will hold her up what about the catchers helen started to say i shook my head i picked up the bridge microphone and switched on the loudspeaker system throughout the ship prepare to abandon ship i said all food stores are to be brought on deck immediately we are in no immediate danger of sinking everything movable and of use will be loaded overside and stacked on the ice i clicked off and rang through to pirow as he replied i could hear the fateful mayday mayday call going out no reply from the catchers he said briefly but theyre in touch with thorshammer ill send sailhardy to bring you here i said what are they saying it is bad for us herr kapitan he replied very bad for all of us without waiting for him to tell me what was bad i ordered sailhardy to bring the prisoners on to the bridge if they were going to die i certainly wasnt going to allow them to die down below in irons i went over to helen and put my arm round her shoulders we felt the ship settle a little farther the light was going from the sick sun as it dropped out of sight behind the blue cliff darker now it was petrifying cold tenuous fingers of ice reached out towards the doomed ship a small growler looking like a porpoise in incongruous imitation of the tropics lay immobile under the factory ships blunt bow the light brought with it too that strange inward coloration of the ships bulwarks which i have never seen in any other sea the factory ships bluff forepeak had become a gangrenous green which had spread to the tarpaulins covering the boats splintered by the explosion in the engineroom under them we stood not saying anything there was a sudden flat scream as the forceps of the ice prised loose the first of the factory ships plates a white kelp pigeon wheeled over the far end of the lifelinelead of water towards the fogbank it seemed to add immeasurably to the distance and desolation of the scene another plate gave in agony as if in echo the strange lonely cry of the kelp pigeon struck dully from the soundabsorbing edges of the pancake ice antarctica was on her way to join captain norris and the sprightly helen shuddered the light went the wind rose metal of the heavens next morning antarctica presented a sorry sight all night the crew under my orders and sailhardys unflagging direction had brought up on deck every available case of food every blanket every item of warm clothing i had got the emergency power plant working since the main supply from the engineroom had disappeared in the explosion now the deck was stacked with tons of supplies over everything as i looked down from the bridge to the maindeck shortly after dawn lay a fine patina of ice and frost unshaven sleepless and hoarse from shouting orders i had waited for the light in order to find a platform on the ice strong enough to bear the weight of the stores throughout the night the ice had tightened its anaconda grip on the dying ship rivet by rivet plate by plate the life was being strangled out of her between decks her dying noises seemed more than inanimatea line of rivets would tremble first then bulge and then tear with a subhuman sound as the inchthick plating buckled and burst in search of the iceplatform sailhardy and i had swung ourselves down over the ships side at first light on to the ice we had found it within a hundred yards of the ship we had hammered in long icepoles with scarlet flags to delimit the safe area to the left and right of the area where the ice remained precarious we had placed a double row of smaller poles carrying orange flags the platform was slightly longer than wide and the sun half obscured by flying cloud painted it sable mink and russet even sailhardys faded weathered anorak and balaclava were transformed to soft champagne by the diffused light it was typical of sailhardy that he had planted a norse flag at halfmast in the centre of the iceplatform to honour the death of the ship antarctica lay half over on her starboard side where the water long since turned to solid ice had poured through he hole in her side the port wing of the bridge connected to the enclosed section by an open lattice covered with a canvas dodger leaned skywards away from the ice platform the bright orange of the helicopter stood out on the ships flensing platform helen was to fly it off to safety on the ice as soon it was light enough a broken davit hung like a narwhals tusk impotent on the port or suns side antarcticas side was bronzegold to starboard or the engineroom side it was blueblack in the ships own shadow neither shadow nor ice could mask the seared plates and mangled corpse making our way back to the ship we had markedagain by means of flagsa safe path across the ice from the platform to antarctica it was hopeless sailhardy and i had agreed during the night to try and remain aboard apart from the noise of plates and steel beams rending everything had begun to distort at a crazy angle between decks making doors and bulkheads deathtraps and i feared that before long the icevice would exert its pressure fore and aft as well already there was an ominous bulge on the maindeck below the bridge throughout the previous night helen had remained on the bridge with me at intervals she had brought me cups of boiling cocoa she had talked little and before the predawn cloud had begun to obscure the sky the hard stars were blue points in her eyes following the explosion i had brought upton walter and bjerko on the bridge but after a time when i saw there was no immediate danger i had sailhardy lock them up again upton had been morose unspeaking completely withdrawn apart from the trouble of guarding the men i was glad to get rid of his sullen illtemper he and helen had not spoken to each other the disaster had had exactly the opposite effect on pirows temperament he was tireless and brilliantly efficient and during the long hours he had sat glued to his radio i had had an insight into his perverted genius it seemed to make no difference to him that i had chained him up action at his beloved instruments stimulated and engrossed him as he relayed to me reports on the catchers their position on the troublesome radar and thorshammers signals the night signals were however of little significance after the one pirow had passed on to me immediately after the explosion thorshammer had ordered reidar bull hanssen and lars brunvoll to seize me upton pirow and walter the skippers said the message were to rendezvous with the destroyer at bouvet island and hand us over there was nothing we could do but await their coming we had no escape i had told only helen and sailhardy what thorshammer intended to do what i was at a loss to understand however was why thorshammer had not come herself why order the catcher captains to arrest us where was thorshammer now what was she about that was more important from pirow i could get no reply he had blamed sunspot interference on the radio and fragments which he passed on to me were too garbled to be comprehensible sailhardy helen and i stood on the bridge as the first burdened men started to climb down a hastilyrigged gangplank and scramblingnet following the path of the marker flags to the platform the wind had not risen nearly as much as i had expected but it was enough to carry a series of fine snowflurries and reduce visibility intermittently to a few hundred yards i did not know where the catchers were nor had i any idea of the extent of the icefield pirow had been trying for hours to try and pinpoint the catchers impatiently i picked up the phone to pirow any radar contacts yet where the hell are those ships pirow if any man can find them you can either by radio or radar his tone had never varied and it showed no traces of his shift of nearly fifteen hours no contacts herr kapitan a slight note of irony crept into the level voice i appreciate your compliment i wondered again how much of kohlers unequalled success had been due to the misdirected genius at the other end of my line we had respected kohler the humane if deadly hunter but we had feared the implacable man with the immaculate hand keep trying i said report the slightest sign of them to me aye aye herr kapitan helen said quickly let me go and look for them in the helicopter bruce that would give you something definite to go on once you knew what they were doing i glanced at the snowfilled sky the only distance you are going to fly that machine is from here to the platform by this afternoon it will be a full gale if thorshammer wants us let her or the catcher boys come and get us youre staying right here let me do something she exclaimed shall i fly off nowto the platform it is quite light enough yes i agreed reluctantly for heavens sake be careful though ive ordered the men to have some full fuel drums there ready to lash the machine to otherwise it might blow away later she smiled ive been trained for just this you know not in the southern ocean i replied bruce she went on whenand ifthe skippers come what are you going to do about my father are you simply going to hand him over i shrugged our first problem is simply to survive you forget im in the same boat thorshammer wants me as much as your father and walter its only my word against theirsim supposed to have shot down the seaplane bruce broke in sailhardy perhaps this sounds a little wild but it wont be difficult let us take the whaleboat you and i we can carry her across the ice to the sea shes light there are plenty of supplies we can make bouvet you and i shell stand up to any weather i looked deep into helens strange eyes putting aside the fact that such an escape would brand me guilty anyway she knew and i knew that to leave the other now was no longer possible i laughed it off youre trying to be another shackleton or bligh sailhardy we belong in less heroic times shackleton survived seven hundred and fifty miles in and ordinary open ships boat he began and bouvet is less than one hundred i cut him short more harshly than i intended you are under my orders sailhardy we stay the same goes for you helen now fly off that machine watch yourself she smiled aye aye herr kapitan she mocked i was so intent on making sure helen took off safely from the canted deck that i did not notice the three figures emerge from a snowflurry and make their way to the gangplank the roar of the helicopters rotors was over my head after a perfect takeoff before i saw the crew of the antarctica start to fall back round the gangplank reidar bull hanssen and lars brunvoll strode through the men there was no mistaking their purposefulness or the grim bitter anger in their snowstreaked faces nor was there any mistaking the purpose of the schmeisser machinepistol reidar bull held a man was coming down the gangplank shouldering a sack and reidar bull thrust him roughly to one side with an oath reidar bull was big and not unlike walter but now it was his hand which i noticed for the first t i m e f r o m h i s l e f t h a n d g r i p p i n g t h e b a r r e l o f t h e schmeisser three fingers were goneat some time a faulty harpoon cable must have ripped them off hanssen tall and blond followed reidar bull up the side and lars brunvoll black bearded brought up the rear the men unloading gaped for the moment they forgot that every gallon of fuel and every tin of food they humped over the side might save a life later on the three skippers strode quickly up the bridge ladder to where i was heidar bull shoved over the safety catch when he saw me i had forgotten the luger and long knife stuck in my duffelcoat belt reidar bull pointed the wickedlooking weapon at me hanssen get those things off him you brunvoll watch the islander he came closer to me where are the others i shrugged in irons im trying to salvage what is left of this ship i would have saved the ship herself if you three lilylivered bastards had obeyed me and brought your catchers in to keep the lead open reidar bulls savage mood seemed to be inflamed by my words listen captain you and this whole crooked bunch are under arrest see im taking you i know i said shortly youre taking me and the others to a rendezvous at bouvet and handing us over to thorshammer i heard it over the radio lars brunvoll could not keep back his anger the killer whale i have seen go and tear out a blue whales tongue just for the sport you are not a killer whale but by god it made me wonder what you are when i saw you shoot down the seaplane reidar bull waved the schmeisser in my face when i opened my mouth to tell them about the spandauhotchkiss hanssen also swore threateningly here in the antarctic men die hard he said however desperate you are yourself you never call in help if it will endanger their lives that is the code you know it captain your captain scott died like that and the world still remembers you however deliberately took life norwegians lives added reidar bull young norwegians who did not have your killer ways captain i saw them they flew right into your bullets your shooting was goodtoo good now you and your friends will pay for it he glanced down at his shattered hand as if something in his past were bringing alive again the seaplane crews agony when the bullets went home i have put these friends of mine as you call them in irons because they intended to kill me i said not only gi myself but sailhardy here look at his face if you dont believe me i told them briefly about norris chart thompson island and what i had overheard on the tannoy reidar bull replied with a fourletter word the other two laughed harshly i dont give a bloody damn for your fine storiesyou can tell them all to thorshammer reidar bull said my job is to take you back to the destroyer and i shall weve got the catchers moored against the iceedge about five miles from here it will mean a slog across the ice and i would not advise you to try any tricks now get down there he jerked the schmeissers muzzle towards the iceplatform hanssen yours and lars go and fetch the others there too and get these gaping clots away indicating the crew i want a little talk with all the prisoners before we set off reidar bull sailhardy and i waited fully ten minutes on the flagmarked platform for the others when the three of us arrived helen swung herself slowly down from the helicopter cockpit she said nothing our eyes met in her sealeopard coat she seemed to merge with the surroundings the curtain of snow saved us the embarrassment of being stared at by antarcticas crew upton led followed by walter bjerko and pirow with hanssen and lars brunvoll bringing up the rear when upton spotted reidar bull he pushed back the hood of his bright blue weatherproof jacket the flap of which was brilliant skyblue and hung down on his chest like the bib under a locusts chin and hurried towards him smiling ah reidar bull he exclaimed i am glad to see you yes keep that man and the islander guarded i knew you would come and rescue me now get these damn manacles off me and well make a plan reidar bull looked nonplussed hanssen and brunvoll had obviously not told him about thorshammer the norwegians face became more sullen and angry you are all under arrestno not you bjerko but you must make no attempt to help these men do you understand upton dropped his manacled wrists slowly his voice was full of menace by whose orders reidar bull thorshammers he replied upton rounded on the three skippers none of you has the guts of a wingless bouvet fly he said as soon as the going became a little tough you ran off and blabbed everything to thorshammer bah you could have been rich men if youd gone after the blue whales brunvoll broke in the hell with you and your blue whales weve all had a bellyful of you sir frederick we dont know yet what youre up to but it has ceased to include us see your daughter sighted a big school of blue whales but then we left them and went off at high speed into the worst ice ive ever seen blast your blue whales and your blue ice also all were likely to get by staying with you is a blue arse as well hanssen had his say too in all our experiences none of us has ever seen ice like this your fine ships finished and it serves you damnwell right upton looked contemptuously at the blond viking youre so scared youre wearing your lucky charm the spur of a wandering albatross mounted in silver at the base was pinned in hanssens lapel he started to finger it sheepishly but reidar bull went on in a hard voice when we started out from tristan we knew we would take some risks we knew we would come inside norwegian territorial waters technically that is nothing a chance to make a little money and a little risk on the sidethat is fair enough but the seaplanewe say captain wetherby walter pirow and you are bloody murderers youre all in this together we are turning you all in upton swung on his toes he tried his comradely charm sailhardy had no part in the shooting he was unconscious in his cabin let him go sailhardys voice had an edge like the wind true i was unconscious i was unconscious because what captain wetherby told you is truethey knocked me out reidar bull waved the schmeisser you can go free sailhardy but be careful that is all i say try and help your captain and see what happens if he goes i go retorted the islander if you march him to the catchers i march too listen i said roughly im not taking the blame for what walter did i didnt shoot down the seaplane ask the auroras helmsman we did said brunvoll he saw you and walter go up to the gun he heard it fired it is a weapon for two men not one hanssen filled in petersen the helmsman heard both the spandau and the hotchkiss two men fired that gun walter i started to say neither hanssen nor brunvoll nor i are here to pass judgment said reidar bull we are under ordersorders from a warship of my country and we shall carry them out walter flicked a quick glance at upton it is true i went up to the gun platform with captain wetherby he said we crossed together from the factory ship to aurora it was captain wetherbys idea to shoot the seaplane down if it shadowed the fleet at that time i too agreed but my heart failed me when i saw those poor boys come into the s i g h t s i t o o a m a n o r w e g i a n a m i t o k i l l m y o w n countrymen just because this english captain says so just for the sake of a few blue whales i pull the gun harness to one sideyou saw how the first burst of tracers went wide but he is good on a gun this captain he is also strong he pulls the gun round and gets in a burst with the quickfirer the hotchkiss then he tries to kill me with the same gun he is killcrazy i have to shoot him with the luger to stop this madness walter you bloody lying bastard i snapped reidar bull brunvoll hanssen these men are evil and they are after something which is evil too i have come to bouvet to see what the albatross foot is all about i have no other interest so said reidar bull you are so keen on this current that you shoot down a seaplane we are simple men captain wetherby but not as simple as that it was i who pulled walter off the gun i protested their faces were hard with disbelief it was i who turned aside the first burst reidar bull waved aside what i was saying you can tell all this to thorshammer we are not very good men captain and not very honest men but we have seen two of our own kind killed coldly and ruthlessly that is all we know that is what made us signal thorshammer he turned to pirow get up there in the helicopter and signal thorshammer no tricks he tossed the luger across to brunvoll go with him lars and see to it pirow tell thorshammer i reidar bull have arrested the men who shot down the seaplane and will rendezvous with her at bouvet as arranged before when pirow had come across the ice to the platform he had looked utterly worn out now his fatigue seemed to drop like a cloak he shot a glance at upton and shrugged slightly he turned to me showing off the herr kapitan reads morse he smiled perhaps he will come to the door of the cockpit and assure you that i am sending the right message reidar bull looked puzzled but agreed i walked with brunvoll and the man with the immaculate hand to the helicopter helen stood back whitefaced silent there was a pause while pirow encumbered still with the manacles went to the machines radio the radio key started to clatter as he called up the destroyer reidar bull skipper catcher crozet to thorshammer i have under arrest the men who shot down and killed your seaplane crew i will rendezvous with you at bouvet as arranged pirows sending was fluent proficient staccato he wasnt trying to bluff thorshammer that he was anyone else why had he agreed so readily to send bulls damning message he was in the business as deep as upton or myself then came thorshammers reply thorshammer to reidar bull catcher crozet rendezvous at bouvet as ordered part of your message not understood thorshammers seaplane ran out of fuel crew safe on life raft position approx miles west of bouvet am searching for fliers i could not believe my ears the seaplane safe on the water out of fuel which i had seen go to its death under a hail of bullets from the spandauhotchkiss i was so astonished that i forgot reidar bull and his schmeisser and jumped up the steps into the radio compartment brunvoll stood luger in hand frowning unaware of what was passing over the air the seaplane i said incredulously to both pirow and brunvoll how can the seaplane be signalling what are you saying demanding brunvoll the seaplane which i saw shot down pirow grinned at me he flicked off the transmitting key so that the tapping which followed was for my benefit alone gone was the german staccato this was the man with the immaculate hand slipping into one of many guises now he had projected himself into being the seaplane crew sending emergency signals from their liferaft the dummy signal he tapped for me was fragmentary a little breathless just as it would sound from a couple of inexperienced fliers facing possible death on a liferaft in the wild seas it all fell into place then why thorshammer had not come to arrest us herself pirow during his long period in the factory ships radio office must have sent off a series of faked messages purporting to come from the seaplane crew on their liferaft he was clever enough not to have given thorshammer time enough to get a bearingthe only man who could get a bearing on a dozen letters was pirow himself he must have thought up his ingenious plan while he listened to the catchers signalling thorshammer the destroyer was at present on her way to an imaginary position given by pirow to pick up a seaplane crew which no longer existed he was giving upton and himself a breathingspace he was also proving that walter had committed no crime for thorshammers radio log would show that the seaplane had been signalling long after she had in fact been shot down moreover thorshammer had already indicated that there had been no signal from the plane to show she had been shot down but that instead she had got lost run out of fuel come down on the water and the twoman crew had taken to the liferaft i saw the mettle of the man with the immaculate hand thorshammer would then be arresting us for an infringement of norwegian territorial waters and hunting the blue whale come i said to brunvoll i want you to hear this too i strode to the cockpit door the circle of faces on the ice looked up at me helens was troubled anxious reidar bull i called thorshammer has just signalled back she says her seaplane crew is safe on the water they were never shot down they ran out of fuel gods truth what is this he roared safe on the water am i drunk or mad brunvoll gripped my arm with a fist of iron i saw every one of us sawthe seaplane fall in the water shot to ribbons by you and walter by walter i said steadily i told them what i believed pirow had done as i did so i saw a look of savage triumph and determination cross uptons pewterhued face framed by the blue hood helen caught my glance and looked at her father she half started forward and again looked up at me she had seen and i had seen i was glad of the manacles on uptons wrists supplemented by the schmeisser guarding him hansen shook his head like a boxer clearing his mind after a blow i see a plane fly into a gun i see the gun fire i see the plane crash now i am told it is not so the three of you have been taken for the biggest ride of your careers i said i told them who pirow was reidar bulls face went black thorshammer wont listen to you now after pirows signals heaven knows how long youll have to hang around at bouvet while she searches for that seaplane crew of hers uptons voice was tense tell them too wetherby that there is no extradition for murder in the antarctic its all in the antarctic treaty which your bloody country signed reidar bull there is no treaty obligation to hand over anyone reidar bull clicked the schmeisser as if to assure himself that it at least was real i dont know what extradition means he replied i dont know what anything means any more with bastards like you around me all i know is that we marchnow you can take any small personal things he gestured with the schmeisser at upton you first what do you want look in my desk drawer he said there is an old chart bring it there is a little leather bag next to it theres a firstaid kit with a hypodermic too and my guarana in the liquor cabinet that is all i want you captain asked reidar bull my sextant i replied that is all it was the sextant with which i had plotted thompson island sailhardy came forward his thumb flicking in its strange way against his palm i march because captain wetherby marches reidar bull you are sailors and you each have your ship i also have a ship it is everything i have in the world to a tristan islander it is worth more than his life almost i will march but i will carry my boat for the first time that morning reidar bulls face relaxed a little by everything thats holy this islander i could almost wish he was my friend and not the captains he looked at the other two skippers they were men who knew what it was to have ones own ship under one there was almost no need to get their approval you can load it aboard my own ship reidar bull went on brusquely as if afraid to show sentiment wait i know captain wetherby can help you carry the whaleboat it will keep him out mischief on the march the others grinned i have a small case ready said helen i packed it ready to leave last night it is on the bridge in a moment reidar bulls face reverted to its grimness youll stay right here miss captain bjerko will remain behind and see to the unloading of the ship when we reach the iceedge i will signal on the wt and you will fly the helicopter to the catchers it may be very useful to us yet youll land on the ice by the catchers and well manhandle it aboard my ship helen started to protest but he cut her short hanssen go and get the things they have asked for be quick i want to go before the weather gets worse he spoke to bjerko well come back with the catchers after we have met thorshammer at bouvet she ordered all three of us to come and aurora makes four therell be enough room aboard to take off antarcticas crew well be away only a couple of days the ice wont break up before then youll be safe enough bjerko looked dubiously at the factory ship whose outline we could see despite the snow flurries i have never seen ice like this come back soon i dont like it nor did i behind the doomed ship where the raft of ice had broken off it had carved the likeness of a gigantic sphinx head with defined lips and a brooding forehead even the neck was there in the shape of a series of striated cliffs almost meeting feet from the surface was a double cantileverlike wing which was held at its base by three fluted columns each one fifty feet in diameter i started to go over to helen but reidar bull waved me back upton infected us all with his tension he appeared to be expecting something brunvoll seemed grateful to have something to do when reidar bull sent him back to guard pirow as hanssen emerged from the path on his return from the ship upton went forward quickly and took the map from him it was norris chart of thompson island upton knelt down and spread it open on the ice come here reidar bull he said authoritatively we all gathered round upton spoke quickly and there was a tic at the corners of his mouth and eyes his fingers were shaky as he pointed to the spidery track of the old sprightly and norris position of thompson island we were drawn inside the circle of his compelling personality have you ever heard of thompson island he demanded reidar bull glanced at the old map he shrugged yes i have also heard of the aurora islands down in the scotia sea men have searched for a hundredmaybe two hundred years for them these islands existhow do you sayin the mind only the faint pink flush suffused uptons mask i could see he was taking a big grip on himself the twitch at the corner of his mouth got worse hanssen didnt even bother to look i have seen a hundred things in the southern ocean which could have been islandsrocks streaked with guano icebergs covered with mud it is not surprising that we all dream a little in these goddamned waters many men have dreamed but only a few islands have been found it is the same with thompson island get up ordered reidar bull march upton squatted on his haunches still he seemed to be losing control of his hands they were shaking so the manacles rattled faintly father said helen in an agonised voice come thompson island can wait his eyes were feverbright its waited a century and more for me he said thickly reidar bull hanssen thompson island exists here is its position captain wetherby has seen it seen it do you hear thompson island his voice rose listen he turned the old chart over and quoted from norris own personal log which with its image of blue ice was written so indelibly into my mind thompson island is nothing but perpendicular rocks and it looks like a complete cinder with immense veins of lava which had the appearance of black glass but much of it is streaked with white veins reidar bulls harsh laugh sounded like floes grinding together rubbish get up upton crouched on the ice like a wounded animal facing its hunters his face was contorted helen had drawn back in horror at his breakup he was keeping his last cardhis real reason for wanting to find thompson islandin reserve still walter licked his lips thompson island had bitten into uptons mind and eroded it in a way which was dreadful to observe i waited in awe at what was to follow i want thompson island he said so softly that i had to crane to hear him he looked at the three skippers ill double my original offer to you if you will take me to thompson island none of them replied upton swung round to me bruce he said bruce you know where is is and so do i nowtake me there looking down on the mouthing figure on the ice and remembering what had happened to men in the past who had also wanted thompson island i resolved to myself that no one would ever wring from me the secret of thompson islands whereabouts upton fumbled with his pathetic little squash leather bag oh god burst out helen bruce he got it open and emptied the contents into his hand still crouching he rolled the five objects across the old chart like throwing dice they looked like bullseyes upton began almost to intone heavenly blue they call it the same colour as this ice its really silvery white but it takes its name from the two heavenly blue lines in its spectrum reidar bull said something in a low voice in norwegian to the other two skippers youll come with me now wont you reidar bull he said looking up expectantly and you lars brunvoll and you hanssen the other money was chickenfeed next to this what are you talking about demanded reidar bull roughly youll come then reidar bull he went on youll be the richest man in norway from that sneered bull indicating the bullseyes the tic tugged at the corner of uptons mouth and eyes as if even now he were reluctant to reveal his secret yes he said that is caesium it is the rarest metal in the world it is worth two hundred pounds a pound caesium the spaceage metal i i had considered all along that it was not geographical curiosity that had driven upton to try and find thompson island caesium had been much in the forefront when i had returned to cambridge after the warit is the most vital part of the fuel for space ships and space rockets looking down at the dicelike objects my mind ran back to one of the young scientists at the cavendish laboratories there who had become a bore and a butt over our afterdinner glass of port because of his endless conversations on the wonders of caesium upton was right when he said blue whales were nothing by comparison with it caesium i had been told over the university port was known to occur in minute quantities in only three placesa small place in northern sweden in southwest africa and in kazakhstan in the soviet union its name comes from the bright blue lines in its spectrumupton was probably right when he said they were heavenly blue i wished now i could remembered more of what the cambridge bore had had to say about it vaguely i recalled that it had the lowest boiling point of any metal in the alkali group and was priceless not only because of its scarcity but because of the ease with which it could be made to form electricallycharged gas for fuel for space ships it was it seemed from what i could remember the answer to the scientists prayer for a space fuelexcept that there was practically none of it to be had there was also something about its extremely high ionization potential which made it possible to transmute the atomic heat of caesium directly into electric power without having to use an intermediate stage of steam boilers or turbines in the space ships i looked at upton and i knew the answer even before i asked him your face caesium some of the wild light went from his eyes you know caesium bruce you know it yes he said touching his face this is the price of my knowledge of it i told you the metal particles pass into the skin i know more about caesium than any man living i worked on itmore than twenty years ago nowat a little place called ronnskar in sweden on the gulf of bothniaits quite close to the port of skelleftea i cut him short i still couldnt see how he linked thompson with his wonder metal how do you know it exists on thompson island where did those samples come from norris took a hammer he said youll see from the log how he sent a ships boat ashore and they had to make a sudden dash back to the ship because of the weather three of those pieces of rock are norris the other two are pirows you see kohler used it as a base for meteor pirow has been there but he doesnt know where it is only roughly somewhere near bouvet kohler never let on the words came tumbling out in a flood helen said gently father why did you go about it this way underhand murderall the rest of it it only needed a hairtrigger to touch upton off thompson island is mine he shouted i wont have any bloody governmental committees telling me where and what i should explore that shameful antarctic treaty reidar bull hanssen and lars brunvoll seemed to be at a loss all this about caesium was going over their heads i asked another question to try and keep upton on an even keel where did you get norris samples from he laughed a strange brittle laugh from the wetherbys you see bruce i bought out wetherbysunder an assumed name of stewart and co you werent to knowdont forget i already suspected you were the only man to have seen thompson island pirow came later when i started scratching in the german naval archives those rocks there are veined with caesiumpollucite they call the mineral salt do you see what norris log and description of whole cliffs seamed with caesium mean to me enough to murder a couple of innocent men his laugh jarred dear god man cant you see that nations will fight atomic wars over thompson islands caesium millions may die not only two they were unimportant beside this i looked again at the old chart at the five dicelike pieces of caesium rock and at the wild eyes of the whaling tycoon men had suffered and died in the past to find thompson and now in the present the island had come back with a lure more deadly and a threat more lethal than anything that had gone before as my eyes lifted they met helens there was no need to formulate the resolution in my mind never to reveal thompson islands whereabouts i turned to reidar bull the man is mad i said harshly you should lock him up thompson island isnt where the chart says anyway remember that sir frederick the awful pink flush suffused his face and he threw himself at me using the manacles as a weapon again and again he struck at me shouting obscenities while lars brunvoll clubbed him with the butt of the luger it took brunvoll and hanssen to drag him off me judas he half gasped half screamed youwho knowyou have betrayed me curse all the wetherbys curse bruce wetherby helen stood back in anguish as he screamed pirows face was grey reidar bulls savage anger was stilled let us march i said to reidar bull sailhardy and will fetch the whaleboat you can send brunvoll along too if you like but there isnt anywhere for us to escape to hanssen held upton now still mouthing threats at me and the skippers when we returned carrying the boat easily by upending her with the bow and sternthwarts on our heads the party had already formed up there was no goodbye allowed to helen she stood camouflaged in her sealeopard coat against the snow at thirty yards next to one of the helicopters landingwheels her lips moved soundlessly to me as we moved off reidar bull bringing up the rear with schmeisser at the ready upton leading with brunvolls luger at his back the whaleboat was no real burden sailhardy could have carried its weight alone himself but two of us made its bulk easier to handle especially when the wind plucked at it the ice was hard and we started briskly antarctica lay against the sick sun the last i saw of her was when she lurched yet again like a beaten wrestler trying to keep his shoulder off the mat by lunchtime by following the markers which reidar bull had laid at intervals across the icefield we came to the iceedge the four catchers crozet kerguelen chimay and aurorawere moored together already the ice had started to trace a needlework pattern on their rigging unless it was cleared they would be carrying a tophamper which would roll them to their doom once they got outside the protection of the icefield which damped down the great rollers of the westerlies each ship had a white square on its black funnel on which was painted its name and to the inexperienced eye all four might have been cut from the same matrixthe flared bows the canvasenclosed bridge the big steam pipe running up and round the funnel the heavy foremast with a crowsnest the long low platform aft like a frigates depthcharge platform to a whalermans eye however they were as individual as those of us who made up the marching party on the march upton had given no more trouble he had pulled his blue hood over his head and all we could see from behind was the hunch of his shoulders as we paused for a breather before making the last leg to the catchers pirow fell back alongside me the greyness had not passed out of his face and he spoke low and agitatedly so that reidar bull behind could not hear herr kapitan he said where is the rendezvous with the destroyerwith thorshammer i was puzzled at his tone why at bouvet i said you know that already yes he said quickly but where off the island or where theres only one anchoragein the southwest at bollevika that is the rendezvous he took my arm as if to steady himself what is it man i asked he appeared so agitated the meteor mined the approaches to the anchorage and bollevika itself he said bouvet pirows words released in me a wave of depression which had been mounting ever since my unspoken farewell to helen along the march the image of that lonely figure in her sealeopard coat had returned again and again always however to my minds eye rose those strange eyes which i was able to tell myself now had come alive and vitalshe had said it herselfthrough me in seeking the albatross foot i like saul had gone in search of asses and found instead a kingdom now the full reaction of that empty farewell set in i knew as i considered the prospect before me that there would be little chance of meeting her again reidar bull had made it quite clear that although not a prisoner like ourselves she would not be free to come and go if she disobeyed reidar bull and stayed at the antarctica she was courting disaster if she could locate thorshammer she could fly to the destroyer and tell her storybut would they believe her any more than reidar bull and the others did the fact that she was uptons own daughter made her suspect the thought of my own future brought me despair as far as the royal society was concerned i was probably done for mere suspicion of what i was supposed to have done would be enough for that august body to finish with meand the albatross foot in the light of what had happened it would appear as if the whole story of the albatross foot had been simply a cover for dubious activities in the southern ocean along with upton and his gang what action would thors hammer take when reidar bull handed us over as he had every intention of doing i could not see pirows deception about the seaplane crew being more than a temporary red herring short of walter confessing i could see no way out upton walter and pirows crime was an infringement of norwegian watersmine was murder if things went the way they were going the thought of helen waiting for me to become conscious after i had fallen off the spandauhotchkiss into the sea and the strange deep look in her eyes when i told her what had really happened made my prospects more agonising she believed me sailhardy believed me but the events which had enmeshed me in shooting down the seaplane were as complex as those which had brought me to bouvet doorway to thompson island automatically i felt for my sextant case which i had hung from my belt inside that sextant case lay the secret of the whereabouts of thompson island it was no more than a notch on the vernier the scale for reading the altitude of the sun and stars it would mean nothing in someone elses hands i intended thompson island to stay unknown the frost crackled on my gloves as i crunched them together the four catchers lay off the iceedge steam rising from their funnels like frostsmoke had i only known that kohler had mined the approaches to bouvet i might have caught him months earlier i had sent a damaged ship to anchor temporarily at bouvetand all i had heard from her again was a stifled desperate message underwater explosion and then no more a day later another merchantman had been sunk a thousand miles away and i had rushed off on a wild goose chase i had assumed from the two widely separated sinkings that kohler was working with a uboat in my waters now i knew it was a mine one might i suppose call bollevika an anchorage but really theres scarcely any holding ground for an anchor lars christen sens ship under the most favourable conditions had had to steam backwards and forwards slowly for a whole month waiting for the shore party to return since she was unable to obtain anchorage at bollevika which lies open to the gales and seas which sweep in endlessly from the southwest quarter pirow must have wondered from my long silence if i d i s b e l i e v e d h i m f o r h e w e n t o n q u i c k l y t h e h e r r kapitan kohler mined the south african coast as far as the hundredfathom line meteor carried ninetyfive mines we used eighty off south africa then we came to bouvet we used the other fifteen at bouvet we must tell the skippers right away i said god fifteen seamines in the bollevika anchorage yes herr kapitan he said sombrely and you know what the approaches will be like i havent been closer than twenty miles but i can guess i said when i had seen bollevika the icebergs made a belt round the island broken here and there by zigzag open leads of water heaven help the crew of any ship mined under those conditions i thought what would be the consequences if it happened to be thorshammer reidar bull i called come here the big norwegian suspicious and with the schmeisser at the ready came across to us i outlined what pirow had told me reidar bulls reaction took me unawares christ he exclaimed angrily must i now be frightened by some bloody fairystory about mines which you two naval types c o n c o c t h a n s s e n b r u n v o l l t h e o t h e r s j o i n e d u s listen to this we mustnt keep the rendezvous at bouvet becauseso our german friend now tells ushis ship mined t h e a p p r o a c h e s t o b o l l e v i k a d u r i n g t h e w a r i s a y nonsense it is true retorted pirow angrily there are fifteen deepsea contact mines lars brunvolls temper had not improved with the long hike across the ice so the first person you run to tell is the english captain heh is he in command of this party why must he know first heh because it is a scarestory they have thought up between themselves said reidar bull i dont believe a word of it hanssen grinned we dont need to believe or disbelieve reidar bull we can prove it quite easily what do you mean asked bull let us send aurora on ahead of our own ships he said if pirows story is a lie which i think it is then no harm will come of it if it is not he shrugged it is just too bad good riddance i say pirow was as white as the moment he had come on the factory ships bridge and saw the blue icefield i was there i know the place is mined he exclaimed dont be such damned fools these men are as slippery as the great ice barrier interrupted brunvoll we may be damned fools but we are not criminal maniacs he went on yes send aurora in with the lot of them aboard and well see what happens if she blows up our own ships will still be safe aye said reidar bull but i wont send auroras crew they had no hand in it easy said hanssen if we sail tonight we can be off bouvet tomorrow morning well transfer auroras crew at the approaches she wont need a full crew to take her in walter can manage the engines for a couple of miles captain wetherby will find no problems in sailing a ship i dont like the idea of letting captain wetherby have a ship grumbled brunvoll anything can happena squall a patch of fog andpoofwhen we look the sea will be empty and aurora will have disappeared if anyone needs to be guarded it is the english captain well guard him all right said hanssen with a grim smile well unship that hellish gun on aurora ill have it rigged forward on my harpoon platform itll only take a couple of hours kerguelen can sail maybe half a mile astern of aurora as we approach the bollevika anchorage if any tricks are played theyll get a double stream of lead the way the seaplane did it was no use arguing with men in their savage mood i turned to pirow can you remembereven vaguely how captain kohler mined bollevika did he lay a definite pattern taking a bearing on something ashore was it a regular line have you any idea at what intervals meteor dropped the mines overboard pirow shuddered no but i remember how herr kapitan kohler laughed after we had mined the agulhas bank off south africa we came close inshore towards a big lighthouse which the fools had left burningin wartime we started mining from the hundredfathom mark and zigzagged shorewards if anyone ever finds the plot of these mines it is more than i would know captain kohler said he did the same at bouvet the mines were also set to float at any depth i was not as concerned as pirow i knew that kohler must have used the german y type mine which was fitted with a selfdestroying device should it break loose to lay his mines deep as he must have done at bouvet and off south africa he also must have used a very light mooringwire and the odds were that bouvets heavy seas had since loosened the moorings and that the mines had destroyed themselves my mind raced ahead if i could get hold of aurora but i would want sailhardy and his whaleboat i looked at the islander you hear what pirow says sailhardy i cant ask you to come in the face of that id like your boat though sailhardy smiled faintly were they y type mines bruce yes i answered the skippers looked suspicious mines and mining were above their heads id come even if they werent he replied reidar bull shook his head i dont like a man going just because of his captain theres no need to worry about me if aurora strikes a mine replied sailhardy the man you should have on your conscience right now is captain wetherby he did not shoot down the plane brunvoll was unimpressed ill follow your kerguelen into bollevika hanssen we must all take bearings and check auroras coursewe dont want to be mined ourselves through carelessness we could send the helicopter in ahead as a spotter began reidar bull leave miss upton out of this i said roughly you bastards are very fond it seems of playing around with other peoples lives while you sit safe on your arses i know what bouvet weather can be fog gales high seas damnall visibility leave her out of it i say you couldnt spot a mine moored at depth from a helicopter anyway and particularly in these seas it is strange to see a man who can get behind a gun and kill like you have done becoming so concerned over anyone sneered reidar bull you shouldnt keep your soft side for women only i had to see helen again reidars bulls remark brought home how curiously she had come to be allied in my own mind with the southern ocean twenty years previously on a night as wild as the creation i had taken my squadron of warships past cape horn into the drake passage and its mountainous seas la meri could not think of it without hearing trenets voice singing the song of that name now the wild threnody sobbed at some inner part of me when i thought of our unspoken farewell at the moment meteors mines seemed unimportant beside my wish to see her helens face was before my minds eye i couldnt give a seals burp for your plan to save your skins and make us into a lot of guineapigs i said harshly ill take aurora in but only if you let me see miss upton again before we sail i turned on pirow pull yourself together man if we strike a mine you wont know what hit you anyway he smiled wanly i wish i could detect them by radio reidar bull dropped the barrel of the schmeisser a little you are a brave man captain wetherby mikklesen said so too war has no place in peace though i could almost wish it had been walter who had shot down the seaplane am i to see miss upton i demanded he looked inquiringly at the other skippers very well captain we have nothing to lose and you may have something to gain by it tomorrow at the approaches to bollevika who knows i remembered bollevika lit on a dark winters afternoon by the fragile strange luminosity of the solar flares which wince and bicker across the southern ocean from cape horn to the great ross barrier and my occasional sight of the icecliffs and towering peaks while the breakneck lightning of the blue magnetic flare twitched from mountain peak to turbulent sea bollevikawho knows i echoed will you signal miss upton to come now from the factory ship he nodded marchto the catchers the party trudged wearily across the remaining distance to the iceedge reidar bull shouted orders to the crews to dismantle the spandauhotchkiss while he himself went aboard the crozet to signal helen he left brunvoll to guard us with the schmeisser upton refused to be drawn into any conversation and merely grunted when brunvoll or hanssen spoke to him he and walter were still shackled i was grateful for it since i feared another outburst on the heels of his morose fit walter tried to be ingratiating to our captors and pirow retained his terrified attitude as if it were already certain that aurora would strike one of the mines once he edged close to me herr kapitan he said in a low voice thompson island has a safe anchorage and there are warm springs you know where the island is shut up snapped brunvoll i dont want any whispering particularly between you two i waited i had scarcely any regard for the activity round me as lights were rigged on auroras and kerguelens decks as well as heavy tackles to lift the gun into position from one to the other we were too far away to hear the crews talking but once or twice i saw grim glances being cast in the direction of the party it was clear that they shared the skippers repugnance at what i was supposed to have done my ears were attuned to hear helens approach at length when the familiar roar of the rotors hung over the ships and shore party it took away at least for me some of the forlorn and desolate air of the scene the men and the ships seemed so puny alongside the great expanse of ice the very wind seemed to be holding back its violence in preparation for an onslaught against us i reckoned the temperature must be anything up to thirty degrees below freezing we stamped and beat our arms to keep warm uptons and walters shackles secured outside their thick gloves so that the icy metal would not burn them clinked dismally the helicopter landed next to us helen cut the engine you can have half an hour said brunvoll then everyone goes aboard after weve rigged the gun the men still have to get that machine lashed aboard the crozet he waved the schmeisser dont get any ideas of making a sudden break in the helicopter although where the hell youd go to i wouldnt know i swung myself up into the machine and went forward to the cabin it was warm inside the light from the loadinglamps threw helens face into sharp relief she was wrapped in the sealeopard coat we looked at each other without saying a word we were insulated from the world outside i could not even hear the men working on the gun helen broke the long silence it couldnt have ended like that could it bruce i shook my head her face was taut and the eyes were never lovelier no i said but it could end another way tomorrow i told her about meteors minefield for a while she did not reply then she reached out and took my gloved hand in a grip that revealed her feelings if it were not for you bruce i think at this moment i would hate the southern ocean and all its works it never relaxes never gives does it yet its a partperhaps more than halfof you isnt it because of that i cant hate it i leant over and kissed her lips lightly i saw the pattern of a downhorizon solar flare explosion in her eyes no she burst out they shant do it i tell you she reached for the throttle switches they shall not not while i can get you away i knocked her hand away and pointed brunvoll had the schmeisser ready pointed before the rotors got going helen thered come a burst from that i said dont think that reidar bull hanssen andbrunvoll dont mean it they do theres a ghastly pattern of things which has caught us up she exclaimed heatedly heres an ocean as big and as empty of humans as any in the world and yet its a human mesh thats taking you away from me the mesh your father wove i said i know i know she went on but you and i realise that my father isnt the whole cause thompson island i said thompson island she said brokenly god how i hate the sound of that name this moment together is borrowed time i said gently its running out ill fly patrol over aurora tomorrow she said if shes mined ill pick you up like before no helen you know you cant take off from a small catchers deck pitching in the sort of sea well run into at bouvet she buried her face in her hands what do you think i ll feel when i watch aurora go in towards bollevika you my father brucewe could still get him well again with treatment brunvoll gestured from below helens face was full of anguish i kissed her and she clung to me for a moment then she took my hand and put it over the compass platform if suzie wong has a ghost let it come and guard bruce wetherbys luck she said i looked deep into her eyes again and then went aft and jumped down on to the ice at the head of auroras gangplank as we filed aboard i turned and looked back i could just make out the shadow of the sealeopard coat against the perspex window upton walter pirow sailhardy and i were locked into one small cabin shortly after nightfall the catchers sailed for bouvet and the bollevika approaches i had thought that once we were alone there would be a fresh outburst from upton against me it did not come i spent an uneasy night almost grateful for the guard outside the door lest uptons mania should return he took the sole bunk in the small cabin for himself and covered his head with the blue hood sailhardy and i huddled on the floor together for warmth pirow and walter exchanged a few words i cut walter short when he tried to speak to me by drawn aurora was pitching heavily and i wondered how the transfer of the crew was to take place pirow again spoke anxiously about meteors mines before dropping off into an exhausted sleep it was like going into an ambush knowing it had been laid for to me the mine is the assassin the thug the torpedo by contrast is the hunter and it pits its skill against range and angle against water salinity depth and the chance of a sudden variation of course by its quarry shortly before midday auroras engines began to slow it was impossible to see outside as the porthole was frosted over there were several sharp alterations of course and then a heavy thump against auroras side i realised what the icewise catcher captains were about they were mooring aurora alongside a small iceberg with another of the catchers in order to transfer the men the cabin door opened brunvoll came in carrying the sphmeisser his heavy clothing was streaked with ice with him was another burly norwegian brunvoll grinned without humour were about ten miles off bouvet you can now have the pleasure captain of seeing whether our friends story about the mines is correct for the last time brunvoll listen protested pirow the place is thick with mines so you said before he replied he handed the other man a key and said something he went forward and unclicked walters and uptons manacles uptons eyes were hard brunvoll the first score i have to pay is with wetherby the second is with you remember that brunvoll shrugged get up on deck all of you and remember captain that kerguelen with the spandauhotchkiss will be only a quarter of a mile behind you youll see when you get on deck theres no searoom theres an openwater passage leading into the bollevika anchorage zigzag and half frozen there are icebergs jumbled together everywhere it was no use arguing brunvoll i said if we are mined are the boats ready to use yes he replied brusquely i had them checked last night the falls are all running freely also the whaleboat is lashed across the winches by the foremast he spoke to sailhardy you dont have to go with this lot you know nor does captain wetherby said sailhardy on to the bridge then replied brunvoll the skippers had done what i thought aurora was held against a small berg by a couple of iceanchors with kerguelen immediately astern two men stood in the spandauhotchkiss harness and pointed the wicked weapon at aurora moored alongside kerguelen was brunvolls ship chimay and half a mile astern pitching heavily in the open water was crozet i halfclosed my eyes against the sudden onslaught of frozen spindrift carried along by the wind it was upon crozet that my attention fixed on her forward catwalk was lashed the helicopter the orange stood out clearly in the wild morning helen would be aboard her i told myself i looked about me with fear in my heart ahead scarcely visible was a mound which looked like a gigantic iceberg it was bouvet we were still too far to distinguish detail clearly except the soaring twin peaks capped with ice the sea was thick with ice and icebergs open water perhaps a quarter of a mile wide made a winding passage between the ice towards the grim island brunvoll ushered us ahead walter he said get down to the engineroom the rest of you stay here there was a cluster of about a dozen men auroras crew filing aboard kerguelen two had remained to cast off the iceanchors its all yours captain said brunvoll youll have to steam slowly because of this he gestured at the ice when you reach bollevika anchor a quarter of a mile offshore ill come aboard again he lifted a hand in the direction of the gun in kerguelens bows the twin barrels pointed straight at us one of the gunners raised a hand in reply brunvoll and the tough norwegian then backed down the bridge ladder as if still afraid we would do something even in the face of the two weapons i cupped my hands cast off i shouted to the men at the iceanchors i rang for slow ahead aurora moved slowly clear heading towards bouvet our course was dictated by the open water through the ice i could not have manoeuvred even if i had wished aurora pitched more heavily than i would have expected which meant that the ice was loose and the sea itself had not frozen kerguelen followed and in line ahead chimay and crozet when we had covered about five miles a squall swept across the sea it cleared and i saw bouvet close the cliffs might have been the savage black conscience of the southern ocean itself the pale sunlight inched into the aweprovoking sky with the tenacity of the orange lichens which stained the stark cliffs near the waters edge the great twin volcanic craters of christensen and posadowsky threw up their icecovered heads three thousand feet to left and right away on the left the cliffs instead of being sombre basalt were a strange sulphur colour running down from the twin glacier cones was a fantastic wall of solid ice and where the cliffs became vertical which i guessed was at a height of about feet the ice rose sheer out of the sea to join with the glaciers high above the ice took its blackness from the cliffs which it parasitised here and there was an eroded headland with fingerlike projections of rock which reached out as if in supplication to the brutal face of the westerlies where the sea and the ice had made rocklike arches they contorted themselves in strychnic agony the southern ocean might have chosen its colours for the grim island in the same way as some old painters used to grind up egyptian mummies for pigment when portraying scenes of death bouvet stood at bay shoulder to the great winds without a chink in its black armour almost without light except at the edge of the flagcloud flapping at the summit of the twin peaks its edges pale orangewhite there must have been fifty or sixty icebergs jammed on one of the outlying reefs of bollevika so that it was almost impossible to see the line of the coast bouvet stood before uswild evil at war endlessly with the mighty undulations which threw themselves against the cliffs from the water below and the winds above which sometimes even the anemometer cannot measure sailhardy was at the wheel i glanced at the echosounder twentyfive fathoms i took a quick bearing on a headland on the port bow that was where christensens party must have erected an emergency depot or roverhullet as they called it stocked with provisions and fuel i wondered if such a hut however well built and shored up could ever have survived the gales of thirtyodd years bollevika anchorage itself lay slightly away to starboard but i thought i might have to do what christensens ship had done during the whole month his party had been ashoresteam back and forth at slow speed because the gales and rollers from the southwest would make anchoring impossible i had just opened my mouth to give sailhardy an order when the mine exploded auroras port side was torn wide open stunned and deafened i could not for a moment believe that it had actually happened my mind could not credit that plating decks beams and rivets had been dissociated from all that they had been part of seconds beforethe very fabric of aurora a ragged chunk of metal sang and rang in the steel wall at the back of the bridge like an apaches arrow it had passed clean between sailhardy and me it would have taken off one of our heads had its path been a foot either side aurora started to roll towards the brash sea a gout of water rose up from her side and then smashed down bringing chunks of ice clattering on the tilting deck from beneath our feet came the sound of frames rending it was sailhardy who saved us i saw that he was shouting although his voice came faint to my stunned senses quick the whaleboat shes going so quickly well be trapped he grabbed me by the shoulder and thrust me down the bridge ladder i stumbled over to the whaleboat and fumbled halfdazed at the lashings above my head the blocks swung loose as the mast sagged walter came running from the engineroom hatchway as if he were drunk even in my confused state i saw he was carrying a heavy wrench and a flensing knife he slashed at the ropes holding the whaleboat sailhardy reappeared half thrusting half carrying upton and pirow upton appeared the least dazed of us all except sailhardy he slid his little firstaid bag over his arm decisively as he too plucked at the lashings i snatched the last rope free of the winch tearing my hand on a rough rowlock i scarcely noticed auroras flared bow harpoon gun and forward engineroom telegraph had been pushed back by the explosion to the line of the focsle ventilators a heavy barrel from one of the starboard winches rolled past us as she prepared to plunge for the last time sailhardy walter and i pulled the whaleboat to the side pirow stood like a man concussed and sailhardy had to thrust him into the boat so incongruously gay in its bright tristan colours yellow blue and white upton and walter jumped in after us fend her off bruce called sailhardy auroras coming right over on us i pushed the boa t clear with one of the long oars sailhardy did likewise we pulled away as the catcher leaned over walter also grabbed an oar the three of us gave a couple of strong sweeps out of range of the dying ships last roll then sailhardy took the high tiller whose steering arm he had not had time to ship properly leaving us at the oars aurora rolled over and disappeared there was a muffled explosion as her boilers blew up but we were well clear she had gone down in about four minutes walter stood up and looked at the fastdisappearing patch on the sea which marked auroras grave she was a fine ship as good as they come he said the other catchers had come to a stop kerguelens bows started to swing away from the whaleboat in the grip of the sea sailhardy glanced astern at the catchers and called to me get the sail on her bruce well beat back to kerguelen into the wind the passage is wide enough to tack the islanders words goaded upton into action dropping his firstaid bag he rose quickly snatched the knife from walter and in a flash was at the tiller he held the long blade at the islanders throat beat back be damned he said thickly take her into the anchorage were going to land i looked at the great cliffs unbelievingly only one party had ever got ashore at bouvetlars christensens that was in weather conditions which have never been repeated land i exclaimed upton you must be crazy you cant land on bouvet there was a sandless parody of a beach at the foot of the cliffs soaring up to the christensen glacier seas with no land between them and south georgia threw themselves against the rocks uptons eyes were as hard and distant as our chances of survival if we tried to make the beach walter stop drivelling over that bloody ship of yours take that wrench and dont hesitate to use it on them if they try any games he thrust the knife closer against sailhardys throat the beach for a long moment the islander did not speak i could see the mania mounting in uptons overbright eyes i had to break the silence can you bring the boat in sailhardy the problem is not to bring her in bruce but to hold her off the rocks once we get there upton jerked out his words get going do you hear get the sail on her quick before the catchers do anything you cant i started to say i shall he retorted you thought youd make all the running on thompson island didnt you wetherby now im going to tell you something we are still going to thompson island what in i asked in this whaleboat upton said tersely his words tumbled over one another ive got norris chart here he tapped his windbreaker thompson is only fortyfive miles northnortheast of bouvet christensens party put up a hut on bouvet well take stores from that well slip away before thorshammer comes i saw he meant it the risks of the wild scene ahead were nothing to him in the face of his dream he might force me to take him fortyfive miles northnortheast of bouvet but we would not find thompson island there i was inflexible in my own mind that thompson islands secret would remain mine so upton too knew of the roverhullet on bouvet one of the chain of emergency depots which have been laid round the palette of antarctica which the norwegian skippers had started to argue about that first night aboard antarctica when they were drinking hard looking at the icemasked island i hoped for the sake of the five of us that the roverhullet was still there get the foresail on her snarled walter i tugged at the halliards and the little rag bright ochrecoloured stood out like a board as it picked up the westerlies sailhardy stood up cocking a foot on the tiller to steer her while he conned his way through the ice the boat gathered way from kerguelen came a long ripping burst of fire upton jumped on a thwart and shouted obscenities at the catcher the whaleboat was too low a target to bit however even for an expert marksman his blue windbreaker hood fell back and he waved the knife at the catcher come on you cowardly bastards he yelled come and get yourself bloodywell mined come on pirow seemed to have regained his morale the herr kapitan kohler did us a favour really the catchers wont dare come into bollevika now the whaleboat picked up speed rapidly it was impossible to see where the burst from the spandauhotchkiss had gone sailhardy zigzagged round and through the ice never losing his main objective the small beach below the cliffs the sea darkened as we neared the island from the lowness of the boat the cliffs appeared more massive they were scored and striated notched and grained by the wind and the ice the whaleboat swept in to within a cables length of the shore a long swell boomed past while sailhardy held her in check coming round in a broad reconnoitring circle i saw the flat tabletop rock when the backwash recoiled from the cliff i started to say so but sailhardy had also spotted it were going innow he called the curious modulation in his voice made it clear above the thunder of the waves against the cliffs he flicked a glance over his shoulder and selected his roller he dropped to a sitting position by the tiller he swung the stern into the comber plumed with white ice and blowing spindrift halfway to the flat rock i whipped the sail off her she scarcely lost way the thrust of the swell was so great sailhardy gestured to me with his left hand he was about to lay her broadside on her port beam one moment we were in deep water the next against the cliff the rock lay exposed jump shouted sailhardy jump out out out dont let her side touch for gods sake i was first out over the bow almost at the same moment sailhardy leapt over the stern our heavy boots scrabbled for purchase on the rock as we held her and the other three sprang clear without pausing sailhardy and i lifted the boat bodily out of the water and staggered over the broken rocks to the cliff face out of the reach of the sea the beach on which we found ourselves was not much bigger than a tennis court it was easy to see we had come to the one and only landingplace for where the rock formed a natural corner out of direct reach of the sea and the wind a flagstaff had been driven into the face of the cliff so that it projected at an angle the flag and the rope had long since gone and the block at the top was rusted black under it was a weathered inscription in norwegian and english captain harald horntvedt master of the norvegia formally took possession of bouvet island in the name of norway on this first day of december and at this spot hoisted the flag of that country in due assertion of norways claim and sovereignty upton read it and laughed he seemed nearest the way i had known him first the bastards he said without rancour they got here first all right and the british government a year later waived all claims to bouvet but he added and his voice was hard no one said anything about thompson island my objective at the moment was to try and find the depot hut from the watermarks high above our heads it was plain that the beach became submerged in a gale sailhardy spotted the piece of board first it had been fastened with iron spikes into the cliff on the left or northern edge of the beach where a headland jutted into the sea it said simply roverhullet a faded arrow pointed to what might have been a manmade path running zigzag up the cliffsides confused mixture of glaciated rock and ice i lost sight of it near a formidable projection a veritable fortress of ice as big as the tower of london high above our heads weve somehow got to climb the cliff i said roverhullet should be at the topif it hasnt been blown away it is quite likely that parts of the path have been swept away by rockfalls since the norwegians were here sailhardy and i will make a reconnaissance will you hell said upton all youd have to do would be to roll a few rocks down on our heads or block the path without the depot wed be dead in three days and you know it yes i replied i know it i also know how desperate our position is even if we find the hut if you had any sense you d get back to the catchers as quickly as the whaleboat would take us theres enough rope in the boat to lash the five of us together said upton you wetherby will lead then pirow between you and sailhardy if he slips there will be two good men to hold him then me and walter in the rear sailhardy looked anxiously at the sky if it come up a full gale the sea will sweep this beach the boat will be lost upton smiled mirthlessly that boat is as valuable to me now as it is to you sailhardy get it up into the corner by the flagstaff and weight her down with stones if the path isnt too rough you and wetherby might carry the boat up to the top later after all the norwegians must have transported a whole depot hut and stores to the top i looked up at the grim cliffs and shuddered the norwegians had made the climb later in the season when there was less ice we did not have even an iceaxe to cut steps up the glacier should it become necessary i had an idea bring the rowlocks from the boat i called to sailhardy who had already started with great care to weight down the boat with some of the big boulders the place was littered with we may find them useful higher up as pitons that wrench of yours may be wanted as a hammer yet walter the prospect of the climb seemed to have cowed the big norwegian perhaps he was suffering from delayed shock from the mine too he surveyed the vague pathway gloomily one man slips and the rest go with him he said better we climb unroped on our own no retorted upton get that rope round us sailhardy i took the six rough horseshoeshaped rowlocks they were so cold they would have seared the flesh if my hands had not been gloved the rope was perhaps thirty feet long sailhardy tied and tested each knot carefully when we were about to start pirow bowed formally and shook me by the hand it was clear that he thought our last moments had arrived i wish you luck in the lead herr kapitan i wish it for myself too i shrugged and we set off up the illdefined path after the first thirty feet it widened and although steep was not dangerous we trekked up and up through the moraine pirow behind me started to blow heavily i raised my hand and called a halt lifting my eyes for the first time from the pathway my head reeled fully five hundred feet below were a series of rockpools beyond the headland which masked the beach one slip of the boot on the narrow track would have sent any of us crashing to a fearsome end far out to sea beyond the line of the icebergs i could see the three catchers my heart lifted at the orange splash on one of themit was the helicopter aboard crozet the thin line of ships stood blockade across the open lead of water how upton proposed to get past them in the whaleboat was beyond me we paused for five minutes not speaking then on and up the ascent became steeper and slippery the wind on the exposed face plucked at our clothing the weather was clearer which was a bad sign for it meant that the wind was coming hard off the ice after another few hundred feet i found myself gasping the raw air which rasped like a file in my throat behind me each man had pulled his hood as close to his face as he could on walters beard i could see the icicles where his breath had condensed and frozen we struggled on round a bend the pathway ran dead it was clearly defined and ended against the side of the huge fortress of rock which i had noticed from below the enormous rock overhung the cliff and the pathway like everything higher up it was coated with a veneer of ice i edged closer then beneath the sixinch patina of ice i saw a steel ladder set into the rock leading beyond an overhang twenty feet above my head walter i called bring that wrench or pass it up here theres a ladder under the ice ill try and chip it free i steadied myself and the wrench was passed cautiously from hand to hand each man fearing he might slip and take a deathplunge the height seemed to smooth out the rollers i swung the heavy wrench against the ice it bounced back i might have been striking the rock itself i struck again the solid head of steel splintered into fragments the cold had made it as brittle as glass i faced about precariously upton do want to go on with this crazy climb any further youre risking everyones lives the cold and the exertion had flushed his face that strange pink as if his anger were permanently engraved in it either you go on or you come back into this he replied he waved the knife hammer the rowlocks into the ice and climb up on them get going bruce broke in sailhardy let me go i but i had already started to untie the rope from my waist pirows face was pinched if you fall dont fall on me for gods sake he mouthed dont go herr kapitan in reply i hammered the first crude rowlock cautiously into the ice with the shaft of the wrench a few feet above the pathway level i swung myself up one foot across its broad horseshoe nothing else stood between me and the drop to the sea a thousand feet below carefully and not using much force so as not to shatter the wrench shaft or the rowlocks i hammered in another using the rowlocks as pitons i reached twelve feet where the rock overhang began through the ice clear as plateglass i could see the rungs christensens men had clamped into the rock even assured of the ladders safety each load carried to the summit must have been a hairraising experience i hung on a piton set below the overhang looking for a suitable place to drive in the next somehow the rungs of the ladder seemed clearer i balanced on one leg and drove in the next rowlock the ice stripped off the overhang like orange peel the rungs had been clearer because here the ice was only a couple of inches thick my gloves clutched empty air i started to fall the wrench and piton clinked on the ice and shot downwards towards the rocks and sea my foot slid off the piton as i slipped sideways i grabbed in frantic terror my right hand closed over one of the newlyexposed rungs at the same moment my left fingers groped found and clasped my feet swung wide away from the rock face over the sea below i cast one desperate glance beneath the four men were staring at me with as much horror as i myself felt there was only one thing i could could do i swung myself sideways and made a desperate clutch at the rung up my hand closed round it i hung for half a minute before repeating the manoeuvre the muscles in my arms started to kick i knew they would only last another few minutes i edged still one rung higher and then pulled my body in against the cliff resting my toes on the shelf of ice about six inches wide where it had peeled away slowly painfully i pulled myself up until my feet as well as my hands rested on the iron ladder the sweat froze on my face as it formed great gasps from my lungs i would have fallen if i had looked down the ladder continued at a gentler angle once it was round the bulge of the overhang and brought me out to a shallow plateau from which the pathway continued to the summit now clearly visible about five hundred feet farther up i could not see the others because of the overhang and although i heard sailhardy shouting the wind blew the words away i tried shouting back but it was futile for perhaps a quarter of an hour i rested and recovered my nerve and then stumbled up the easier gradient to the summit i dragged myself over the top fifty yards from the edge up a gentle path was a wooden hut heavily shored and stayed against the gales lars christensens men had built the roverhullet well the hut was big enough for a dozen men and there was an outbuilding which i guessed must be a storeroom each corner of the structure as well as the roof was guyed to steel posts driven between fissures of the rock in front was an iron flagstaff which had been bent double like a sapling by the gales i wished i had the luger as i moved slowly towards the roverhullet its lack of windows added to its air of utter desolation the backdrop of the massive christensen glacier made it appear puny the front door was held by four big sliding bolts unlocked which were heavily greased i slid them back and threw open the door it was eerie and halfdark and for a moment i wondered whether i would find inside some ghastly corpse like the one the famous explorer sir james clark ross had found in the kerguelen islands in the sa man with a bottle in his hand terror in his eyes and gigantic footprints leading up to him i put such thoughts from my mind and stepped inside it was hard to see and there was that curious smell of frozenness which only the antarctic can produce the walls were flaskedlined with ice there was a big stove in the centre of the first room and a notice in norwegian and english said this hut is for the use of distressed seamen there are stores provisions fuel and other necessaries in the storeroom beyond please put back whatever is not used i went through two more rooms and had to bend down to enter the storeroom when i saw the piles of sleeping bags blankets cases of kerosene lamps and a host of paraphernalia so essential for survival in the antarctic i remembered that christensen had originally planned to establish a weather station on bouvet but had abandoned the thought after seeing the wildness of the place in a rack heavily greased were a number of iceaxes pitons skis and oldfashioned throwing harpoons each with a length of rope attached to the shaft there were coils of thick rope hundreds of feet of it but before it could be used it would have to be thawed out i noted with approval that all the boxesand indeed the joints of the hut itselfwere all dovetails and dowels there was not a nail to be seen these men had known their job for in the antarctic wood changes its nature and the cold dries it out so that nails lose their withdrawal resistance i took four iceaxes and one of the harpoons whose steel shaft must have been six feet long and some pitons my immediate task was to bring the party past the iceladder to the hut we could make the path and ladder usable later on but for the moment they would have to cut steps in the ice as far as the exposed rungs from which i had hung i stood at the top of the cliff and looked out at the distant gi catchers before starting down the track crozet was apart from the others i watched in puzzlement for i thought i could see her moving since the orange of the helicopter showed against the general whiteness whatever she was about it needed sailhardys eyesight to see all i could distinguish was that crozet was much nearer the ice than the others who remained in the centre of the channel then i saw radiating like spokes from a wheel hub there were a number of other open passages between the ice to the north and northeast converging on the towering northern cliffs of the island they would be useless for a ship to negotiate but for the whaleboat i craned over the cliff and looked down ramming the harpoons blade firmly in a crack of the rocks to hold my altitude above the sea gave the effect of an aerial photograph of the ice below a number of fissures in the icebelt followed the contours of the island in other words there were small open channels running round bouvet which would easily take the whaleboat into one of the wider channels to the north and so avoid the catchers which lay to the southwest upton could not miss seeing them either i made my way slowly and cautiously down the path back to the great fortress rock and the iceladder i climbed over the overhang carrying two iceaxes and shouted sailhardys voice tense with relief came back crouching on the last exposed rung i handed the axes down and felt them being seized by invisible hands i climbed back to the top of the overhang with its dizzy drop to the sea for about fifteen minutes i heard the clunk of icesteps being cut and then sailhardy grinning hauled himself alongside me bruce boy he exclaimed i thought you were a goner that time is there a hut i told him about the roverhullet and the supplies theres enough there to last us a year or more it was also uptons first question when he appeared next he seemed in great spirits when i told him about the hut despite the height he swung himself up and down on his toes in impatience to be off pirow looked like a ghost and walter was sullen all of them were blue with the cold and it was not until we neared the top that some colour came back into pirows face upton walter and pirow made straight for the hut but i held back touching sailhardys arm i want you to take a look at the catchers i said i left my glasses behind in the factory ship crozet is easy to pick out because of the helicopter it seems odd that shes against the ice sailhardy took a long look its not so strange he said quietly shes doing exactly what aurora did to get a steady platform shes tied up to an iceberg you mean why should she want a steady platform he asked shes going to fly off the helicopter the roverhullet my dread since the loss of the antarctica that helen would attempt the impossible with the helicopter crystallised at sailhardys words the southwest quadrant of the horizon was ominously and unnaturally clear what wild eddies would arise above bouvets stark cliffs the only projection in the sea for thousands of miles when the gale hit them i could not guess we have got to signal her to keep off i said there are certain to be some emergency flares in the roverhullet storeroom look he replied i too caught the flicker of light above the orange splash the rotors were spinning quick i went on she mustnt come close it would be suicide here i gestured to the glacier slope behind the hut sailhardy and i ran to the hut i leading the way to the storeroom upton and walter were examining the stores with satisfaction and pirow was busy on his knees trying to get the stove going in the outer room do you see any flares here uptons manner changed at my question and anger started up in his eyes thorshammer no i said helen is flying off the helicopter shell kill herself im going to signal her although it was dim in the storeroom i could see the brightness of uptons eyes he moved swiftly over to the harpoonrack whipped up one of the oldfashioned weapons and stood with it poised above his head pointing at sailhardy and me walter here you know how to use one of these things youll stay just where you are wetherby there will be no signalling anyone do you understand but helen i protested its not helen alone but the skippers as well he replied theyre coming to fetch us because they cant get into bollevika by sea for gods sake doesnt your own daughters life mean anything to you except that you may be caught i exclaimed shes a fine flier he replied defensively she knows how to look after herself in the air theres no flier born who is good enough for bouvets conditions i snapped back let me find some flares walter balanced another long harpoon from the rack in his massive fist i had heard it said that he was one of the finest harpoonists in the southern ocean the harpoon is like a sailingship he said caressingly there is no sailor like a sailingship sailor there is no harpoonman like one trained to throw the old harpoons there is a sense of balance i turned to the stacks of cases i never saw walter move but the head of the harpoon crashed into the heavy timber within a foot of my face walter stood grinning another harpoon already in his hand sailhardy looked unimpressed but uptons face was full of admiration i was shaken by walters skill the skippers must have seen us through their glasses come up the pathway said the islander they know we are hereright here in this hut and they have the schmeisser i added upton started to laugh i did not like the sound of it there are no windows in the roverhullet are there wetherby are there sailhardy he didnt wait for our reply no one will move outside the hutunderstood walter he grinned again how about harpooning something quite new for a change the front door will stand wide open upton went on well hear the helicopter overhead shell come down low but i guess helen wont try and land right away before she sees the lie of the land reidar bull will be in the machine for certain with his schmeisser he wont expect a harpoon to be heaved at him hell think hes quite safe with a gun against unarmed men walter held the harpoon headhigh and made a lightning dummythrow by god i like that i like that he exclaimed listen upton i said youve already got blood on your hands youre making things worse its only a matter of time before thorshammer arrives she can lie off the island and shell this hut into oblivion if she wishes upton shook his head she can if she wishes he replied but we wont be here were going to thompson island in the whaleboat we can also go to cape town in the whaleboat i said sarcastically it is simply sixteen hundred miles across the worst seas in the world there was another change in uptons manner he was easy and friendly and he spoke directly to sailhardy youd sail your boat to cape town wouldnt you sailhardy we could stock her up theres plenty here for a moment he caught sailhardys imagination with his curious attractive power of drawing a person out of himself wed have to halfdeck the boat against the waves sailhardy said lost in the dream upton had conjured up but shed make it shackleton sailed seven hundred and fifty miles to south georgia and his was only an ordinary ships boat dont talk nonsense i said harshly upton we heard the roar of the rotors carl shouted upton come here dont go outside come here do you hear pirow came through to the storeroom the unspoken question dying on his lips when he saw walter with the harpoon the hut shook as the machine came low overhead it could not have been more than thirty feet up the sound receded and then returned as the machine came back from the seaward side the sound hung overhead the note changed the machine was coming down walter tensed and then ran quickly forward i gestured to sailhardy with walter out of the way upton with his harpoon by himself was not much threat and pirow was unarmed sailhardy rushed at upton he couldnt handle the harpoon sailhardy dodged an ineffectual thrust and grabbed the weapon from him i snatched an iceaxe from the rack and rushed after walter as i darted through the doorway i saw walter poise in his stride and lift the harpoon like a javelinthrower the helicopter was hanging about fifteen feet above the ground in front of the roverhullet the nose half pointing towards the doorway the cabin door was open and in it stood reidar bull with the schmeisser at the ready walter threw the crackle of the schmeisser came almost at the same moment but walter had dropped on the ground out of the line of fire and started to roll sideways in the split second the harpoon took to reach its target the machine dipped a few feet it might have been that helen saw it coming or it might have been an eddy of wind the harpoon trailing its short length of rope arced and missed reidar bull the steel head and shaft crashed into the spinning rotors the rest followed at lightning speed i saw the bight of rope snick upwards as it became entangled in the rotors one moment reidar bull was standing firing the automatic pistol the next the harpoonrope had snatched off his head the headless trunk stood transfixed i never saw the head fall the rotors gave a single flailing screech of torn metal like a shot partridge the headless trunk and the schmeisser spilled on the ground a buckled rotor still under power bit into the rocky ground and cartwheeled the machine for about thirty yards past the roverhullet into a boulder at the start of the glacier incline i sprinted to the wreck behind the perspex i could see helen in her sealeopard coat slumped over the controls my raiders glasses which i had left behind at the factory ship were suspended round her neck i hacked through the window with my iceaxe i jumped through and cut the throttle the thumping clatter stopped in my anxiety to get helen clear before the machine caught fire i forgot her safety belt i hacked it free there was a mark across her forehead and she was unconscious i picked her up in my arms and staggered clear of the machine in front of the roverhullet stood upton pirow walter and sailhardy walter cradled the schmeisser in his huge paws behind the group blood staining the rocks lay what remained of reidar bull i carried helen to them get the stove going i ordered pirow i dont know how badly shes hurt upton was casual she doesnt look too bad you callous bastard i started to say but he ignored me walter he went on dont hesitate to use it if either wetherby or sailhardy starts anything sir frederick said pirow theres a radio in the helicopter im going to see if it is all right wait a moment said upton the machine could still catch fire although it doesnt seem likely now he went to the corpse and turned it over with his foot with a measure of cool pleased appraisal which sickened me for gods sake i said sailhardy get that stove lighted will you and bring some blankets from the store upton grinned throw that thing over the cliff he told walter here give me the gun while you do it walter hesitated throw him over the cliff repeated upton what are you waiting for he balanced himself lightly on the balls of his feet walter shook his head there should be some sort of prayer after all just now he was a man perhaps the captain will say one and then i will throw him over christ burst out upton you walter a catcher skipper walter became surly id want it that way if i was lying there catcher skipper or no bloody catcher skipper carry on said upton therell be no prayers while im around i did not wait to see walter perform his grisly task i carried helen inside and sailhardy brought some blankets in which we wrapped her she was breathing easily and i could not find any bones broken both sailhardy and i reckoned she was merely stunned he also brought from the storeroom some pieces of wood chopped them up and lit a fire for our immediate warmth on a piece of metal he had also found at the same time he started the big stove in the centre of the room the ice would take hours to melt off the walls in ten minutes she stirred helen i exclaimed helen ill get a sleepingbag for her and some more wood said sailhardy she sat up and threw her arms round me bruce my darling my darling she sobbed i held her but she pulled back suddenly where are your glasses i brought them from the antarctica yes i said gently they were round your neck and i have them the helicopter bruce did it catch fire no i said but it will never fly again i told her briefly about reidar bull she seemed paler that means we cant get off this island upton came in yes indeed we shall with bits of your helicopter if not with the whole he seemed scarcely concerned about her geoffrey jenkins a grue of ice walter followed schmeisser in hand what the hell are you talking about now i asked get this clear wetherby said upton i am going to thompson island in sailhardys whaleboat so are youall of us in fact i need you to navigate i need sailhardy to sail it he indicated the schmeisser beyond that i have no use for you remember that sailhardy came back sailhardy you have the material now to halfdeck your boat theres all the aluminium you need how long will it take sailhardy put down the wood and looked at me for support a day maybe two provided the weather doesnt get much worse well have to carry the aluminium down to the beach and that will be quite a job helen listened in disbelief father she said quietly you have cause so much misery already drop this idea of yours about thompson island what we need most is warmth shelter civilisation he burst out laughing pirow returned carrying the helicopters radio hear that carl my daughter wants warmth and civilisation weve got everything we need for the moment here and thompson island is fortyfive miles away do you think i would give up now helen recoiled and sat silent we would make the boat voyage all right i told myself but when he had failed to find thompson island i could then try and locate thorsham mer and give ourselves up we would be in no shape for anything else after a few days in an open boat in a southern ocean storm pirow was jubilant the radio is undamaged ill show you ill fetch the batteries and aerial wire he looked sid eways at upton its a long time since thorshammer heard from the seaplane crew of hers id better get on the air before the destroyer starts to lose heart and comes to bouvet to keep her rendezvous with the catchers and us said walter grimly and us echoed upton three days until we leave you can string the destroyer along for that length of time cant you carl after that they can send a whole fleet to bouvet but they wont find us dont you think the catchers were watching us through their glasses i said they saw the whole business theyll see us leave in the whaleboat too so what said upton they dare not risk coming into the bollevika anchorage because of the mines let them see us go the weathers getting worse and thatll hide us too clear weather is quite exceptional hereyou know that and ive read kohlers reports yes i said the same goes for thompson island dont try and fob me off before we ever get there snarled upton fog orno fog storm or no storm we sail in three days time pirow came back and connected the batteries and aerial which he looped outside over a metal stayrope the light was going and the dimness added to the weird air inside the icelined walls as pirow imitating the seaplane crew began his probing tentative tapping on the radio we all huddled round the stove except walter who stood far enough away to prevent sailhardy or me from tackling him helen half propped up among her blankets and a sleepingbag looked graved and troubled the faltering weak signal went out from the long fingers again i had to admire the uncanny skill of the man with the immaculate hand he clicked over the transmitting switch paused listened his fingers fiddled almost like separate thinking entities among the dials is thorshammer answering upton asked pirow waved him silent the yellow light of the kerosene burners hollowing his eyesockets sketched his remoteness from our group suddenly he stiffened his left hand reaching automatically for the switch the right for the transmitting key his next signal faltered more than the first then he smiled and broke the tension tharshammer says keep that key downkeep keying she wants a fix she must get a fix to establish the liferafts position are you sure you gave her enough upton asked pirow ignored him but dummytapped with the key switched off smiling at me qqq qqq i am being attacked that is enough is it not herr kapital only three letters i got up and strode outside the tension in the roverhullet uptons overbright eyes the agony in helens and the barbaric walter brandishing the automatic pistol had got me down it was bitterly cold on the tiny plateau before the hut sunset sawedged the west i focused my powerful glasses on the catchers silhouettes yes there they were lights on crozets reflecting from the iceberg to which she was moored there was a frightening immensity of silence there was a fresh breeze gusting up to about twentyfive knots i reckoned but still the storm from the southwest had been far longer in coming than either sailhardy or i had anticipated it would accordingly be the worse when it did come thinking of the whaleboats chances in the great seas i shuddered uptons plan seemed more insane than ever next morning upton woke us early we had all slept round the stove upton pirow and walter taking shifts to stand guard we had broken open cases of stores and sailhardy had prepared a meal which we had eaten by the light of lanterns from the storeroom helen looked tired and fell into a broken sleep in the middle of night there had been a sound which had seemed to me like the glacier falling on the roverhullet but it had in fact been only the inner coating of ice on the walls crashing down when upton called next morning the room was warm and comfortable were going to strip some big pieces of aluminium off the helicopter and take them down to the beach he said decisively that should take us the best part of today tomorrow sailhardy and wetherby will halfdeck the boat while the rest of us get supplies down to the beach on the third day we sail some of my previous nights introversion was with me still when i thought of the puny boat and the great seas weather permitting i added weather or no weather he replied you can make up your mind about that and we sail down the channel into the waiting arms of the catchers i went on upton laughed come wetherby youre not as dumb as that so he had not missed the other iceleads to the north and northeast helen interrupted im helping bruce and sailhardy it is my helicopter after all i could not see how sailhardy and i were to carry big sheets of aluminium down the cliffside especially in the wind we would be snatched off the pathway before we had gone five hundred feet there was also the problem of negotiating the ladder section i started to object but upton stopped me you obviously havent taken a close look at the stores the norwegians brought a winch up here with them they must have hauled the sections of the hut up with it theres enough rope to rig a windjammer here is some already thawing two big coils lay close to the fire and the film of ice was melting upton went on youll also see that christensens men drilled some boltholes in the rock a few sheets of light metal wont be any worry he was right after sailhardy and i using iceaxes to prise loose the rivets had stripped off several large sheets from the helicopter to deck the bow and the stern of the whaleboat it became obvious it would be simplicity itself to lover them down the cliff face by hand without resorting to the winch which walter was busy rigging while upton kept watch with the schmeisser helen was shaky when we began but seemed to pick up her strength as the day progressed by midafternoon we had ripped the metal skin from a large undamaged section to the rear of the cockpit and had stacked it ready for lowering to the beach next day i had seen helen smile for the first time since landing on bouvet when sailhardy insisted on chopping loose her seat in the cockpit and putting it in front of the fire in the roverhullet either walter or upton had kept guard from the front of the hut while we worked and pirow had occupied himself with the radio and preparing meals there was not only quantity among the stores but a wide variety which would have kept a marooned party from boredom for months when sailhardy helen and i returned to the roverhullet for our midday meal upton had selected and stacked a pile of cases to provision the whaleboat the were also a couple of alpinetype lightweight stoves to heat things in the boat to me the cases looked woefully few upton had asked sailhardy how long it would take to sail the fortyfive miles from bouvet to thompson island the islander replied that it had usually taken about four hours to cover the eighteen miles from tristan to nightingaleperhaps a day to a dayandahalfs hard sailing to thompson the wind and run of the sea would be behind us knowing there would be no thompson island i had persuaded upton to take supplies for about ten days which i considered might be enough if we had to beat back to bouvet in the teeth of the gale we were also taking the helicopters radio and my hope was that after a week in the whaleboat in a blow everyone would be only too glad to surrender themselves to thorshammerif we could locate her or she us the project seemed riskier whatever way i thought about it sailhardy wrenched the last sheet of metal skin loose from the helicopter he smiled at helen well maam i suppose its better than using seaelephant hide to half deck the boat with she mocked him gently so thats what you had in mind for your epic voyage from bouvet to the cape i really think that sailhardy was sold on the ideaif only as a thoughtof making the voyage to the cape he was serious immediately you must not forget maam that on tristan the first and maybe some of the beet whaleboats were made of seaelephant hide stretched over wooden ribs three or four sea elephants would give us enough hide to do the job where do you propose to find sea elephants on bouvet she asked he pointed at the blockhouse shape of a small island which lay at the southern entrance to bollevika id bet you ma am that youd find some there there arent any animals on bouvet she exclaimed or insects or plants youre wrong maam he replied if you look hard youll see penguins on that little island i smelt them as we came in im sure there are seals round on the sheltered side of the island he waved his hand beyond the glacier if we are very lucky we might see a ross sealtheyre supposed to breed on bouvet i said it is the most beautiful creature in the southern ocean and its eyes are quite wonderfully affectionate helen laughed again how you two stick up for your southern ocean in every way sailhardy was carried away if there are adelie penguins down there maam then i dont need bruce for a navigator the adelie is the best pilot in the antarctic we on tristan know he steers by the stars and the sun and if i were making for cape town hed be the pilot i would choose she shook her head but i backed sailhardy the americans down at mcmurdo sound thought the adelies navigation was just one of those stories they carried out a test they ringed and marked five adelies and flew them two thousand miles away a year later the five walked back into their rookery at mcmurdo dont laugh sailhardy touched her leopardseal coat that is the creature you want to be afraid of maam hes wicked through and through hes the colour of dirty snow and his head looks like a huge snakes i dont want to hear any more she smiled youve convinced me the jobs done and we cant move anything until tomorrow i want bruce to take me for a walk up the glacier slope ill put this sheet on the pile then and get both of you some crampons and an iceaxe replied sailhardy he looked up the long incline scattered here and there with boulders cemented into the ice you wont be able to go far up maam i dont want to go far she replied all i want to do is to get away from this feeling of being watched all the time will you tell that oaf with gun sailhardy grinned and went off helen pulled back the hood from her hair in the pale sun it was golden bruce she said when the islander was out of earshot all this has a dreadful inevitableness about it no one seems to be doing anything i nodded towards walter that automatic pistol would cut anyone in half with a burst we must pretend to fall in with the idea of leaving the island under pressure for gods sake not herethey might hear you she said thompson island yes i replied i want to talk to you about thompson island up there where no one can possibly hear sailhardy returned with an iceaxe for me and crampons for our shoes he started to be jocular but he too lapsed into silence when he saw our faces not speaking helen and i trekked up the slope above us towered the massive cone of the christensen glacier a rag of cloud about the peak made me uneasy about the storm which had been so tardy in coming there was a bank of low cloud against the sun and i wondered if the reason for the relatively light wind so far from the southwest meant a blow not from that quarter but from the northwest a northwesterly cyclone meant a heavy swell from the same direction which would throw up a tumbled sea to make our voyage to thompson island all the more hazardous worst of all however would be the low cloud and poor visibility which went with it about half a mile above the roverhullet helen and i found our further path blocked by a face of ice which rose for about two hundred feet sheer we leaned against a big rock i handed her my glasses the view was stupendous she studied the catchers for a long time and then cased the whole quadrant of sea and ice to the northwest the north and the northeast until her view was obstructed by the glacier looking for thompson island i joked she dropped the binoculars to the length of their lanyard she gestured to the northeast its not there is it bruce despite the chart no i said its not there at all you could not see it in its real position from here even if it were clear the glacier is in the way her eyes were a mixture of pale gold white and green from the sun the sea and ice you mean thompson island is south of bouvet not north at all yes helen not north or northnortheast despite what the chart says south rather south with a little east in it better men than your father with better ships than a whaleboat have searched every inch of the waters north northeast and northwest of bouvet for thompson island you know with what results but south how can that be how sit down i said its a long story but before i tell you it remember one thingcaesium remember your father also and remember i could not tell you this except except that i know it was not you who shot down the seaplane she replied she pulled off one glove for a moment and held my glasses with her bare hand i have to love inanimate sometimes violent things to come to the heart of bruce wetherby a pair of raiders binoculars a compass of the seathats the way it is nothing static nothing restful always something at war with ice or warmth or life in that you can include thompson island i said why are you telling me about thompson island she went on why after all i am his daughter because i said simply i believe that within a week we will all dead in an open whaleboat one week she echoed one week ofus i leaned forward and kissed her lips it will have to do for a lifetime her voice was unsteady sailhardy thinks the same no he secretly cherishes a hope that one day he will make a greater open boat voyage than shackleton or even bligh of the bounty that blinds him the sea is his friend never forget not his enemy fortyfive miles to thompson island is nothing to him except that it is not fortyfive miles and there is no thompson island where the chart says she said she faced me bruce why why are you doing this thing why not take him to thompson island let him have it even if it sends him completely completely unstable when he finds that his caesium and all the rest of it is a dream it is not a dream i said it is not a dream i heard myself what you said to him about the caesium myself it is because i believe that there is caesium on thompson island that i am telling you this i said slowly thompson island must never be foundnever you know what caesium means to our presentday world a fullscale atomic war could be fought over thompson island so you are prepared to sacrifice your own life and the lives of five other people yes i said unless i can persuade your father when we are nearing the end of our tether to give ourselves up to thorshammerif we can find her i began thompson island lies she held her hand now gloved again over my mouth bruce my darling are you sure you want to tell me this quite quite sure it is an act of faith i replied thompson island lies sixtyfive miles to the southsoutheast of bouvet it was minutes before she replied and her voice was so soft i could scarcely hear the words now i can ask how you alone know this if you look on the vernier scale of my sextantthat is the scale thats used for reading the angle of the sun and the starsyoull see there is a little notch clearly filed that is the latitude of thompson island no one has ever searched for it there but why during the war i made what i considered a major discovery about the antarctic light rays bend greatly in the antarctics cold air you get refractions you cannot take an accurate sighting i dont understandwhat are you trying to say the peculiar quality of light rays bending makes the positions of distant objects greatly distorted in other words the sextant lies it puts the sun and the stars on which we rely for navigation out of position i discovered that there is a consistent error of one hundred and ten miles too far north therefore instead of being fortyfive miles to the northnortheast of bouvet it is sixtyfive miles to the southsoutheast she wrinkled up her eyes in a puzzled way which brought to my eyes all the loveliness that had lain dormant for so long i dont understand the logistics of what youre saying although i accept it bruce but what i cant understand is why when everyone was wrong including norris when he first fixed the position of thompson island that error should not have remained constantin other words even if it was marked at such and such a position and strictly it was wrong why couldnt everyone else making the same error because of light refractions get there all the same the same thought struck me i said your assumption is that an oldtime sealer was capable of getting an accurate fix and that bouvets position itself was known bouvet itself i drew a map superimposing the various positions where bouvet has been plotted i replied there are at least four from reliable sources and three from less reliable to say that thompson lies fortyfive miles northnortheast of bouvet doesnt mean a thing in fact i found on checking that the man who discovered bouvet the frenchman captain bouvet de lozier first was supposed to have sighted land somewhere near where norris said thompson lies she laughed ill bet you shot bouvets position down in flames too i grinned back yes i did you see bouvet based his longitude on the cape verde islands not on greenwich i told you so she said delightedly but what about the oldtime sealers you were starting to tell me about i caught her mood two important things i spent months checking and rechecking logs and sealers sighting reports in the southern ocean among old wetherbys records briefly it was nothing for a sealer to be out ten minutes in latitude under the most favourable conditions of weather sun and stars their longitude really had them beaten though dont forget even during the napoleonic wars the only british warships which carried chronometersessential for determining longitudewere the commanders of convoys it was only four years after napoleons death that norris found thompson island after months of research i found one could more or less rely on any old whaler being out about a degree and a half in longitudesay ninety miles what i cant understand is why you didnt tell the admiralty all this when you were pressing your point about having seen thompson island i shrugged i was laughed practically out of the admiralty down the horse guards parade i said i could see it in their facescrackpot prove it they kept on saying it was just that opportunity i was asking for one gentleman in the hydrographic department told me pointedly that it would throw every map ever made of the southern ocean and antarctic into the wastepaper basket and such waste could not be afforded i remember his words still empiricism versus absolute knowledge captain wetherby we prefer absolute knowledge it may sound silly but how did you arrive at the true position of thompson island when your sextant lied along with all other sextants by taking four different sextant sightings of the stars not the sunto balance the refraction errors four ways i said norris was not bruce she interrupted quickly bruce look she pointed up the incline to where the slope resumed beyond the barrier of ice leaning over was the unmistakable snakelike head of a sealeopard unless there was some way round and down however we were in no immediate danger we must get back to the roverhullet and warn them i said the massive head and shoulders swayed backwards and forwards as if seeking some way down suddenly from high above towards the summit of the glacier a white object detached itself i thought at first it was a chunk of ice look helen theres something diving down on the sealeopard it was a giant bird his neck outstretched he plummeted down like a stuka divebomber he could not be making for the sealeopard i told myself quicklythere must be some other prey we could not see on the ledge where the animal stood albatross exclaimed helen the diving bird was upon the sealeopard he ballooned his wings to avoid hitting the snakelike head but it was too late we saw a flash of light as a claw lashed out there was a burst of white feathers and the white warpaint of the albatross was stripped down to the red flesh underneath i could almost see the effort of the birds neck muscles as he tried to lift himself he would have made it except for a projecting sawedge of cliff wounded he could not pull himself clear he crashed into the glacier ice and came tumbling down in an untidy heap among the rocks at our feet helen started to run towards the albatross which rose up to a crouching position he craned his fine neck and tried to rise across his left wing was a long tear from the sealeopards claws bruce we must help him she began but she stopped at the look in my face and the iceaxe in my hand no i said gently no helen five minutes ago he was an adventurer who could have flown from here to the south pole and back now he is a heap of feathers i moved forward to administer the coup de grace hell die slowly if we leave him but quickly and mercifully if i do it he must die either way helens eyes were full of pain i raised the iceaxe as i did so the albatross swung his neck round in the exquisitely beautiful motion which is the act of courtship of the great wanderer of the seas a grace worthy of a fonteyn i lowered the iceaxe and looked at helen she went forward and examined the halfextended wing i went closer i expected a savage slash from the strong beak it did not come but instead the albatross stood swaying his head ill come back with sailhardy i said well bring some ropes and get the bird down to the hut at the beach tomorrow we can catch some fish for himthere are bound to be some left behind in the rockpools when the tide recedes we mustnt wait here much longer we hurried to the roverhullet as quickly as our crampons and the iceslope would allow sailhardy was delighted at the thought of saving the albatross rather than ropes he brought a fishingnet which had been thawing in front of the hut on the rocks walter with the gun did not hinder us at the icecliff sailhardy and i found the great bird still crouching it was a matter of minutes to put the net round it together we carried it back and set it free in front of the hut as sunset closed on our second night on bouvet at first light next morning upton began preparations for lowering the aluminium sheets to the beach sailhardy helen walter and i set off down the cliffside track the norwegian bringing up the rear with the automatic even at the ladder down which i helped helen hand over hand there was no chance to jump walter the descent was easy this time with ropes secured to the upper rungs walter came down them with the agility of a cat for the last section of the descent i roped helen to myself in front and to sailhardy behind about three hundred feet above the beach sailhardy stopped and called look the catchers are launching a boat helen stood hard back against the rock face away from the fearful drop i trained my glasses on the ships the crazy idiots what are they trying to do walter tapped the schmeisser coming to get us i dont see lars brunvoll just sitting waiting sailhardy pointed at the seas breaking heavily on the rocks and the beach no one could land from an ordinary ships boat in that the sea is the same for sailing tomorrow i said grimly we have a tristan whaleboat replied sailhardy my god exclaimed helen watching the whitecapped rollers race across the anchorage the islander looked with a curious mixture of satisfaction and awe it will be easier when we get into the open sea maam true the boat will pitch a lot but shes small enough not to stretch from wave to wave that helps quite a bit i focused the glasses on chimay brunvolls catcher boat away the tiny thing pulled hard from the ships side with two men at the oars on either side the man at the tiller could have been brunvoll but i was not sure the boat rode clear of the catchers lee and disappeared in a welter of spray i saw it capsize and the five men were flung into the water shes over theyd better haul them out of the waterquickly exclaimed sailhardy they wont last long in this cold the catcher steamed in what seemed slow motion to the struggling men and i saw some being hauled aboard good riddance said walter come on weve got work to do lets get down to the beach we scrambled down the final section to the rough shingle the whaleboat lay where we had left her we unroped ourselves i looked up from the top of the cliff the first piece of aluminium decking was starting to swing down at the end of a long rope helen sailhardy and i started for the boat as our boots crunched on the shingle a tiny head rose over the side of the whaleboat the soft luminous eyes of the creature no bigger than a fullgrown dachshund stared at us its a ross seal whispered sailhardy neither he nor i had ever seen this rarest and most beautiful of antarctic animals helen started forward dont maam began sailhardy but she was already at the tiny creature it went unhesitatingly into her arms his minkgrey fur was slightly darker underneath than above she turned to me her eyes shining bruce look at him see how he trusts me i laughed and stroked the lovely head of the seal pup that is just the trouble with the ross seal they trust everyone the old sealers exterminated them by simply hitting them over the head they trust humans completely helen put the little creature on the beach he walked from her to me and then to sailhardy he did not like the common southern fur seal turn his flippers forward when he walked and i was surprised that he did not slip on the wet rocks since the undersides of his flippers were covered in softest down i had never before seen a seals flippers with fur on them he allowed us to stroke his head but helen was clearly his favourite she picked him up again and he nestled in the crook of her arm i have never seen anything so lovely she smiled im going to take him with us in the boat well take fish along for him too it was the remembrance of helen with the exquisite creature in her arms half enveloped in her sealeopard coat with the backdrop of the basalt cliffs and little beach that was to return to my minds eye again and again in the days to come bring him along for sure said walter sullenly hell make good eating when the going gets tough walter i said quietly if you touch this pup ill kill you with my bare hands he raised the schmeisser at my tone keep back he said surlily youll find youre killing the bloody thing yourself when your belly cries out for fresh meat a sheet of aluminium clattered on its rope over our heads sailhardy and i seized it as it swung in the wind against the cliffs we found that we would probably need only four sheets to halfdeck the boat both fore and after with rope and tools we had brought down from the roverhullet we bent shaped tied and fastened the aluminium to the canvas and wooden ribs we worked all day pausing only to unship the cases of stores which upton and pirow lowered to stock the boat by the middle of the afternoon the boat was ready halfdecked but sailhardy was not satisfied i wanted to get away from the raw little beach to the roverhullet before the weather became worse the sun was obscured and great clouds drifted round the twin peaks from time to time squalls masked the tap of the cliff helen helped stack the cases of supplies out of reach of the sea in the natural corner of the cliff where horntvedts flagstaff was the seal pup followed her everywhere although i wished to get away sailhardy took a long look at the ominous weather buildup in the southwest and started in on the steering lines and the rudder for fully an hour he flexed the supple lines through the holes greasing and regreasing them checking testing again and again he went repeatedly over the odd projection on the port side near the rudder from which a rope ran through the sternport into a big enclosed space below the helmsmans seat nothing would make him hurry over his searching examination while he checked and walter stamped in the growing cold helen and i fished in the rockpools with the seal pup which joined in hauling up the codlike notothenia fish as if it had been a game by the time sailhardy had finished we had collected a pile of about twenty which we stacked with the other supplies upton had agreed the previous night to taking the albatross in the boat because of sailhardys insistence that the great bird would be invaluable in finding land once it could fly againthe islander reckoned it would be within a weekand so he said help us locate thompson island sailhardy had reinforced his argument by pointing out that in a small boat in bad weather it would be virtually impossible to take an accurate sighting i suspected however that sailhardy was more concerned with the albatross safety than with locating thompson island we had decided too that we could lower the bird down the cliffside by the rope by putting the net round it again i was well aware of sailhardys methods of navigationby the direction of a flock of petrels flying by feeling the temperature of the sea at hourly intervals with his hand the colour of the water and a host of other esoteric sealore his only manmade instrument was a kind of rough wooden backstaff by which he took angles on the stars but never the sun his landfalls were as good as mine when it made the climb to the roverhullet the wind began gusting heavily and plucked at us on the exposed rock faces as it increased during the evening upton became more uneasy and morose almost nothing was said but he pored over the chart after our evening meal round the stove and at intervals he opened the door and looked out on one occasion i caught a glimpse of the catchers lights rising and falling the night had a resonant ominous background of sound from the waves thundering on the cliffs below and the wind tearing at the glacier above i went with upton to the door and found the albatross huddled against the front wall i called sailhardy and we carried him unprotesting through to the storeroom we did not need to tell each other how little we thought of our chances of leaving bouvet the next day in the middle of the night my sailors instinct suddenly brought me broad awake i raised up in my sleepingbagwe had each selected our own for the boatand looked round the dim light of the stove etched walter unshaven and with sockets of shadows for eyes evil as he sat crosslegged with the schmeisser across his knees helen lay with her back towards me and the yellow light made even softer the colour of her hair loose on the flap of the sleepingbag pirow turned uneasily as if his mind were on the faked messages he had sent earlier in the evening to thorshammer but it was uptons face that brought me fear and revulsion the pewter hue was tinged with blue including the eyelids as if the caesium were justifying the blue in its spectrum perhaps the light added to the grotesqueness for there was no sign of age not a wrinkle anywhere everything was tautit was the face of a dead man mummified with his dreams in his face sailhardy had heard too and was awake it had sounded to me like a double bass string being plucked both of us guessed what had happenedone of the steel cables holding the hut had parted the wind shook the walls and a peckle of hail rattled against them we kicked ourselves out of our sleepingbags and crawled across to walter i spoke softly so as not to wake the others that was one of the guyropes wasnt it walter was on edge aye it was ill tell you straight captain although were on the wrong sides i dont like this bloody wind itll be blowing a full gale by morning christ what will it be like at sea try and persuade your boss about that i replied roughly the wind carried a burst of low thunder from the breaking waves we wont last more than a couple of days bruce we must rig a new ropenow if anything else gives the roverhullet will go over the cliff whispered sailhardy i reckon we would be better at sea than here he added defensively jesus said walter okay see what you can do in the storeroom we cut off a length of the thick rope which had been used for lowering the aluminium and supplies we opened the door the icy wind took our breath away we drew our windbreaker hoods round our heads the air was laden with flying spicules we could not see but felt our way to the corners of the hut to locate the broken stay it was one of two in front with expert hands although in gloves sailhardy knotted one end of the rope round the iron pole in the rock and the other to the trailing end from the roof upton was waiting by the stove when we returned helen and pirow were also awake i turned back my hood and pulled off my gloves are you still going ahead with this insane idea of yours i asked upton if i have to drive everyone of you down to the beach at the point of the automaticyes i glanced at helen you can do that but you wont be able to drive a fullyladen boat into the breakers at the point of a gun i said if we ever get the boat into the water ill tell you what will happenshell be smashed against the rooks by the next roller dont try and stop me wetherby he shouted we sail tomorrow sea or no sea gale or no gale listen i wont listen to a wetherby he yelled completely out of control the contorted face bore no relation to the sleeping mask thompson island is mine i tell you there was no point in arguing but on the rough little beach next morning following a nightmare descent after slinging the albatross down in the net he saw what i meant we had loaded the boat while she lay behind the corner of the cliff great seas crashed on to the rocks under favourable conditions lifting the boat as she wasthe helicopters radio under the stern decking added to the weightwas a job for six men upton and pirow would not hear of leaving the radio and we had used it as ballast in the net with the albatross the tiny seal pup which had shared helens sleepingbag in the roverhullet had come down the pathway buttoned inside her coat upton raised no objectioni think he was trying to make a gesture to her it is hopeless i said theres no future in going on with this nonsense upton let us get back to the roverhullet while we still can shut up damn you he snapped i am going to thompson islandtoday get that clear the day was still dim although it was midmorning the sun was shut out by thick driving cloud which seemed to have a ceiling lower than the cliffs new icebergs had piled up with the gale but there were open passages between huge rafts of ice the roar of the surf was matched by the ice crashing and grinding i think sailhardy too secretly admitted the futility of the scheme though he didnt say so there would be only one way to launch a boat in this said walter proper davits and a ships side upton swung round on him so suddenly that the blue bib of his windbreaker staine now with salt flapped in his face davits my god walteryouve got it i dont see any davits answered walter heavily look upton went on excitedly up there we looked up the cliffside track as if half expecting to see some davits materialise the rock the rock and overhang went on upton get up there walter and secure two ropes on either side of the overhangfrom the rungs of the ladders theyll serve the same purpose as falls from a davit all we have to do is run the ends round the thwarts of the whaleboat lift and fend her clear of the cliff and well get a clean launch above the waves the scheme seemed impossible to me upton well be thrown against the cliffs as soon as we touch the water upton snatched the schmeisser from walter and pointed it at me take your choice he said his voice deadly with menace you assist or else you can stay herewith a dozen bullets in you i looked helplessly at helen who stood whitefaced silent cuddling the seal pup i shrugged there was nothing i could do walter scrambled up the pathway and more quickly than i expected the two ropes snaked down sailhardy and i ran them round the thwarts and when walter returned the three of us with pirow helping lifted the boat shoulderhigh and secured them the boat was suspended headhigh against the cliff and when we let her go would swing forward about fifty feet round the second cliff which enclosed the beach from the north until she was directly below the overhang one false move and the canvas side would be torn open the albatross was under the forward decking i helped helen in by lifting her up on my shoulders pirow and upton followed using walters shoulders the two of them hauled walter up then sailhardy and last me we fended her off the cliffside with the oars and inched forward until we hung free above the waves sailhardy and i eased the ropes loose round the stern and forward thwarts respectively i awaited his signal the smallest lack of synchronisation between us when we cast off would pitch us all into the sea now rising and falling under the keel sailhardy tensed watching sea and wind let go he shouted the boat dropped heavily into the water sailhardy moved quickly to the tiller and i whipped up the ochrecoloured mainsail the boat gathered way swiftly towards an icelead running to the gaunt sulphurcoloured northwesterly shoulder of bouvet which is known as cape circumcision sailhardy then stood up on the stern decking steering with his right foot on the tillerhead while he conned a passage through the ice i turned from securing the mainsail halliard to say something to the islander i looked aghast at the horizon so that he too swung round to see the bank of ragged cloud drifting on a level with the glacier gave the impression of a line squall but i recognised it as the spearhead of the storm i had anticipated there was a flurry of icy rain cloud segments started to writhe up and down in contorted whorls a mile wide deliberately a cloud shape started to reach down towards the seas surface to the northwest two further vast and perfectlydrawn rulers of cloud funnel spinning on an axis a mile wide and held upright by its own gyroscopic motion then it pitched forward and lunged into the sea a great gout of spray and ice rose swaying like a bali dancer the wedded mass of sea and cloud moved towards us we cleared the stark cape as the waterspout crashed against the cliffs a quarter of a mile astern of the frail boat bouvet vanished in the turmoil to hide his agitation sailhardy became formal course for thompson island steer northeast by a half east i ordered under parrys arc for three days sailhardy scarcely left the tiller our estimate of the time we would take to reach the locality of thompson island as marked on norris chart had been hopelessly astray four hours for eighteen miles to nightingale from tristan we had reckoned and therefore we had given ourselves about a day and a half at the outside for the fortyfive miles from bouvet to thompson the storm had decreed otherwise from the time bouvet had disappeared sea and wind had made our lives a freezing wet hell how many times sailhardys skill had saved the boat during the night i do not know but i had witnessed it at least half a dozen times during the daylight hours several times the islander had had to drag the boats bows round to face the gale in order to ride it out without being swamped before putting her back on course as best he couldfor thompson island by dead reckoning i considered that the whaleboat must have reached the approximate vicinity of thompson island on the chart my noon sight was almost duefor what it was worth in the bucking boat there was a vast drift of storm cloud through which there was an occasional glimpse of sun this was the position sight which i hoped would persuade upton that there was no thompson island where the chart said upton sailhardy walter and i were in good shape but i was worried about helen the wild gyrations of the boat had exhausted her and she was very silent pirow had sent off more faked liferaft signals to thorshammer and on the first day after leaving bouvet had told us with a grin that the catchers had signalled thorshammer telling of our escape adding that we stood no chance in the wild weather thors hammer had replied pirow said that her chief concern was to find the liferaft the destroyer refused to accept the catchers repeated assertions that the signals were faked i crawled along the rough grating on the bottom of the boat to pirows cubbyhole where my sextant was stored away from the prevailing wetness i gave the thumbsup sign to sailhardy sitting steering his right shoulder and arm were caked with congealed ice and the accumulated spicules round his hood seemed to carve deeper the lines of his strong face he grinned back upton jumped to a sitting position on the forward thwart he shot a glance round the empty sea visibility was about a mile is it time wetherby are you going to shoot the sun now i paused and showed him the time in a quarter of an hour at our voices walter who was still in his sleepingbag pulled himself out and looked round you could pass by bloody thompson island and never see it in this shut up snapped upton were close and if we have to beat round in circles for a week ill find it what about that birdis he showing any signs of wanting to fly the albatross was clinging like a figurehead to the decking in the bows he was picking up strength daily we had fed both the seal pup and the bird on the fish we had caught and the albatross had accepted it docilely walter shook his head glumly if land were close hed be wanting to be offand theres not a sign of it upton became more agitated were looking after the damned thing too well its no wonder he doesnt want to leave when every home comfort is laid on for him i took my sextant from its case and wiped the fogged eyepieces a flurry of fine sleet and snow blocked out the sun i stood straddled by the amidships thwart trying to keep my balance the horizon swung rapidly i took the instrument from my eyes its hopeless upton he grabbed the schmeisser from walter get on with it get on with it i looked at helen up to that moment i think she still thought there was some remote hope for her father now she saw him as a madman trying to force the sun to shine at pistolpoint her head sank forward so that her chin rested on the seal pups head i shrugged what do you expect me to domanufacture a sun and a horizon youre stalling wetherby you know the answers and by god im going to get them out of you bruce called sailhardy theres a break coming quick the islanders keen eyes had detected a gap in the flying wrack i rammed the eyepiece to my eye one finger on the vernier scale for a brief moment a sallow light appeared while i battled to keep the horizon glass steady my fingers twiddle the micrometer screw then the flying cloud obscured the sun blast blast blast burst out upton did you yes i replied i got a fix not too bad in these appalling conditions where is thompson islandwhich way he demanded without a thought for intricacies of a navigators calculations it showed the state of his mind i did not reply but put down the sextant on the thwart and started to work out our position give me the chart i said to upton he pulled the parchment from his windbreaker and handed it to me i made a little cross on it i felt i had to go through with the useless charade it was idle trying to explain to upton the errors and difficulties of using an outdated chart there i said we are now one mile to the north of thompson island i looked at helen as her father swung round and scanned the sea to starboard she was sobbing gently bring her about he ordered sailhardy despite the danger of the sea catching us beamon the islander manoeuvred the boat the whaleboat was now trying to work across the run of the sea and the wind one could only guess speed but i let half an hour pass we reached the position where thompson island was supposed to be as far as the eye could see the sea was a turmoil of blowing spindrift under a blanket of cloud according to my calculations were sailing over the solid land of thompson island at this moment i said the irony in my voice brought him to me its another filthy wetherby trick he screamed its a trick i tell you you bastard he thrust the schmeisser against my chest father dont helen stumbled over but he thrust her aside roughly what have you done with thompson island he shouted thompson island thompson island he was so beside himself that i dont think he consciously grabbed the sextant but despite the fact that he was unaware of its workings he picked it up and tried to read the fix i had made he stiffened when he spoke the hysteria was gone and in its place was a coldness which was more deadly why he asked would a man make a notch on his sextant wetherby why walter i ask you as a navigator of sorts too why would a man file a little notch let me see said walter upton handed him the sextant his eyes never left my face what does it mean walter read it would the position of the notch be anywhere near here im not the bloody captain and i need time for a thing like this said walter sullenly this is a fancy instrument too upton was frighteningly quiet youve got a minute to tell me whether the notch indicates thompson island wetherby it was walters fumbling with a type of sextant he had never handled before that reaffirmed in my mind my resolution that i and i alone would keep the secret of thompson island i could almost sense helens and sailhardys shock as i pretended to acquiesce yes i said that is the position of thompson island helen gazed at me wideeyed here let me show you walter unthinkingly handed me the instrument i was barely a jump ahead of upton walter he shouted dont he was too late i took the sextant and tossed it overboard it was fully two minutes before upton spoke in a strangled voice in gods name what did the notch in the sextant say walter what is the real position of thompson where is thompson island i dunno i hadnt a chance to see i dont know my way round a fancy thing like that sextant the island cant be so far from here though because the notch lay close to his reading today uptons hands were shaking so that i thought he would fire the schmeisser involuntarily where did your notch show thompson island to be wetherby where man where i laughed harshly look around you upton its not here is it and while i live you wont find out either he levelled the schmeisser at me youll take me there i say youll take me i cut him short were in the middle of damnall in as bad a storm as ive seen it may get worse if youve any sense left youll tell pirow to signal thorshammer now now do you hear and try and have her pick us up while theres still time never he said in the space of a few minutes you have become the most valuable person in the world to me you and you alone know where thompson island really is heaven help us if he should find out that helen knew i thought his voice was unsteady you would not have thrown away the sextant if you had not believed in the caesium would you bruce he became almost imploring bruce i know about caesium and you know about thompson island we could be a great team he saw the look in my face and his eyes became hard very well then we search well search the sea for thompson island i saw that he meant it despite the weather i knew too how many expeditions with specially equipped ships had searched thousands of square miles of these selfsame waters for thompson island all without succes a search in the tiny whaleboat would result in one thing onlydeath within a few days if i set coursewith the loss of the sextant i would have to rely on sailhardys methods of navigation to pass near bouvet we might be able to regain the roverhullet i felt sure that in the exhausted state we would find ourselves in then upton would be forced to lie up and i could try and get a signal off to thorshammer i was firmly resolved as before not to reveal the whereabouts of thompson i was gravely concerned at helens weak state and a search which i knew in advance to be futile would bring tragedy no i said we do not search it would be suicide sailhardy will have to navigatehis own way you mean breathed upton i turned away from the overwrought face to the islander steer southwith a little east in it sailhardy looked keenly at me and then without a word brought the whaleboat round to the course the gale seemed to be mounting in fury and we were driven forward by a tiny storm staysail no bigger than a mans shirt which i rigged the whaleboat tore to the south and easttowards thompson island by afternoon it was a full fiftyknot blow near the top of the beaufort wind scale if we could have hoveto we would have but there was nothing to be done but try and keep afloat for three days the whaleboat raced like a frightened animal before the gale there was no stopping guiding or holding it sailhardy and i shared the tiller watches sitting in the high stern the wind threw against our baths as we huddled over almost double a volley of ice snow and frozen spray with the stengunlike insistence of a spanish dancers heels at times i found myself sobbing at the remorseless beat the long bursts of the fusillade until i thought i could endure no longer then would come a merciful lull only to be followed by a further savage volley scything everything before it i was barely conscious of bits of ice growlers and small bergs storming past in the uncertain light which seemed to vary between pale green by day and complete blackness by night wherever the spray settled it froze until our faces the mast thwarts gratings and canvas sides were coated the motion of the boat prevented any heating and the meals were sorry affairs scooped with fingers out of cans walter and upton shared the forward deckedin section with the albatross and pirow was in the stern section with the radio it was dark inside his cubbyhole and he might have been dead except for the occasional flicker of sound as he continued to fox thorshammer the irregular ribs and rough gratings made sleeping a hell and the wicked chill seemed to penetrate through the waterproofing and fleece of our sleepingbags i had stretched the ochrecoloured mainsail from the stern decking to a thwart and under it helen sailhardy and i lived either he or i being on tiller watch the seal pup shared helens sleepingbag and brought a tiny patch of warmth in the pervading cold when i had called sailhardy during the previous night and crept into my sleepingbag i had been desperately worried to hear her talking deliriously now in the middle of the morning seeing her lying semicomatose i made up my mind to carry out the plan i had formulated when i had thrown my sextant overboardto overpower pirow and signal thorshammer if she could find us and it was a big if in the galethe secret of thompson island would still be mine for no one would listen to uptons ravings i knew too that i must act speedily the strength was running out of me and when taking over the tiller from sailhardy for the dawn watch i saw what a toll the southern ocean had taken of his great strength his eyes were sunken after the cruel watches of the past week and he had been slow in speaking wiping his lips with the back of his gloves to clear away the frozen saliva and mucous on the stubble of his upper lip upton and walter had given up their gunwatch over sailhardy and meit was hardly possible in the stormbut they still watched me carefully whenever i moved from my sleepingbag i looked at my watch tenthirty sailhardy had been at the tiller since eight oclock i had heard pirow give a brief signal when the islander had taken over and as it was midmorning upton and pirow might not suspect if they heard another after a break of several hours i would have to muster all my strength and speed to overpower pirow and get off a message before they missed me i looked down at helen the ice had rimed her closed eyes making them strangely ethereal she broke into an incoherent mutter i caught nothing except my name the exquisite little seal pup peeped out from the mouth of her sleepingbag up forward there was no sign from upton or walter i inched out of my sleepingbag and dragged myself along the gratings to pirows cubbyhole it was so dim that it took me a minute to make out the man with the immaculate hand he was sitting in front of the radio i heard him move and i jammed myself hard down on the grating the snap of a switch followed he became silhouetted as a weak dial light came alive i could not see his face but from the stoop of his shoulders it was clear that he like the rest of us was nearing the end of his tether let him start sending i thought let him get the preliminaries done then i would jump him when thorshammer was listening the weak signal started thorshammer thorshammer it scarcely needed pirows skill to bluff the destroyer now the signal was weak and faltering enough to be genuine pirow threw over the receiving switch i was surprised to hear the strength of thorshammers reply she must be very close to come through as clear as that thorshammer to liferaft personal captain olstad to lieutenant mosby keep your key down let your batteries run out we are close we will find you keep your key down pirow started to exclaim in german i slithered forward along the gratings my left arm went hard round his windpipe he gave a strangled gasp with my free right hand i locked down the transmitting key my instinct told me something was wrong i wrenched round walter was coming on hands and knees from the bow a flensing knife in his fist behind him upton was standing the schmeisser pointed i threw myself out of the cubbyhole but i was still fulllength walter leapt to his feet at the entrance as i shot out he paused momentarily perhaps even he would not kill a man lying at his feet i jerked sideways and jackknifing my body kicked his legs from under him he was adroit he fell heavily twisting like a cat and took the fall on his shoulder but it kept his right hand under him for a moment i grabbed for his thick beard and swung astride his powerful body the knifethrust would come before sailhardy could help me my hands clamped on his beard and i jerked his head a couple of inches sideways the crude skill of the tristan boatmen had not succeeded in smoothing one of the gnarled knots in the ribs it would serve as a garotte as efficient as anything in south america i felt walters knifehand go up for the plunge i rammed the top of his spine where it joins the head hard against the knot his mouth was wrenched wide open fear burst into his eyes drop that knife i heard the weapon clunk against the bottomboards we were within three feet of helen i saw that her eyes were open and she was staring startled at what was going on now is the time i told myself savagely with the feel of the thick beard in my hands and killlust in my heart to get the record straight about the shooting down of the seaplane from walters own lips walter say it and say it quickly who shot down the seaplane who ordered it helens eyes dilated with horror and fixed on her father i heard three clicks i jerked round without releasing walter upton was tugging at the schmeissers trigger it was pointed into my back my fear and the explanation of the misfire were simultaneous the firing mechanism was locked by oil which had frozen solid i scarcely recognised my own voice upton you can go on clicking that blasted thing as long as you like in this weather but it wont fire i shoved walters head further back his spine would snap in a moment tell her tell who it was i shot it down sir frederick ordered me to i took the knife and dragged myself upright uncertainly i lost my footing as the whaleboat rolled and i crashed heavily on the thwart the knife spinning across to uptons feet he picked it up walter pulled himself forward and crouched on his hands and knees near upton his face livid unable to rise uptons eyes were bright he seemed in better shape than any of us i should say thank you to this frozen gun he said slowly as i gasped for breath i forgot for a moment that you are the only person who knows the secret of thompson island dont be a bloody fool again and waste your strength i want it all for thompson island thompson island for god s sake upton your daughters not going to last but you are he said you are the one person who matters to me we will find thompson islandtogether my weary brain made a hurried calculation assuming that we had travelled directly due southeast from the norris chart position of thompson island we might well in the past three days have covered the one hundred and ten miles which separated the false and the true positions of the island in my weak state and for helens sake i was almost tempted to try and find the warmth and the good anchorage pirow had spoken ofhow many days ago now how i could locate the island without my sextant i did not know but sailhardy might be able to with his strange methods of natural navigation bouvet with its wellstocked roverhullet was a better proposition if we could find it again than an unknown anchorage but at that moment i would have welcomed any shelter away from the storm but i did not intend upton to know how near i was to agreeing to find thompson island you were mad to leave bouvet i said listen had thompson island been where norris had charted it what could come of finding it there could be all the caesium in the world but you couldnt take it away in this little boat you might find it but you would have had to give its position away in order to be rescued uptons answer underlined the state of his mind youre wrong bruce theres a whole fleet of ships waiting at thompson we wouldnt need to be rescued he laughed to himself you can take your pick when we get thereyou can have a liner or a freighter or a tanker just what you wish there was no point in going on with talk of that kind i crawled into my sleepingbag to try and get some rest before taking the afternoon watch from sailhardy upton stood grinning down at me and then he too stumbled forward out of reach of the icesharpened file of wind i fell into a broken uneasy state which was half sleep and half semiconsciousness towards midday i drew helens head into the crook of my arm she did not wake but mumbled something which i could not follow i feared for the coming night sailhardy too must have passed out at the tiller for half the afternoon was gone when i heard him slither down the decking and shake me his articulation was thick and the long vowels seemed to have difficulty in getting past his cracked lips he tried to say something but gave it up and instead gave a curious stiff and unnatural wave of his arm at the sea and the wind it was a gesture of surrender i was aware of a lifesapping lethargy in my limbs and arms why not i argued leave the whaleboat to it own devices with the rudder lashed rather than forsake the warmth and shelter of my sleepingbag for the raw hell of the tiller seat better to let the boat broach to and sink for none of us i felt sure would see the next day out i chafed helens hands which was as cold as a corpses the seal pup provided a tiny patch of warmth i watch sailhardy eyes shut drag himself half into his sleepingbag and then fall fulllength on the gratings i sat upright it took me about five minutes to kick myself clear of my own bag forward upton and walter lay like dead men there was silence from pirows cubbyhole the only sign of life was the albatross near the two men in the bows which was moving his wing as if exercising it i slipped across the icecovered metal decking to the tiller and undid the lashing which sailhardy had secured before i felt sure taking his last watch below i crouched as the thin lances of frozen spray stabbed at my back on the gale for an hour i tried to keep my seared burning eyes on the waves and steer the boat away from the worst i remembered the quality of the light starting to change my soggy mind told me night was at hand but i had no will or strength left to call sailhardy or unclamp my gloved hand from the steeringarm the whaleboat drove on racing down each long roller heaving laboriously up the next while all the time the gale iceblasted my back hood and arms with flying granules it was my sailors instinct alone and nothing to do with my will which perked me to semiconsciousness later i was to know that about six hours had passed the whaleboat lay in a calm sea of diaphanous white light the fury of the westerlies was dead the silence was more unnerving than the storm my hand clamped on the tiller no longer swung corrected swung to keep her stern to the waves the wind was gone i told myself because i had died at my post it was a dead light too not the dayless nightless coloration of the past week but a diffused whitish light tinged with blue i glanced at my watch it was after midnight i saw where the light was coming from then a series of immense flares laced the sky in green flame blue and violetthe southern lights one wing rose up like a scarlet and violet scimitar from the direction of the south pole and brandished its wild glory across the unreal sky the flares outlined the dome of the heavens one moment rising in bursting splendour along skypaths like the spokes of a wheel the next receding towards the pole in a petulant bicker of light never however did they lose their colours and the broken cloud which passed across the face of the aurora enhanced rather than diminished the grandeur i looked round me unbelievingly for there was no ice on the water and still in the absence of the southern lights there was a whiteness being reflected from something which i could not see the albatross stood like a figurehead on the bow decking flexing and reflexing his damaged wing and gazing ahead my first thought was for helen with the boat lying still i could get one of the alpine stoves going and give her something hot i prised my numb hand from the tiller and straightened my cramped limbs it took me ten minutes of rubbing and banging my arms and legs before i could leave my position helen i said shaking her she lay without moving she was breathing shallowly and the drawn face with the antarctics white beauty mask over it sent a tremor of fear through me helen i tried to kiss her but all i felt was the crackle of ice and the skin tearing from my lips i found one of the stoves and a can of soup i lit it and its tiny circle of warmth was more comforting to me than the great blazes which danced across the sky sailhardy lay still he was still alive but only just there was a stir from forward and upton sat up in his sleepingbag he looked at me the sky and the sea in disbelief he crawled over to me why isnt there ice on the water bruce his use of my christian name was an indication of his own distress his sunken eyes became alive thompson island youve brought me to thompson island i tried to laugh but the cold held my jaw i have not the remotest idea where we are i couldnt give a damn for thompson or any other mystery at the moment all i want is some hot food i propped helens head against me and gave her a spoonful of hot soup she took it uncertainly and her eyes remained closed the seal pup stared inquisitively i filled the spoon again and drank from the can myself and then passed it over to upton i felt the warm life of it flood inside me he passed the can back threequarters empty get another couple of cansin there i said indicating the stern cubbyhole he was back quickly and heated them while i tried to get helen to take some more try and get some down sailhardys throat i told him hes pretty near finished helen opened her eyes the glazed look of delirium was gone what is it bruce did you find thompson island the way she said it made the name sound like a curse i dont know where we are i said i dont see land all i know is that its calm and the sea is free of ice i cant even account for the light i gave her more hot soup and did the same for sailhardy it must have been an hour before he was fully conscious and he seemed very weak and lethargic upton roused both walter and pirow who looked like a ghost we brought out the second alpine stove and cooked our first hot meal in a week it was nearly dawn by the time we had finished the light began to change almost imperceptibly the hemispherereaching flares of the southern lights drew back into their icy matrix the whole upper lobe of the sky became one great sweep of light in a huge arch which stretched not north and south like the southern lights but east and west the gigantic tracery was faint and white although there seemed to be a background of rising colour it was something i had scarcely hoped ever to seethe rare parrys arc it seemed a fitting glory for our deliverance if indeed deliverance it was i told helen what it was and she sat up the faint white of parrys arc began to be laced with brilliant reds scarlets greens violets and blues then the arc itself became double in a breathtaking display of ethereal pyrotechnics and spread itself across the whole sky the arc elongating itself into an ellipse which seemed to stretch from the weddell sea to australia my god called upton front the bows the light from parrys arc was bright enough to reveal the awesome spectacle as far as the eye could see the whole horizon to windward was a gigantic mass of icebergs between a thousand and fifteen hundred feet high behind them still higherhigher than the cliffs of the great ross barrier itselfreached a wall of ice we lay in a bay probably fifty miles across of ice perhaps five miles astern on our starboard quarter the northwestern cliff of floating ice continentit was scarcely less than thatthrust a squared buttress into the southern ocean under the uncertain light it was impossible to tell where it began and ended and out to port there seemed to be a patch of heavy fog i realised then that we were in the presence of the phenomenon which had first enabled norris to see thompson island and seventy years later captain fuller and the third recorded time myself in cycles of seventy years a great continent of ice builds up along the shores of the antarctic mainland detaches itself and drifts northwardstoward thompson and bouvet islands any big icefield will clear visibility but it took all of a continent of ice to clear the fogshrouded shores of thompson island which lay in the heart of the southern oceans weather machine to back up what i now knew was one of the secrets of thompson island i remembered that when the japanese had conducted aerial surveys of the antarctic coastline directly to the south of bouvet they were surprised to find that they bore little resemblance to lars christensens air photographs of three decades previously and i was struck by the coincidence that in the same year that captain fuller saw thompson island three famous clippers including the cutty sark had reported passing clean through a continent of iceshe had used those words in her log to describe itand all three had barely escaped destruction i rose to my knees and looked round the horizon but the great flare of parrys arc which had lit the distant ice barrier faded and it was impossible to see much we were all too weak and too overcome by the sight to do anything but stare sailhardy croaked look at the albatross boy the bird was balancing himself above the cutwater with his wings wide the last starlets reds golds blues and violets of parrys arc made a tracery across their whiteness for a moment he hung on uncertain flapping his wings then he launched himself dipped for a moment towards the water picked up wheeled round the whaleboat twice and struck off towards a point beyond the port bow there was a commotion at my feet and i looked at helens sleepingbag the seal pup was fighting to kick himself free the little animal shot out of the mouth of the bag he leapt on to the thwart next to me and stood with his head cocked every muscle tense someone was knocking on the bottom of the boat thompson island for a moment i thought sailhardy or helen was striking the bottomboards in some final convulsion of weakness knock knock knock someone might have been rapping a knuckle on the underside of the boat saidhardys eyes opened and he put his ear to the gratings i knelt down and did the same the islander exclaimed faintly its the tristan knocker the tristan knocker i could see his excitement but he was so weak that he had to speak deliberately to get the words out its got a scientific name in south georgia but on tristan we call it the knocker its a big fish like a cod thats the noise they make when theyre courting look at the seal the little animal had slithered across the thwart and was gazing excitedly at the sea at any moment he would go over the side upton stood over us gaunt wildeyed what is it what is it you two s a i l h a r d y s a t u p i t s l a n d t h e t r i s t a n k n o c k e r spawns in shallow water theres landclose the seal pup dived over the side it was just light enough to see in the dawn the albatross made a point of white against the dark patch out to port which i thought to be fog uptons face was alive land thompson island helen turned her face away if it is the meteors base i will know it said pirow you cant mistake the entrance and the headland walter screwed up his eyes but the albatross was now out of sight that would be the way to go sure but how there s no wind and were too weak to row get up to the tiller wetherby said upton there is no way on her i began there will be he replied im going to row without waiting he went forward and returned with the bag he had salvaged from the factory ship he filled the syringe carefully we watched fascinated with walter helping he heaved up one of the big oars into position in the thole gripping the oar with his right hand he took the hypodermic in his left and thrust the point into the muscles of his right quickly he changed hands and repeated the strange performance what the hell i said caffeine he said shortly now get up to the tiller this is not the time to start giving yourself fancy drugs he did not take his eyes off my face but sat at the oar clamping and unclamping his fingers then he did not seem to be able to open them any more he grinned im going to row this boat to thompson island caffeine paralyses the muscles i cant take my hands off the oars theyre going to stay there until we reach thompson island steer over therewhere the albatross went yes i i clambered stiffly up to the tiller seat the boat felt lopsided with one oar but i brought her head round towards the dark patch the sun came up and turned the vast amphitheatre of ice into a breathing panorama the sea was bluegreen and calm and my eyes could scarcely tolerate the whiteness of the barrier we were heading away from the nearest cliffs which rose to full view in the direction of a belt of fog which completely blanked off the eastern and southern shores of the barrier the seal pup sported about the boat with a tristan knocker in his mouth pirow and walter cooked more food and walter took a short trick at another oar but soon gave it up helen brought me some hot food and had some herself but she looked deathly pale uptons stroke became weaker and weaker suddenly i felt a strong thrust underneath the boat it took us quickly into the belt of fog before i realised that the boat was in the grip of a powerful current i felt the warmth first and then the wetness of the fog upton dragging the oar which he could not unclench was hidden from view the fog was so thick that helen only a few feet away became a murky outline the current swept the boat on and on once helen called to me in a frightened disembodied voice to ask where we were going the warmth was as unexpected as the darkness i reached down cautiously and tested the water with my ungloved hand it too was warm compared with the normal icy seas of the southern ocean we broke out of the fog thompson island lay before our eyes i identified it immediately the low level east point like a blue whales snout was unmistakable i had seen it with my own eyes and i had studied captain norris sketches of it the entrance sloped away abruptly and to the west was the point norris had called dalrymple head but it was upon neither of these that our eyes fixed in wonder and awe it was upon the giant glacier which cappedto use norris own words the island like a nightmare caul the strange colour made one automatically think of it as evil it rose up two thousand feet sheer its foot in the inner anchorage which was still out of sight it had none of the opaque whiteness and soft undertones of blue and green of the floating icecontinent which encircled the island and had aroused our wonder earlier the caul was bottlegreen and translucent to such a degree that one could see huge trapped boulders deep inside its heart there was a tracery of white in a group about halfway up which looked as if it might have been the entombed skeletons of half a dozen blue whales the baleful green gave it an inherent quality of malice heightened by my realisation that the anchorage entrance of ragged basalt and pumice cliffs resembled the open jaws of a serpent there was no sign of ice or snow on them by contrast the caul towered in archangelic glory and stretched away out of sight to the south upton hampered by the oar gazed speechlessly his voice was thick when he gestured at the cliffs flanking the entrance caesium caesium striated and grooved with white like the stripes on a zebras flank were the veins of priceless ore i had never seen upton so moved the gaunt face was radiant under its patina of stubble argyria and fatigue mine he exclaimed all mine the strong current swept us in towards the point like driftwood pirow was smiling the sight of thompson island had restored his morale the fleet is waiting for you herr kapitan i turned to look at him the boat was swept round the headland into a long fjord see he said canted against the northern bank of the anchorage was a liner i did not need to see her name that clydebuilt silhouette was as familiar to me as london bridge for months i had studied itthe streamlined funnel set further aft than was usual during the war and the peculiar derricks forward the liners picture had hung in the chartroom of hms scott the liners last agonised signal outward bound to melbourne in was fresh in my mind qqqqqqqqq south westliner kyle of lochalsham being attacked by unknown ship before my eyes in thompson islands harbour lay the kyle of lochalsh a little further down the fjord halfbeached was the tanker gronland rommel never knew that kohler had won one of the afrika korps battles in the frozen fastnesses of the southern ocean the loss of fifteen thousand tons of aviation spirit and diesel oil she was carrying to the middle east had reduced still further britains hold there gronland had vanished while under my charge the tankers heavy feeder hoses were still over the side i saw now the source of kohlers apparently unlimited supplies of fuel another of kohlers victims was tied up alongside the gronland a liberty ship whose deck cargo of tanks and lorries looked absurdly new in the bright light inside the fjord she too had disappeared without trace far to the south of the cape of good hope they were my ships and kohlers ships in the fjord i shared neither uptons elation nor pirows satisfaction and my thoughts were reflected by the pain in helens eyes the natural harbour would i foresaw be a perfect stagingpost for aircraft travelling from cape town to sydney via the south pole and a strategic base of the first order for flying patrol over the vital sea route round the cape but i felt a surge of despair at the sight of the caesium veins uptons personal battle had ended in triumph but the worlds struggle over this hidden island of incalculable wealth would end in chaos yet i told myself as we were drawn further in to the fjord helen and i alone were still the repository of the secret of the islands position i eyed upton if i could get hold of the schmeisser there were a score of other ships scattered about the anchorage some of the names i could read others not the beautiful danish training sailing ship kobenhavn was there her disappearance in the southern ocean without trace before the war with a crew of sixty cadets had been a sea mystery as deep as the loss of the marie celeste near the kobenhavn was the berwick one of the great teak fliers which had broken all records from calcutta to london in the s a big ironsided windjammer was broken in half across a reef in addition stacked like fragments of corpses in a mortuary were ships masts teak and oaken timbers figureheads stanchions cabin doors big oldfashioned teak binnacles with kelvin compasses and oil sidelights broken oars harness casks whole deckhouses a long mainyard pointed skywards as if it had been dropped from a plane the footropes and gaskets still in position overwhelmed by the sight i steered automatically for the far end of the fjord where i could see jets of steam in the rocks spurting from some underground volcanic source the glacier was more impressive close up where the tongue of the ice entered the water it was sharp not smooth and rounded as one would expect from the wash and weathering of the current it would be warm where the steam jets were i told myself and all of us needed warmth upton did not speak but stared like a man in a dream at the caesium seams as we slid along with the current pirow waved as we passed the groniand look herr kapitanit was you in hms scott that made us slip those hoses and get away to sea so quickly the man with the immaculate hand the fine ships were as much his victims as kohlers i brought the whaleboat into the shallows sliding to a standstill against a rough beach of basalt and pumice a jet of steam blew from a fissure in the rocks twenty feet above our heads i seemed to be choking with warmth and i pulled off my gloves i jumped uncertainly over the side to secure the boat as i felt land under my seaboots a wave of emotion and weakness almost overcame me i threw a bight of rope round a rock to moor the boat a tiny springtailthe wingless fly of antarcticasettled on my hand i had thought never to see a land creature again i picked helen up and carried her ashore bringing the sleepingbag for her to lie on i had to assist sailhardy walter said upton bring me some hot water and see if we can get my hands loose the palms must have been raw from the rowing but he seemed oblivious of pain take the schmeisser you bloody fooli dont want wetherby to get hold of it at this stage his eyes were hard you wont be as lucky this time wetherby the oil will have unfrozen by now in the gun pirow clambered out too and stood next to me he looked down the fjord liebe gott he said huskily it is good to be back there was pride arrogance and a touch of triumph in his ashen face the undamaged state of the shipskohlers victimspuzzled me there had never been any hint from kohlers signals in the german war records that he had used thompson island as his base it was clear that kohler had kept pirow in the dark as to the name and position of this southern ocean base the german sea fox had done the same to his own oberkommado der marine in two years he had sent the high command only half a dozen short messages listing his amazing successes he like pirow believed that while you kept off the air while raiding you lived did you send boarding parties and bring the ships in afterwards i asked pirow he shook his head the herr kapitan kohler was a sailor like yourself he used what the southern ocean gave him why risk the meteor in action when your ships would come to him here in the fjord what do you mean the current replied the man with the immaculate hand it is deep and powerfulyou want to see what happens to a ship in its grip it is no ordinary current herr kapitanyou see the vessels it has brought in from the ocean to this graveyard a current is not that powerful no herr kapitan it is not further out it is a strong current which will bring a derelict in and all the sort of stuff you see here but near thompson island it becomes a killer it sweeps in past the entrance on the side of the fjord where we are now and then look he pointed at the foot of the glacier there was a great swirling eddy it seems to nosedive there we lost a boats crew trying to investigate it closely on the other side of the fjord the countercurrent is weak by comparison the herr kapitan had his anchorage there and he always entered the fjord on the countercurrent side you mean you just sat here he held out his hands the ships came because i signalled them sometimes it was a fake distress call sometimes he grinned an order from the officer commanding the south shetlands naval forceyou in other words herr kapitan wetherby it was merely necessary to bring them into the fogbelt where the current becomes so powerful and it did the rest it brought them in like lambs to the slaughter the kyle of lochalsh was armed with sixinch guns i said he nodded across the fjord you havenot noticed meteors gun emplacement over there we unshipped one of our inch guns and mounted iton that side so that we could cover the enemy as he was swept along this side of the fjord we had every inch of the fjord taped for ranges resistance would have been suicide i was filled with foreboding listening to pirows boasting the weapons and victims of our war seemed so insignificant beside the potential in the rock seams above our heads walter was massaging uptons hands with warm water i carried helen to the stream of warm sulphursmelling water where it cut through the pumice on its way to the fjord i shifted some lumps of pumice to make a support for her back what is my father going to do now she asked my own anxiety was reflected in her voice he talked about shipsand here they are i said but you cant sail away without a crew in any of them even assuming that they are in any shape after all these years listen she said pirow was talking animatedly we were slightly higher than the boat where the stream began up the slope the herr kapitan kohler thought the inch gun in the emplacement was better technically than those harwood had at the battle of the river plate he enthused but kohler always marvelled at the english rate of fire that gun is automatic on the rangesevery inch of the fjord is tabulated you simply cant miss upton got his hands free he gave them a quick glance and then turned to walter could you load a gun like that pirow interrupted there is no need to pick up the shells there is a hoist which brings them right to the breech christ said walter all this sounds as if youre planning a war ive got my island and ive got the means to defend it went on upton stretching himself theres a big magazine under the gun went on pirow when meteor put to sea a gun crew was left behind except the last time in order to engage hms scott there are probably some smallarms too bruce whispered helen it gets worse not better you must get to the radio and signal thorsharnmer im desperately afraid of what he is up to sailhardy came slowly over to us did you hear bruce yes will that gun be of any use after all this time hope started into helens face sailhardy did not wait for my reply it must have a film of rust inside the barrel if upton tries to fire it hell blow himself to pieces i shook my head if the gun had been on this side of the fjord the warm side i might have been hopeful there arent any warm springs over there the temperature is polar near the glacier things dont rust in the dry antarctic cold just after the war the americans found a shotgun at least fifty years old in a camp by the ross sea the barrel was still burnished bright upton walter and pirow came ashore and walked stiffly along the beach upton flexing his fingers bruce said helen eagerly here is your moment look theyre all three wrapped up in what theyre saying the radio is in the boat signal thorshammer be quick boy sailhardy exclaimed watch that gun for gods sake ill shout if they turn i raced stumbling on the rough pumice to the whaleboat i threw myself under the decking to get at the radio i clicked over the switch there was still some power left in the batteries i fiddled for a moment with the tuning dials and took the first frequency which dropped into my mind metres raiders frequency dotdotdotdashdashdashdotdotdotsos sos i flicked over the receiving switch holding one earpiece against my head and listening with my other ear for the telltale crunch of boots on the shingle i cast round desperately i wasnt a skilled operator like pirow and probably the signal was weak i must get through to thorshammer give our position and warn her about the current and the gun in my anxiety my wartime code signal came to me it was all i could think of gbxz i tapped no reply i switched frantically to the metre band gbxzto all british warships i clicked over the reply was loud and clear dr dram coming to your aid keep transmitting for d if bearing vkyi thorshammer beware liferaft i missed sailhardys shout it was walter who tore at me sending the headphones spinning pirow was there too clutching at me as if i had outraged his precious radio walter pulled me half out of the cubbyhole on to the gratings i thrust him aside he wasnt that strong yet he got off a message and the key is locked exclaimed pirow god alone knows what hes said upton stood by the boat have you switched it off pirow nodded he turned to me what did you say to the destroyer the hell with you i retorted anyway thorshammer is coming for you shes got the bearing now shes been asking for so often get in there upton told pirow see what thorsham mer is saying call it out while we watch wetherby in a moment pirow called i cant understand shes saying gbxz that is the british wartime code to all british warships and now dacoming to your assist ance are you sure its thorshammer signalling yes called pirow shes telling us to keep transmitting there was a short pause now shes calling liferaft liferaft keep transmitting keep your key down can you hear me can you hear me pirow said upton come out of there pirow was badly shaken i want you to send a message do you hear just the same weak sort of message you have been faking up as coming from the liferaft you are to give our exact position dont be crazy said walter helen and sailhardy joined us youre telling thorshammer to come and get usjust what this bastard has been doing i did not like uptons look im telling her to come not necessarily to come and get us what is our position wetherby go to hell i replied find out the position of thompson island yourself no matter said upton put the key down as the destroyer wants pirow let her get a good bearing find out how far away she is and how soon shell be here that is very important pirows mouth was taut can i elaborate a little bit technically i mean do what you bloodywell like but bring that warship here to thompson i dont understand began walter youdont have to replied upton i want you strong feed yourself upright now pirow will give us an idea how soon the destroyer can be here you have to load inch shells into the hoist of that gun over there the big norwegian looked astonished youreyoure going to fight it out with thorshammer no he said he waved at the graveyard none of these fought it out with meteor ill play kohlers game the fjord is ranged to the yard all we have to do is get on the gun and point it let thorshammer come in on the currentpirow will see to that youre a harpoongunner walter itll be easy the destroyer will be a sitting duck by god exclaimed walter i interrupted incredulously it seemed to me the final insanity i could see that helen thought so too you cant sink a warship upton you cant i would sink awhole fleet for those he replied pointing at the veins of caesium i am going to blow her out of the water the surprise will be complete the crew certainly wont be at action stations when she comes in on the current dont he ridiculous i said he waved again at the caesium veins they said thompson island was ridiculous you know they laughed at you too just the same way as they laughed about your albatross foot i believed in thompson island and now i have it britain norway germany americatheyve spent hundreds of thousands of pounds searching for thompson no they sneered it did not exist you knew it existed i had only my faith i also believed in caesiumhere it is pirow came out the batteries are very low so ive switched off theres enough power for only a few mare signals thorshammer is happy though shes got her bearing and shes on the way when will she be here when man pirow was very certain of himself nat before evening if she had our exact position the bearing wasnt all that good shell still have to search aroundsay in a radius of ten miles shes certain to locate thompson island by radar during the night but i guess her surprise will be so big that she wont risk coming in until daylight food what we want is hot food exclaimed upton this afternoon we will cross the fjord to the gun no rowing for you walterwetherby and sailhardy will do that i want you fit to work that gun by tomorrow morning we gathered driftwood and made a big fire on the rough shingle close to the boat without the fire it was warm enough to shed our heavy clothing and by afternoon we were all feeling fitter and i was relieved to see some colour in helens pale cheeks she was very silent however and apart from the preparation of the food did and said little after another substantial meal at midday we set off across the fjord to the gun emplacement sailhardy had taken more of a beating than i thought and he seemed to flag at his oar very much at the end of the pull although the current was so powerful it had not the grip on the shallow draught of the light whaleboat it would have had on a big ship it was relatively easy to steer at a shallow angle across the current towards the glacier head and then use the countercurrent on the emplacement side to coast down to the gun itself the sight of the gun filled me with dismay it was a magnificent incher mounted in a concrete emplacement about twenty feet above the level of the fjord on a shelf of rock concrete had also been poured over the rock at waterlevel to provide a landingstage in which were sunk several metal mooring rings helen bit her lips when she saw the gun and cast me a glance of apprehension sailhardy looked strained and reserved but upton and walter were jubilant we tied up and walter and upton jumped ashore walter guarding us with the schmeisser while upton investigated it was clear to me that a destroyer even ready for action would fight a onesided battle against the gun upton ran back to us down the concrete steps from the gun itself carrying a czech pistol he must have found in the arsenal come on wetherby come and have a look thors hammers in for the surprise of her life there was no doubt about that on the firing platform i realised again what a genius of a gunnery officer kohler must have had for a moment as i stared along the sights of the weapon i remembered what kohlers guns had done to hms scott before i could get close to sink him with torpedoes one of the inch shells had gone through the starboard boiler while her whole horsepower was thrusting her in for the kill and she went over to starboard with a list which drew the awe and admiration of the simonstown dockyard when eventually i made my stricken way through the roaring forties to cape town one boilerroom and the after messdeck were full of water and dead men and at times the starboard gunwale was awash i remembered too how when kohlers superb salvo crashed home into the vitals of my ship i automatically ordered sailhardy on the torpedo tubes to fire all torpedoes into the sea set to sink before we ourselves were blown up by them his voice had been steady over the phone back to the bridge he had asked me to lay hms scott broadside to her target and to let him fire them at the enemy rather than into the sea water pouring in hms scott had swung beamon to the wild sea sailhardy like nelsons gunners at trafalgar had fired over open sights on the roll of the sea two of his salvo four torpedoes had sent meteor reeling to the bottom of the sea i dragged myself back into the present kohlers gunnery genius had rigged an effective handhoist for the heavy shells which meant that firing them was easy there was a complete set of calibrated ranges according to the speed of the current and the physical features of the fjord the headland was sketched next to its rangeoddly enough in yards and not metres where the cliff started to ascend from the entrance there was a patch of pumice like a brick kiln it was marked as such on the range chart yards i did not want to see any more thorshammers fate was sealed once she came round the headland into the fjord i went back to the boat without speaking walter inspected the gun while upton guarded us and then pirow removed the radio from the cubbyhole and spent the best part of an hour rigging it at the rear of the gun the journey back to the warm side of the fjord was easy we drifted down the slack countercurrent on the glacier side towards the entrance and then rowed into the strong current which carried us down past the ships graveyard to our original landingbeach with its steam jets we collected more driftwood and lit a big fire the suns last light made the glaciercaul more evilly green than before darkness fell the stars themselves looked baleful reflecting off the glacier we ate another huge meal and lay in our sleepingbags upton had told us to be ready to leave for the gun before dawn walter who seemed to have regained much of his strength sat by the blaze with the schmeisser i lay awake turning endless futile schemes over my mind i fell into an uneasy sleep the air of unreality of the fjordthe gun and the destroyer coming to her doomwas heightened when upton woke us the southern lights lit the fjord in blue and violet and glittered off the glaciercaul dominating everything sailhardy and i rowed like sleepwalkers helen drew her hood over her face when the chill of the glacier struck us i could not see her eyes but i felt inwardly that they too must have taken on the unreal light of our surroundings pirow was talkative tense back in his wartime role of the man with the immaculate hand upton and walter eagerly discussed ranges and speed of loading the afternoon before they had slid one of the long naval shells into the breech and swung the muzzle of the weapon from one range to the next according to the calibrations then they had set it on the headland target all that was left to do now was to pull the firing lanyard when thorshammer appeared the whaleboat eased alongside the landing stage come on walter come on pirow said upton he turned to me you three stay right here in the boat see were going to be busy as soon as its light but dont try anything anything do you hear do you expect me to sit here with hands folded if the thorshammer returns your fire i asked she wont he said confidently youre quite safe helen dropped back the hood of her sealeopard coat father for the sake of he turned his back and said harshly to pirow call out thorshammers signals and yours to her in the silence the boots of the three men clumped up the concrete steps to the gun i heard the radio come alive pirow repeated thorshammers signals in a low chant dri am coming to your aid shall i reply sir frederick he asked in his normal voice in the silence uptons voice was clear how soon will it be light walter half an hour maybe light enough to fire aye i can see the outline of the headland already across the fjord the tracery of old masts and the silhouettes of the dead ships were starting to show against the first light which unobstructed by the low entrance to the anchorage unlike the glacier end where we were which was still in blackness uptons voice was exultant bring her in carl bring her in liferaft stumbled the man with the immaculate hand mosby to thorshammer cannot send much longer the transmission rose fell ebbedweakness a surge of strength then exhaustion hold on hold on pirow was calling out thorshammers signals taking bearings on this transmission i could almost see pirow grinning at his eatandmouse game cant last much onger he tailed off then like an exhausted man taking a grip of himself are you close thorshammer thick fog radar show island or big iceberg keep sending keep sending upton broke in say it is ice not land pirow she mustnt be warned she must not know anything until she comes round the paint on the current pirow resumed his chant while he transmitted ice no and clear visibility here strong current came back thorshammer are you ex periencing same uptons voice came back jubilant weve gat her carl weve got her walter shes in the fogbelt caught by the current i stood up and shouted upton stop this madness stop his face was livid as he leaned over the edge of the firing platform shut up do you hear shut up he pointed the pistol at me youve outlived your usefulness sir frederick called pirow shes saying put your key down put your key down do i the interruption diverted uptons attention and saved my life for gods sake how long will she take in the grip of the current to get here he asked disappearing from view about twenty minutes i guess replied pirow lock the key down said upton the chatter of the key turned to a continuous failing note as the power ran out he continued to forget me in the intensity of waiting ten minutes passed suddenly sailhardy raised his head bruce theres a wind feel the dawn wind began to steal off the cold glacier side of the fjord towards the warm current side ill cast her offyou get that sail up damn quick he whispered to helen who was white and drawn he went on you must take the tiller maam while bruce and i get her clear with the oars right she nodded and glanced apprehensively at the gun the three men were out of sight bruce hissed sailhardy my god look thorshammer burst round the point crabwise half out of control her turbines were fighting the relentless current she was not being much more successful against it than kohlers victims as a gunnery target the elongated profile could not have been better cast off cast off in my anxiety i raised my voice sailhardy freed the painter but he too knew that they must have heard me up above he thrust the tiller into helens hands while i grabbed one oar and he another steer towards thorshammer maam zigzag bruce you first me second i threw all my strength against the long oar i straightened from the first punishing stroke and froze walter stood on the emplacement the schmeisser raised chesthigh sailhardy had seen too and tugged at his oar to make the whaleboat yaw it was a powerful stroke but it was not enough helen rose in agonised slowmotion the front of her right shoulder was polkadotted as the heavy bullets tore through flesh and the sealeopard coat she slumped back then she reached to grip the tiller with her left hand underneath the useless right arm another burst tore the water round the boat i tugged desperately at my oar to get out of range and at the end of the stroke whipped up the mainsail its faded ochre inched us out of range of the schmeisser as i straightened i heard a noise which i thought was the blood racing past my eardrums because of my effort at the oar i paused uncertain it sounded like distant gunfire then meteors gun sounded as if it had been fired right under our stern the shell screamed across the fjord pull yelled sailhardy pull help the sail helen i began leave her for a momentpull oh my god the directortower behind thorshammers bridge mushroomed with a direct hit it was a curious noduleshaped projection and it seemed to hold still for a moment before becoming one in a wild tangle of steel masts and tracery of the search radar i jumped on to the thwart and screamed helplessly at the gun emplacement walter upton you bloody bloody fools stop it you crazy bastards stop i looked square into the muzzle of the gun i drew back waiting for the earsplitting crashthen the blast threw me fulllength on the bottom gratings i lifted myself to see the heavy armourpiercing shell shear through thorshammers modem enclosed bridge in the silence following the burst i heard the clang as thorshammers gongs sounded action stations it was too late the destroyer yawed sagged and yawed again as she swung out of control with a grinding crash she cannoned into the side of the kyle of locha sh at the same moment her twin inch guns opened up the shells bounced off the armour plate of the glacier a thousand feet above uptons head the destroyer canted further biting into some unknown obstacle against the old liners side her next pair of fourfive shells screamed high over the glacier they were so wide that it was clear to me what was going on the directortower and bridge was a holocaust of stinking cordite fumes and roasting flesh the guns in the forward turret were firing aimlessly by local control we were almost halfway across the fjord and the wind gripped the whaleboats mainsail she was sailing fast lay the boat alongside thorshammer i ordered get further down the fjord and then swing into the strong current shell sweep down on thorshammer by herself we shipped the oars i was first at helens side but the islanders hands as he prised hers from the tiller were gentle blood dripped down her sleeve on to the steeringarm stop my father she whispered go backdo anything but stop this senseless killing i eased her on to the gratings but i seemed to be choking with the heat the wind filling the sail seemed hot too listen said sailhardy incredulously gunfire from the southern side of the island came the sound of heavy guns the concussion swelled boomed reverberated down the fjord oh god whimpered helen as another savage scream from the emplacement ended in a burst of flaring metal and tinctured smoke from thorshammer then i saw the sea by the entrance started to boil helen lay unconscious against me her blood staining my hands and jacket i pointed to the water sailhardy tunny before he could reply there was another rumble of heavy gunfire from the southern side of the island the albatross foot he burst out the other prong of the albatross foot i saw how the albatross foot joined forces with the thompson island millrace and swept in to the head of the glacier where it must plunge into some gigantic subterranean fissure i dipped my hand override it was warm sailhardy shook his head as if to clear it that isnt gunfire were hearing from beyond therethe ice is breaking up to produce sound like that i told myself hurriedly vast fields of ice must be shattering under the impact of the warm albatross foot any moment the glacier would start to disintegrate but would that solid caul break up quickly enough to put a stop to uptons madness i made a lightning decision lay the whaleboat alongside sailhardy come with me another shell screamed across the fjord from uptons gun and burst on the old liners superstructure thorshammers twin bofors situated aft the steel latticed emergency conning position chattered ineffectually they couldnt bear on uptons gun and it showed what a sorry state her firecontrol was in sailhardy laid the boat alongside the landward side of the destroyer i scrambled over the low bulwarks she had taken a frightful beating there seemed to be bodies everywhere the bridge was a shambles sailhardy passed me helens limp body i guessed right that the wardroom had been turned into an emergency casualty station i pushed past the orderlies and wounded men and put helen down on the wardroom table which was serving as an operating table i did not wait for the doctors astonished outburst i pointed silently to the row of bulletholes in her shoulder he began to swear angrily but i turned and raced back to sailhardy on deck an officer was standing behind the forward turret shouting half his uniform jacket seemed to have been burned off his shoulders and his cap was gone dazed men dragged themselves towards what seemed to be the only orderly musteringpoint on the ship while others helped and half supported the wounded towards the wardroom companionway from which i had emerged thorshammer was afire aft but the worst damage was above our heads on the bridge and firecontrol no one took any notice of sailhardy and me except a young sublieutenant who stood on the steel wing of the emergency conning position towards the stern and shouted at us as we squeezed through a narrow opening between it and a deck boilerroom ventilator torpedoes i started to say to sailhardy but he pulled me forcibly to the deck as another shell came towards the stricken destroyer it was a trifle high however and plunged through the twisted wreckage of the radar scanner bursting prematurely above the old liner her steel sides rang like a bell we sprinted for the quadruple torpedotubes on the port side facing across the fjord together we swung round the sawnoff snouts the islander sighted them on the gun emplacement belay there i ordered he looked at me astonished bring them to bear ten degrees asternon the glacier i added bruce the thunder of the great barrage of ice drowned the noise of the next inch shell the glaciercaul had started to split the translucent bottlegreen suddenly became pocked with white like a cars windscreen shattering thousands of tons of ice started to movebut would they move quickly or far enough to stop uptons murderous fire i asked myself the answer lay under sailhardys hand bearing ten degrees astern he said target bears glacier head bearssteady fire one i ordered sailhardy threw over the tipping lever the sharp slap of the firing charge was lost in the thunder of the icebarrage the sibilant cylinder of death slipped into the water fire two no need to tell sailhardy to spread them to case the entire head of the glacier fire three then fire four no concussion reached us as the warheads burst against the glacier head the thunder of the ice swamping all sound four columns of water rose like spouts from a blue whale in tribute to the islanders marksmanship the glacier now disintegrating had clamped itself between two separate land masses although norris sketches had shown only one fissures ran up the ice cliffs like a boarding party frosted white leaping to the summit of the green glacier the ice wavered hung wavered and then thousands of tons crashed down on to the gun emplacement i left sailhardy looking at the debacle i skirted the forward gun turret from which the crew had emerged and were gazing in awestruck silence at the opposite shore the officer in charge seized me by the hand and started to exclaim in norwegian gesturing towards the glacier head and the torpedotubes i shook myself free of his congratulations and made my way to the crowded wardroom helen was lying on the table her eyes closed the surgeon put the finishing touches to the bandages round her shoulder and armpit is she i started to say she smiled and opened her eyes at the sound of my voice the doctor smiled not too seriousnothing vital has been touched he said in english she has been very lucky indeed its a new one on me to have to attend a woman who has been shot up as i spoke to the doctor a man in uniform came over from a bunk his head was in bandages and his left arm in a sling why have the fourfive stopped firing did that sonofabitch knock out the forward turret too why has everything stopped i saw his rings of rank captain olstad yes he snapped who the hell are you what is happening on deck the doctor taped down the last of helens bandages i picked her up to carry her to a bunk its quite a story which i think you should hear i said dont worry there wont be any more shells from the gun across the fjord the young sublieutenant i had seen on the emergency conning position clattered down the companionway saluted and spoke rapidly in norwegian to olstad indicating me i put helen down gently but she clung to me olstad came and sat at the foot of the bunk helen propped herself against my shoulder who are you he demanded how do you and another civilian understand about firing torpedoes i told him who i was the other civilian as you call him was once the finest torpedoman afloat bruce said helen my father she looked round the crowded wardroom overheated now by the steam tubes which ran round it and the crowd of men who lay sat or stood waiting their turn with the doctor a boy minus a hand sobbed hysterically and a seaman hideously burnt about the eyes screamed through the morphia which had been hastily administered oh god she exclaimed these are the living but how many are dead bruce darling why is the gun silent what the glacier started to topple on to the emplacement i said to stop the slaughter here i hastened it with four torpedoes she hid her face olstad said savagely who were the murderers who crippled my ship and killed my men without provocation in gods name why was it doneit is not war i have you ever heard of thompson island i asked olstads face reflected his incredulity thompson island you mean exactly i said this is thompson island the man who opened fire on you had an obsession about it i told him how upton had come to tristan and had implicated me in his schemes when he found out i had norris chart olstads face went hard when i told him how walter had shot down the seaplane and how the man with the immaculate hand had strung him along with the faked signals while i spoke the doctor and his orderlies dressed bandaged and drugged the wounded who were laid on mattresses on the floor olstad nodded in silent wonder when i explained the mystery of the albatross foot and how it had caused the breakup of the glacier across the fjord he looked keenly at me when i said i had sighted thompson island during the war and shook his head over the rejection by the admiralty and the royal society of my discovery of light refraction and its bearing on the true position of thompson island sailhardy came in and his face lighted to see helen sitting up olstad looked from sailhardy to me in unconcealed admiration we norwegians have always loved a voyage into the unknown we have preserved the kon tiki raft in a museum if ever another boat deserves to be kept it is your whaleboat i find it hard to believe that anyone could have made a trip like that in an open boat in such a storm and survived with your permission i would like to take the whaleboat back to norway with me tomorrow we must have a ceremony in honour of thompson island we will hoist flags and fire guns i made my decision captain olstad there is a function which you as captain are empowered to perform i ask that it should have priority over any ceremonial the norwegian looked surprised at my tone the safety of my ship and the welfare of my crew is my first consideration i am afraid captain wetherby any request must be subsidiary to that thorshammer is a job for a dockyard it will take months to make her seaworthy here i am stuck in an unknown harbour thousands of miles from anywhere you have overlooked the four catchers i replied signal them to come here ill give you the position warn them to approach from the southeast like kohler used to do otherwise theyll be in trouble at the entrance to the fjord you can leave a skeleton crew to look after thorshammer while the catchers take us to cape town you can arrange assistance from there that is excellent he said he grinned suddenly it is going to take a hell of a lot of explaining though what is your request captain wetherby i took helens hand in mine you are entitled to perform a marriage service are you not olstads face broke into a boyish grin by heavens captain you and this lady helens eyes were luminous as parrys arc at my words she sat upright the sealeopard coat falling from her wounded shoulder leaving it and her neck bare olstad shook us both by the hand this will be good for thompson island a wedding to mark its rediscovery it will be good for the morale of my crew too there is still some sad work to be done burying those poor lads lying on deck a massive peal of thunder more distant now shook the ship as the icebarrage continued to the south of the island olstads face went tense but relaxed when he realised it was not gunfire i would like to hear about your trip in your own words he said to sailhardy i interrupted wryly what he really wanted was to sail from bouvet to cape town the hardship the storm olstad started to say then he shrugged upton must have been mad rather than obsessed to have done all this merely in order to discover one useless little island a cold stab went through me remembering the veins of caesium ore something of what i was thinking must have been in the minds of helen and sailhardy too they both watched me as i stayed silent who i asked myself except upton with his highly specialised knowledge shared by per haps four other scientists in sweden and cambridge could identify the veins for what they werepollucite upton had called itthe bearers of the worlds most priceless metal who among ordinary scientists was capable of placing pollucite and caesium if we kept silent who would knowi myself had seen a score of islands in the southern ocean streaked white from other causes the savage current and perpetual fogbelt made access itself to thompson island hazardous into the bargain once the first flush of its rediscovery had passed would thompson island not sink back into oblivion againprovided the secret of the caesium were kept useless i echoed olstad shrugged again perhaps it has some value as a harbour for whalers but what else with the risks bouvet is close but few catchers use its anchorage i was about to say something about global strategy the importance of the cape of good hope sea route and flights over the south pole but i saw the look in helens eyes yes i said slowly thompson island seems to have only a certain limited value as a whalers harbour sailhardy inclined his head as if listening to the distant ice helen reached up and touched my arm old john wetherby would have liked it that way she said
