jeffery deaver making amends jamie feldon woke up one cool monday morning in april and decided to change his life the night before hed fallen asleep on the couch thinking about a sitcom hed just watched it was great really kickass most tv comedies were just plain stupid twentyfiveyearolds tossing out oneliners then mugging for the camera while the laugh sign goosed the audience to make noise no this show was different the hero was a guy whod had an ohjesus moment or something and was making amends for everything bad that hed done in his life each episode hed track down somebody hed screwed over or hurt and apologize and make it up to them pretty damn sharp jamied lain on the couch mesmerized by the show laughing and once or twice even crying which was something he never did you can believe it real tears hed thought about that show for hours until still dressed hed fallen asleep now at seventhirty am the fortytwoyearold rolled over and rubbed his face feeling the creases left by the corduroy slipcover he squinted hard and studied what sat beside him on the coffee table half a bottle of wild turkey bourbon an overflowing ashtray and a bag of popcorn with a bunch of unpopped old maids inside the microwave was on its way out swinging his feet to the floor jamie pulled the remote control out from under him the smell of sweat and unwashed clothes wafting around him he wrinkled his nose then wiped it on the sleeve of his paleblue dress shirt the tv set was still on but quiet hed hit the mute button in his sleep on the screen an early morning talkshow host was silently moving his lips he seemed real sincere a picture flashed ontwo asian kids holding bowls of rice they were happy back to the host he now looked happy too jamie shut the set off it crackled as the screen went black he stretched and felt his belly pressing his waistband he figured the big macsforlunch pizzafordinner diet hed been on lately was finally catching up his head throbbed with the drumbeat of a marching band he happened to glance at the mail dumped on the floor the other day he hadnt looked at it then he now saw that the letter on top was from the family court what now he wondered sourly hed had a problemwasnt his faultand had missed picking up his son last month the exd made a big stink about it maybe she was trying to modify visitation what a bitch or maybe it was something else was he late with the maintenance or the childsupport check he couldnt remember he didnt know what the hell she had to complain about though even if he was a little late christ she got fiftysix percent of his salary though that wasnt exactly a gold mine as a claims agent for a small insurance agency jamie made squat he eased forward and cradled his aching head crowned with an unruly fringe of thinning red hair lost in his depression the relentless troublesthe words that popped into his mind were the bottom thats where i am ive hit bottom and just like the night before watching that tv sitcom tears welled in his eyes sitting here in his shabby twobedroom apartment the graying walls decorated with stains and scuff marks some of them dating back to when he moved in four years ago jamie couldnt get that show out of his thoughts the guy making amends for all the bad things in his past then he began considering the offenses in his own life fellow workers his brother exbosses girlfriends students at his community college his exwife his mother even kids in his grade school pettiness cheating insults andjust like the hero of the tv showeven a few crimes his initial reaction was to offer excuses it wasnt so bad it was an accident everybody acts that way everybody cheats from time to time but then he stopped cold furious with himself excuses excuses excuses no more instinctively he reached for the whisky then as if he was watching himself from a distanceviewing himself on a tv screenhe saw his arm slow then it stopped no my friend thats not the way its going to be this time he was going to change just like that guy on tv hed look back over his life hed make a list of all the bad things and hed set them right making amends jamie rose unsteadily picked up the liquor and poured it down the kitchen sink he returned to the living room and eyed his cigarettes well he knew he couldnt give them up not completely but he was going to limit himself to ten a day wait no five and hed never smoke before noon that was reasonable that was mature he staggered into the bathroom and took a fiercely hot shower then a freezing one he toweled off and walked into his kitchenette had half a bagel with no butter and coffee without cream it was a very different jamie feldon who stepped from his apartment into the bright new england morning twenty minutes later virtually sauntering to the parking lot he dropped into the seat of his battered toyota started the engine and headed for route which would take him to his office twenty miles north of boston normally the congestion drove him crazy but today he hardly noticed it he was thinking about the possibility of a future real different from the disaster his life had been he could actually foresee being content being happy making amends and yet jamie realized sitting at his desk later that day it might be easy to work up the determination to stick to your moral convictions but there were practical issues to consider logistical problems in the tv show for instance the hero had spent a halfhour or so coming up with a list of people hed offended or hurt but that was fiction in real life coming up with a list of offenses would take a lot of work so at quitting time he went to his boss and asked for the rest of the week off the chunky disheveled manager swung back and forth slowly in his old office chair he clearly wasnt happy with the idea but jamie was determined to stick to his plan so he added im talking without pay mr logan without the boss was working to get his head around this idea unpaid leave the words were sinking in but logan still seemed uncertain maybe wondering if jamie was scheminghoping the boss would say naw its okay ill pay you anyway jamie said sincerely i mean it mr logan really something personals come up and i really need the time you sick no but therere a few people need my help yeah you doing good deeds logan laughed something like that well you find somebody to cover for you yeah then i guess its all right thanks mr logan i appreciate it i really do as he left he glanced back and noticed his boss studying him with a perplexed smileas if he was looking at a brandnew jamie feldon returning home that night jamie called around until he found a temp worker who was familiar with the company he arranged for the man to start the next morning as a replacement on tuesday jamie woke early showered dressed and ate a bowl of cereal with lowfat milk then he cleaned his kitchen table off and went to work a pad of yellow paper in front of him he began the list it wasnt easy compiling all the bad things in your life some were hard to deal withhe felt so much shame about them some he wasnt sure if theyd actually occurred were they figments of his imagination dreams a result of the booze he also realized that he had to decide which offenses to include some were serious some seemed laughably minor he told himself at first not to worry about the small things but something stiffened within him when he thought that no he thought angrily either you do this right or you dont do it at all hed include the smallest infractions as well as the most serious he worked for two days straight and finally came up with a list of fortythree incidents then he spent another day identifying the people involved and finding out their most recent addresses some he knew others required detective work using the phone book directory assistance and his computer as well as actually pounding the pavement he managed to get at least a lead to nearly everybody by thursday night jamie was finished with the list and he celebrated with a tall glass of arizona iced tea mintflavored and a cigarette before he headed off to bed though he considered another question should he start with the older offenses or the newest jamie debated this for some time and decided that hed start with the most recent he was worried that hed get bogged down finding people from decades ago and he was eager to get his new life underway so the most recent who was first a glance at the list the name on the top was charles vaughn lincoln the man awoke on friday morning with the memory this had happened nearly every day since the incident a month and a half ago the memory was there when he awoke and it was there when he fell asleep and it popped up all by itself a couple of times during the day too it was one of those things you try to forget but the harder you try the more you relive it then your gut twists your palms grow clammy and a chill pall of dread fills you anger too you hope that time will take care of it and probably thatll happen eventually but like when youre wracked with the flu you just cant imagine youll ever feel better charles vaughn had a good life he was a senior sales manager for a large internet software company hed gotten his mba at new york university and had played with the big boys in the wall street finance world for a long time then moved to bean town to join a startup a year ago he jumped to his present company he was tough he played hardball but never screwing around with the heavyhitters the irs or the sec and he did well now at fortynine he knew what the real world was about doing a good job being invaluable to your customersand just as important if not more to your bossand paying attention to details looking over your shoulder toomaking millions and making enemies go hand in hand hed moved up through the ranks of the company fast and had a shot at being president in the next few years the businessman had a beautiful home in lincoln a wife who was a successful realtor and two kids headed for good colleges in the next couple of years he had his health everything about his life seemed perfect and it would have been except for the goddamn memory it just wouldnt leave him alone what happened was this vaughn and his wife and daughter made the mistake of spending st patricks day at that tourist trap of stores and restaurants in boston faneuil hall along with of course about a billion other people just as they were about to head home his daughter remembered she needed to get a birthday present for her friend were out of time on the meter vaughn pointed out dad its like what a quarter theyd been shopping for two hours and only now she remembered the present vaughn sighed ill be in the car well just be a minute his daughter and wife disappeared back inside vaughn pumped another quarter into the meter and climbed into the car he started the engine and cranked up the heater to cut through the infamous boston spring chill of course it wasnt a minute at all in fact twenty of them rolled by without the two ladies surfacing vaughn sat back and was thinking about a man at work a rival salesman who was making a move on some accounts that were up for grabs and that vaughn really wanted the rival wasnt as good a salesman but he knew the tech side of the product better than any other employee except the programmers themselves vaughnd have to come up with some plan to stop him he was considering what he could do when he heard a honk he glanced into the street and saw a driver in a car pausing next to him the man had a pudgy face and was about vaughns age maybe a little younger he said something vaughn shook his head and opened his passenger window whats that you leaving gesturing at the parking space not just yet vaughn replied with a smile waiting for the wife which any man would understand was humorous shorthand for it could be five minutes could be an hour but the guy in the battered car didnt smile just pull out and wait for her up there doublepark vaughn blinked at the mans bluntness rather not she and my daughter are expecting me here im not saying drive to the cape just pull up a car or two youre leaving anyway im not sure how long theyll be it cant be that long your engines running isnt it vaughns face grew red he was angry and uneasy think id rather wait here he shut the engine off oh that was cute the man snapped he seemed drunk st patricks day pisspoor excuse for a holiday vaughn turned away and rolled up the window he glanced at the shops hoping hed see his wife and daughter the other driver shouted something else which vaughn couldnt hear he stared at the control panel of his acura thinking that if he ignored the guy hed go away come on he thought to his family growing angry at them for putting him in this position it was then that he glanced toward his right into the street and saw that the door on the battered car was open where a rush of motion from the sidewalk vaughns car door was jerked open before he could reach the doorlock button the driver was leaning down directly in vaughns face with a steam of drunken smoky breath between them the man said listen up asshole i dont need anybody to dis me like that the hell you think you are vaughn fixed his eyes on the scruffy man not in great shape but big both scared and angry vaughn said im not leaving until my familys here live with it live with it ill give you something to live with he flicked away a cigarette and ran his key along the side of the acura scraping off a line of paint thats it vaughn pulled his cell phone from his pocket hit a police dispatcher came on immediately this is nineoneone whats the nature of your emergency im being attacked please send somebody you prick the assailant muttered and reached for him but vaughn leaned back into the car your name sir the dispatcher asked whats your address charles vaughn i live in lincoln but im in my car at faneuil hall near williamssonoma hes drunk hes attacking me i the big man lunged forward snatched the phone away and flung it to the sidewalk where it shattered bystanders jumped back though most stayed closeto watch whatever was going to happen next a couple of drunk teenagers laughed and started chanting fight fight fight the man gripped vaughns jacket and tried to pull him out of the car get off me vaughn gripped the wheel and the men played tug of war until a siren sounded nearby getting closer thank god the assailant his face red with rage let go and stood frozen for a moment as if he was wondering what else he could do to vaughn he settled for repeating you prick and ran back to his car he spun the wheels in reverse disappearing around the corner vaughn strained his neck looking back but he couldnt see the license plate hands shaking breath ticking with the fright vaughn felt weak with fear and dread the police arrived and took a statement made a note of the incident and the damage to the car vaughn was giving them what information he could remember when another thought occurred to him his voice faded what sir an officer asked noticing the businessmans troubled face he heard me give nineoneone my name and where i lived the town i mean do you think hell try to find me to get even the police didnt seem concerned road rage or parking rage whatever it never lasts very long i dont think youre in any danger besides one officer added nodding at the damage to the paint looks like he already did get even the police talked to passersbywith less enthusiasm than vaughn would have likedbut nobody had gotten the mans tag numberor was willing to admit it if they had then another call came in on their radioanother fight in progress st paddys day one of the officers spat out shaking his head they hurried off you okay one of the bystanders asked yeah thanks vaughn said not feeling the least bit okay he ran his hand across the long scratch in the paint he kept replaying the incident had it been his fault should he have given the guy the space of course not but how had he sounded was he abrupt insulting he hadnt thought so certainly hadnt meant to be finally his wife and daughter returned from the hall toting several small bags they noticed the damage to the car and the pieces of vaughns cell phone sitting in the backseat what happened honey he explained to them oh dad no are you all right fine just get in he locked the doors and drove away fast on the turnpike vaughn checked the rearview mirror every few seconds but he saw no sign of the attackers car his wife and daughter chatted away as if nothing had happened vaughn was quiet upset about the incident and the angerat them and at himselfwasnt going away when they were a few miles from home judy asked something wrong honey youre not still bothered by that crazy man are you no he said im just a little tired dont worry she said its just paint they can fix it up like new sometimes women just didnt get it at all oh dad his daughter said urgently can we stop at beths i want to give her the necklace no but its right up there i said no but no he snapped youll see her at school tomorrow the girl wasnt happythe friends house was after all on the way homebut vaughn wouldnt change his mind when they arrived at home he pulled his wife aside and told her his big concernthat the man had heard vaughn mention his name and the town they lived in oh now judy seemed miffed his impression was that she was upset hed gotten into the fight in the first place and hadnt just given the guy the parking space then doubleparked to wait for them as if it was male ego thatd caused the problem he came a millisecond away from reminding her that their lastminute shopping spree was the ultimate cause of the whole thing but selfpreservation kicked in and he managed to restrain himself he said the police dont think its anything to worry about but just keep an eye out he described the man keep an eye out she muttered and walked off silently to make dinner vaughn didnt eat much that night his excuse was that his stomach was upset from the fast food theyd had for lunch which his wife had ordereda fact he managed to work into his explanation with some petty satisfaction after his family went to bed that night vaughn climbed the stairs to the study above the garage and stayed awake for a long time keeping a vigil staring out at the street looking for any sign of the assailant at three am or so he fell asleep with the memory prominently sitting in his thoughts and the next morning he awoke with it vaughn forced himself to relax and even though he was groggy from lack of sleep he made breakfast for the family spent a cheerful halfhour with them and then headed off to work but the good mood didnt last the memory kept coming back he replayed the incident a hundred times that day he regretted not fighting back not grabbing the man and wrestling him to the ground pinning him there until the cops arrived he felt he was a coward a failure he was so distracted he missed the lunch hed set up to woo the big client that his rival was after over the next six weeks things grew worse several times on the way to work he spotted cars that might have been the assailants and skidded off the highway desperate to escape two weeks ago hed nearly slammed into a womans suv in a grocery store parking lot while staring at a car behind him and another time leaving a local bar hed seen a man in sunglasses across the street vaughn believed he looked like the assailant panicked the businessman leapt back inside the bar knocking into several people and spilling drinks he nearly tripped down the back stairs of the bar as he fled all of these incidents turned out to be false alarmsthe men hed seen were not the attackerbut he couldnt shake the fear that consumed him finally he couldnt take it anymore one morning vaughn canceled a meeting at work and drove to a building outside of town a place hed found in the yellow pages a gun shop and shooting range there he bought a mm semiautomatic glock pistol and enrolled in the course that would give him a class a firearm permit allowing him to carry a concealed weapon today at lunch he was going to complete the course and get the license from now on he could carry the gun wherever he wanted to jamie feldon woke up at nine on friday well rested and ready to get started on his new life unlike the typical evening from his past last night hed slept in his bed under clean sheets wearing clean pajamas and even though hed had a beer with dinner hed gone to sleep sober hed also stuck to his rule of only two cigarettes for the entire evening he brushed his teeth for a full minute now eating a modest breakfast he looked over the notes hed taken about charles vaughn the businessman lived in lincoln but jamie wanted to see him without his family around so hed googled the name and found him mentioned on some computer industry websites he learned where the man worked an internet company about ten miles away jamie decided to take something along with him and after some thinking he had a brainstorm champagne vaughn he recalled was a man who dressed well and would probably have good taste after washing his breakfast dishes jamie jumped in his car and headed off to the nearest wine store figuring hed spend some serious money on the bottle you cant scrimp when youre working on a new life good shooting the man said he was a welltoned fiftyyearold with cropped gray hair tendons and muscles were prominent in his arms and neck his name was larry bolling and he was the senior instructor at patriot guns and shooting range where charles vaughn had been taking his lessons vaughn pulled his ear protectors off what good shooting i said thanks vaughn put the black semiautomatic pistol down on the bench in front of him as the instructor reeled the target back in the eight shots were grouped tight in the silhouettes chest the shooting wasnt competitionlevel but he was satisfied the idea that charles vaughn would be spending any time at all thinking about grain weight of bullets and the advantages of a sigsauer safety a thumb lever versus a glock a second trigger was hilarious here was a man who made his living with credit reports and productspec sheets and yet he was spending his lunch hour shooting at images of bin laden and john q thug but even more ironic was that charles vaughn had turned into a pretty damn good shot at first hed held the gun stiffly in a way that seemed to mimic what hed seen actors do in the movies now sir larry bolling had explained at the first lesson you might not want to do that whats that hold your weapon that way okay sure why not because when you pull the trigger the slidesee that part thereis gonna fly back at oh about a thousand miles an hour and itll take a portion of your thumb with it what you do is just rest one hand on the other sorta like this this thats right now lets go put some holes in a target well at first he hadnt put a lot of holes in anything but the bullet trap at the back of the range but today hed been rewarded for his skill good shooting after the lunchhour lesson today vaughn dismantled the gun then cleaned reassembled and reloaded it he found bolling in the front office hunched over some papers he motioned vaughn to take a chair so i get my ticket the businessman asked not quite yet sir vaughn frowned hed passed all the tests with perfect scores hed also passed the background checks hed attended all of the video and liveinstruction sessions had done all his homework i thought that was it nope bolling explained theres one more thing that i include in my classes okay whats that you need to answer a question go ahead why do you want a carry permit you never told me im a wealthy businessman im concerned about my family theres a lot of crime in boston thats all trueat least i can attest to the last one of those and the other two are no doubt right as well but why dont you tell me the real reason vaughn could only laugh he shook his head and explained about the attack on st patricks day okay sir i understand that was upsetting but thats not a good reason to carry a weapon but he was dangerous let me ask that was six weeks ago give or take you seen hide or hair of that man since then i dont think so vaughn said defensively a nod toward the pistol on the businessmans hip youve done good in the course you know safety and youve got every legal right to carry that my advice to you is to take it home put it in a lockbox and leave it there until the next time you come here to have some fun then take it home again and put it back in the box you get my drift but listen to me vaughn looked up into the mans steely eyes he nodded most people in their entire lives theres a one in a million chance that thered be a good reason to draw their weapon on the street and even less of a chance they ought to use it the absolute best possible thing you can do in a confrontation is turn and run like a rabbit calling for help at the top of your lungs ill tell you from my heart that thats exactly what id do run as fast as your feet can carry you and if youre with your grandmother or your child you sling em over your shoulder and carry em with you a guns for that one time in your life when youre trapped theres no help around and your assailant intends to kill you that situation in boston naturally it upset you and no doubt that man was a solidgold son of a bitch and youre thinking you were a coward but im telling you its braver to live with a feeling like that than to go looking for trouble well duly noted vaughn said i appreciate your comments there ive said my piece bolling produced a temporary permit good luck to you sir leaving the gun shop and range returning to his car charles vaughn was thinking about bollings words but they didnt stay with him long he was aware of a curious feeling it was as if something fundamental in his life had changed he thought back to the incident in boston and found to his surprise his gut didnt twist his heart didnt pound quite so fast the angerat the attacker and at himself for his cowardicewas almost gone charles vaughn walked to his car and headed back to work buoyed by a confidence that he hadnt felt for months maybe even years at five pm that evening jamie feldon sat in the front seat of his toyota listening to the radio and watching people leave the office of nes computer products he didnt know if charles vaughn was a workaholica lot of times those internet guys really put in the hoursbut jamie would stay as long as he needed to in order to see the guy beside him was a grilled chicken sandwich from mcdonalds an iced tea and a bottle of champagne whose name he couldnt pronounce which meant that it had to be good he ate his dinner listened to the radio and thought about the other people on his list then at seven pm jamie saw charles vaughn leave by the front door look around and then head toward the parking garage jamie took a deep breath making amends a new life he grabbed the champagne stepped out of the car and started up the sidewalk to the garage approaching his car charles vaughn examined the paint job the body shop had completely erased the damage from when the psycho had keyed his car outside faneuil hall just like the gun on his hip had erased the psychic scarring he no longer felt defenseless no longer felt scared in fact despite the gun instructors advice which vaughn thought was a bit hypocritical considering his job he was hoping the man would make his move im ready for you it was then that he heard a snapor some soundnot far away he froze and looked around the garage was deserted here after his lesson at the gun shop hed returned to find parking only on the fifth floor his was the only car here now he shifted his briefcase to his left hand his pistol was only a few inches away from his right but he told himself how would the punk know where he worked he mightve been staking out lincoln but here impossible though if the guy was really determined it wouldnt be impossible to find out his company vaughn squinted scanning the floor behind him was that the shadow of someone on the far stairwell he couldnt tell his heart beating quickly he remembered the mans face remembered the anger in his eyes the smell of liquor the uncontrolled hands as they gripped vaughns lapels a chill tickled his spine but it wasnt fear it was exhilaration keeping his right hand free vaughn set his briefcase down and fished for his car keys while he scanned the garage in the direction he believed the sound had come from the sound again he hit the unlock button on the key but still didnt get inside he tapped the gun with his right palm vaughn tensed as the sound of tires squealing filled his ears he laughed to himself watching the pickup truck squeal down the exit ramp from the top floor where maintenance workers and contractors were supposed to park that was the noise hed heard the men loading up the truck it was then that a mans voice behind him said excuse me mr vaughn you probably dont remember me vaughn gasped dropping the car keys he stared at the figure approaching him carrying something large in his right hand it looked like a club a bowling pin jesus its him its the attacker instinctively vaughn dropped into a combat shooting pose drew his gun and aimed directly at the mans chest he started to pull the trigger jamie feldon gasped holding up a hand as if it could ward off the bullet that was about to end his life no please neither jamie nor vaughn moved time was frozen jamie heard nothing he felt nothing it was so quiet had the gun actually gone off maybe it had and he was dead but then he felt wind on his cheek and heard a truck shifting gears nearby a horn honked in the distance his heart too he could actually hear it please he whispered please dont vaughn was squinting at jamie could you im sorry could you step into the light there jamie did vaughn studied his face then the champagne he slumped my god my god my god the gun lowered and the businessman leaned against his car i thought im sorry i thought you were somebody else feeling his hands quiver madly jamie gave a breathless laugh who vaughn said this guy i had a runin with in boston on st patricks day im so sorry i couldnt see you clearly his shoulders slumped or maybe i was just so paranoid he glanced down at the gun with wide eyes and quickly put it in the holster on his hip are you are you all right jamie laughed well ive gotta say im a lot better now that you put that thing away thought id pee my pants for a minute there who are you my names jamie feldon vaughn shook his head do i know you not really but weve met what can i do for you jamie said brightly ive come to see you about making amends he nodded at the champagne amends vaughn asked frowning what did you do to me oh jamie said its not what i did to you its what you did to me to you what vaughn asked but before he could continue jamie lunged forward and swung the bottle into the side of the businessmans head the businessman went down like a rock five minutes later charles vaughn came to jamie was standing over him aiming the mans pistol at his chest the grip of the gun wrapped in a napkin hed found in a nearby trash bin what vaughn gasped whats this all about he squinted amends he said like i said but i dont even know you whatd i do you really dont remember do you no i swear well take a good look im sorry really please put down the gun we can talk about it think back jamie said in a smooth voice think back to late march you were in the lincoln brew pub i go there all the time i know but this particular day you should remember you started to walk out the door but all of a sudden you jumped back like you saw a goddamn ghost you spilled my bloody mary all over me and then you just run out the back door jamie gave a cold laugh do you say youre sorry do you offer to pay for the dry cleaning no wait vaughn was shaking his head i remember that but wait how did you find me just asked the bartender at the lincoln pub what your name was then i googled you and found where you lived and worked had to see you alone of course didnt want your family around you have to understandat the bar back then in march that guy i was telling you about the attacker i thought he was outside i was afraid jamie shrugged i was supposed to pick up my kid for visitation but i had that drink all over me couldnt pick him up looking like that could i i had to go home and change i was late and his motherd taken him someplace with her by the time i got there made a big deal about it with the court too im sorry but sorry but jamie mocked see ive been putting up with crap like that all my life peopleve insulted me cheated me made fun of me bumped into me ever since i was a kid and ive never had the guts to fight back i just swallowed it all i get walked over and i never have the balls to do anything but a week ago i decided im not going to put up with it anymore peoplere going to make amends to me for what theyve done and youre the first on my list make amends vaughn gasped but i just spilled something on you what do you want you want money no i want you to die jamie said matteroffactly and shoved the gun against vaughns head then pulled the trigger after he cleaned the blood off his own face and hands jamie wrapped the dead mans fingers around the gun and quickly left the garage he looked around nobody seemed to have heard the shot he walked slowly down the stairs and out to the lot where he was parked carrying the champagne jamied taken the bottle to use as a weapon it was something that nobody would be suspicious of hed planned to either beat vaughn to death with it or if it broke use the jagged neck to slash the mans carotid artery but vaughn had actually been carrying a gun if the businessman was really so jittery about whateverd happened on st patricks day the cops might get the idea hed gone over the edge and killed himself or maybe theyd think that guy whod attacked him had finally tracked him down jamie climbed in his car and drove slowly out of the parking lot he kept hearing vaughns words in his mind at the bar back then in march that guy i was telling you about the attacker i thought he was outside i was afraid excuses jamie reflected in disgust there were always excuses and he wasnt going to accept them anymore jamie was going to be true to his resolution the tv show hed seen had changed him forever people had to make amends for their transgressions and he was going to be the angel of justice to make sure they did who next he glanced down at the list and noticed his wifes name but she was at the bottom hed have to handle that one carefully since hed be a prime suspect in her death but there were plenty of scores to settle before her he saw the name below vaughns carole in scituate she was a thirtyfiveyearold bank manager hed taken out on a date in february theyd gone to the red lobster all you can eat and she sure had but afterwards a double insult shed refused to sleep with him and then shed never called like shed promised it was seventhirty did he have time to take care of carole tonight sure he did jamie decided tomorrow was saturday he could sleep in besides there were a lot of names on his list itd feel good to mark another one off he lit a cigarette only his fourth of the day and headed
