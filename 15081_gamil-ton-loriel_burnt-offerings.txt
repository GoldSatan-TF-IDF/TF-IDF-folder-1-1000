laurell k hamilton burnt offerings book of the anita blake vampire hunter series most people dont stare at the scars theyll look of course then do the eye slide you know the quick look then drop the gaze then just have to have that second look but they make it quick the wounds arent like freak show bad but they are interesting captain pete mckinnon firefighter and arson investigator sat across from me big hands wrapped around a glass of iced tea that our secretary mary had brought in for him he was staring at my arms not the place most men look but it wasnt sexual he was staring at the scars and didnt seem a bit embarrassed about it my right arm had been sliced open twice by a knife one scar was white and old the second was still pink and new my left arm was worse a mound of white scar tissue sat at the bend of my arm id have to lift weights for the rest of my life or the scars would stiffen and id lose mobility in the arm or so my physical therapist had said there was a crossshaped burn mark a little crooked now because of the ragged claw marks that a shapeshifted witch had given me there were one or two other scars hidden under my blouse but the arm really is the worst bert my boss had requested that i wear my suit jacket or longsleeved blouses in the office he said that some clients had expressed reservations about my ah occupationally acquired wounds i hadnt worn a longsleeved blouse since he made the request hed turned the air conditioner up a little colder every day it was so cold today i had goose bumps everyone else was bringing sweaters to work i was shopping for midriff tops to show off my back scars mckinnon had been recommended to me by sergeant rudolph storr cop and friend theyd played football in college together and been friends ever since dolph didnt use the word friend lightly so i knew they were close what happened to your arm mckinnon asked finally im a legal vampire executioner sometimes they get pesky i took a sip of coffee pesky he said and smiled he sat his glass on the desk and slipped off his suit jacket he was nearly as wide through the shoulders as i was tall he was a few inches short of dolphs six foot eight but he didnt miss it by much he was only in his forties but his hair was completely grey with a little white starting at the temples it didnt make him look distinguished it made him look tired he had me beat on scars burn scars crawled up his arms from his hands to disappear under the short sleeves of his white dress shirt the skin was mottled pinkish white and a strange shade of tan like the skin of some animal that should shed regularly that must have hurt i said it did he sat there meeting my eyes with a long steady look you saw the inside of a hospital on some of that yeah i pushed the sleeve up on my left arm and showed the shiny place where a bullet had grazed me his eyes widened just a bit now that weve proven were big tough hemen can you just cut to the chase why are you here captain mckinnon he smiled and draped his jacket over the back of his chair he took the tea off my desk and sipped it dolph said you wouldnt like being sized up i dont like passing inspections how do you know you passed it was my turn to smile womens intuition now what do you want do you know what the term firebug means an arsonist i said he looked expectantly at me a pyrokinetic someone who can call fire psychically he nodded you ever seen a real pyro i saw films of ophelia ryan i said the old blackandwhite ones he asked yeah shes dead now you know no i didnt know burned to death in her bed spontaneous combustion a lot of the firebugs go up that way as if when theyre old they lose control of it you ever see one of them in person nope whered you see the films two semesters of psychic studies we had a lot of psychics come in and talk to us demonstrate their abilities but pyrokinetics is such a rare ability i dont think the prof could find one he nodded and drained the rest of his tea in one long swallow i met ophelia ryan once before she died nice lady he started to turn the icefilled glass round and round in his large hands he stared at the glass and not at me while he talked i met one other firebug he was young in his twenties hed started by setting empty houses on fire like a lot of pyromaniacs then he did buildings with people in them but everybody got out then he did a tenement a real firetrap he set every exit on fire killed over sixty people mostly women and children mckinnon stared up at me the look in his eyes was haunted its still the largest body count ive ever seen at a fire he did an office building the same way but missed a couple of exits twentythree dead howd you catch him he started writing to the papers and the television he wanted credit for the deaths he set fire to a couple of cops before we got him we were wearing those big silver suits that they wear to oil rig fires he couldnt get them to burn we took him down to the police station and that was the mistake he set it on fire where else could you have taken him i asked he shrugged massive shoulders i dont know somewhere else i was still in the suit and i held onto him told him wed burn up together if he didnt stop it he laughed and set himself on fire mckinnon sat his glass very carefully on the edge of the desk the flames were this soft blue color almost like a gas fire but paler didnt burn him but somehow it set my suit on fire the damn thing is rated for something like degrees and it started to melt human skin burns at degrees but somehow i didnt melt into a puddle just the suit i had to strip it off while he laughed he walked out the door and he didnt think anyone would be stupid enough to grab him i didnt say the obvious i let him talk i tackled him in the hallway and slammed him into a wall a couple of times funny thing where my skin touched him it didnt burn it was like the fire crawled over a space and started on my arms so my hands are fine i nodded theres a theory that a pyros aura keeps them from burning when you touched his skin you were too close to his own aura his own protection to burn he stared at me maybe that is what happened because i threw him hard up against the wall over and over he was screaming ill burn you ill burn you alive then the fire changed color to yellow normal and he started to burn i let him go and went for the fire extinguisher we couldnt put the fire on his body out the extinguishers worked on the walls everything else but it wouldnt work on him it was as if the fire was crawling out of his body from deep inside wed dampen some of the flames but there was just more of it until he was made of fire mckinnons eyes were distant and horrorfilled as if he was still seeing it he didnt die ms blake not like he should have he screamed for so long and we couldnt help him couldnt help him his voice trailed off he just sat there staring at nothing i waited and finally said gently why are you here captain he blinked and sort of shook himself i think weve got another firebug on our hands ms blake dolph said that if anyone could help us cut the loss of life it was you psychic ability isnt technically preternatural its just talent like throwing a great curve ball he shook his head what i saw die on the floor of the station that day wasnt human it couldnt have been human dolph says youre the monster expert help me catch this monster before he kills he or she hasnt killed yet its just property damage i asked he nodded i could lose my job for coming to you i should have bucked this up the line and gotten permission from the chain of command but weve only lost a couple of buildings i want to keep it that way i took in a slow breath and let it out ill be happy to help captain but i honestly dont know what i can do for you he pulled out a thick file folder heres everything weve got look it over and call me tonight i took the folder from him and sat it in the middle of my desk blotter my numbers in the file call me maybe its not a firebug maybe its something else but whatever it is ms blake it can bathe in flames and not burn it can walk through a building and shed fire like sprinkling water no accelerant ms blake but the houses have gone up as if theyve been soaked in something when we get the wood in the lab its clean its like whatever is doing this can force the fire to do things it shouldnt do he glanced at his watch im running late im working on getting you on this officially but im afraid theyll wait until people are dead i dont want to wait ill call you tonight but it may be late how late is too late to call any time ms blake any time i nodded and stood i offered my hand he shook it his grip was firm solid but not too tight a lot of male clients that wanted to know about the scars squeezed my hand like they wanted me to cry uncle but mckinnon was secure he had his own scars id barely sat back down when the phone rang what is it mary its me larry said mary didnt think youd mind her putting me straight through larry kirkland vampire executioner trainee was supposed to be over at the morgue staking vampires nope whats up i need a ride home there was just the slightest hesitation to his voice whats wrong he laughed i should know better than to be coy with you im all stitched up the doc says ill be fine what happened i asked come pick me up and ill tell all then the little son of a gun hung up on me there was only one reason for him to not want to talk to me hed done something stupid and gotten hurt two bodies to stake two bodies that wouldnt have risen for at least another night what could have gone wrong as the old saying goes only one way to find out mary rescheduled my appointments i got my shoulder holster complete with browning hipower out of the top desk drawer and slipped it on since id stopped wearing my suit jacket in the office id put the gun in the drawer but outside the office and always after dark i wore a gun most of the creatures that had scarred me up were dead the majority id done personally silverplated bullets are a wonderful thing larry sat very carefully in the passenger seat of my jeep its hard to sit in a car when your back has fresh stitches in it id seen the wound it was one sharp puncture and one long bloody scrape two wounds really he was still wearing the blue tshirt hed started in but the back of it was bloody and ragged i was impressed hed kept the nurses from cutting it off of him they had a tendency to cut off clothing that stood in their way larry strained against the seat belt trying to find a comfortable position his short red hair had been freshly cut tight enough to his head that you almost didnt notice the curls he was five foot four an inch taller than me hed graduated with a degree in preternatural biology this may but with the freckles and that little pain wrinkle between his clear blue eyes he looked closer to sixteen than twentyone id been so busy watching him squirm that id missed the turnoff to i we were stuck on ballas until we got to olive it was just before lunch and olive would be packed with people trying to shove food in their mouths and rush back to work did you take your pain pill i asked he tried to sit very still one arm braced on the edge of the seat no why not because stuff like that knocks me out i dont want to sleep a drugged sleep isnt the same thing as regular sleep i said no the dreams are worse he said he had me there what happened larry im amazed youve waited this long to ask so am i but i didnt want to ask in front of the doctor if you start asking questions of the patient the docs tend to wander off and treat somebody else i wanted to know from the doctor who stitched you up just how serious it was just a few stitches he said twenty i said eighteen he said i was rounding up trust me he said you dont need to round up he grimaced as he said it why does this hurt so much he asked it might have been a rhetorical question but i answered it anyway every time you move an arm or a leg you use muscles in your back moving your head and muscles in your shoulders makes muscles in your back move you never appreciate your back until it goes out on you great he said enough stalling larry tell me what happened we were stopped behind a long line of traffic leading up to the light on olive we were stuck between two small strip malls the one on our left had fountains and v js tea and spice where i got all my coffee to our right was streetside records and a chinese buffet if you came up ballas at lunch time you always had plenty of time to study the shops on either side he smiled then grimaced i had two bodies to stake both vamp victims that didnt want to rise as vampires they had dying wills i remember youve been doing most of those lately he nodded then froze in midgesture even nodding my head hurts itll hurt more tomorrow gee thanks boss i needed to know that i shrugged lying to you wont make it hurt less anybody ever tell you your bedside manner sucks lots of people he made a small hmph sound that i believe anyway id finished the bodies and was packing up a woman rolled in another body said it was a vamp with no court order attached i glanced at him frowning you didnt do a body without paperwork did you he frowned back of course not i told them no court order no dead vampire staking a vamp without a court order is murder and im not going to be up on charges because someone screwed the paperwork i told them both that in no uncertain terms them i asked i eased up the line of traffic a little closer to the light the other morgue attendant had come back in they went out in search of the misplaced paperwork i was left with the vampire it was morning he wasnt going anywhere he tried to look away and not meet my eyes but it hurt he ended up staring at me angry i went out for a cigarette i looked at him and had to slam on the brakes when the traffic just stopped larry was flung into the seat belt he groaned and when he was finished writhing on the seat he said you did that on purpose no i didnt but maybe i should have you left a vampire body alone a vampire that might have had enough kills to deserve a court order of execution alone in the morgue it wasnt just the cigarette anita the body was just lying there on the gurney it wasnt chained or strapped there were no crosses anywhere ive done executions they plaster the vamps with silver chains and crosses until its hard to find the heart it just didnt look right i wanted to talk to the medical examiner she has to approve all vampires before execution or somebody does besides the me smokes i figured we could have one together in her office and i said she wasnt in and i went back to the morgue when i got there the woman attendant was trying to pound a stake through the vamps chest it was lucky we were at a dead stop in traffic if wed been moving id have plowed into someone i stared at him you left your vampire kit unattended he managed to look embarrassed and angry at the same time my kit doesnt include shotguns like yours does so i figured who would bother it a lot of people will steal things out of the bag for souvenirs larry traffic started to creep forward and i had to watch the road instead of his face fine fine i was wrong i know i was wrong i grabbed her around the waist and pulled her off the vampire his eyes slid downward not looking at me this was the part that bothered him or the part he thought would bother me i turned my back on her to check the vampire to make sure she hadnt hurt him she did your back i said we inched forward we were now trapped between dairy queen and kentucky fried chicken on one side and an infiniti car dealership and a gas station on the other the scenery was not improving yeah yeah she must have thought i was down for the count because she left me and went back to the vampire i disarmed her but she was still trying to get to the vampire when the other attendant came in it took both of us to pin her she was crazy manic why didnt you draw your gun larry his gun was sitting in his vampire kit because a shoulder holster and his back wound did not mix but he went armed id taken him out to the shooting range and out on vampire hunts until i trusted him not to shoot his foot off if id drawn my gun i might have shot her thats sort of the point larry its exactly the point he said i didnt want to shoot her she could have killed you larry i know i gripped the steering wheel tight enough to mottle my skin white and pink i let out a long breath and tried not to yell you obviously dont know or you would have been more careful im alive and shes not dead the vampire didnt even get a scratch it worked out all right i pulled out onto olive and started creeping towards we needed to head north towards st charles larry had an apartment over there it was about a twentyminute drive give or take his apartment looked out over a lake where geese nested in the spring and congregated in the winter richard zeeman junior high science teacher alpha werewolf and at that time my boyfriend had helped him move in richard had really liked the geese nesting just under the balcony so had i larry you are going to have to get over this squeamishness or youre going to get killed ill keep doing what i think is right anita nothing you can say will change my mind dammit larry i dont want to have to bury you what would you have done shot her i wouldnt have turned my back on her larry i could have probably disarmed her or kept her busy until the other attendant arrived i wouldnt have had to shoot her i let things get out of control he said your priorities were screwed you should have neutralized the threat before you checked on the victim alive you could help the vamp dead youre just another victim well at least ive got a scar you dont have i shook my head youll have to try harder if you want a scar i dont have you let a human shove one of your own stakes into your back two humans with multiple bites what i used to call human servants before i knew what the term really meant i had one pinned and was stabbing him the woman came at my back so yours wasnt a mistake he said i shrugged i could have shot them when i first saw them but i didnt kill humans as easily back then i learned my lesson just because it doesnt have fangs doesnt mean it cant kill you you used to be squeamish about shooting human servants larry asked i turned onto no ones perfect why did the woman have a hardon to kill the vampire he grinned youre going to love this one shes a member of humans first the vampire was a doctor in the hospital hed tucked himself into a linen closet it was where he always slept the day away if hed had to stay too late in the hospital to drive home she just popped him on a gurney and wheeled him down to the morgue im surprised she didnt just push him out into the sunlight the last sunlight of the day works as well as noonday the linen closet he used was on the basement floor just in case someone opened the door at the wrong time of day no windows she was afraid someone would see her before she could get him up in the elevator and outside she really thought you would just stake him i guess so i dont know anita she was crazy really crazy she spit at the vampire and us said wed all rot in hell that we had to cleanse the world of the monsters the monsters were going to enslave us all larry shivered then frowned i thought humans against vampires was bad enough but this splinter group humans first is genuinely scary hav tries to work within the law i said humans first doesnt even pretend to care they claimed they staked that vampire mayor in michigan claimed you dont believe them i think someone near and dear to his household did it why the cops sent me a description and some photos of the security precautions hed taken humans first may be radical but they dont seem very well organized yet youd have had to plan and be very lucky to get to that vampire during the day he was like a lot of the old ones very serious about his daytime safety i think whoever did it is happy to let the rightwing radicals take the blame you tell the police what you think sure thats why they asked im surprised they didnt have you come down and see it in person i shrugged i cant go personally to every preternatural crime besides im technically a civilian cops are sort of leery about involving civilians in their cases but more importantly the media would be all over it the executioner solves vampire murder larry grinned thats a mild headline for you unfortunately i said also i think the killer is a human i think its just someone he was close to its like any wellplanned murder except for the victim being a vampire only you would make a lockedroom vampire murder sound ordinary larry said i had to smile i guess so my beeper went off and i jumped i pulled the damn thing off my skirt and held it where i could see the number i frowned at it whats wrong is it the police no i dont recognize the number you dont give out your beeper number to strangers im aware of that hey dont get grumpy at me i sighed sorry larry was slowly wearing me down on my aggression threshold he was by sheer repetition teaching me to be nicer anybody else and i would have fed them their head in a basket but larry managed to push my buttons just right he could caution me to be nicer and i didnt slug him the basis of many a successful relationship we were only minutes from larrys apartment id tuck him into bed and answer the call if it wasnt the police or a zombieraising i was going to be pissed i hated being beeped when it wasnt important thats what beepers are for right if it wasnt important stuff i was going to rain all over somebodys parade with larry asleep i could be as nasty as i wanted to be it was almost a relief when larry was safely tucked in bed with his demorol so deeply asleep that nothing short of an earthquake would have woken him i made my phone call i still didnt have the faintest idea who it was which bothered me it wasnt just inconvenient it was unnerving who was giving out my private numbers and why the phone didnt even finish a ring before it was picked up the voice on the other end was male soft and panicked hello hello all my irritation vanished in a wash of something very close to fear stephen whats wrong i heard him swallow on his end of the phone thank god whats happened i made my voice very clear very calm because i wanted to yell at him to force him to tell me what the hell was going on can you come down to st louis university hospital that got my attention how bad are you hurt its not me my heart slid up into my throat and my voice came out squeezed and tight jeanclaude the moment i said it i knew it was silly it was just after noon if jeanclaude had needed a doctor they would have had to come to him vampires did not travel well in broad daylight why was i so worried about a vampire i happened to be dating him my family devout catholics are simply thrilled since im still a little embarrassed about it its hard to defend myself its not jeanclaude its nathaniel who stephens breath went out in a longsuffering sigh he was one of gabriels people which was another way of saying he was a wereleopard gabriel had been the leopards leader their alpha until i killed him why had i killed him most of the wounds hed given me had healed it was one of the benefits of the vampire marks i didnt scar quite so easily anymore but there was a curl of scars high up on my buttocks and lower back faint almost dainty but i would always have a little reminder of gabriel a reminder that his fantasy had been to rape me to make me cry out his name then kill me though knowing gabriel he probably hadnt been so picky on when i died after or duringeither would have worked for him as long as i was still warm most lycanthropes arent into carrion i sounded casual about it even in my own head but my fingers traced along my back as if i could feel the scars through my skirt had to be casual about it had to be or you start screaming and you dont stop the hospital doesnt know nathaniels a shapeshifter do they i said he lowered his voice they know hes healing too fast for them not to know so why whisper because im out in the waiting room on a pay phone there was a sound on the other end like hed had to take the receiver away from his mouth he muttered ill be off in just a minute he came back on i need you to come down anita why please youre a werewolf stephen what are you doing babysitting one of the kittycats im one of the names in his wallet in case of emergencies nathaniel works at guilty pleasures hes a stripper i made it a question because he could have been a waiter but it wasnt likely jeanclaude owned guilty pleasures and he would never have wasted a shapeshifter offstage they were too damned exotic yes the two of you need a ride it was my day for it i guess yes and no there was something in his voice that i didnt like an unease a tension it wasnt like stephen to be cagey he didnt play games he just talked how did nathaniel get hurt maybe if i asked better questions id get better answers a customer got too rough at the club no anita please theres no time come down and make sure he doesnt go home with zane who the hell is zane another of gabriels people hes been pimping them out since gabriel died but hes not protecting them like gabriel did he isnt alpha pimping them out what are you talking about stephens voice rose high and far too cheerful hello zane have you seen nathaniel yet i couldnt really hear the answer just the buzz of all the people in the waiting room i dont think they want him to go just yet hes hurt stephen said zane must have stepped very close to the phone very close to stephen a low growling voice came through the wire hell go home when i say he goes home stephens voice held an edge of panic i dont think the doctors will like that i dont give a shit who are you talking to for his voice to be that clear he had to have stephen pinned against the wall threatening him without saying anything specific the growling voice was suddenly very clear hed taken the phone from stephen who is this anna blake and you must be zane he laughed and it sounded too low as if his throat were sore the wolves human lupa oh im so scared lupa was the word the werewolves used for their leaders mate i was the first human so honored i wasnt even dating their ulfric anymore wed broken up after i saw him eat somebody hey a girls got to have some standards gabriel wasnt scared of me either look where it got him i said zane was quiet for a handful of heartbeats he breathed over the phone like a dog panted heavy but not like he was doing it on purpose more like he couldnt help it nathaniel is mine keep off of him stephen isnt one of yours i said does he belong to you i could hear cloth moving a sense of movement on the other end of the phone that i didnt like he is sooo pretty have you tasted these soft lips has this long yellow hair swept over your pillow i knew without seeing it that he was touching stephen caressing him to match the words dont touch him zane too late i gripped the phone tight and forced my voice calm even stephens under my protection zane do you understand me what would you do to keep your pet wolf safe anita you dont want to push that button zane you really dont he lowered his voice to an almost painful whisper would you kill me to keep him safe i usually have to meet someone at least once before threatening to kill them but i was about to make an exception yeah he laughed low and nervous i see why gabriel liked you so tough so sure of yourself sooo dangerous you sound like a bad imitation of gabriel he made a sound that was somewhere between a hiss and a bah stephen shouldnt have interfered nathaniels his friend i am all the friend he needs i dont think so i am taking nathaniel with me anita if stephen tries to stop me ill hurt him you hurt stephen i hurt you so be it he hung up shit i ran for my jeep i was thirty minutes away twenty if i pushed it a lot twenty minutes stephen wasnt dominant he was a victim but he was also loyal if he thought nathaniel shouldnt go with zane hed try and keep him he wouldnt fight for him but he might throw his body in front of the car i had no doubts at all that zane would drive right over him best case scenario worst case scenario was zane would take both stephen and nathaniel if zane acted as much like gabriel as he talked id rather have taken my chances with the car my second emergency room in less than two hours it was a redletter day even for me good news was that none of the injuries were mine bad news was that that might change alpha or not zane was a shapeshifter they were able to benchpress mediumsize elephants i was not going to armwrestle him not only would i lose but hed probably pull the arm out of my socket and eat it most lycanthropes liked to try and pass for human i wasnt sure zane sweated little details like that yet i didnt want to kill zane if i didnt have to it wasnt mercy it was the thought that he might force me to do it in public i didnt want to go to jail the fact that the punishment worried me more than the crime said something about my moral state some days i thought i was becoming a sociopath some days i thought i was already there i carried silverplated bullets in my gun at all times silver worked on humans as well as on most supernatural beings why keep switching to normal ammo that only did humans and a very few creatures but a few months ago id met a fairie that had damn near killed me silver didnt work on fairies but normal lead did so id taken to keeping a spare clip of regular bullets in the glove compartment i peeled off the first two rounds of my silver clip and replaced them with lead which meant i had two bullets to discourage zane with before i killed him because make no mistake if he kept coming after id pumped him full of two glazer safety rounds which hurt a hell of a lot even if you could heal the damage the first silver bullet was not going to be aimed to wound it wasnt until i was going through the doors i realized that i didnt know nathaniels last name stephens name wasnt going to help me damn the waiting room was packed women with crying babies children racing through the chairs belonging to no one a man with a bloody rag around his hand people with no visible injury staring dully into space stephen was nowhere in sight screams the sound of breaking glass metal clanked to the floor a nurse ran out of the far hallway get more security now a nurse behind the admittance desk punched buttons on the phone call it a hunch but i was betting i knew where stephen and zane were i flashed my id at the nurse im with the regional preternatural investigation team can i help the nurse clutched my arm youre a cop im with the police yes prevarication at its best as a civilian attached to a police squad you learn how to do that thank god she started to pull me towards the noise i pulled my arm free and took out my gun safety off pointed at the ceiling ready to go with normal ammo i wouldnt have pointed at the ceiling not with a hospital full of patients above me but glazer safety rounds arent called safety rounds for nothing the back area was like every emergency area id ever been in curtains hung from metal tracks so you could make lots and lots of little individual examining rooms a handful of curtains were closed but patients were sitting up staring through the curtains watching the show a wall divided the room down the middle to the corridor so there wasnt much to see a man wearing green surgical scrubs went flying through the air from around that wall he smacked into the opposite wall slid down it heavily and lay very still the nurse with me ran towards him and i let her go what lay beyond what was tossing doctors around like toys wasnt a job for a healer it was a job for me two more figures in surgical scrubs lay on the floor one male one female the woman was awake eyes wide her wrist was at a degree angle broken she saw my id clipped to my jacket hes a shifter be careful i know what he is i said i lowered the gun just a touch her eyes flinched and it wasnt pain dont shoot up my trauma center try not to i said and moved past her zane stepped out into the corridor id never seen zane before but who else could it be he was carrying someone in his arms i thought at first a woman because the hair was long and shining brown but the exposed back and shoulders were too muscular too male it had to be nathaniel he fit easily into the taller mans arms zane was about six foot stretched tall and thin he wore only a black leather vest on his thin pale upper body his hair was cottonwhite cut short on the sides with the top long in moussed spikes he opened his mouth and snarled at me he had fangs upper and lower like a great cat sweet jesus i pointed the gun at him and let out the air in my body until i was still and quiet i was aiming for a line of shoulder above nathaniels still form at this distance id hit it ill only ask once zane put him down hes mine mine he took striding steps down the hallway and i fired the bullet spun him halfway around and staggered him to his knees the shoulder id hit stopped working and nathaniel slid out of his arms zane got to his feet with the smaller man tucked under his good arm like a doll the flesh of his shoulder was already reknitting rebuilding itself like a fastforward picture of a flower blooming zane could have tried to rush past me to use his speed but he didnt he just came walking towards me as if he didnt believe id do it he should have believed the second lead bullet took him square in the chest blood exploded out of his pale skin he fell onto his back spine bowing struggling to breathe with a hole the size of a fist in his chest i went for him not running but hurrying i walked wide around him out of arms reach and came up a little behind him and to the side the shoulder id shot was still limp his other arm trapped under nathaniels body zane gasped up at me brown eyes wide silver zane the rest of the bullets are silver ill make it a head shot and blow your freaking brains all over this nice clean floor he finally managed to gasp out wont blood filled his mouth and spilled down his chin i pointed the gun at his face about eyebrow level if i pulled the trigger he was gone i stared down at this man id never met before he looked young nowhere close to thirty a great emptiness filled me it was like standing in the middle of white noise i felt nothing i didnt want to kill him but i didnt care if i did it didnt matter to me it only mattered to him i let that knowledge fill my eyes that i didnt give a damn one way or the other i let him see it because he was a shapeshifter and hed understand what i was showing him most people wouldnt most sane people anyway i said you are going to leave nathaniel alone when the police arrive you are going to do everything they tell you to do no arguments no fighting or i will kill you do you understand me zane yes he said and more blood flowed in a heavy line from his mouth he started to cry tears welled down his bloodstained face crying the bad guys arent supposed to cry im so glad youve come he said i tried to take care of them but i couldnt i tried to be gabriel but i couldnt be him his shoulder had healed enough that he covered his eyes with his hand so we couldnt see him cry but his voice was thick with tears as well as blood im so glad youve come to us anita im so glad were not alone anymore i didnt know what to say denying that i was going to be their leader seemed a bad idea with bodies littering the area if i refused his offer he might get nasty again and id have to kill him i realized suddenly with something like a physical jolt that i didnt want to kill him was it the tears maybe but it was more than that it was the fact that id killed their alpha their protector and never given a thought what that might do to the rest of the wereleopards it had never occurred to me that there was no second in command no one to fill gabriels place i certainly couldnt be their alpha i didnt turn furry once a month but if it would keep zane from tearing up any more doctors i could play along for a while by the time the cops arrived zane was healed hed curled around nathaniels unconscious body like it was a teddy bear still crying he stroked nathaniels hair and muttered over and over shell keep us safe shell keep us safe shell keep us safe i think the she was me and i was in way over my head stephen lay in the narrow hospital bed his curly blond hair was longer than mine sweeping across the white pillow angry red and pink scars crisscrossed his delicate face he looked like hed been shoved through a window which is exactly what had happened stephen who didnt outweigh me by twenty pounds had stood his ground zane had finally shoved him through a wiremesh safety window like shoving someone through a wire cheese grater if it had been a human being theyd be dead even stephen was hurt badly hurt but he was healing i couldnt literally see the scars fading it was like trying to watch a flower bloom you knew it happened but you never got to see it id glance back at him and thered be one less scar it was unnerving as hell nathaniel was in the other bed his hair was longer than stephens waist length i was betting hard to judge since id only seen him prone it was the darkest of auburns almost brown but not it was a rich deep mahogany the hair lay on the white sheets like the pelt of an animal thick and shining he was pretty rather than handsome and couldnt have been more than five foot six the hair helped the illusion of femininity but his shoulders were disproportionately broad part weightlifting but part genetics he had great shoulders but they belonged on someone about half a foot taller he had to be eighteen to strip at guilty pleasures his face was slender jaw too smooth he might have been eighteen but he wasnt much over maybe someday hed grow into the shoulders we were in a semiprivate room on the isolation ward the floor that most hospitals kept for lycanthropes vamps and other preternatural citizens anything they thought might be dangerous zane would have been dangerous but the cops had carted him away wounds nearly healed his flesh had pushed my bullets out onto the floor like rejected bits of organ i didnt think we needed the isolation ward for stephen and nathaniel i could be wrong on nathaniel but i didnt think so i trusted stephens judgment better than that nathaniel hadnt regained consciousness id asked what his injuries were and they told me because they still thought i was a cop and id saved their asses gratitude is a wonderful thing someone had pretty much gutted nathaniel i dont mean just cut open his gut with a knife i mean opened him up and let his intestines fall onto the floor they found bits of debris on his intestines there were signs of severe trauma to other parts of the body hed been sexually abused and yes a prostitute can be raped all it takes is saying no no one not even a lycanthrope would agree to being raped while their insides were spilling onto the floor the rape could have been first then they tried to kill him it was a touch less sick done in that order a touch there were marks on his wrists and ankles like hed been chained the marks were rubbed bloody like hed struggled and they werent healing which meant that theyd used chains with a high silver content so it would hurt and not just hold whoever had done this to him knew ahead of time theyd be getting a lycanthrope they were prepared which raised some very interesting questions stephen said gabriel had been pimping the wereleopards out i understood why people would want something as exotic as a wereleopard i knew that sadomasochism existed shapeshifters could take a hell of a lot of damage so the combination even made a certain sense but this was beyond sex games id never heard of anything this brutal outside of a serialkiller case i couldnt leave them alone unprotected even without the threat of sexual murderers there was still the wereleopards zane might have cried and kissed my feet but there were others if they had no pack structure no alpha they had no one to tell them to leave nathaniel alone without a leader it might be a matter of having to back down or kill each of them individually not a pleasant thought real leopards dont sweat whos in charge much they dont have pack structures but shapeshifters arent animals theyre people which meant no matter how solitary and uncomplicated the animal form the people half will find a way to screw things up if gabriel had handpicked his people i couldnt trust that they wouldnt come and try for nathaniel again gabriel had been one sick kitty and zane hadnt impressed me much either who you gonna call for reinforcements the local werewolf pack of course stephen was a member of their pack they owed him protection there was a knock on the door i took the browning out and held it on my lap underneath the magazine id been reading id managed to find a threemonthold copy of national wildlife with an article on kodiak bears the magazine hid the gun nicely who is it its irving come in i left the gun out just in case somebody would try to push in behind him irving griswold was a werewolf and a reporter for a reporter he was a good guy but he wasnt as careful as i was when i saw he was alone then i would put the gun up irving pushed the door open smiling his frizzy brown hair encircled his head like a brown halo with the bald spot gleaming in the middle glasses perched on a small nose he was short and gave the impression of being round without being fat he looked like anything but a big bad wolf he didnt even look much like a reporter which was one of the things that made him such a great interviewer but would probably always keep him from being oncamera material he worked for the st louis postdispatch and had interviewed me many times he closed the door behind him i put up the gun his eyes widened he spoke low but not in a whisper hows stephen how did you get in here theres supposed to be a cop on the door gee blake im glad to see you too dont mess with me irving theres supposed to be a guard out there hes talking to a very pretty nurse at the desk dammit i was not a real cop so i couldnt go around yelling at them but it was tempting there was a law floating around washington that might give vampire hunters federal badges soon sometimes i thought it was a bad idea sometimes i didnt talk to me fast before i get kicked out how is stephen i told him you dont care about nathaniel he looked uncomfortable you know that sylvie is de facto pack leader while richard is out of town working on his masters degree right i sighed no i didnt know i know youre not talking to richard since you broke up but id think someone else would have mentioned it all the other wolves creep around me like theres been a death no one talks about richard to me irving i thought hed forbidden them to talk to me not to my knowledge im surprised you didnt come in here asking for a story i cant do this story anita its too close to home because you know stephen because everyone involved is a shapeshifter and im just a mildmannered reporter you really think youd lose your job if they found out job hell what would my mother say i smiled so you cant play bodyguard he frowned you know i hadnt thought about that when one of the pack got hurt in public where it couldnt be hidden raina always used to ride to the rescue with her dead i dont think we have any alphas that arent hiding what they are no one id trust to guard stephen anyway raina had been the wolf packs old lupa before i took the job technically the old lupa doesnt have to die to step down unlike the ulfric or king wolf but raina had been gabriels playmate theyd shared certain hobbies like making pornographic snuff films starring shapeshifters and humans shed been helping film while gabriel tried to rape me oh yeah raina had made it a real pleasure to punch her ticket thats the second time youve ignored nathaniel i said what gives irving i told you sylvie is in charge until richard gets back in town so shes forbidden any of us to help the wereleopards in any way why raina used the wereleopards in her porno movies a lot along with the wolves ive seen one of the films i wasnt impressed horrified but not impressed irving looked very serious she also let gabriel and the cats punish wayward pack members punish i made it a question irving nodded sylvie was one of the ones who got punished more than once she hates them all anita if richard hadnt forbid it shed have used the pack to hunt the leopards down and kill them all ive seen what gabriel and raina thought was fun and games i think im on sylvies side for once you cleaned house for us you and richard richard killed marcus and now hes ulfric pack leader you killed raina for us and now youre our lupa i shot her irving according to pack law so im told using a gun negates the challenge i cheated youre not lupa because you killed raina youre lupa because richard picked you as his mate i shook my head we arent dating anymore irving but richard hasnt picked a new lupa anita until he does the jobs yours richard was tall dark handsome honest truthful brave he was perfect except for being a werewolf even that had been forgivable or so i thought until i saw him in action saw the whole enchilada the meat had been raw and squirming the sauce a little bloody now i was dating just jeanclaude i wasnt sure how much of an improvement dating the head vampire of the city was over dating the head werewolf but id made my choice it was jeanclaudes pale pale hands that held my body his black hair that curled over my pillow his midnightblue eyes that i stared into while we made love good girls do not have premarital sex especially with the undead i didnt think good girls had regrets about exboyfriend a when theyve chosen boyfriend b maybe id been wrong richard and i avoided each other when we could which had been for most of the last six weeks now he was out of town easy to avoid each other now i wont ask what youre thinking about irving said i think i know dont be so damn smart i said he spread his hands wide occupational hazard that made me laugh so sylvies forbidden anyone to help the leopards where does that leave stephen he went against her direct orders anita for someone as low in the pack structure as stephen that took guts but sylvie wont be impressed shell tear him up and she wont allow anyone to come down and babysit them i know her that well i cant do this twentyfour hours a day irving theyll heal in a day or so i frowned at him i cant sit here for two days he looked away from me and went to stand beside stephens bed he stared down at the sleeping man hands clasped in front of him i walked over to them i touched irvings arm what arent you telling me he shook his head i dont know what you mean i turned him around made him face me talk to me irving you arent a shapeshifter anita you arent dating richard anymore you need to get out of our world not further into it he looked so serious solemn that it scared me irving whats wrong he just shook his head i grabbed him by both arms and resisted the urge to shake him what are you hiding there is a way for you to get the pack to guard stephen and even nathaniel i took a step back im listening you outrank sylvie im not a shapeshifter irving i was the new pack leaders girlfriend im not even that anymore youre more than that anita and you know it youve killed some of us you kill easily and without remorse the pack respects that gee irving what a rousing endorsement do you feel badly about killing raina did you lose sleep over gabriel i killed raina because she was trying to kill me i killed gabriel for the same reason selfpreservation so no i didnt lose any sleep the pack respects you anita if you could find some pack members that are already outed as shifters and convince them that youre scarier than sylvie theyd guard them both of them i am not scarier than sylvie irving i cant beat them to a pulp she can but you can kill them he said it very quietly watching my face searching my expression i opened my mouth closed it what are you trying to get me to do irving he shook his head nothing forget i said it i shouldnt have said it get more cops in here and go home anita just get out of it while you can whats going on irving is sylvie a problem he looked at me his usually cheerful eyes solemn thoughtful he shook his head ive got to go anita i grabbed his arm you go nowhere until you tell me whats happening he turned back to me slowly reluctantly i let go of his arm and stepped back talk sylvie has challenged everyone higher in the pack than she is and won i looked at him so do you understand how unusual it is for a woman to fight her way to second in command shes about five foot six smallboned ask how shes winning youre being coy irving thats not like you im not going to play twenty questions with you just tell me she killed the first two people she fought she didnt have to she chose to the next three challenges she made just agreed she was dominant to them they didnt want to risk being killed very practical i said he nodded sylvies always been that she finally picked one of the inner circle to fight shes too small to be one of the enforcers besides i think she was afraid of jamil and shangda jamil richard didnt drive him out but he was one of marcuss and rainas flunkies irving shrugged richard thought the transition would go smoother if he kept some of the old guard in power i shook my head jamil should have been driven out or killed maybe but actually jamil seems to support richard i think it really surprised him when he wasnt killed instantly richard has earned his loyalty i didnt know jamil had any loyalty i said none of us did sylvie fought and won the place of geri second in command she kill for it surprisingly no okay so sylvies tearing up the pack shes second in command great so what i think she wants to be ulfric anita i think she wants richards job i stared at him theres only one way to be ulfric irving to kill the old king irving said yeah i think sylvie knows that i havent seen her fight but ive seen richard fight he outweighs her by a hundred pounds a hundred pounds of muscle and hes good she cant beat him in a fair fight can she its like richard is wounded anita the hearts gone out of him i think if she challenged and really wanted it shed win what are you telling me that hes depressed i asked its more than that you know how much he hates being one of the monsters hed never killed anyone until marcus he cant forgive himself how do you know all this i listen reporters make good listeners we stared at each other tell me the rest irving looked down then up he doesnt discuss you with me the only thing he said was that even you couldnt accept what he was even you the executioner were horrified it was my turn to look down i didnt want to be we cant change how we feel irving said i met his eyes i would if i could i believe you i dont want richard dead none of us do im afraid of what sylvie would do without anyone to stop her he motioned to the other bed first order of business would be hunting down all the wereleopards wed slaughter them i took in a deep breath and let it out i cant change how i feel about what i saw irving i saw richard eat marcus i paced the small room shaking my head what can i do to help call the pack and demand that they acknowledge you as lupa make some of them come here and guard both of them against sylvies express orders but you have to give them your protection you have to promise them that she wont hurt them because youll see to it that she cant if i do that and sylvie doesnt like it ill have to kill her its like im setting her up to be killed thats a little premeditated even for me he shook his head im asking you to be our lupa to be richards lupa to show sylvie that if she keeps pressing richard may not kill her but you will i sighed shit im sorry anita i wouldnt have said anything but i needed to know i said i hugged him and he stiffened in surprise then hugged me back what was that for for telling me i know richard wont like it the smile faded from his face richard has punished two pack members since he took over they challenged his authority big time and he nearly killed them both what i asked he sliced them up anita he was like someone else something else richard doesnt do things like that he does now not all the time most of the time hes fine but then he snaps and goes into a rage i dont want to be anywhere near him when he loses it how bad has he gotten i asked hes got to accept what he is anita hes got to embrace his beast or hes going to drive himself mad i shook my head i cant help him love his beast irving i cant accept it either irving shrugged its not so bad being furry anita there are worse things like being the walking dead i frowned at him get out irving and thanks for telling me i hope youre still thankful in a week me too irving gave me some phone numbers and left didnt want anyone to stay too long people might suspect him of being more than just a reporter no one seemed to worry about my reputation i raised zombies slew vampires and was dating the master of the city if people began to suspect me of being a shapeshifter what the hell difference would it make three names of submissive pack members who irving thought were tough enough to play bodyguard and weak enough to be bullied i didnt want to do this the pack was based on obedience punishment and reward mostly punishment if the pack members i called refused me i had to punish them or i wasnt lupa wasnt strong enough to back richard of course he probably wouldnt be grateful he seemed to hate me now i didnt blame him hed hate me interfering but it wasnt just richard it was stephen hed saved my life once and i still hadnt returned the favor he was also one of those people that was everyones victim until today yeah zane had nearly killed him but that wasnt the point hed put friendship above pack loyalty which meant that sylvie could withdraw pack protection from him hed be like the wereleopards anybodys meat i couldnt let that happen to him not if i could stop it stephen might end up dead richard might end up dead i might have to kill sylvie i might have to maim or kill a few pack members to make my point might might might damn id never killed before except in selfdefense or for revenge if i put my hat in the ring it would be premeditated coldblooded murder maybe not in a technical sense but i knew what i would be starting in motion it was like dominoes they all stayed straight and neat until you hit one of them then there was no stopping them i would end up with a pretty pattern on the floor richard solidly in power stephen and the wereleopards safe sylvie backed down or dead the first three things were going to happen it was sylvies choice how the last bit turned out harsh but true of course there was one other option sylvie could kill me that would sort of open things up for her again sylvie wasnt exactly ruthless but she didnt let anyone get in her way we shared that trait no i am not ruthless if i was id have just called sylvie into a meeting and shot her on the spot i wasnt quite sociopath enough to do it mercy will get you killed but sometimes its all that makes us human i made the calls i chose a mans name first kevin no last name his voice was thick with sleep gruff like he smoked who the hell is this gracious i said very gracious who is this its anita blake do you know who i am when trying to be threatening less is more me and clint eastwood he was quiet for nearly thirty seconds and i let the silence build his breath had sped up i could almost feel his pulse quickening over the phone he answered like he was used to strange phone calls and pack business youre our lupa very good kevin very good condescending is also good he coughed to clear his throat what do you want i want you to come down to st louis university hospital stephen and nathaniel have been hurt i want you to guard them for me nathaniel hes one of the wereleopards thats right sylvies forbidden us to help the wereleopards is sylvie your lupa questions are great but only if you know the answers if you ask questions and the answers surprise you you look silly hard to be threatening when you look illinformed he was quiet for a second no who is i heard him swallow you are do i outrank her you know you do then get your butt down here and do what i ask sylvie will hurt me lupa she really will ill see that she doesnt youre just richards human girlfriend you cant fight sylvie not and live youre right kevin i cant fight sylvie but i can kill her what do you mean if she hurts you for helping me ill kill her you cant mean that i sighed look kevin ive met sylvie trust me when i say that i could point a gun at her head and pull the trigger i can and will kill sylvie if she forces me to no jokes no bluffs no games i listened to my voice as i said it i sounded tired almost bored and so serious it was almost frightening all right ill do it but if you let me down she may kill me you have my protection kevin and i know what that means in the pack it means i have to acknowledge you as dominant to me he said it also means that if anyone challenges you i can help you fight your battles seems like a fair trade silence filled the phone lines again his breathing had slowed deepened promise me you wont get me killed i cant promise that kevin but i can promise that if sylvie kills you ill kill her for you silence shorter this time i believe you would ill be at the hospital in forty minutes or less thanks ill be waiting i hung up and made the other two calls they both agreed to come down id drawn a line in the sand with sylvie on one side and me on the other she wasnt going to like it not one little bit couldnt blame her if our places were reversed id have been pissed but she should have left richard alone irving had said it was like richard was wounded like the heart had gone out of him id helped put that wound there id cut his heart into tiny little pieces and danced on them not deliberately my intentions were good but you know what they say about good intentions i couldnt love richard but i could kill for him killing was the more practical of the two gifts and lately id become very very practical sergeant rudolph storr showed up before the babysitting werewolves could arrive id called him myself he was the man in charge of the regional preternatural investigation team rpit or rip a lot of people call us rip for rest in peace hey at least they know who we are dolph is six foot eight built like a prowrestler but it isnt just physical size that makes him impressive hed taken a squad that had been meant as a joke to appease the liberals and made it work rpit had solved more preternatural crimes in the last three years than any other police unit including the fbi dolph had even been invited up to lecture at quantico not bad for someone whod been given his command as a punishment dolph wasnt exactly an optimist few cops are but give him lemons and he made damn fine lemonade he closed the door behind him and stared down at me the doctor said my detective was in here i just see you i never said i was a detective i said i was with the squad they assumed the rest he shook his head his black hair actually hid the tops of his ears he was overdue for a hair cut if you were playing cop why didnt you yell at the uniform that was supposed to be on this door i smiled up at him i thought id leave that to you i assume he knows that he was a bad boy i took care of it dolph said he stayed standing at the door i stayed sitting in my chair id actually managed not to pull my gun on him i was happy about that he was staring at me hard enough to hurt without flashing a gun at him whats going on anita you know everything i know i said how did you happen to be johnnyonthespot stephen called me tell me he said i told him i even put in the part about the pimping i wanted that stopped the cops are pretty good at stopping crime if you tell the truth i left out a few things like me having killed the wereleopards old alpha it was the only thing i left out for me it was almost the same as being honest dolph blinked at me and took it all down in his trusty notebook are you saying that our victim allowed someone to do this to him i shook my head i dont think its that simple i think he went there knowing theyd chain him up he knew thered be sex and pain but i dont think he knew theyd come this close to killing him the doctors actually had to give him blood his body was going into shock faster than it could fix itself ive heard of wereanimals healing from worse wounds than this dolph said i shrugged some people heal better than others even among the shapeshifters nathaniel is pretty low in the power structure so im told maybe part of being weak is not healing as well i spread my hands wide i dont know dolph searched back through his notes someone dropped him off at the emergency entrance wrapped in a sheet no one saw anything he just appeared no one ever sees anything dolph isnt that the rule that earned me a small smile it was nice to see the smile dolph wasnt too happy with me lately hed only recently found out that i was dating the master of the city he didnt like it he didnt trust anyone that socialized with the monsters couldnt blame him yeah thats the rule are you telling me everything you know about this anita i raised a hand in a scouts salute would i lie to you if it suited your purpose yes we stared at each other the silence grew thick enough to walk on i let it sit there if dolph thought i was going to break first he was wrong the strain between us wasnt this case it was his disapproval of my choice of dates his disappointment in me was always there now pressing weighted waiting for me to apologize or say shucks just kidding the fact that i was dating a vampire made him trust me less i understood two months ago even less and id have felt the same way but here i was dating who and what i was dating dolph and i both had to deal with it and yet he was my friend and i respected him i even agreed with him but if i could ever get out of this damn hospital i had a date with jeanclaude tonight regardless of my doubts about richard morals in general and the walking dead i wanted the date the thought of jeanclaude waiting for me made my body tight and warm embarrassing but true i dont think anything short of giving up jeanclaude would have satisfied dolph i wasnt sure that was an option anymore for a lot of reasons so i sat and looked at dolph he stared back the silence grew thicker with each tick of the clock a knock on the door saved us the officer now attentively on the door whispered something to dolph dolph nodded and closed the door the look he gave me was even less friendly if that was possible officer wayne says that there are three relatives of stephens out here he also says that if theyre all relatives hell eat his gun tell him to pucker up i said theyre fellow pack members werewolves consider that closer than family but legally its not family dolph said how many of your men you want to lose when the next shapeshifter comes through that door we can shoot them just as good as you can anita but you still have to give them a warning before you shoot them dont you you still have to treat them like people instead of monsters or you end up in front of the review board witnesses say you gave zane no last name a warning i was feeling generous you were shooting him in front of witnesses that always makes you generous we went back to staring at each other maybe it wasnt just dating a vampire maybe it was the fact that dolph was the ultimate cop and he was beginning to suspect that i was killing people murdering people people who hurt me or threatened me did have a tendency to vanish not many but enough and less than two months ago id killed two people where the bodies couldnt be hidden selfdefense both times never saw the inside of a courtroom both assassins with records longer than i was tall the womans fingerprints had been the answer to several political killings that interpol had lying around bigtime bad guys that no one really mourned at least not the cops but it fed dolphs suspicions hell it did everything but confirm them whyd you recommend me to pete mckinnon dolph he didnt answer for so long i thought he wasnt going to but finally he said because youre the best at what you do anita i may not always approve of your methods but you help save lives put away the bad guys youre better on a murder scene than some of the detectives on my squad for dolph this was a speech i opened my mouth closed it then said thanks dolph coming from you thats a big compliment you just spend too much time with the damn monsters anita i dont mean who you date i mean all of it youve played by their rules so long sometimes you forget what its like to be normal i smiled i raise the dead for a living dolph ive never been normal he shook his head dont purposely misunderstand what im saying anita its not the fur or the fangs that make you a monster not always sometimes its just where you draw the line the fact that i play with monsters is what makes me valuable to you dolph if i played it straight i wouldnt be as good helping you solve preternatural crimes yeah sometimes i wonder if id left you alone not gotten you to consult with us if youd be softer i frowned at him are you saying you blame yourself for what ive become i tried to laugh it off but his face stopped me how often did you go to the monsters on one of my cases how often did you have to make bargains with them to help put away a bad guy if id left you alone i stood up i reached out to him then let my hand fall back without touching him im not your daughter dolph youre not my keeper i help the police because i like it im good at it and who else you gonna call he nodded yeah who else the shifters outside can come in and visit the patients thanks dolph he took in a long breath and let it out in a big rush of air i saw the window that your friend stephen got shoved through if hed been human hed be dead its just luck that no civilians were killed i shook my head i think zane was being careful of the humans at least with the strength he has it would have been easier to kill than to maim why would he have cared because hes in jail and he gets a bail hearing they wont let him out dolph said he didnt kill anyone dolph since when havent you seen someone not get bail for assault and battery you think like a cop anita its what makes you good i think like a cop and like a monster thats what makes me good he nodded closed his notebook and slipped it into an inner pocket of his jacket yeah thats what makes you good he left without another word he sent in the three werewolves and closed the door kevin was tall dark scruffy and smelled like cigarettes lorraine was neat and prim like a secondgrade schoolteacher she smelled of white linen perfume and blinked nervously at me teddy his preference not mine weighed around three hundred pounds most of it muscle hed buzzed his hair down to a fine dark prickle and his head looked too small for his massive body the men looked scary but it was lorraines handshake that left power vibrating down my skin she looked like a scared rabbit and had enough power to be the big bad wolf within twenty minutes i was free to leave the mismatched trio of werewolves had divided the shifts so that one of them would be with the boys at all times did i trust the new wolves to guard them yeah because if they abandoned their posts and let stephen get killed i really would kill them if they tried their best and were simply not strong enough fine but if they just gave up id given stephen and now nathaniel my protection i wasnt kidding i made sure that all of them knew that kevin said it best if sylvie shows up well send her to you you do that he shook his head playing with an unlit cigarette id told him he couldnt smoke it but even touching it seemed to comfort him youve pissed in her pond i hope you can clean it up i smiled eloquent kevin very eloquent eloquent or not sylvie is going to bust your ass if she can the smile widened i couldnt help it let me worry about my own ass my job is to keep your ass out of the sling not mine the three werewolves looked at me there was something on all their faces almost the same expression but i couldnt read it being lupa is more than just fighting for dominance said lorraine in a small voice i know that i said do you she asked and there was something childlike in the question i think so you kill us if we fail you kevin said but will you die for us will you risk the same price you ask us to pay i liked kevin better when he wasnt being eloquent i stared at these three strangers people id just met would i risk my life for them could i ask them to risk their lives for me if i wasnt willing to return the favor i looked at them really looked at them lorraines small hands clutching her purse so tightly her hands shook teddy who stared at me with calm accepting eyes but there was a challenge in them an intelligence that you might miss if you just looked at the body kevin who looked like he should be in an alley looking for a fix or in a bar drinking up his share of whiskey there was something underneath the cynicism it was fear fear that id be like all the rest a user who didnt give a damn about them raina had been that and now sylvie the pack was supposed to be their refuge their protection not the thing they feared most their warm electric power filled the room flowed out of them dancing over my body they were nervous scared strong emotions made most shapeshifters leak power if you were sensitive to it youd feel it id felt it a lot over the years this time was different somehow i didnt just sense the power my body reacted to it not merely a shivering of skin a line of goose bumps but something deeper it was almost sexual but that wasnt it either it was as if the power had found a part of me caressed a part of me that i never knew was there their power filled me touched something and i felt it whatever it was open up like a switch being thrown a rush of warm energy welled up inside of my body and spread out through my skin as if every pore of my body was emitting a warm line of air it brought a soft gasp to my throat i knew the taste of the power and it wasnt jeanclaude it was richard somehow id tapped into richards power i wondered if he felt it all the way out of state studying for his degree six weeks ago to save both their lives id let jeanclaude bind the three of us to each other they were dying and i couldnt let them go richard had invaded my dreams by accident but mostly jeanclaude had kept us apart because anything else was too painful this was the first time id felt richards power since then the first time i knew for certain that the tie was still there still strong magic is like that even hate cant kill it i suddenly had the words words i couldnt have known i am lupa i am the allmother i am your guardian your refuge your peace i will stand with you against all harm your enemies are my enemies i share blood and flesh with you we are lukoi we are pack the warmth cut off abruptly i staggered only teddys hand kept me from falling to the floor are you all right he asked in a voice as deep and impressive as the rest of him i nodded im fine im fine as soon as i could i stepped back richard had felt the pull hundreds of miles away and hed cut me off hed slammed the door shut without knowing what i was doing or why a rush of rage danced down inside my head like a silent scream he was so angry we were both bound to jeanclaude i was his human servant and richard was his wolf it was a painful intimacy you arent lukoi lorraine said you arent a shapeshifter how did you do that i smiled trade secret truth was i didnt know id have to ask jeanclaude tonight i hoped he could explain it he was only the third master vampire in their long history to have bound both a mortal and a shapeshifter into a single bond i suspected strongly that there wasnt a manual and that jeanclaude winged it more often than i wanted to know teddy went down on his knees you are lupa the other two followed him they abased themselves like good little submissive wolves though kevin didnt like it and neither did i but i wasnt sure how much was form and how much was necessary i wanted them submissive because i didnt want to have to fight anybody or kill anybody so i let them crawl on the floor and run their hands along my legs and sniff my skin like dogs which is when the nurse came in everybody got up off the floor i tried to explain and finally stopped the nurse just stood there staring at all of us a strange frozen smile on her face she finally backed out without doing a damn thing ill send doctor wilson in to check on them she nodded her head too often and too rapidly and shut the door behind her if shed been wearing heels id have bet we could have heard her run so much for not being one of the monsters tucking in the babysitting werewolves made me late for my date taking time to read mckinnons file made me later but if there was a fire tonight itd be embarrassing not to be prepared i learned two things from the file one that all the fires had been started after dark which made me think instantly of vampires except that vampires couldnt start fires it wasnt one of their abilities in fact fire was one of the things they feared most oh id seen a few vamps that could control existing flames to a small extent make a candle flame rise or fall parlor tricks but fire was the element of purity purity and the vamps didnt mix the second thing i learned from the file was that i didnt know much about fires in general or arson in particular i was going to need a book or a good lecture jeanclaude had made reservations at demiches a very nice restaurant id had to run home to my new rented house to change it had put me late enough that id arranged to meet him at the restaurant the trouble with fancy dates was where to put my weapons womens dress clothes are the ultimate challenge to concealedweapon carry formals hid more but made grabbing the weapon harder anything formfitting made it difficult tonight i was wearing a spaghettistrap formal with slits so high on either side id had to make sure that the hose were a matching offblack and the underwear was lacy and black i knew myself well enough to know that sometime during the evening id forget and flash the undies and if i had to go for the gun id certainly flash so why wear it answer i had a firestar mm pistol tucked inside a bellyband the bellyband was an elastic strap that went over the underwear but under the outerwear it was designed to wear under a buttondown dress shirt pull the shirt up with the free hand pull the gun out and violа start shooting the bellyband didnt work well under most formals because you had yards of cloth to raise before you could get to the gun it was better than nothing but only if the bad guy was patient but this dress all i had to do was put my hand up through one of the slits i had to pull the gun out down and out from under the dress so it still wasnt speedy but it wasnt bad the bellyband also did not work with an especially formfitting dress nobody gains weight in the shape of a gun id actually found a strapless bra that matched the black panties so once i took off the gun and dress i was wearing lingerie the shoes were higher heels than id normally accept but it was either that or hem the dress since i refuse to sew heels it was the one major drawback to the spaghetti straps was that it showed off all my scars id thought about buying a little coverup jacket but this wasnt a dress that was meant for a jacket so screw it jeanclaude had seen the scars before and the few people rude enough to give second glances could have an eyeful i was getting pretty good at makeup eye shadow blusher lipstick the lipstick was redvery very red but i had the coloring for it pale skin black curly hair pure brown eyes i was all contrasts and strong colors the bright red lipstick matched i was feeling pretty spiffy until i got a glimpse of jeanclaude he was sitting at the table waiting for me i could see him from the entryway though the maitre d was two people ahead of me i didnt mind i enjoyed the view jeanclaudes hair is black and curly but hed done something to it so it was straight and fine falling past his shoulders curled under at the ends his face seemed even more delicate like fine porcelain he was beautiful not handsome i wasnt sure what saved his face from being femininesome line of his cheek bend of his jaw something you would never mistake him for anything other than male he was dressed in royal blue a color id never seen him in a short jacket of a shining almost metallic cloth was overlaid with black lace in a pattern of flowers the shirt was his typical frilled а la s shirt but it was a rich vibrant blue down to the mound of ruffles that climbed up his neck to frame his face and spill out the sleeves of the jacket to cover the upper half of his slender white hands he held an empty wineglass in his hand spinning the stem of the glass between his fingers watching the light spill through the crystal he couldnt drink wine more than a sip at a time and mourned it the maitre d led me through the tables towards him he looked up and seeing his face fullon made my chest tight and it was suddenly hard to breathe the blue so close to his face made his eyes bluer than id ever seen them not the color of midnight skies but cobalt blue the color of a good sapphire but no jewel ever had that weight of intelligence of dark knowledge the look in his eyes as he watched me walk towards him made me shiver not cold not fear anticipation in the heels and with the slits on both sides of the dress there was an art to walking you had to sort of throw yourself into it a slingback slouching hipswinging walk or the dress wrapped around your legs and the heels twisted at your ankles you had to walk like you knew you could wear it and look wonderful if you doubted yourself hesitated youd fall to the floor and turn into a pumpkin after years of my not being able to wear heels and dress clothes jeanclaude had taught me in a month what my stepmother couldnt teach me in twenty years he stood and i didnt mind though once upon a time id pissed off a prom date by standing every time that he did for the other girls at the table one id mellowed since then two i could see the rest of jeanclaudes outfit the pants were black linen clinging smooth and perfect to his body so form fitting that i knew there was nothing under the pants but him black boots climbed his legs to the knees the boots were soft crepelike leather wrinkled and pettable he glided towards me and i stood there watching him come i was still half afraid of him afraid of how much i wanted him i was like a rabbit caught in headlights frozen waiting for death to come but did the rabbits heart beat fast and faster did its breath come like a choking thing into its throat was there an eager rush to the fear or was there just death he wrapped his arms around me drawing me close his pale hands were warm as they slid over my bare arms hed fed on someone tonight borrowed their warmth but theyd been willing even eager the master of the city never went begging for donors blood was about the only bodily fluid i wouldnt share with him i slid my hands over the silk of his shirt underneath the short jacket i wanted to mold my body against his stolen warmth i wanted to run my hands over the roughness of the linen contrasting it to the smoothness of the silk jeanclaude was always a sensual feast right down to his clothing he kissed my lips lightly wed learned that the lipstick came off then he tilted my head to one side and breathed along my face down my neck his breath was like a line of fire along my skin he spoke with his lips just above the big pulse in my neck you are lovely tonight ma petite he pressed his lips against my skin softly i let out a shuddering breath and drew back from him it was a greeting among the vampires to plant a light kiss above the big pulse in the throat it was a gesture reserved for the very closest friends it showed great trust and affection to refuse it meant you were angry or distrustful it still seemed too intimate for public consumption to me but id seen him use it with others and seen fights start with a refusal it was an old gesture just coming back into vogue in fact it was becoming a chic greeting among entertainers and others of the same ilk better than kissing the air near someones face i guess the maitre d held my chair i waved him off it wasnt feminism but lack of grace i never managed to be scooted under a table without the chair banging my legs or being so far from the table i had to finish scooting forward on my own so the heck with it id do it myself jeanclaude watched me struggle into my chair smiling but he didnt offer to help id finally broken him of that at least he sat down in his own chair with a graceful fall it was an almost foppish movement but he was like a cat even at rest there was the potential of muscle under skin a physical presence that was utterly masculine i used to think it was vampire trickery but it was him just him i shook my head whats wrong ma petite i felt pretty spiffy until i saw you now i feel like one of the ugly stepsisters he tuttutted at me you know you are lovely ma petite shall i feed your vanity by telling you how much i wasnt fishing for compliments i gestured at him and shook my head again you look amazing tonight he smiled dipping his head to one side so his hair swept forward merci ma petite is the hair permed straight i asked it looks great i added hastily and it did but i hoped it wasnt as permanent as a perm i loved his curls if it was what would you say if it was youd have just said so now youre teasing me would you mourn the loss of my curls he asked i could return the favor i said he widened his eyes in mock horror not your crowning glory ma petite mon dieu he was laughing at me but i was used to it i didnt know you could get linen that tight i said his smile widened and i did not know you could hide a gun under such a slender dress as long as i dont hug anybody theyll never know very true a waiter came and asked if we wanted drinks i ordered water and coke jeanclaude declined if he could have ordered anything it would have been wine jeanclaude brought his chair over to sit almost beside me when dinner came hed move back to his place setting but picking out the meal was part of the nights entertainment it had taken me several dinner dates to realize what jeanclaude wantedno almost needed i was jeanclaudes human servant i bore three of his marks one of the side effects of the second mark was that he could take sustenance through me so if wed been on a long sea voyage he wouldnt have had to feed off of any humans on the boat he could live through me for a time he could also taste food through me for the first time in nearly four hundred years he could taste food i had to eat it for him but he could enjoy a meal it was trivial compared to some of the other things hed gained through the bonding but it was the thing that seemed to please him most he ordered food with a childlike glee and watched me eat tasting it as i did in private hed roll on his back like a cat hands pressed to his mouth as if trying to drain every taste it was the only thing he did that was cute he was gorgeous sensual but rarely cute id gained four pounds in six weeks eating with him he slid his arm over the back of my chair and we read the menu together he leaned close enough for his hair to brush my cheek the smell of his perfume oh sorry cologne caressed my skin though if what jeanclaude wore was cologne then brut was bug spray i moved my head away from the caress of his hair mainly because the feel of him this close was all i could think about maybe if id taken him up on his invitation to live with him at the circus of the damned some of this heat would have dissipated but id rented a house in record time in the middle of nowhere so my neighbors wouldnt get shot up which is why i moved out of my last apartment i hated the house i wasnt a house kinda gal i was a condo kind of gal but condos had neighbors too the lace overlay on his jacket was scratchy against my nearly bare shoulders he put his hand on my shoulder smoothing his fingertips across my skin his leg brushed my thigh and i realized i hadnt heard a damn thing hed said it was embarrassing he stopped talking and looked at me gazed at me from inches away with those extraordinary eyes i have been explaining my menu choices to you have you heard any of it i shook my head sorry he laughed and it hovered over my skin like his breath warm and sliding over my body it was a vampire trick but low on the scale and had become public foreplay for us in private we did other things he whispered against my cheek no apologies ma petite you know it pleases me that you find me intoxicating he laughed again and i pushed him away go sit on your side of the table youve been here long enough to know what you want he moved his chair dutifully back to his place setting i have what i want ma petite i had to look down and not meet his eyes heat crept up my neck into my face and i couldnt stop it if you mean what do i want for dinner that is a different question he said you are a pain in the ass i said and so many other places he said i didnt think i could blush more i was wrong stop it i love the fact that i can make you blush it is charming the tone in his voice made me smile in spite of myself this is not a dress to be charming in i was trying for sexy and sophisticated can you not be charming as well as sexy and sophisticated is there some rule about being all three slick very slick i said he widened his eyes trying for innocent and failing he was many things but innocent wasnt one of them now lets start negotiating on dinner i said you make it sound like a chore i sighed before you came along i thought food was something you ate so you wouldnt die i will never be as enamored of food as you are its almost a fetish with you hardly a fetish ma petite a hobby then he nodded perhaps so just tell me what you like on the menu and well negotiate all that is required is that you taste what is ordered you do not have to eat it no no more of this tasting shit ive gained weight i never gain weight you have gained four pounds so i am told though i have searched diligently for this phantom four pounds and cannot find them it brings your weight up to a grand total of one hundred and ten pounds correct thats right oh ma petite you are growing gargantuan i looked at him and it was not a friendly look never tease a woman about her weight jeanclaude at least not an american twentiethcentury one he spread his hands wide my deepest apologies when you apologize try not to smile at the same time it ruins the effect i said his smile widened until a hint of fang peeked out i will try to remember that for the future the waiter returned with my drinks would you like to order or do you need a few minutes jeanclaude looked at me a few minutes the negotiation began twenty minutes later i needed a refill on my coke and we knew what we wanted the waiter returned pen poised hopeful id won on the appetizer so we werent having one id given up the salad and let him have the soup potatoleek soup hey it wasnt a hardship we both wanted the steak the petite cut i told the waiter how would you like that prepared half welldone half rare the waiter blinked at me excuse me madam its an eightounce cut right he nodded cut it in half and cook four ounces of it welldone and four ounces of it rare he frowned at me i dont think we can do that at these prices you should bring the cow out and have a ritual sacrifice at the table just do it i handed him the menu he took it still frowning he turned to jeanclaude and you sir jeanclaude gave a small smile i will not be ordering food tonight would you like wine with dinner then sir he never missed a beat i do not drinkwine i coughed coke all over the tablecloth the waiter did everything but give me the heimlich jeanclaude laughed until tears trailed from the corners of his eyes you couldnt really tell it in this light but i knew that the tears were tinged red knew that there would be pinkish stains on the linen napkin when he was done dabbing his eyes the waiter fled without having gotten the joke staring across the table at the smiling vampire i wondered if i got the joke or was the butt of the joke there were nights when i wasnt sure which way the grave dirt crumbled but when he put his hand out to me across the table i took it definitely the butt of the joke dessert was raspberrychocolate cheesecake a triple threat to any diet plan truthfully i preferred my cheesecake straight fruit except for strawberries and chocolate just muddied the pure cream cheese taste but jeanclaude liked it and dessert took the place of the wine id refused to order with dinner i hated the taste of alcohol so jeanclaudes choice of dessert besides the restaurant did not serve plain cheesecake not artistic enough i guess i ate all the cheesecake chased the last chocolate curl across the plate and pushed it away i was full jeanclaude had laid his arm across the tablecloth rested his cheek on his arm and closed his eyes swooning trying to savor every last taste he blinked at me as if coming out of a trance he spoke head still resting on his arm you have left some whipped cream ma petite im full i said it is real whipped cream it melts on the tongue and glides across the palate i shook my head i am done if i eat any more ill be sick he gave a longsuffering sigh and sat back up there are nights when i despair of you ma petite i smiled funny i think the same thing about you sometimes he nodded his head making a small bow touchй ma petite touchй he stared off past my shoulder and stiffened the smile didnt fade from his face it was wiped clean his face was its blank unreadable mask and i knew without turning around that someone was behind me someone he feared i managed to drop my napkin and picked it up with my left hand with my right hand i drew the firestar when i sat back up the gun was in my hand in my lap though shooting up demiches seemed like a bad idea but hey it wouldnt be the first bad idea id had i turned to see a couple walking towards us through the tables and crystal the woman looked tall until you got a glimpse of the heels she was wearing stiletto four inches id have broken my ankle trying to walk in them the dress was white square necked formfitting and more expensive than my entire outfit even if you threw in the gun her hair was a whiteblond so pale it matched the dress and the simple white mink stole curled around her shoulders the hair was piled in a mound atop her head with a sparkle of silver and the crystal fire of diamonds to frame the hair like a crown she was chalkwhite and despite the expert makeup i knew she hadnt fed yet tonight the man was human though there was a thrumming energy to him that made me want to take back the human part he was tanned that wonderful rich brown that olive skin can manage his hair was a luxuriant curling brown shaved short on the sides but done so it fell in curls near his eyes the eyes were pure brown and watched jeanclaude steadily joyously but it was a dark joy he was dressed in a white linen suit complete with silk tie they stopped at our table like i knew they would the mans handsome face was all for jeanclaude i might as well have not been there he had very strong features from high cheekbones to an almosthooked nose an inch either direction and his face would have been homely instead it was striking compelling handsome in an utterly masculine way jeanclaude stood hands loose at his side face beautiful and empty yvette it has been a long time she smiled wonderfully a very long time jeanclaude you remember balthasar she touched the mans arm and he obligingly slid it around her waist he planted a chaste kiss on her pale cheek he looked at me then for the first time it wasnt a look id ever gotten from a man if it had been a woman id have said she was jealous the vampires english was perfect her accent was pure french of course i remember him jeanclaude said time spent with balthasar was always memorable the man turned back to jeanclaude then but not memorable enough to keep you with us he too sounded french but there was an undercurrent of some other language it was like mixing blue and red and getting purple i am master of my own territory it is what everyone dreams of is it not some dream of a seat on the council yvette said her voice was still mildly amused but there was an undercurrent now like swimming in dark water when you know there are sharks i do not aspire to such lofty heights jeanclaude said really yvette said truly jeanclaude said she smiled but her eyes stayed distant and empty we shall see there is nothing to see yvette i am content where i am if that is so you have nothing to fear from us we have nothing to fear regardless i said i smiled when i said it both of them looked at me as if i was a dog that had done an interesting trick i was really beginning not to like either of them yvette and balthasar are envoys of the council ma petite bully for them i said she doesnt seem very impressed with us yvette said she turned fullface to me her eyes were greyishgreen with tiny flecks of amber dancing round the pupils i felt her try to suck me under with those eyes and it didnt work her power raised goose bumps on my skin but she couldnt capture me with her eyes she was powerful but she wasnt a master vampire i could feel her age like an ache in my skull a thousand years at least the last vamp id met who was that old had cleaned my clock but nikolaos had been master of the city and yvette would never be that if a vamp hadnt attained master status in a thousand years she or he was never going to a vamp gained power and abilities with age but there was a limit yvette had reached hers i stared into her eyes let her power tickle across my skin and wasnt impressed she frowned impressive thanks i said balthasar stepped around her and went to one knee in front of me he put one hand on the back of my chair and leaned into me if yvette wasnt a master then he wasnt her human servant only a master vampire could make a human servant which meant he belonged to someone else someone i hadnt met yet why did i get the feeling id be meeting that someone soon my master is a council member balthasar said you have no idea what kind of power he wields ask me if i care anger flared across his face darkening his eyes making his grip on my chair tight he laid his hand on my leg just above my knee and started to squeeze id played with the monsters long enough to know what supernatural strength feels like his fingers dug into my flesh and i knew he could keep squeezing until muscle popped and he bared my bones to the air i grabbed his silk tie and pulled him close and shoved the barrel of the firestar into his chest i watched the surprise chase across his face from inches away bet i can blow a hole in your chest before you can crush my leg you wouldnt dare why not i asked a touch of fear flowed through his eyes i am the human servant of a council member not impressed i said try door number two he frowned at me i dont understand give her a better reason not to kill you jeanclaude said if you shoot me here in front of witnesses you will go to jail i sighed there is that i jerked him close enough that our faces almost touched take your hand off my knee slowly and i wont pull this trigger keep hurting me and ill take my chances with the police he stared at me you would do it you really would do it i dont bluff balthasar remember that for future reference and maybe i wont have to kill you his hand eased then moved slowly away from me i let him move back his tie sliding through my hand like a fishing line i eased back in my chair the gun had never made it out from under the tablecloth wed been the soul of discretion the waiter came over anyway is there a problem no problem i said please bring our check jeanclaude said right away the waiter said he watched a little nervously while balthasar got to his feet balthasar smoothed down the wrinkles in his linen pants but theres only so much you can do with linen it really isnt meant to be knelt in you have won the first round jeanclaude be careful that it does not become a pyrrhic victory yvette said she and balthasar left without ever taking a table guess they werent hungry whats going on i asked jeanclaude sat back down yvette is a council toady balthasar is the human servant of one of the most powerful council members why are they here i believe it is because of mr oliver mr oliver had been the oldest vampire id ever met the oldest one id ever heard hinted at hed been a million years old no joke a million years give or take for all those with a head for prehistory yes that does mean he wasnt homo sapiens homo erectus and able to walk around during the day though i never saw him cross direct sunlight hed been the only vamp to ever fool me for even a few moments into thinking he was human which is nicely ironic since he wasnt human at all hed had a plan to take out jeanclaude take over the vamps in the area and force them to slaughter humans oliver had thought a slaughter like that would force the authorities to make vamps illegal again he thought vampires would spread too quickly with legal rights and take over the human race id sort of agreed with him his plan might have worked if i hadnt killed him how i managed to kill him is a long story but id ended up in a coma a week unconscious gone so close to death that the doctors didnt know how i survived of course they hadnt been too clear on why i was in a coma to begin with and no one felt like explaining vampire marks and homo erectus vampires i stared at jeanclaude the crazy son of bitch that tried to take you out last halloween oui what about him he was a council member i almost laughed no way he was old older than sin but he wasnt that powerful i told you he agreed to limit his powers ma petite i did not know who and what he was at first but he was the council member known as the earthmover excuse me he could cause the earth to shake by his power alone no way i said yes way ma petite he agreed not to cause the earth to swallow the city because it would be blamed on an earthquake he wanted the bloodletting to be blamed on vampires you remember his plan was to drive vampires back to being illegal an earthquake would not do that a bloodbath would no one not even you believes that a mere vampire can cause an earthquake damn straight i dont i stared at his careful face youre serious deadly serious ma petite it was too much to take in all at once when in doubt ignore and be terribly unimpressed so we took out a council member so what he shook his head there is no fear in you ma petite do you understand what danger we are all in no and what do you mean the danger we are all in who else is in danger besides us all our people he said define all i said all my vampires anyone that the council considers ours larry i asked he sighed perhaps should i call him warn him how much danger i am not sure no one has ever slain a council member and not taken their place i killed him not you you are my human servant the council sees all that you do as an extension of my actions i stared at him you mean anyone i kill is your kill he nodded i wasnt your servant when i killed oliver i would keep that bit of knowledge to ourselves why they may not kill me ma petite but a vampire hunter who killed a council member would be executed there would be no trial no hesitation even though im your human servant now that might save you it is one of our most stringent laws not to destroy anothers servant so they cant kill me because im your servant but they can harm you ma petite they can harm you so very much that you may wish for death you mean torture not in a traditional sense but they are masters at finding that which terrifies you most and using it against you they will use your desires against you and twist everything you are into a shape of their choosing ive met master vampires that could sense your hearts desire and use it against you everything you have seen of us before ma petite is like a distant dream the council is the reality they are the nightmare on which we are all based the thing that even we fear yvette and balthasar didnt seem that scary to me he looked at me there was no expression on his face it was a mask smooth pleasant hidden if they did not frighten you ma petite it is only because you do not know them yvette is a toady of the council because they are powerful enough to give her a ready supply of victims victims you arent talking about human prey are you it can be human but yvette is considered perverted even by other vampires i wasnt sure i wanted to know but perverted in what ways he sighed and looked down at his hands they lay very still on the tablecloth it was like he was pulling away from me i could see the walls clicking back into place he was rebuilding himself into jeanclaude master of the city it was a shock to realize that there had been a change it had been so gradual that i hadnt realized that with me on our dates he was different i dont know if he was more himself or more what he thought i wanted him to be but he was more relaxed less guarded watching him put on his public face while i sat across from him was almost depressing yvette loves the dead i frowned at him but shes a vampire thats redundant he stared at me and it wasnt a friendly look i will not sit here and debate with you ma petite you share my bed if i were a zombie you would not touch me thats true it took me a handful of seconds to understand what hed just said are you telling me that yvette likes to have sex with zombies real rotting corpses among other things yes i couldnt keep the disgust off my face good lord thats words failed me then i found a word shes a necrophiliac she will use a dead body if nothing else is available but her true joy is the rotted animated corpse she would find your talent most appealing ma petite you could raise her an unending stream of partners i wouldnt raise the dead for her amusement not initially he said no not under any circumstances the council has a way of finding circumstances that can force you to do almost anything i watched his face and wished i could read it but i understood he was hiding from them already how deep is the hole were in deep enough to bury us all if the council chooses maybe i shouldnt have put the gun up i said perhaps not he said the check came we paid we left i made a stop at the ladies room on the way out and retrieved the gun jeanclaude took my car keys so i wouldnt have to handle anything but the gun it was a short walk from bathroom to door black gun against a black dress either no one noticed or no one wanted to get involved what else was new the parking lot was a dark expanse of shining blackness with pools of light spotlighting gleaming cars jaguars volvos and mercedes were the dominant species in the lot i caught a glimpse of my jeep at the far end of a line i lost sight of it as we walked between the cars jeanclaude held my car keys cupped in his hand so they didnt rattle as he moved we werent holding hands or anything else now i had the firestar in a twohanded grip pointed at the ground but ready i was scanning the parking lot my eyes flicking back and forth i wasnt coy about it a cop would have known what i was doing from yards away i was searching for danger searching for targets i felt both silly and nervous the skin across my bare shoulders was trying to crawl down my spine it was silly but id have felt better in jeans and a shirt more secure i dont think theyre out here i said softly im sure you are right ma petite yvette and balthasar have delivered their message and run back to their masters i glanced at him before turning my attention back to the parking lot then why am i in combat mode because the council travels with an entourage we have not seen the last of them tonight ma petite of that i can promise you great we came around the last cars between us and my jeep there was a man leaning against the jeep the firestar was just suddenly pointing at him no thinking just paranoiaoh sorry caution jeanclaude froze beside me utterly motionless the old vampires can do thatjust seem to stop stop breathing stop moving stop everything as if if you looked away they might just disappear the man leaned on the back of my jeep in profile he was in the middle of lighting a cigarette youd have thought he hadnt seen us but i knew better i was pointing a gun at him he knew we were there the match flared showing one of the most perfect profiles id ever seen his hair shone golden in the light shoulderlength thick waves to frame his face he tossed the match to the pavement with a practiced flick of his hand he took the cigarette from his mouth and raised his face skyward the street light played along his face and golden hair he blew three perfect smoke rings and laughed that laugh trailed down my spine as if hed touched me it made me shiver and i wondered how the hell id thought he was human asher jeanclaude said that one word was spoken without emotion empty of meaning but it was all i could do not to look at jeanclaudes face i knew who asher was but only by reputation asher and his human servant julianna had traveled with jeanclaude across europe for a couple of decades theyd been a mйnage а trois the closest thing jeanclaude had had to a family since he became a vampire jeanclaude had been called away to his dying mothers bedside asher and julianna had been taken by the church read witchhunters asher turned and gave us his right profile the street light that had caressed the perfection of his left side seemed harsh now the right side of his face looked like melted candle wax burn scars acid scars holy water vampires couldnt heal damage done by holy objects the priests had had a theory that they could burn the devil out of asher one drop of holy water at a time i kept the gun on him solid no wavering id seen worse recently id seen a vampire whose face had rotted away on one side an eye had been rolling in a bare socket compared to that asher was a gq cover boy the thing that made the scarring worse somehow was that the rest of him was so perfect it made it worse somehow more obscene theyd left his eyes pure and the midline of his face so his nose the fullness of his mouth sat in a sea of scars jeanclaude had saved him before the zealots killed him but julianna had been burned as a witch asher never forgave jeanclaude for the death of the woman they both loved in fact last id heard he was asking for my death he would kill jeanclaudes human servant as revenge the council had refused him up until now step away from the jeep slowly i said would you shoot me for leaning against your car he sounded amused pleasant the tone in his voice the way he chose his words reminded me of jeanclaude when id first met him asher pushed to his feet using just his body he blew a smoke ring at me and laughed again the sound slithered across my skin like the touch of fur soft and feelingoh so slightlyof death it was jeanclaudes laugh and that was unnerving as hell jeanclaude took a deep shuddering breath and stepped forward he didnt block my line of sight though and he didnt tell me to put the gun down why are you here asher his voice held something id seldom heard regret is she going to shoot me ask her yourself i am not the one holding the gun so it is true you do not control your own servant the best human servants are those that come willingly to your hand you taught me that asher you and julianna asher threw the cigarette on the ground he took two quick steps forward dont i said his hands were balled into fists at his side his anger rode the night like close lightning never never say her name again you dont deserve to speak her name jeanclaude gave a shallow bow as you wish now what do you want asher anita will grow impatient soon asher stared at me he looked at me from head to toe but it wasnt sexual though that was in there it was like he was looking me over like i was a car he was thinking of buying his eyes were a strange shade of pale blue would you really shoot me he turned his head so that i couldnt see the scars he knew exactly how the shadows would fall he gave a smile that was supposed to melt me into my socks it didnt work cut the charm and give me a reason not to kill you he turned his head so that a sheet of golden hair spilled over the right side of his face if my night vision had been worse it might have hidden the scars the council extends their invitation to jeanclaude master of the city of st louis and his human servant anita blake they request your presence this night you may put up the gun ma petite we are safe until we see the council just like that i said last i heard asher here wanted to kill me the council refused his request jeanclaude said our human servants are too precious to us for them to agree very true asher said the two vampires stared at each other i expected them to try vampiric powers on each other but they didnt they just stood there looking at one another their faces gave nothing away but if theyd been people and not monsters id have told them to hug and make up you could feel their pain on the air i realized something i hadnt before they had loved each other once only love can turn to such bitter regret julianna had been their link but it hadnt just been her they loved it was time to put the gun up but irritatingly id have to flash the parking lot i was really going to have to invest in more dressy pants suits dresses just sucked for concealed carry there was no one else but the three of us in the parking lot i turned my back on both of them and raised the dress enough to put up the gun please dont be modest on my account asher said i smoothed the dress into place before i turned around dont flatter yourself he smiled and the look on his face was amused condescending and something else that something else bothered me modest were you also chaste before our dashing jeanclaude found you thats enough asher jeanclaude said she was a virgin before you he made it a question and then threw his head back and laughed he laughed until he had to lean against the jeep to steady himself you wasted on a virgin it is simply too perfect i wasnt a virgin not that its any of your damn business the laughter stopped so abruptly it was startling he slid down to the ground sitting on the dark pavement he stared up at me through a curtain of golden hair his eyes looked strange and pale not virginal but chaste ive had enough games for one night i said the games are just beginning he said whats that supposed to mean i asked it means ma petite that the council await us they will have many games for us to play none of them pleasant asher rose to his feet like hed been pulled by strings he stood brushing himself off he settled his black overcoat more solidly into place it was hot for a long coat not that he would necessarily care but it was odd vamps usually tried to blend in better than that made me wonder what was underneath the coat you could hide a pretty big gun under an anklelength coat id never met a vampire that carried a gun but there was always a first time jeanclaude had said we were safe until we reached the council but that didnt mean asher couldnt pull a weapon then and blow us away it had been beyond careless to put up my gun without patting asher down first i sighed what is wrong ma petite asher was a vampire how much more dangerous could he be with a gun but i couldnt do it let me test my understanding is asher going to ride in the car with us to the meeting i must to give you directions asher said then lean against the jeep he frowned at me in an amused condescending sort of way excuse me i dont care if youre the second coming of the antichrist you cant sit behind me in my own car until i know youre not carrying a weapon ma petite he is a vampire if he is sitting behind you in a car he is close enough to kill you without a gun i shook my head youre right i know youre right but the point isnt logic jeanclaude the point is that i simply cant let him in the car behind me without knowing whats under the coat i just cant it was true paranoid but still true jeanclaude knew me better than to argue very well ma petite asher would you be so kind as to face towards the jeep asher smiled brilliantly at both of us flashing fang you want to pat me down i could rip you into pieces with my bare hands and youre worried i have a gun he chuckled a low skinprickling sound that is so very cute cute me just do it please he turned to face the jeep still laughing softly hands on the hood feet apart i got out the gun one more time maybe i should just carry it on a chain around my neck i pressed the barrel into his spine i felt him stiffen under my hands you are serious about this absolutely i said feet further apart he shifted but it wasnt enough i kicked his feet apart until his balance was offcenter and started searching him onehanded dominant very dominant does she like to be on top i ignored him more surprising so did jeanclaude slower slower hasnt jeanclaude taught you not to rush he drew in a breath at the appropriate moment oooh thats nice yes it was embarrassing but i searched him top to bottom there wasnt a damn thing to find but i felt better i stepped back until i was out of reach and put the gun up he was watching over his shoulder do the panties match the bra i shook my head you can stand up now he stayed against the car dont you need to stripsearch me in your dreams i said he stood smoothing his coat back into place you have no idea what i dream anita i couldnt read the look on his face but the look was enough i didnt want to know what asher saw when he closed his eyes at the break of day shall we go jeanclaude said are you so eager to throw your life away asher asked the anger returned with a rush chasing out the amused teasing gallant the council will not kill me tonight jeanclaude said are you so sure it is their own laws that have forbidden those of us in the united states to fight amongst ourselves until the law has passed or failed to pass in washington the council wants us to remain legal in this country if they break their own rules no one else will obey them asher turned full face into the light there are worse things than death jeanclaude jeanclaude sighed i did not desert you asher what can i say to convince you of the truth you can taste the truth in my words i came to you as soon as i knew you have had centuries to convince yourself of what you want the truth to be jeanclaude wanting it to be true doesnt make it so so be it asher but i would undo whatever you think i have done if i could i would bring her back if i could asher held up his hand as if he could push the thought away no no no you killed her you let her die you let her burn to death i felt her die jeanclaude i was her master she was so afraid to the last she thought you would come save her i was her master and i know that her last words were your name jeanclaude turned his back on asher the other vampire closed the distance between them in two striding steps he grabbed jeanclaudes arm and swung him around the street light showed tears on jeanclaudes face he was crying for a woman who had been dead over two hundred years it was a long time for tears you never told me that before jeanclaude said softly asher pushed him away hard enough that he stumbled save your tears jeanclaude youll need them for yourself and for her theyve promised me my revenge jeanclaude touched the back of his hand to the tears you cant kill her they wont allow that asher smiled and it was most unpleasant i dont want her life jeanclaude i want your pain he walked around me circling like a shark i moved with him and knew he was too close if he rushed me id never get the gun out in time youve finally given me what i need to hurt you jeanclaude you love someone else at last love is never free jeanclaude it is the most expensive emotion we have and i am going to see that you pay in full he stood in front of jeanclaude hands in fists by his side he was trembling with the effort not to strike out jeanclaude had stopped crying but i wasnt sure hed fight back in that moment i realized he didnt want to hurt asher guilt is a many splendored thing problem was asher wanted to hurt him i stepped between them i took a step forward asher was either going to have to step back or wed be touching he stepped back staring down at me as if id just appeared hed forgotten me for just a second love isnt the most expensive emotion asher i said i took another step forward and he retreated another step hate is because hate will eat you up inside and destroy you long before it kills you very philosophical he said philosophys great i said but remember this dont ever threaten us again because if you do ill kill you because i dont give a fuck about your tortured past now shall we go asher stared at me for a few heartbeats by all means i cannot wait to introduce you to the council he meant it to be ominous and it was i didnt want to go and meet the bogeymen of vampirekind but we were going one thing id learned about master vampires you can run but not far enough you can even hide but not forever eventually they catch you and master vampires dont like to be kept waiting i drove asher gave directions he also hung on the back of the seat i didnt ask him to buckle up for safety jeanclaude sat in the passenger seat next to me silent not looking at asher or me somethings wrong jeanclaude said i glanced at him you mean besides the council coming to town he shook his head cant you feel it i dont feel anything that is the problem he turned as far as the seat belt would let him and met ashers eyes what is happening to my people asher sat so his face showed perfectly in the rearview mirror as if he wanted me to see him he smiled his whole face moved when he smiled the scarred skin had muscles underneath everything seemed to work just fine except for the scars the look on his face was smug selfsatisfied the kind of joy that cats get from tormenting mice i do not know what is happening to them but you should you areafter allmaster of the city whats going on jeanclaude what else is wrong i asked i should be able to feel my people ma petite if i concentrate it is like background noise i can feel the ebb and flow of them in extreme duress i can feel their pain their fear now i am concentrating and it is like a blank wall balthasars master has kept you from hearing the cries of your vampires asher said jeanclaudes hand lashed out in a blur of speed that was almost magical he grabbed ashers coat collar twisting it into a choking ring ihavedonenothingwrong they have no right to harm my people asher didnt try to get away he just stared at him there is an empty seat on the council for the first time in over four thousand years whoever empties that seat takes that seat that is the law of succession jeanclaude released asher slowly i dont want it you shouldnt have killed the earthmover then he would have killed us i said councils privilege asher said thats ridiculous i said youre saying because we didnt roll over and die were going to be killed now no one has come here planning to kill anyone asher said believe me that was my vote but i was the minority the council just wants to make sure that jeanclaude isnt trying to set up his own little council jeanclaude and i both looked at him i had to swing my attention back to the road before i was ready to stop being astonished you are babbling asher jeanclaude said not everyone is happy with the current councils rules some say they are oldfashioned people have been saying that for four hundred years jeanclaude said yes but until now there was no alternative some see your refusal of the council seat as a blow for a new order you know why i did not take it asher laughed a low roll that played along my skin whatever do you mean jeanclaude i am not powerful enough to hold a council seat the first challenger would sense that and kill me then they would have my council seat i would be a stalkinghorse yet you killed a council member how did you manage that jeanclaude he leaned on the back of my seat i could feel him he picked up a curl of my hair and i jerked my head away where the hell are we going you were supposed to give directions i said there is no need for directions jeanclaude said they have taken the circus what i stared at him and the only thing that kept the jeep from swerving was luck what did you say dont you understand yet the traveler balthasars master blocked my powers and the powers of my vampires and kept them from reaching out to me your wolves you should have felt something from your wolves theyre your animal to call i said jeanclaude turned to asher only one vampire could have kept my wolves from calling out for help the master of beasts asher rested his chin on the back of my seat i felt him nod get off my seat i said he raised his head but didnt really move back they must think me powerful indeed to send two council masters jeanclaude said asher made a harsh sound only you jeanclaude would be arrogant enough to believe that two council masters came to this country just for you if not to teach me a lesson then why are they here jeanclaude asked our dark queen wished to know how this legality is working for the vampires in the states we have traveled from boston to new orleans to san francisco she chose what cities we would visit and in what order our dark queen left st louis and you for last why would she do that jeanclaude asked the queen of nightmares can do anything she likes asher said she says go to boston we go if she said walk out into the sunlight would you do it i asked i glanced at him he was close enough that turning my head was enough no mirror needed his face was blank and beautiful empty perhaps he said i turned back to the road youre crazy youre all crazy too true asher said he sniffed my hair stop that you smell of power anita blake you reek of the dead he traced his fingers along my neck i swerved the jeep purposefully sending him sliding around the back seat dont touch me the council thought we would find you stuffed with power bloated with newfound abilities yet you seem much the same but she is different she is new and there is that werewolf yes that ulfric richard zeeman you have him bound to you as well asher pulled himself back up to the seats though not so close to me it is your servants who have the power not you is padma anything without his animals jeanclaude asked very true though i might not say so in front of him he leaned on the back of the seats again not touching me this time so you admit it is your servants who have given you the power to take a council member my human servant and my wolf are merely extensions of my power their hands are my hands their deeds my deeds that is council law so what does it matter where my power comes from quoting council law jeanclaude you have grown cautious since last we met caution has served me well asher but have you had any fun it was a strange question coming from someone who was supposed to hate jeanclaude some and you asher how fares it with you are you still serving the council or did you come along on this mission to torment me yes to both questions why have you not fled the council many aspire to serve them asher said you didnt perhaps revenge has changed my aspirations jeanclaude laid his hand on ashers arm ma petiteis right hatred is a cold fire and it gives no warmth asher jerked back sliding as far back as the seat would let him i glanced in my rearview mirror he was huddled in the dark hugging himself when i see you weep for your beloved i will have all the warmth i need well be at the circus soon i said whats the plan i am not sure there is a plan we must assume they have all our people in thrall so it will be only what the two of us can do alone are we going to try and take the circus back or what asher laughed is she serious always jeanclaude said fine what are we supposed to do survive if you can asher said shut up i said this is what i need to know jeanclaude do we go in there kicking butt or crawling would you crawl to them ma petite they have willie jason and who knows how many others so yeah if it would keep them safe id do a little crawling i do not think you would be very good at it jeanclaude said im not but no no crawling tonight we are not strong enough to retake the circus but we go in as you say kicking butt dominant i made it a question oui how dominant be aggressive but not foolish you may wound anyone you are capable of hurting but do not kill we do not want to give them an excuse they think youve started a revolution jeanclaude asher said from the darkness like all revolutionaries dead you become a martyr they dont want you dead jeanclaude turned so he could see the other vampire then what do they want asher tell me they have to make an example of you surely you see that if i had planned on forging a second council in america yes i would see their point but i know my limitations i cannot hold a council seat against all comers it would be a death sentence i want simply to be left alone asher sighed it is too late for that jeanclaude the council is here and they will not believe your protestations of innocence you believe him i said he was quiet for a few seconds then said yes i believe him the one thing jeanclaude has always done well is survive challenging the council is not a good way to do that asher slid forward against the seats putting his face very near mine remember anita that all those years ago he waited to save me waited until he knew he wouldnt be caught waited until he could save me at the least risk to himself waited until julianna was dead because it was too great a risk to take that is not true jeanclaude said asher ignored him be careful that he does not wait to save you i dont wait around for anybody to save me i said jeanclaude stared out the window at the passing cars he was shaking his head gently back and forth back and forth i tire of you already asher you tire of me because i speak the truth jeanclaude turned and faced him no i tire of you because you remind me of her and that once a very long time ago i was almost happy the two vampires stared at each other but now you have a second chance asher said you could have a second chance too asher if you would only let the past go the past is all i have and that is not my fault jeanclaude said asher slid back into the darkness huddling against the seat i thought jeanclaude had won the argument for now but just call it a feeling i didnt think the fight was over the circus of the damned is in a converted warehouse from the front it looks like a carnival with posters promoting the freak show and dancing clowns twirling on top of the glowing sign from the back its just dark i pulled the jeep into the small parking lot reserved for employees it was small because most of the help lived at the circus no need for a car if you never left here was hoping wed be needing our car i turned off the engine and silence swirled into the car both vampires had sunk into that utter stillness that made me have to glance at them to make sure they were still there mammals can freeze but a rabbit frozen waiting for the fox to pass is a vibrating thing it breathes fast and faster its heart pounds vampires are more like snakes a snake will put a length of its body out then freeze there is no sense of movement stopped no sense that movement will continue in that moment of frozen time a snake seems unreal more like a work of art something carved rather than something alive jeanclaude seemed to have fallen into a well of silence where movement even breath was forbidden i glanced back at asher he sat in the back seat utterly still a perfect golden presence but not alive the silence filled the jeep like icy water i wanted to clap my hands yell anything to make noise to startle them into being again but i knew better all id get would be a blink and a look a look that wasnt human and maybe never had been the sound of my dress against the upholstery was loud will they pat me down for weapons my voice seemed flat in the charged silence jeanclaude blinked gracefully then turned his neck to look at me the look was peaceful rather than empty i had begun to wonder if the stillness was a form of meditation for the vampires maybe if we lived through the night id ask this is a challenge ma petite they will let us be dangerous though i would not flaunt your weaponry your little gun is fine i shook my head i was thinking of more he raised his eyebrows more i turned to look at asher he blinked and raised his eyes to me i hit the dome light and saw his eyes true color for the first time they were blue but that didnt do them justice they were as pale a blue as jeanclaudes were a dark blue pale cold blue the startling color of a huskys eyes but it wasnt just the eyes it was the hair it had looked golden but the normal gold of a dark blond in the truer light of the car i realized it wasnt just illusion and dim light it was gold his hair was the truest gold id ever seen outside of a bottle or a can of metallic paint the combination of hair and eyes was amazing even without the scars he wouldnt have looked real i glanced from one vampire to the other jeanclaude was the more beautiful and it wasnt the scars asher was just a trace more handsome than he was pretty the same vamp made you both right i asked jeanclaude nodded asher just stared at me whered she go i asked unnaturallybeautifulstudsrus asher let out a harsh bark of laughter he dragged his fingers down the scarred side of his face making the skin stretch drawing it away from his eye so you could see the pale inner flesh of the eye socket he emphasized everything into a kind of hideous mask do you think i am beautiful anita he released the skin and it snapped back into place resilient perfect in its own way i looked at him what do you want me to say asher i want you to be terrified i want to see on your face what ive seen on every face for the last two hundred yearsdisgust derision horror sorry i said he leaned into the seats showing the scars to the light he seemed to have an innate sense of what any light would do to the wounds to know just how the shadows would fall years of practice i guess i just looked at him i met his pale perfect eyes gazed on the thick waves of golden hair the fullness of his lips i shrugged what can i say im a hair and eye person and you have great hair and amazing eyes asher threw himself back into his seat he gazed at us both and there was such rage in his eyes such horrible rage that it scared me there he said there youre afraid of me i can see it smell it taste it he smiled pleased with himself triumphant somehow tell him what you fear ma petite i glanced at jeanclaude then back at asher its not the scars asher its your hatred thats frightening he leaned forward and i think without meaning to his hair spilled around his face camouflaging him it had the look of long habit long comfort yes my hatred is frightening terrifying and remember anita blake that the hatred is all for you and your master i knew he meant jeanclaude and i couldnt argue with the title anymore though sometimes i wanted to hatred makes us all ugly i said he hissed at me and there was nothing human in the gesture i gave him a bored look come off it asher been there done that if you want to play bigbadvampire get in line he stripped his overcoat off in an abrupt violent movement a brown tweed suit jacket ended up crumpled on the seat he turned his head so i could see that the scars marched down his neck into the collar of his white dress shirt he started unbuttoning the shirt i glanced at jeanclaude his face was impassive unhelpful i was on my own so what else was new not that i dont appreciate the offer but i dont usually let a man strip down on the first date he snarled at me he bared his chest to the light shirt still carefully tucked into his pants the scars dribbled down his flesh like someone had drawn a dividing line down the center of his body one half pale and perfect the other half monstrous theyd been more careful of his face and neck they had not been careful of his chest the scars cut deep runnels the skin so melted that it didnt even look real anymore the scars flowed down his stomach into the belted top of his pants i stared because thats what he wanted me to do when i could finally meet his eyes i had no words left id had holy water poured on a vampire bite before cleansed they called it torture was another word for it id crawled and cursed and vomited i couldnt imagine the pain hed survived his eyes were wide and fierce and fearful the scars go all the way down he said that left a trail of visuals that id been trying to avoid i thought of a lot of things to say wow but it seemed too junior high school and cruel sorry was totally inadequate i spread my hands wide kneeling on the seat looking at him i asked you once before asher what do you want me to say he pushed himself as far away from me as he could back against the jeeps door why doesnt she look away why doesnt she hate me why isnt she disgusted with this body like he was disgusted it hung unsaid on the air but it was there in his eyes in the way he held himself unspoken the words hung in the air with the weight and push of thunder he yelled why dont i see in her eyes what i see in everyones eyes you do not see horror in my eyes mon ami jeanclaude said no asher said i see worse i see pity he opened the car door without turning around i would have said he fell out of the car but that isnt true he floated upward before he could touch the ground there was a backwash of wind that swept over me like a storm and he was gone we sat in silence for a few seconds both of us staring at the open door finally i had to fill the silence my people do come and go quickly here jeanclaude didnt get the movie reference richard would have gotten it he liked the wizard of oz jeanclaude answered me seriously asher always was very good at flying someone chuckled the sound made me reach for the firestar the voice was familiar but the tone was new arrogant profoundly arrogant silver bullets wont kill me anymore anita my new master has promised me that liv appeared in the open car door peering in at us muscular arms propped on the sides of the door she smiled broadly enough to flash fangs when you pass the fivehundred mark like liv you only flash fangs when you want to she was grinning like the cheshire cat very pleased about something she wore a black sports bra and highcut jogging shorts so that all that bodybuilding muscle gleamed in the street lights she was one of the vamps that jeanclaude had invited into his territory recently she was supposed to be one of his vampire lieutenants what canary did you eat i asked she frowned at me what the cat that ate the canary i said she continued to frown livs english is perfect no accent of any kind sometimes i forget that its not her first language a lot of the vamps have lost their original accents but they still dont understand all the slang but hey i bet liv knew some slavic slang that id never heard anna is asking why you are so pleased with yourself jeanclaude said but i think i already know the answer i glanced at him then back at liv i had the firestar out but not pointed she was supposed to be on our side i was getting the feeling that might have changed did liv say her new master i asked she did jeanclaude said i raised the gun and pointed it at her she laughed it was unnerving she crawled into the back seat still laughing very unnerving liv may have been six hundred years old and some change but she wasnt powerful certainly not powerful enough to laugh off silver ammo you know ill shoot you liv so whats the joke can you not feel it ma petite the difference in her i steadied my hand on the back of the seat gun pointed at her impressive chest i was less than two feet from her at this distance the bullet would take out her heart she wasnt worried she should have been i concentrated on liv tried to roll her power in my mind id done her before knew what she felt like in my head or thought i did her power beat along my skull hummed down my bones i could feel her power like a thrumming note so deep and low it was almost painful i took a deep breath and let it out slowly i kept the gun pointed at her if i pull this trigger liv even with the boost in power youll die liv looked at jeanclaude it was a long selfsatisfied look you know i wont die jeanclaude only the traveler could make such an extravagant promise and hope to keep it jeanclaude said you are a little too feminine for his tastes unless he has changed her face was disdainful he is above such petty desires he offered me only power and i accepted jeanclaude shook his head if you truly believe the traveler above the desires of the body then he has been very careful around you liv he is not like the others she said jeanclaude sighed on that i will not argue liv but be careful that his power does not become addictive you seek to frighten me but it will not work jeanclaude his power is like nothing i have ever felt before and he can share it i can be what i was meant to be he can fill you to bursting with his power liv it will not make you a master if he has promised you that then he has lied to you she hissed at him you would say anything to save yourself tonight he shrugged perhaps i thought liv took an oath of loyalty to you i said oui then whats going on the council will be very careful to observe the rules ma petite the circus is a public business thus the council might have crossed the threshold uninvited instead they found someone to invite them inside i stared at the smirking vamp in the back of my jeep she betrayed us yes he said softly he touched my shoulder do not kill her ma petite the bullet would enter but the traveler would not allow her death you would simply waste a bullet i shook my head she betrayed you all of you if they could not have bribed someone they would have tortured someone else into betraying us i much prefer this method he said i stared down the barrel of the gun at livs smiling face i could have pulled the trigger and not worried about it shed done all the damage she could do it wasnt like id be killing her to save us i didnt want or not want to pull the trigger i simply thought she deserved to die for betraying us not anger or even outrage just good business it was a bad precedent to allow anyone to betray you and survive it set a bad example i realized with an almost physical jolt that killing her meant nothing to me just good business sweet jesus i put up the gun i didnt want to kill anyone that coldly killing didnt bother me but it should mean something liv leaned back in the seat grinning pleased id seen the futility of shooting her if she only realized why i hadnt done it she might still have been scared of me but she was hiding behind the power of this traveler confident that it was shield enough against anything if she pissed me off enough tonight maybe wed test the theory i shook my head if i was going to meet the bogeymen of vampirekind i needed more weapons i had my wrist sheaths complete with silver knives in the glove compartment i often carried them in the jeep when i wore something i couldnt wear them with like the dress never knew when youd need a good knife ill tell them about any weapons i see she said i finished buckling the knives in place yvette and balthasar know i have the gun im not trying to be subtle here just prepared i opened the door and stepped out i scanned the darkness for more company though the really old ones could hide almost in plain sight some vampires had chameleons beat all to hell when it came to blending with their surroundings id seen one that could wrap himself in shadows then fling them aside like a cloak it had been impressive liv scooted out of the car to stand near me shed lifted a few too many weights to cross her arms comfortably but she was trying trying for that nonchalant bodyguard look she was six feet tall and built like a brick outhouse she didnt have to try hard to look intimidating jeanclaude got out of the car on my side putting himself between the two of us i wasnt sure who he was protecting her or me he had ashers long coat in his arms i suggest ma petite that you wear this to cover the weapons ill tell them about the knives liv said if the weapons are in plain sight it is more of a challenge jeanclaude said someone might feel compelled to take them from you they can try i said jeanclaude handed me the coat draped across his arms please ma petite i took it from him he didnt say please often i slipped the black coat on i was reminded of two things one it was too damn hot to wear a coat two asher was six foot or more the coat was huge i started rolling up the sleeves anita liv said i glanced at her she looked serious now her strong nordic face blank and unreadable look into my eyes i shook my head what do you guys do sit around watching old dracula movies and stealing the dialogue liv took a threatening step forward i just stared up at her save the bigbadvampire routine liv weve done this and you cant roll me with your eyes ma petite jeanclaude said do as she asks i frowned at him why suspicious who me because if the travelers extra power can bespell you through livs eyes it would be better to know here in relative safety than inside among our greater foes he had a point but i didnt like it i shrugged fine i stared at her face into her blue eyes though the color was a little washed out from the street light liv turned a spill of yellow light from the open car door hit her eyes and made them that amazing violetblue almost purple her eyes were her best feature and id never had any trouble meeting that flowerpetal gaze i still could not even a twinge livs hands balled into fists she spoke but i didnt think she was talking to either of us you promised me promised me enough power to roll her mind there was a rush of wind cold enough to make me shiver and huddle into the long coat liv laughed a loud bray of sound she raised her arms to the cold wind as if it were wrapping her around like drapes in the breeze the cold wind raised the hairs on the back of my neck but it wasnt the temperature it was the power in it now liv said look into my eyes if you dare little better on the dialogue i said are you afraid to meet my gaze executioner the cold wind that had come from nowhere died then faded a last icy caress i waited until the summer heat slid over me like plastic wrap waited until sweat trailed down my spine then i looked up once upon a time id avoided looking any vamp in the eyes id had some natural immunity but even the lesser vamps were dangerous their gaze was one trick that almost all of them had to a lesser or greater extent my powers had grown and the vampire marks had cinched it i was pretty much immune to vampire gaze so why was i afraid now i met livs violet gaze solid no flinching at first there was nothing but their extraordinary color a tension went out of me my shoulders loosened they were just eyes then it was as if the violet of her eyes was water and i was something that skated over the surface tension until something rose from her eyes and pulled me down always before it had been like falling but now something had me something dark and strong it sucked me under like water under ice i screamed and lashed out lashed out against that cold film of ice reached for a surface that wasnt physical wasnt even metaphorical but i fought to rise fought against the pull of that darkness i came to myself kneeling on the parking lot with jeanclaudes hand grasped in mine ma petite ma petite are you all right i just shook my head i didnt trust my voice yet id forgotten how much i hated being rolled by their gaze forgotten how helpless i felt my own power was making me careless around the damn things liv leaned against the side of the jeep she seemed tired too i almost had you i found my voice you didnt have anything it wasnt your eyes i was being sucked into it was his she shook her head he promised me the power to do you anita to take your mind i let jeanclaude help me to my feet which tells you how shaky i was feeling then he lied liv its not your power its his you fear me now she said i can feel your fear in my head i nodded yeah im scared if that makes you happy then laugh it up i started backing away from her more weapons i needed more weapons it does make me happy she said youll never know how happy it makes me his power has left you liv jeanclaude said it will return she said i was on the other side of the jeep i was headed for the back of it but i didnt want to be within touching range of liv right this second id broken free but i didnt want to keep pushing my luck the power may return liv but anita has broken his bond with you she has pushed his power aside no liv said he has chosen to let her go jeanclaude laughed and it chased along my body and i knew that liv felt it too the traveler would have kept ma petite if he could have held her but he could not she is too big a fish even for his net liar liv said i left liv and jeanclaude to argue between themselves id broken free of the travelers power but it hadnt been pretty or easy though come to think of it as soon as i started to struggle it had broken the sad truth was i hadnt tried to shield myself id stared into livs eyes empty and waiting confident that she couldnt roll me it had been stupid noarrogant sometimes there isnt a whole lot of difference between the two i walked to the rear of the jeep i crawled in the cargo area edward assassin of the undead had persuaded me to let an acquaintance of his remodel my jeep the wheel well on one side was now a secret compartment inside was my extra browning and extra ammo id felt silly when hed talked me into it i didnt feel silly now i opened the compartment and found a surprise a miniuzi complete with shoulder strap there was a note taped to the gun you can never have too much firepower he hadnt signed it but it was edward hed started his career as a normal assassin but humans became too easy so he switched to monsters he did love a challenge i had another miniuzi at home it had been a gift from edward too he had the best toys i took off the coat and slid the uzis strap across my chest when i slipped the coat back on the uzi hung at my back not perfect but not too noticeable the second browning hipower was in the compartment too i put it in my pocket and two extra clips of ammo in the other pocket when i slid to the ground the coat hung funny but it was so big on me that it wasnt conspicuous the vampires werent arguing anymore liv leaned against the jeep looking sullen as if jeanclaude had had the last word or won the argument i stood watching her i wanted to shoot her not because shed betrayed us but because shed scared me not a good enough reason besides it had been my own carelessness that let her scare me i tried not to punish other people for my mistakes i cant let you go unpunished liv jeanclaude said the council would see it as a weakness she just looked at him hit me if it will make you feel better jeanclaude she pushed away from the jeep and crossed the distance between them with three long strides she lifted her chin like a bully daring you to take the first swing he shook his head no liv he touched her face gently i had something else in mind he caressed her face rubbing his hand along her cheek she sighed rubbing her face against his palm liv had been trying to get into jeanclaudes pants since she hit town shed never hidden her plan to sleep her way to the top shed been very frustrated that he wouldnt cooperate she laid a gentle kiss on his palm things could have been so different if it werent for your pet human i walked up behind them and it was like i wasnt there they were in some private place that just happened to be in plain sight no liv jeanclaude said it would not have been different it was not anita that kept you from my bed it was you his hand closed on her throat his fingers convulsed in her flesh he made a sharp movement and tore the front of her throat out liv collapsed to the pavement choking blood flowing in a crimson wash down her front out of her mouth she rolled onto her back hands clawing at her throat i came to stand beside him and stared down at her i caught a glimpse of her spine deep in the wound her eyes were wide painfilled frightened jeanclaude was wiping his hand off on a silk handkerchief hed pulled from somewhere hed flung the gobbets of flesh to the pavement where they lay looking small and not important enough to die over we both watched her writhing on the pavement jeanclaudes face was that empty mask he wore beautiful and distant like trying to draw comfort from the moon i didnt have a mirror and my face would never be his lovely perfection but it was just as empty i watched liv flop on the pavement and felt no pity no cold wind came to save her i think that surprised liv because she reached for jeanclaude reached for him begging with her eyes for him to help her he was motionless sunk into that great waiting stillness as if he was willing himself to vanish maybe it did bother him to watch her die if shed been human it would have been pretty fast but she wasnt human and it wasnt fast she wasnt dying i wasnt sure it was pity but i couldnt just stand there and watch anyone in such pain such terror i pulled the browning out of the coat pocket and pointed it at her head im going to end this she will heal ma petite it is a wound that her own vampire body will heal in time why isnt her new master helping her i asked because he knows she will heal without his aid no wasted energy huh something like that he said it was hard to tell through the blood but it did look as if the wound was filling in there was just so much to fill in we offer our throat or wrist or the bend of our elbow to each other as a formal greeting the lesser offer up their flesh to the greater as an acknowledgment of power it is a pretty thing a polite thing but this is the reality ma petite liv offered me her throat and i took it i stared into her wide wide eyes did she know this was a possibility if she did not then she is a fool such violence is never condoned unless the lesser vampire questions the authority of the greater vampire she questioned my dominance over her this is the price liv turned onto her side coughing her breath rattled in her throat in a painful gasp things were reforming she was breathing again when she had enough air to speak she said damn you jeanclaude then she coughed blood yummy jeanclaude held his hand out to me hed wiped it off but you never get the blood out from around the fingernails without soap and water i hesitated then took his hand wed get bloodier before the night was over it was almost guaranteed we walked towards the circus the coat billowed behind me like a cape the uzi bounced lightly against my back id added one extra thing from the glove compartment a long silver chain with a cross on it id gotten longer chains when i started dating jeanclaude the shorter ones spilled out of my clothing at awkward moments i was loaded for bear uh vampire and ready to go kill something edward would have been proud the side door of the circus has no handle the only way in is if someone opens the door security measures jeanclaude knocked and the door swung inward at his touch open waiting expecting us ominous the door opened into a small storage room with a bare light bulb hanging from the ceiling a stark room with a few boxes against one wall a door to the right led into the main part of the circus where people were usually riding the ferris wheel and eating cotton candy a smaller door led off to the left there were no bright lights and cotton candy in that direction the light swung back and forth as if someone had just hit it the naked bulb made the shadows thicker and the light dance until it was hard to tell shadow from light something glinted on the lefthand door something attached to its surface i didnt know what it was except it glinted dully in the strange light i shoved the door flat against the wall just to make sure no one was behind it then i put my back to the door and trained the browning on the room stop the bulb from swinging i said jeanclaude reached up and touched the bulb he had to stand on tiptoe to do it whoever had set it swinging was over six feet the room is empty ma petite jeanclaude said whats on the door it was flat and thin and my mind couldnt make a shape out of it whatever it was it was hammered to the door with silver nails jeanclaude let out a long sigh mon dieu i crossed the room with the browning pointed twohanded at the floor jeanclaude said the room was empty i trusted that but i trusted me more liv staggered to the door the front of her body was covered with blood but her throat was perfect i wondered if the traveler had helped her after we walked away she coughed and cleared her throat so violently it sounded painful i wanted to see your faces when you saw the master of beasts compromise she said the traveler refused to let him and his people greet you in person this is the master of beasts calling card how do you like it she sounded eager in a predatory unpleasant sort of way what the fuck was on the door even standing next to it i didnt know what it was thin rivulets of blood were seeping down the door from it the sweet metallic scent of blood warmed the stale air the thing was almost paper thin but had a consistency more like plastic it curled at the edges straining against the five silver nails i suddenly had an awful idea so awful my eyes couldnt see it even after id thought it i took three steps back from the thing and tried to see the silhouette there there two arms two legs shoulders it was a human skin once i found the shape of it i couldnt stop seeing it i knew that when i closed my eyes tonight that it would haunt me that thin stretched thing that used to be a person where are the hands and feet i asked my voice sounded strange distant almost unattached my lips and fingertips tingled with the pure horror of it it is merely the back of someones body not the entire skin ma petite besides it is hard to take the living skin off of fingers and toes when your victim is still struggling jeanclaude said his voice was utterly flat carefully empty struggling you mean whoever this was was alive you are the police expert ma petite it wouldnt be bleeding this much if they hadnt been alive i said yes ma petite he was right i did know that but the sight of a human skin nailed to a door had thrown me it was a first even for me sweet jesus do the silver nails mean the victim was vampire or lycanthrope most likely jeanclaude said does that mean theyre still alive he looked at me his look managed to be empty and eloquent all at the same time they were alive when the skin was removed if vampire or lycanthrope the mere removal of the skin would not be sufficient to kill them a shudder ran through me from head to feet it wasnt exactly fear it was horror horror at the casualness of it the callousness of it asher mentioned padma is he the beast master the master of beasts jeanclaude said you cannot kill him for this indiscretion ma petite youre wrong i said the horror was there like a coating of ice underneath my skin but over that was anger rage and under the rage was fear fear of anyone that would skin another person alive just to make a point told you something about a person told you how few rules they had told me in no uncertain terms that i should kill him as soon as i saw him we cannot punish them for this tonight ma petite tonight is about survival for all of us remember that and curb your anger i stared at the thing on the door i am way past anger then curb your rage we must save the rest of our people if theyre alive they were alive when i came upstairs to wait for you liv said whos skin is it i asked she laughed and it was her usual bray all healed all better guess she said if you guess right ill tell you but only if you guess right it took more control than was pretty not to point the browning at her i shook my head no games liv not with you the real games dont even begin until we get downstairs well said ma petite let us go down no liv said no youll guess youll guess who it is i want to see your face i want to see the pain in your eyes while you think about each of your friends anita i want to watch the horror on your face while you picture it happening to each of them what did i ever do to you liv you stood in my way she said i shook my head and pointed the gun at her three strikes and youre out liv she frowned what are you talking about betraying us was one trying to roll me with your eyes was number two that was partly my fault so i would have let it go but you took an oath to protect all of jeanclaudes people you swore to use that wonderful body that strength to protect those weaker than yourself whoever belongs to that skin was someone you swore to protect instead you betrayed them delivered them over to hell strike three liv you cant kill me anita the traveler will heal me no matter what you do i shot her in the right kneecap she fell to the floor holding the shattered leg writhing screaming i felt myself smile most unpleasant i hope it hurts liv i hope it hurts like hell the temperature in the room dropped like a stone it felt cold enough that i half expected to see my breath livs screams stopped and she stared up at me with her violet eyes if looks could have killed id have dropped on the spot you cannot harm me anita my master will not allow it liv got to her feet with the faintest of limps she walked to the door with its awful burden she stretched the edge of the thing showing holes in the skin that had nothing to do with the skinning process i fed on him while they tortured him i drank his blood while he screamed her fingers came away stained with blood she licked them clean sliding her fingers in and out of her mouth hmm tasty all i had to do was guess who it was and shed tell me all i had to do was play her game i shot her in the other knee she collapsed to the floor shrieking dont you understand you cant hurt me oh i think i can liv i think i can i shot the right knee again she lay on her back screaming grabbing at her shattered knees and recoiling because her own touch hurt the travelers power raised the hair on my body in a shiver of goose bumps he really was going to heal her if i wasnt going to kill her i needed to be somewhere else before she could walk i knew liv well enough to know that when she could stand she was going to be pissed not that i blamed her in fact if i just stood there long enough for her to get to her feet itd be selfdefense of course itd be premeditated selfdefense come ma petite let her be the traveler does not give his blessings so easily a second time or would this be the third he will heal her at his own pace now a blessing and a punishment rolled into one as most of the councils gifts are wont to be he opened the door that led downstairs his hand came away with blood on it he held the hand out in front of him like he didnt know what to do with it he finally walked through the door wiping his hand along the wall smearing the blood down the stones in a faint crimson line the longer we delay the more tortures they will think of with that comforting line he started down the steps i gave one last glance to liv she lay on her side crying shrieking she was shrieking that she was going to see me dead i should have shot her in the head until her brains leaked on the floor if i was truly ruthless i would have but i didnt i left her alive and screaming threats edward would have been so disappointed the steps leading underground were taller than normal as if whatever they were originally designed for wasnt quite human i kicked the door shut didnt want to touch the blood the door cut liv off in mid scream i could still hear her very faintly like the high buzzing of an insect but the door was almost soundproof needed something to muffle the screams from below of course tonight there was only silence on the stairs a silence so deep that it vibrated in my ears jeanclaude moved in a boneless grace like a big cat down the awkward steps i had to wrap the end of the coat over my left arm to keep from tripping over it even then i didnt glide down the stairs in threeinch heels i sort of limped jeanclaude waited at the bend of the stairs just before the landing i could carry you ma petite no thanks if i took the shoes off the dress would be so long id need to hold it up i needed one hand free for a gun if my choices were being slow and having a gun drawn or being fast and having my hands full of dress id be slow the stairs stretched empty wide enough to drive a small car down the door at the base of the stairs was solid oak iron bound like the door to a dungeon tonight not a bad analogy jeanclaude pulled on the heavy door and it swung open it was usually kept locked he turned to me the council can demand that i greet every vampire within these walls formally you mean like you did with liv i asked he gave a very small smile if i do not acknowledge their dominance over me then perhaps what if you do acknowledge them i asked he shook his head if we had gone to the council for aid of some kind then i would not fight i would simply acknowledge their superiority and be done with it i am not strong enough to be council i know that he smoothed his hands down the ruffles his shirt adjusting the cuffs on his jacket so the ruffles at his wrists showed to best advantage he often fussed with his clothes when he was nervous of course he fussed with his clothes when he wasnt nervous too i hear a but coming i said he smiled at me oui ma petite but they have come to us they have invaded our lands harmed our people if we acknowledge them as greater than ourselves without a struggle they may set up a new master in my place they may take all i have gained i thought the only way to step down as master was to die they would come to that eventually then we go in kicking butt but we cannot win by violence ma petite what we did with liv was to be expected she had to be punished but in a struggle to kill or be killed the council will win i frowned up at him if we cant just say theyre bigger and badder than we are and we cant fight them what can we do we play the game ma petite what game the game that i mastered at court so long ago it is a thing of diplomacy bravado insults he raised my left hand to his lips and laid a gentle kiss on it you will be very good at part of the game and very bad at others diplomacy is not your strong suit bravado and insults are two of my best things he smiled still holding my hand indeed ma petite indeed put the gun away i am not saying do not use it but have a care who you shoot not everything you will meet tonight can be harmed by silver bullets he cocked his head to one side as if thinking though come to that ive never seen anyone try to kill a council member with modern silver ammunition he smiled it might work he shook his head as if to rid himself of the image but if it comes to trying to slay the council by bullets then all is lost and all that will be left is to take as many of them with us as we can lets save as many of our people as we can too i said you dont understand them ma petite if we are dead there will be no mercy for those who are loyal to us any good revolution kills the loyalists first he touched the back of my right hand lightly reminding i still had the gun out somehow i just didnt want to put it away but i did i put the safety on i didnt want them to know the gun was there so i couldnt keep holding it i put the safety on because i didnt want to shoot myself in the leg it would be embarrassing as well as painful and probably wouldnt impress the council one little bit i didnt understand the game but id hung around vampires long enough to know that if you could impress them sometimes you walked out alive of course sometimes they killed you anyway sometimes a show of bravado just earned you a slower death like it did with some american indian tribes that only tortured enemies they thought worthy of the honor an honor i could do without but sometimes in the midst of being tormented you could get away if they just tore your throat out all options were over we were definitely going for impressive if we couldnt impress them wed kill them if we couldnt kill them theyd kill us liv had just been the beginning of the evenings entertainment the living room was a bare stone room once again jeanclaudes efforts at redecorating lay in piles of black and white cloth and broken wood the only thing untouched was the portrait above the false fireplace jeanclaude julianna and an unscarred asher gazed down at the ruins i expected an unpleasant surprise to be waiting for us there was only willie mccoy standing in front of the cold fireplace he had his back to us hands clasped behind him his peagreen suit clashed with his slickedback black hair one sleeve was torn and bloodstained he turned towards us blood seeped from a gash on his forehead he dabbed at it with a handkerchief covered in dancing skeletons it was silk and had been a gift from his girlfriend a centuryold vamp who had recently joined us hannah was as tall leggy and lovely as willie was short badly dressed and well willie he smiled at us so good of you to join us can the sarcasm i said where is everybody i started walking towards him but jeanclaude stopped me with a hand on my arm willies smile was almost gentle he stared at jeanclaude with a look of expectancy it was an expression id never seen on willies face i glanced at jeanclaudes perfect mask of a face closed and careful nofearful whats going on i asked ma petite may i introduce the traveler i frowned at him what are you talking about willie laughed and it was the same irritating bray hed always had but it ended in a low chuckling growl that raised the hairs at the base of my neck i looked at him and knew the shock showed on my face i had to swallow before i could talk even then i didnt know what to say willie he can no longer answer your call ma petite willie stood there staring at me he had been an awkward person alive dead he hadnt been much better he hadnt been dead long enough to master that otherworldly movement that the others had he walked towards us in a wave of his own liquid grace it wasnt willie shit i said softly is it permanent the stranger in willies body laughed again i am merely borrowing his body i borrow a great many bodies dont i jeanclaude i felt jeanclaude draw me backwards he didnt want to get closer i didnt argue we backed up it was odd being backed up by willie normally he was one of the least scary vamps i knew now tension sang down jeanclaudes hand i could taste his heart beating in my own head he was afraid and that made me afraid the traveler stopped hands on hips laughing afraid i will use you as my horse jeanclaude if you are truly strong enough to have slain the earthmover then you should be strong enough to withstand me i am cautious by nature traveler time has not lessened the habit you always did have a smooth tongue in your head and so many other places i frowned at the doubleentendre not sure i caught the meaning not sure i wanted to let willie go he is not being harmed the vampire said he is still inside the body jeanclaude said he still feels still sees you have only pushed him aside traveler not replaced him i glanced at jeanclaude his face showed nothing you say that like you know from personal experience jeanclaude was one of my favorite bodies once upon a time balthasar and i enjoyed him very much balthasar walked out of the far hallway as if hed been waiting for his cue maybe he had he was smiling but it was more a baring of teeth than pleasure he strode into the room looking elegant and roguish in his white suit he stood behind willie hands on the shorter mans thin shoulders willie the traveler leaned back against balthasars chest the bigger man wrapped his arms around him they were a couple will he know what theyre doing with his body i asked yes jeanclaude said willie doesnt like men no jeanclaude said i swallowed and tried to think reasonably and just couldnt vampires could not take over another vampires body it wasnt possible it just wasnt but i looked at willies familiar face with a strangers thoughts flowing through his brown eyes and knew it was true those brown eyes smiled into mine i dropped my gaze if the traveler could do me through livs eyes when he wasnt inside her then hed suck me down now for sure it had been a long time since i had had to practice the trick of staring at a face without meeting the eyes it was like tag with the vamp trying to capture my gaze and me avoiding it it was irritating and scary jeanclaude had said that violence wouldnt save us tonight he wasnt kidding if a vamp had been holding willie against his will forcing him sexually id have shot him but it was willies body and hed get it back shooting it full of holes was a bad idea what i needed was a good idea does the traveler like women i asked are you offering yourself in his place the vampire asked no just wondering how youd like it if the tables were turned no one else has my ability to share a body the traveler said would you like it if someone forced you to have sex with a woman willies face cocked to one side and the expression was alien to him the sense of otherness was strong enough to make my skin crawl i have never felt the draw of a womans body youd find it distasteful i said willie the traveler nodded yes then let willie go pick someone who wouldnt mind so much the traveler snuggled into balthasars arms and laughed at me are you appealing to my sense of mercy i shrugged i cant shoot you youre council i was hoping that would mean you had more rules than the rest of them guess i was wrong he looked at jeanclaude does your human servant do all your talking now she does well enough jeanclaude said if she seeks to appeal to my sense of fair play then you have told her nothing about your time with us at court jeanclaude kept my left hand clasped loosely in his but he stepped away from me i felt him draw himself straighter as if hed been hunched just a little huddled around his panic i knew he was still afraid but he had rallied brave jeanclaude i wasnt that afraid yet but then i didnt know any better i do not dwell upon the past jeanclaude said he is ashamed of us balthasar said rubbing his face against willies he planted a soft kiss against willies temple no the traveler said he fears us what do you want of me traveler why has the council invaded my lands and taken my people hostage willies body pushed away from balthasar to stand just in front of the taller man willie normally looked smaller than he was sort of hunched and rabbity but now he looked slim and certain of himself the traveler had given willie the grace and assurance he never had on his own you slew the earthmover but did not come to take his council seat there is no other way to rise to the council except through the death of another we have a vacancy that only you can fill jeanclaude i do not want it nor am i powerful enough to keep it if not powerful enough then how did you slay oliver he was a frightening force of nature the traveler walked towards us with balthasar in his wake how did you slay him jeanclaude didnt back up this time his hand tightened on mine but he stood his ground he agreed not to call the earth against me the vampire and his servant circled us like sharks one circling left the other right so it was hard to keep an eye on both of them why would he limit his powers he had gone rogue traveler oliver wished to bring back the days when vampires were illegal an earthquake might have destroyed the city but it would not have been blamed on a vampire he wanted to possess my vampires and cause a blood bath that would bring us back to being hunted oliver feared we would destroy all the humans eventually and thus ourselves he thought we were too dangerous to be allowed legal rights and freedom we received your report the traveler said he stopped by me balthasar stopped on the other side closest to jeanclaude they were mirroring each other i wasnt sure if it was the vampire controlling his servant or just centuries of practice i knew olivers ideas i drew back against jeanclaude is it just vamps or can he take over humans too you are safe from his intrusion ma petite great i said i stared at the traveler and it was frightening how easily i was beginning to think of this body as the traveler and not willie why didnt you stop oliver then i asked the traveler sidled closer and closer until only the barest inch kept us from touching he was council council cannot fight to the death among ourselves and nothing short of true death would have stopped him you let him come here knowing what he planned to do i said we knew he had left the country but not where he fled to or what his plans were the traveler raised a hand towards my face balthasar did the same on his side for jeanclaude willies small hand hovered near my face you had declared him rogue jeanclaude said any vampire that found him could slay him without violating our laws that is what rogue means the traveler traced the barest of touches down my face a trembling tentative touch so you thought we would not come to your door because you had saved us the trouble of hunting him down ourselves oui balthasar had stopped caressing jeanclaudes face he came to stand by his master he watched the smaller man slide his hand along my face balthasar seemed puzzled surprised something was happening and i didnt know what it was the traveler cupped my chin in his hand he turned my face to him he slid his hand over my jaw behind my neck to run fingers in my hair i pulled away from him i thought you didnt like girls i dont he stood there staring at me your power is amazing his hand lashed out too quick to see too quick to react he had a handful of my hair and his eyes willies eyes met mine i was shielding myself this time prepared but my heart still fell to my feet i waited for that cold blackness to pull me under nothing happened we stood there inches apart and they were just eyes i could feel his power beating down his arm like a march of icy fingers but it wasnt enough he laid his hands on either side of my face almost as if he were going to kiss me our faces were so close that his next words seemed intimate even though they werent i could force my gaze upon you anita but it would be an expenditure of power that i might regret before dawn you have injured liv twice this night i am healing her but that too takes power he stepped back from me hugging himself as if hed gotten more from touching me than just the feel of skin he took three gliding steps to put himself face to face with jeanclaude her power is a heady thing something to wrap around your cold skin and warm your heart for all eternity jeanclaude let out a slow breath she is my human servant indeed said the traveler a hundred years ago i could invade you without touching your fair skin now i cannot has she given you this power he reached towards jeanclaudes face as he had mine i pulled jeanclaude back out of reach and stepped between them hes mine no sharing jeanclaude slid his arm around me holding me loosely at his side if you would leave us in peace i would let balthasar and any person you chose use me but i will not willingly be your horse ever again traveler willies brown eyes stared up at jeanclaude there was a shrewdness a frightening intensity in those familiar eyes i am council you are not you will have no choice in the matter are you saying that if he took the council seat then you couldnt hurt him i asked if he is powerful enough to hold a council seat then i should not be able to invade his lovely body even were my lips pressed to him let me test my understanding here if he takes the council seat youll still try and force yourself on him because if you can force him then hes not powerful enough to be council but if he doesnt take the seat youll do it anyway the traveler smiled beautifully at me delight shining from his eyes willies eyes quite true why is everything with you people a freaking catch you dont do business you just do torture i said are you judging us he asked his voice was suddenly lower and deeper than willies throat should have been able to hold he took that last step forward and i was suddenly touching them both their power flared over me it was like being in the middle of two different fires but it didnt burn the travelers power was like jeanclaudes cool and swimming a breath of mortality the touch of the grave the power pulled a gasp from my throat and raised every hair on my body back off i tried to shove him away from us but he grabbed my wrist too quick to stop almost too quick to see the feel of his bare skin on mine sent a wave of numbing cold through my body like a spear of ice he jerked me away from jeanclaude jeanclaude caught my other wrist the moment his hand touched my skin the cold faded his power swept through me like a flood of warm water and it wasnt his power i knew the taste of this warmth it was richard jeanclaude was drawing on richards power as id done earlier he chased the travelers power out of me like summer heat on ice it was the traveler who released me he stepped back rubbing his hand on his coat as if it hurt jeanclaude you have been a very naughty boy jeanclaude drew me against him one hand resting against my neck so that his fingers touched my skin that electric warmth was still there playing over his skin and mine and i knew in that moment that richard had felt our urgency our need a noise turned us all to the far hallway i didnt recognize the man he was tall slender darkskinned maybe hispanic maybe something more exotic he wore nothing but a pair of black satin pants with silver embroidery along the legs he was dragging willies lady love hannah by one arm her mascara had run in black tears down her face her expensive haircut still framed her face still brought your eyes to her strong cheekbones and full lips but her face was like a mask now black tears and burgundy lipstick smeared across her lower face like a wound the traveler said why have you brought her here fernando my father is as much council as you are traveler i do not dispute that yet you forbid him come to this first meeting if he is council then let him bend me to his will the travelers voice was mocking we are all council but we are not all equal fernando smiled he grabbed hannahs beaded blue dress and tore it down her back she screamed the traveler swayed putting a hand to his face im going to fuck her fernando said balthasar strode towards them but two leopards the size of ponies crawled from the hallway one black one yellow spotted both big enough to tear him to pieces they growled low and deep moving on huge padded feet between balthasar and fernando fernando grabbed hannah around the waist pulling her dress over her hips to expose pale blue garters she turned and slapped him hard enough that he rocked back she was as feminine as they come but she was also a vampire and could have thrown him into the solid stone wall so that he stuck there fernando hit her back blood spattered from her mouth in shining beads she sat halfstunned on the floor fernandos power boiled through the room as if hed been holding it in check until now shapeshifter did he match the leopards that guarded his back maybe but it didnt matter what flavor he was he picked hannah up by the front of her dress dragging her to her knees he drew his hand back to hit her again i pulled the browning out of the coat pocket willie collapsed to his knees on the floor he stared up and said angelfangs he tried to stand and couldnt jeanclaude picked him up under the arms and raised him easily fernando hit hannah again a casual slap that rocked her head back and rolled her eyes to white he must truly love you to fight off the travelers touch every time he sees you abused jeanclaudes hand on my arm brought me back to myself i had the browning pointed at fernando i had to let out a breath to keep from pulling the trigger the safety was off and i didnt remember doing it why fernando and not the kitties the wereleopards could close the distance in the blink of an eye but i knew who the alpha was take out the leader and the cats might go play somewhere else jeanclaude supported willie with one arm the other still lightly on my arm as if afraid what id do fernando he said youve done what you set out to do the traveler is forced out and it will take him a little time to find a second host you can let hannah go fernando grinned at us white teeth bright in his dark face i dont think so he dragged hannah to her feet arms around her waist pinning her arms to her sides he tried to kiss her she turned her head and screamed willie was standing on his own now he pushed away from jeanclaude no i wont let you hurt her the black leopard dropped to its belly crawling closer to willie to us if were going to take them out we have to do it now i said fernando first then one of the leopards if i had time if not one problem at a time not yet ma petite fernandos father padma will not waste precious time tormenting the little ones the traveler will return too soon for that the traveler wont let me taste her once he returns fernando said he kept hannah pressed to his body with one arm and raised her dress with the other does he seriously think were going to stand here while he rapes her i asked my father is the master of beasts you wont stop me for fear of his wrath you just dont get it do you fernando i pointed the gun very steadily at his head i dont give a fuck who your daddy is let go of her and tell your furry buddies to back off or im going to make your daddy a very unhappy vampire you dont want me unhappy the voice caused my eyes to flick to the hallway beyond but the gun didnt move the vampire in the doorway was indian as in from india he was even wearing one of those long combo coattunic things it was gold and white and shimmered on the edge of my vision as he walked further into the room i kept my sights on his son one monster at a time jeanclaude let his hand drop away from my arm he stepped behind me and to one side careful not to block my shot padma master of beasts greetings and welcome to my home jeanclaude master of the city greetings your hospitality has been beyond my wildest expectations he laughed then but it was just a laugh theatrical and annoying even sinister but it didnt make my skin jump tell him to let hannah go i said you must be jeanclaudes human servant anita blake yeah nice to meet you now tell your son to let go of our vampire or im going to put a really big hole in him you wouldnt dare harm my son it was my turn to laugh short abrupt and not very funny your son said almost the same thing you are both so wrong if you kill my son i will kill you i will kill you all fine let me test my understanding if he doesnt let her go whats he going to do with her fernando laughed and it was low and hissing the laugh was enough somewhere in that lovely body was black fur and big button eyes wererat i will have her because the traveler has forbidden it and my father has given her to me no willie said he took a step forward but jeanclaude stopped him no willie this is not your fight fernando slid his hand over hannahs groin only jeanclaudes hand on willies arm kept him from rushing the shapeshifters hannah said master help me he cant help you child padma said he cant help any of you i aimed two inches to the right of fernandos head the shot echoed in the big room the bullet bit into the stone wall everyone froze the next bullet goes in fernandos skull you wouldnt dare padma said you keep saying that lets get something straight beast master fernando is not raping hannah no way ill kill him first then i will kill you padma said fine but that wont bring back your son now will it i let the breath out of my body and felt that stillness spill through me decide beast master decide i am the master of beasts he said i dont care if youre santa claus he lets her go or he dies jeanclaude control your servant if you can control her padma be my guest but take great care anita never bluffs she will kill your son decide i said softly decidedecidedecidedecide i wanted to shoot him i really did because i knew as surely as i was standing there that if i didnt shoot him now id have to shoot him later he was too arrogant to leave it alone too blinded by his own power to leave hannah alone and he couldnt have her that was a line he could not cross and live let her go fernando padma said father the man sounded shocked she will pull the trigger fernando she wants to pull it dont you anita yeah i do silver bullets i assume padma said never leave home without them i said let her go fernando even i cannot save you from a silver bullet no shes mine you promised id listen to your dad fernando do you disobey me my son there was a tone in padmas voice that sent a rush of warm air through the room the beginnings of anger something was flung over my skin a backwash of power but it wasnt vampiric power not exactly he wasnt trying to control jeanclaude it had a taste of warmer blood an electric dance that said lycanthrope which wasnt really possible a vampire cant be a lycanthrope and viceversa fernando cringed clutching hannah to him like a doll hiding his face in her yellow hair no father i would never disobey you then do as i say fernando flung hannah backwards she scrambled to willie he took her in his arms touching the blood on her face blotting at it with the silken handkerchief i lowered the gun fernando pointed a dark hand at me maybe ill ask for you to be my pet tough talk ratboy lets see if youre man enough to back it up i was baiting him i realized that i wanted him to rush me i wanted an excuse to kill him not good not good i had to calm down or i was going to get us killed the black leopard taller at the shoulders than my waist started creeping towards me it was belly to the ground muscles tensed and rippling the gun just shifted to it dont try it elizabeth padma said the name startled me id seen elizabeth in human form once sort of from a distance she was one of the local wereleopards id assumed until that moment that the leopards were part of the entourage that padma had brought with him if elizabeth was local the other leopard might be too the only thing i was sure of was that it wasnt zane or nathaniel other than that it could have been anybody but zane acknowledging me as his alpha had saved him from being here if zane had been alpha then beating him would have given me all the leopards and none of them would have been here or that was the theory with me being merely human and not a lycanthrope the master of beasts might still have called the kitties but i would have tried to keep them safe i wondered if elizabeth had tried she snarled at him at me at everyone her fangs were ivorywhite and at less than ten feet impressive as hell this close even a real leopard might have gotten to me before i could fire a killing shot you arent supposed to hunt big game with a handgun the leopard took another belly crawl forward elizabeth that one word flung outward burned along my skin and made me gasp the leopard came up short like shed hit the end of her leash she rolled on the floor struggling slashing the air she hates you anita padma said his voice was normal now conversational but whatever he was doing to the wereleopard was still happening i could feel it like ants marching down my skin ants with red hot pokers in their little hands i glanced at jeanclaude wondering if he could feel it his face was blank empty unreadable if he felt the pain it didnt show i wasnt sure admitting i could feel it was a good idea stop it i said she would kill you if i let her you killed the one she loved their leader she would have her revenge youve made your point let her go mercy for one who hates you so he glided into the room slippered feet barely touching the floor as if he rode always on tiny currents of his own power i should have been sensing his vampire powers but he was almost a blank as if something was keeping him in check or protecting me i glanced at jeanclaude again was he powerful enough to keep us safe now had the triumvirate helped him that much his face told me nothing and i didnt dare ask not in front of the master of beasts the leopard lay on its side panting heavily it watched me with pale green eyes and it was not a friendly look when i called them padma said she tried to bargain with me they have no alpha and yet she tried to bargain elizabeth would bring the leopards without a struggle to do with as i like if i would let her kill you help her kill you the beast master motioned behind him and a small slender woman stepped up beside him like shed been waiting in the hallway for his call like a welltrained dog she was nude except for a necklace that must have weighed five pounds and burned with diamonds her skin was that pale shade of dark that says africanamerican via ireland bruises decorated her face running in purple stains down her body she was one of the most beautiful women id ever seen even with the bruises she was perfectly proportioned from forehead to slender feet her eyes were brown and flicked from the leopard on the floor to jeanclaude to the ratman back and forth back and forth until finally she settled on me she pleaded with her eyes and i didnt need words to know that she was saying help me that i understood but why me when elizabeth came she brought the others with her i chose vivian as my present to myself padma stroked her hair absently the way youd pet a dog i will give her a gift for every harm i do her she will be rich if she survives the air around her trembled like the wash of heat off a summer road another wereleopard that id never met how many of them were there how many people had elizabeth delivered over to the bad guys what is this a fatherson rape outing i asked padma frowned at me i grow tired of you anita blake its mutual i said we forced the traveler out of his host body but his power still shields you he was to keep you from sensing your vampires distress now he seems to be protecting you from the full rush of my powers a pity you would tremble at the feel of them jeanclaude touched my shoulder lightly the touch was enough i wasnt here to trade clever repartee with the master of beasts killing him sounded like a really good idea but ive met older vamps that you couldnt take out with silver bullets it would be just my luck that padma was one of them padma called the leopards to him the yellow one rolled around his ankles like a big kittycat elizabeth sat like a welltrained dog willie and hannah were oblivious to the room he touched her gently as if she were glass they kissed and that one chaste touch of lips said it all tenderness love willie and hannah were just plain gone on each other it was beautiful you see why i gave her to my son such anguish her abuse would have caused them both but the traveler needed their bodies i stared at him it was bad enough when i thought the choice was just because hannah was blond and lovely but to know it was deliberate cruelty and not just lustthat made it worse you son of a bitch i said are you trying to make me angry padma said jeanclaude touched me again anita please he rarely used my real name when he did it was either very serious or something i wouldnt like this time it was both i dont know what i was about to say because suddenly the traveler lifted his shield padmas power crashed over us it thundered over me filling my head scrambling every thought i had i fell to my knees like id been hit by a hammer between the eyes jeanclaude stayed standing but i felt him sway beside me padma laughed he cannot reenter another host and maintain his shield a voice came like a wind easing through the room i wasnt sure if i heard the voice out loud or if it was just in my head he will need his powers in the hallway i chose to lift the shield enough games padma let him see what lies beyond there was a scent with the words fresh turned earth the smell of roots pulled from the ground i could almost feel the crumble of rich black soil between my hands i squeezed my hands around the browning until they shook and i still couldnt shake the sense of earth between my hands on the gun even staring at the gun seeing it was clean didnt make it go away whats happening i asked surprised and pleased that i could form a coherent sentence they are council jeanclaude said they have taken off how would you say the gloves shit i said padma laughed he stared at me and i knew he was concentrating just for little ol me his power slammed over me into me it was halfway between putting your hand on a live electric wire and shoving the same hand into fire the electric heat ate through my body the heat gathered in the center of me it flexed like a fist growing larger larger if he spread his fingers inside me hed tear me apart burst me from the inside out with just his power i screamed a cool touch slid over the heat a wind cool and easeful as death swept over my body the wind blew my hair back from my face blessed coolness filled me jeanclaudes hands caressed my shoulders he was kneeling on the floor cradling me in his arms i didnt remember falling his skin was cool to the touch i knew that somehow he was throwing his hardwon warmth away his warmth to cool the fire that awful pressure inside of me eased then shrank it was like jeanclaude was a wind blowing out padmas fire but it cost him i felt his heart slow the blood in his veins flowed slow and slower the warmth that mimicked life was leaving him and death seeped inside to fill its place i turned in his arms so i could see his face the face was pale and perfect and youd never have known just by watching what it had cost him to save me hannah turned to us her battered face set in calm lines my apologies jeanclaude my compatriot has let your servants defiance best his judgment willie stepped away from hannah shaking his head damn you damn you hannahs grey eyes turned to him angry do not tempt me little one you cannot trade insults with me and survive willie jeanclaude said there was no power to the word just a warning it was enough willie stepped back jeanclaude looked at the traveler in his new body if he had killed anita i might have died with her is that why you have truly come to kill us i swear it is not where hed made willie glide hannah was awkward on her stiletto heels he didnt fall but he didnt glide either it was almost heartening he wasnt perfect to prove my sincerity he said take your warmth back from your servant we will not stop you he thrust me out padma said how can you allow him to grow strong again you sound afraid the traveler said i do not fear him padma said then let him feed i leaned into jeanclaudes chest resting my cheek against the mound of silken ruffles on the front of his shirt his heart had stopped beating he wasnt even breathing hed used too much of himself up i watched padma from the safety of jeanclaudes arms and knew i would kill him i knew that padma wanted us dead id felt it no one as powerful as he lost control that badly hed nearly killed me us and it would all have been a tragic accident bullshit the browning lay where id dropped it but id tasted padmas power now silver might not be enough to kill him wounding him seemed like a really bad idea kill or leave him the hell alone like any big predator dont fuck with it unless you can finish the job feed from your servant padma said i will not stop you the traveler has spoken that last held a touch of bitterness council member or not padma feared the traveler or hed have fought him more compatriots but not equals i knelt gripping jeanclaudes arms through the rough lace and the glittering material of his jacket his arms felt reassuringly solid real what he stopped me with fingers on my lips a delicate touch it is not blood that i need padma it is her warmth it is only a lesser master that must take blood from his servants padmas face had gone empty blank you have not lost your knack of insulting without being insulting jeanclaude i stared up at jeanclaude even kneeling he was taller his voice eased through my mind no questions ma petite or they will know you are not wholly mine since i had a lot of questions that pretty much sucked but if i couldnt ask direct questions there were other ways does the beast master have to sink fang to jumpstart his heart oui ma petite how vulgar i said it was one of the most civilized insults id ever come up with it worked too padma hissed at us do not test my patience too far jeanclaude the traveler is not the head of the council you have enough enemies here now that a vote might not go your way press me too hard and i will force a vote force a vote to what end jeanclaude asked the traveler has promised that you are not here to kill me what else would you vote upon master of beasts get on with it jeanclaude padmas voice was low with a sound that was almost a growl it sounded more animal than vampire jeanclaude touched my face gently turning me to look at him let us show the master of beasts how it is done ma petite i didnt really like the sound of that but i knew one thing for certain jeanclaude needed his strength back hed never be able to repeat the trick of thrusting out a council member when he was so cold so drained do it i said i had to trust him trust him not to hurt me trust him not to do something awful or embarrassing i realized that i didnt trust him that no matter how much i loved his body i knew he was other i knew that what he thought of as okay was not necessarily okay at all he smiled i will bathe in your warmth ma petite roll you around me until my heart beats only for you my breath will grow warm from your kiss he cupped my face between the chilled skin of his hands and kissed me his lips were velvet his touch light caressing his hands slid up the sides of my face fingers gliding through my hair next to the scalp kneading massaging he kissed my forehead and shuddered i tried to kiss him again and he drew back remember ma petite if any of your fair body touches mine too much it will deaden do not be so eager to lose the sweet sensation of your lips for the night i went very still in his arms thinking about what hed just said bodies touching bare skin needed maybe but if any part touched too long or too forcefully my skin would deaden but only for the night jeanclaude was really very good at giving information without seeming to made me wonder how often hed had to do it in the past he slipped the coat off my shoulders until it hung nearly to my waist he ran his hands over my skin kneading his fingers into me his hands were warm he slid his hands over the coat gripping my arms through it but no bare skin he kissed my throat butterfly light his face rubbing up my neck my cheek he drew back from me with a quick rush of breath i put my hand over his heart and there was nothing i caressed his face touching the big pulse in his throat nothing i wanted to ask what we were doing wrong but didnt dare didnt want the bad guys to know we didnt do things like this much sex we did the otherworldly vampire shit we skipped if i could manage it he started unbuttoning his shirt i looked at him eyes a little wide he bared a circle of his stomach i just looked at that glimpse of pale skin what i asked touch me ma petite i glanced at the watching vampires i shook my head no foreplay in front of the bad guys i could simply take blood if you would prefer he said softly he said it as if we did it every night wed done it twice voluntarily on my part once had been to save his life the second time had been to save him and richard i did not want to donate blood sometimes i thought bloodletting was more intimate than sex to a vampire i didnt want to do that in front of company either i stared up at him getting angry he was asking me to do very intimate things in front of strangers i didnt like it and he knew i wouldnt like it so why hadnt he warned me had he really not thought wed have to do this tonight she is angry with you padma said is she truly that modest he sounded doubtful could it be that you cannot truly do what you say you can do hannahs body stood legs apart balancing on the unfamiliar high heels are you as weak as padma just another bloodsucker the traveler shook his head hannahs hair sliding across the shoulders of her ruined dress what else have you been bluffing about jeanclaude damn you all to hell i said i slid my hands inside jeanclaudes shirt fingers sliding over his stomach he was cold to the touch dammit i pulled his shirt out of his pants none too gently and ran my hands over his skin i kneaded my fingers along the muscles of his back and could feel heat rise up my throat into my face under other circumstances in the privacy of a bedroom it had possibilities now it was just embarrassing he drew my arms out careful ma petite or your hands will grow cold my fingertips were cold as if id been outside without gloves i stared up at him for a second or two if i cant touch you with my hands what do you suggest i use padma suggested something explicit enough to make me point a finger at him you stay out of this he laughed at me she is truly embarrassed how terribly precious asher said she was a virgin before you i did not believe him until now i let my head drop to my chest i was not going to say it i did not owe the vampire council a rundown on my love life jeanclaudes hand moved into view he never touched me but just the movement of his hand brought my face up to meet his gaze i would not ask this of you here and now if it were not necessary you must believe that looking into his blue blue eyes i did believe him stupid but true what do you want me to do he raised his fingers and put them just above my lips so close that if i breathed in hed have had to touch me use your lovely mouth over my heart if our bond is as strong as i believe it to be there are shortcuts ma petite i sighed and pulled his shirt up baring his chest in private i loved running my tongue over the crossshaped burn scar on his chest but this wasnt private hell with it i laid my lips against the cool skin of his stomach and licked a quick wet line up his chest he drew in a sharp hiss of breath how could he be breathing and not have a heartbeat no answer to that but id seen it before vampires that breathed but did not have a pulse i ran my tongue over the smoothness of the crossshaped burn scar ending with a kiss over his heart i felt my lips grow cold it wasnt the tingling cold of winter though it was just as hed said his body stealing my warmth my life seeping away into him i knelt back away from him licking my lips trying to feel them hows that he laughed and the sound slid down my back like an ice cube rubbed purposefully and long to the base of my spine i shuddered youre feeling better he lifted me suddenly hands on my thighs i let out a surprised yip putting my hands on his shoulders for balance he wrapped his arms around my legs and stared up at me the pupil in his eyes had bled away to a shining blue fire i felt his heartbeat in my throat his pulse raced through my body he let me slide slowly through his arms kiss me ma petite as we are meant to kiss i am warm and safe to touch warm but never safe i said i started to kiss him when i was inches above his forehead and continued the kiss as i slid down his body he kissed me like he would eat me from the mouth down fangs pressed hard and sharp and he had to draw away or draw blood the kiss left me breathless tingling but not with cold i realized that hed gotten a buzz from drinking in my warmth that it had felt good in a more than practical way trust him to make a virtue out of necessity now that you have your full powers once again the traveler said i will be leaving you you drove padma out without my aid surely you can defend yourself again he bested you as well padma said hannahs face looked at us yes he did i would expect nothing less from the master that slew the earthmover hannah turned back to padma and he did what you cannot he regained his warmth with his human servant without drawing her blood a trick that any true master can accomplish enough of this padma said he sounded angry having to share blood with your human servant seemed to be a real faux pas the night wanes now that you are at full strength jeanclaude search for your people see who does not answer your call i will leave you now jeanclaude i will await you beyond hannah suddenly sagged willie caught her and lowered her gently to the floor search jeanclaude search for your people padma said jeanclaude stood drawing me with him his pupils swam through the shining blue of his eyes his eyes settled into their normal color he stared past me past padma i didnt think he was seeing anything in the room his power crept from his hands across my skin i think if i hadnt been touching him i wouldnt have felt a thing the faintest shimmer of energy as if this was a small thing to do he blinked and looked at padma damian damian was one of jeanclaudes lieutenants like liv he was over five hundred but would never be a master in damians case it was over a thousand years but would never be a master it was a frightening amount of time to have acquired so little power dont get me wrong damian was powerful for a fivehundredyearold he was scary for a thousand years he was a baby a dangerous carnivorous baby but still damian had acquired all the power he might ever have he could live until the sun expanded and swallowed the earth and hed be no more powerful than he had been at dusk today he was one of the few vamps to ever fool me completely about his age id underestimated his age by over half id judged by power and was just beginning to learn that power was not the only thing to judge by jeanclaude had bargained with damians old master for his freedom to come here and play second banana what have you done to damian jeanclaude asked i nothing but is he dead padma smiled and took vivians hand that is a question only his master may answer he walked down the hallway leading the wereleopard by the hand vivian looked back at me watching me with wide frightened eyes until they were lost to sight the black leopard lingered watching me i spoke before i thought instinct almost how could you have given them over to that thing she snarled at me tail twitching you are weak elizabeth gabriel knew that and despised you for it she let out a coughing roar padmas voice cut across the sound like a knife blade elizabeth come to me now or i shall be very angry the leopard gave me a last snarl and padded out of sight did gabriel tell you she was weak ma petite i shook my head she wouldnt have brought them here if she were stronger he called and she came but she should have come alone perhaps she did her best ma petite then her best isnt good enough i looked at jeanclaudes careful unreadable face his body was still calm i laid my hand above his heart underneath his shirt his heart was pounding you think damians dead i said i know he is dead he stared down at me whether it is permanent that is the question dead is dead i said he laughed then and hugged me to him oh ma petite you above all should know that is not true i thought you said they couldnt kill us tonight i said so i thought he said great every time i thought i understood the rules they changed why was it that the damn rules always seemed to change for the worse willie came over to us leading hannah by the hand thank you master anita there were gashes in his thin face part of the initial fight for the circus i guess they were already healing he looked awful even more like the walking dead than usual you look like hell i said he grinned at me flashing fang he hadnt been dead three years yet it takes a little practice to smile without flashing fang im okay he looked at jeanclaude i tried to stop them we all did jeanclaude had tucked his shirt back in his pants he smoothed his hands down the front of the shirt and touched willies shoulder you fought the council willie win or lose you did well thanks master jeanclaude usually corrected anyone when they called him master but tonight i guess we were going formal come we must attend damian he offered me his wrist and when i didnt know quite what he wanted he laid my fingertips over the pulse you touch me as if you were taking my pulse is there some significance to this it shows that you are more than my servant or my bed partner it shows i consider you an equal what will the council think about that i asked it will force them to negotiate not only with me but with you it will complicate things for them and give us more options i rested my hand on his wrist his pulse was steady under my fingers confusion to our enemies eh he nodded making it almost a bow indeed ma petite indeed i walked beside him towards the hallway my right hand in my pocket on the browning which id rescued from the floor when we got a clear view of the hallway jeanclaudes pulse sped under my fingers damian lay on his side curled around a sword blood had soaked around the blade into the dark material of the vest he wore as a shirt the point came out his back hed been spitted hard to be a hundred percent sure but it looked like a heart blow there was a new vampire standing beside him he held a twohanded sword in his hands point down like a cane i recognized the sword it was the one damian slept with in his coffin the new vamp was tall six foot six or more broadshouldered his hair was cut like a bowl of yellow ringlets around his face leaving his ears bare he wore a white tunic white trousers white on white in layers he stood rigid at attention like a soldier warrick jeanclaude said i had hoped you escaped yvettes tender mercies the tall vampire looked at us his eyes flicked to my hand on jeanclaudes wrist he dropped to one knee and held damians sword across his hands he bowed his head and offered the sword to us he fought well it had been too long since i had such an opponent i forgot myself and slew him i would not have wished death on such a warrior his final death is a great loss jeanclaude took the sword from the vampires hands save your apologies warrick i come to save damian not to bury him warrick raised pale blue eyes to us but i have pierced his heart if you were the master that had made him then there would be a chance but you did not call him from his grave to his second life but i am master of the city and damian took a blood oath warrick laid the sword on the ground near damians still form your blood may call to him i pray that it will be enough i stared at him id never heard a vampire say i pray vampires for obvious reasons didnt pray a lot i mean who was going to answer oh yeah there was the church of eternal life but they were more a humanist religion sort of new wavey im not sure they talked much about god damians hair was nearly bloodred a startling color against the alabaster whiteness of his skin i knew his eyes were a green that any cat would envy but tonight his eyes were closed and if things went badly theyd never open again jeanclaude knelt beside damian he laid his hand on damians chest near the sword if i pull out the sword and his heart does not beat his eyes do not open then he is gone one chance and one chance only we could put him in a hole somewhere for a hundred years and until the sword was pulled out of his heart there would still be a chance if we do it here and now we risk losing him forever that last bit of lore is why you never ever remove a stake from a corpses heart no matter how dead it appears to be i knelt beside them is there a ritual for it he shook his head i will invoke the blood oath he took that will help call him back but warrick is correct i did not make damian i am not his true master no hes older than you are by about six hundred years i looked down at the vampire spitted on the sword lying in a pool of his own dark blood he was wearing a pair of dress pants that matched the vest without a conservative shirt under the vest it looked strangely erotic i could still feel damian in my head his power the beat and the pulse of centuries flowed through him he wasnt dead or at least not completely dead i could still feel his aura something i can still feel damian i said what do you mean ma petite i had a horrible compulsion to touch damian to run my hands over his bare arms i wasnt into necrophilia no matter how close i walked the edge what was going on i can feel him his energy in my head its like coming on a fresh corpse before the soul has left the body hes still intact i think warrick was looking at me how can you know that i reached out towards damian and stopped myself hands curling into fists my hands ached to touch him not sexual exactly but like seeing a really fine sculpture i wanted to trace the lines of his body to feel the flow and ebb of him to what is wrong ma petite i touched my fingertips to damians arm as if afraid he would burn my hand slid over his cool flesh almost without me wanting it to the force that animated damians body flowed through his cooling skin flowed over my hand down my arm marched in goose bumps across my body i gasped what are you doing ma petite jeanclaude was rubbing his arms as if he too felt it warrick put out a hand towards me like he was holding his hand in front of fire not sure if he could or should touch he pulled back rubbing his hand on his pants it is true you are a necromancer you aint seen nothing yet i whispered i turned to jeanclaude when you pull out the sword the trick is going to be to keep the power from leaving with the opening of the wound to keep for lack of a better word his soul from fleeing right jeanclaude was watching me as if hed never really seen me before nice to know i could still surprise him i do not know ma petite i am not a witch or a student of magical metaphysics i will invoke the oath speak the ritual and hope he survives sometimes when i call a zombie from the grave its easier to call them a second time i slid my hands down to hold damians limp hand but it wasnt enough my power and the power inside the vampire needed a more immediate touch than mere hands he is not a zombie ma petite warrick said you hadnt called damian from the grave but i have once upon a time nearly by accident i had raised three of jeanclaudes vampires it was when he richard and i first invoked the triumvirate the power had been so overwhelming that id raised every true corpse near us as a zombie but there had been too much power id fed it to the vampires and theyd risen for me necromancers were rumored to be able to call all manner of dead to do their bidding but that was legend as far as i knew i was the only living necromancer to pull off this particular trick what are you asking ma petite i crawled around damians body the blood was cool through my hose my hand trailed up his arm never losing contact with his body with that power curled inside of him the power that animated him had thrust me out once cast me out hurt me but it was like once having brushed each other we were linked youre linked to damian but youre also linked to me i can feel damian in my head i dont know if its a link but its something use it i said you mean draw on your power to help strengthen my hold on him jeanclaude said yeah i dragged damian into my lap on his side the sword still spitting him when jeanclaude saw what i was doing he helped me i cradled damian on his side shoulders in my lap his head resting on my arm i slid my hand down his chest searching for his heart and found the blade instead it had pierced his heart even with my help even with jeanclaudes help if he hadnt been over five hundred hed be dead five hundred seemed to be an age where vamps gained a great deal of power being over a thousand could only help him i could feel him through my body my head through the growing power i realized id turned my back to the hallway it was hard to think but i said do we have a truce until we raise him you mean will they attack us while we save him yes i will guard you warrick said he stood and took damians sword isnt that a conflict of interest i asked if he does not rise i will be punished for killing him it is not just sorrow at my own carelessness that prompts me to help you i fear what my mistress will do jeanclaude stared down at damian padma wishes to kill us for the power the triumvirate has given us ma petite now that he knows you have called damian from his coffin like a zombie he will fear you even more is warrick going to tell him jeanclaude gave a gentle smile there is no need for warrick to tell is there traveler a voice sighed around us i am here i stared up at the air at nothing you little son of bitch youre an eavesdropper willie stumbled hannah jerked back from him i am many things anita willie turned to us with that ancient intelligence burning in his eyes why have you withheld this information from us jeanclaude you see us as a threat without this bit of information traveler do you blame me for hiding it from you he gave a small smile that was both gentle and condescending no i suppose i dont jeanclaude gripped the hilt of the sword he put his hand on damians chest to brace himself his fingers brushed my hand you might wish to move your hand ma petite the sword is sharp i shook my head im going to make his heart beat i cant do that if im not touching it jeanclaude turned his head to one side looking at me the magic grips you ma petite and you forget yourself at least use your left hand he was right the magic for lack of a better word was building id never felt my own power so strongly outside of a blood sacrifice of course there was plenty of blood just none that id spilt myself but i could sense damians heart inside his chest it was almost as if i could have reached inside and caressed the muscle like i was not seeing it but feeling it and that wasnt it either i had no word for it it wasnt touch or sight but i could feel it just the same i pulled my right hand away and slipped my left over damians still heart are you ready ma petite i nodded jeanclaude rose on his knees i am the master of the city my blood you have drunk my flesh you have touched you are mine damian you gave yourself willing to me come to me now damian rise to me now come to my hand he tightened his grip on the blade i felt damians body shift boneless as the dead i felt his heart caressed it and it was cold dead i am master of your heart damian jeanclaude said i will it to beat we will make it beat i said my voice sounded distant strange not like my voice at all power breathed through me through damian into jeanclaude i felt it spreading outward and knew that every corpse in the place would feel the rush now i whispered jeanclaude looked at me one last time then turned all his attention to damian he yanked the blade out in one harsh motion damians essence tried to follow the blade out tried to slip away through the wound i felt it sliding away i called to it pressed it into the dead flesh and it wasnt enough i moved my hand over his heart the sliding blade sliced my hand blood fresh and warm and human flowed over the wound the thing inside damian hesitated it stayed to taste my blood it was enough i didnt caress his heart i smashed it filled it with the power that crawled over us the heart thudded against his chest so that i felt it in my bones his spine bowed raising him out of my lap throwing his head his mouth opened in a silent scream his eyes flew open wide he slumped back into my lap he stared up at me wideeyed frightened he grabbed my arm he tried to talk and couldnt speak past the thundering of the pulse in his throat i could feel the blood in his body the beat of his heart the rush of him he reached out to jeanclaude grabbing the sleeve of his jacket he finally whispered what have you done to me saved you mon ami saved you damian slumped suddenly his body began to quiet i began to lose the sense of his pulse the taste of his heart it slid slowly away and i let it go but i was almost sure i could have held it i could have kept the feel and rush of his body i could have made it rise and fall to my touch i was almost sure i ran my hand through his thick red hair and knew temptation and it was only slightly tinged with sex i raised my still bleeding hand where i could see it it wasnt much of a cut two three stitches and id be fine it hurt but not enough i ran the still bleeding hand through his hair the thickness of his hair slid across the open wound abrading it the pain was suddenly sharper aching and nauseating enough pain to bring me back to myself damian stared up at me afraid afraid of me my how terribly impressive i turned damian still in my lap yvette was stalking down the hallway towards us shed lost the mink stole and the white dress was very simple very elegant very chanel the rest of the scene was pure marquis de sade jason werewolf flunky sometimes voluntary appetizer to the undead was with her he was dressed in a cross between black leather pants and skintight chaps bare skin showed at his thighs and what looked like a leather thong covered his groin around his neck was a metalstudded dog collar with a leash attached to it yvette was holding the leash fresh bruises marched down his face neck arms there were cuts on his lower chest and stomach that looked like claw marks his hands were bound behind his back arms pulled so tight to his body that that alone had to hurt yvette stopped about eight feet from us posing she shoved jason hard enough in the back for him to let out a small sound forcing him to his knees she drew the leash tight so he was almost hanging she smoothed her hand through his yellow hair adjusting it like he was about to get his picture taken hes my gift while im here do you like the wrapping can you sit up i asked damian i think so he rolled off my lap sitting up carefully as if everything wasnt working quite right yet i got to my feet how you doing jason im okay he said yvette jerked the leash tighter so he couldnt talk i realized that the inside of the collar had metal spikes on it a choke collar great he is my wolf yvette mine to protect you cannot have him jeanclaude said i have already had him she said but i will have him again i have not hurt him yet the bruises are not my doing he got that in defense of this place in defense of you ask him yourself she eased the collar and then the leash itself jason took a long breath and looked at us did she hurt you jeanclaude asked no he said you have shown great restraint jeanclaude said to yvette or have your tastes changed since last we embraced she laughed oh no my tastes are the same as they always were i will torment him now in front of you and you will be powerless to stop me this way i torment several people for the price of one she smiled she looked better than she had at the restaurant not quite so pale whod you feed off of i asked her eyes flicked to me youll see soon enough she turned her attention to warrick he didnt exactly cringe but he seemed suddenly smaller less shining warrick you failed me warrick stood against the wall damians sword still in his hand i did not mean to hurt him mistress oh i dont mean that you guarded them while they brought him back you said i would be punished if he died so i did but would you really have used that great sword on me he dropped to his knees no mistress then how could you guard them warrick shook his head i did not think you never do she pulled jason in against her legs cradling his face against her thigh watch jason watch and see what i do to bad little boys warrick got to his feet putting his back to the wall he dropped the sword clattering on the stones please mistress please do not do this yvette took in a deep breath head back eyes closed caressing jasons face she was anticipating whats she going to do i asked watch was all jeanclaude would say warrick was kneeling close enough for me to touch whatever was about to happen we were going to have a ringside seat which was the point i suppose warrick stared at the far wall past us ignoring us as much as he could a white film spread across his pale blue eyes until they were cloudy blind if i hadnt been standing within arms reach it would have been too subtle to see his eyes collapsed inward crumbling with rot his face was still perfect strong heroic like an engraving of st george but his eyes were empty rotting holes thick greenish pus trailed down his cheeks like thick tears is she doing that to him i asked yes jeanclaude said almost too soft to hear warrick made a small sound low in his throat black fluid burst from his mouth pouring down his lips he tried to scream and all that came out was a deep choking gurgle he fell forward onto hands and knees the pusfilled liquid poured from his mouth eyes ears it flowed in a puddle of liquid thicker than blood it should have stunk but as so often happened with vampires that rotted there was no odor warrick vomited his own rotting internal organs onto the floor we all began to move back from the widening pool didnt want to step in it it wouldnt do us any harm but even the other vampires stepped back from it warrick collapsed onto his side his white clothes were nearly black with gore but underneath the mess he was still whole his body was untouched his hand reached out blindly it was a helpless gesture a gesture that said better than words that it hurt and he was still in there still feeling still thinking sweet jesus i said you should see what i can do with my own body yvettes voice dragged our attention back to her she was still standing there cradling jason against her leg she was a white gleaming figure except for her hand from the elbow down a green rot had started jason noticed it he started to scream and she yanked the collar too tight for speech she caressed his face with her rotting hand leaving a smear of something thick and dark and all too real jason went wild he tore away from her she pulled on the collar until his face turned pink then red he fought to stay away from her fought like a fish on a hook his face turned purplish and still he wouldnt come to her rotting hand jason collapsed to the floor he was about to choke himself into unconsciousness he has tasted the pleasures of rotting flesh before with other vampires havent you jason he is so afraid it is why padma gave him to me yvette started to close the distance between herself and jasons prone body i doubt his mind will survive even a night isnt it delicious we are so not doing this i said i took the browning out of my pocket and showed it to her dont touch him you are a conquered people anita dont you grasp that yet she asked conquer this i said i raised the browning towards her jeanclaude touched my arm put away your gun ma petite we cant let her have jason she will not have jason he said he stared down the hallway at yvette jason is mine mine in every way i will not share him with you and it is against the rules of hospitality that you do something to one of my people that will cause permanent damage breaking his mind is against council law padma doesnt think so yvette said but you are not padma jeanclaude glided towards them his power began to fill the hallway like cool rising water you were my toy for over a hundred years jeanclaude do you really think you can stand against me now i felt her lash out like a knife striking but her power met jeanclaudes and faded it was like she was striking at mist his power didnt fight back it absorbed jeanclaude stepped up almost touching her and jerked the leash out of her hand she touched his face with her rotting flesh smearing things worse than blood down his cheek jeanclaude laughed and it was bitter like swallowing broken glass it hurt to hear the sound i have seen you at your worst yvette there is nothing new you can show me she dropped her hands to her side and stared up at him there are more delights up ahead padma and the traveler await you she didnt know that the traveler was already among us willies body remained quiet not giving the traveler away interesting yvette held up her hand and it was smooth and perfect once more you are conquered jeanclaude you just dont know it yet jeanclaude hit her a blur of speed that sent her careening along the floor to end in a not so elegant bundle against the wall i may be conquered yvette but not by you not by you jeanclaude untied jasons hands and tore the collar from around his neck jason huddled into a little ball on the floor he was making small noises in his throat more primitive than words and more piteous yvette had gotten to her high heels and left us warrick was healing if that was the right word he sat up still covered in the remains of his own bodily fluids but his eyes were clear and blue and he looked whole the traveler in willies body walked up to stand by jeanclaude you have impressed me more than once this night i did none of it to impress traveler these are my people these are my lands i defend them it is not a game he produced two handkerchiefs from somewhere he handed me one for your hand ma petite he started to wipe the goop off jasons face with the other handkerchief i stared down at my left hand blood was running in a nice steady line down my hand id forgotten about it watching warrick rot some horrors were worse than pain i took the bit of blue silk from jeanclaude thanks i wrapped the makeshift bandage around the wound but couldnt tie it onehanded the traveler tried to help me tie the bandage i pulled away from him i offer you aid not harm no thanks he smiled and again it was not willies thoughts that slid over his face it upsets you so much that i inhabit this body why hes my friend i said friendship you claim friendship with this vampire he is nothing a power not to be reckoned with hes not my friend because hes powerful or not powerful hes just my friend it has been a very long time since someone has invoked friendship in my presence they will beg for mercy but never on the grounds of friendship jeanclaude stood no one else would have thought of it no one else would have been so naive the traveler said it is a form of naivetй jeanclaude said that is true but how long has it been traveler since someone anyone had the courage to be naive before the council they come before you asking for power safety vengeance but not friendship not loyalty no that they will not ask of the council willies head did that little turn to one side again as if the traveler were thinking does she offer me friendship or ask it of me i started to answer but jeanclaude beat me to it can you offer true friendship without asking for it in return i opened my mouth to say that id sooner be friends with a hungry crocodile but jeanclaude touched my arm gently it was enough we were winning dont blow it friendship the traveler said now that is indeed something i have not been offered since i took my seat upon the council i spoke then without thinking first that must be very lonely he laughed and it was that same eerie mixture of willies loud bray and a slithering chuckle she is like a wind through a window long closed jeanclaude a mixture of cynicism naivetй and power he touched my face and i let him he cupped the side of my face in his hand in an almost familiar gesture she does have a certain charm his hand trailed down my face fingertips lingering against my cheek he dropped his hand suddenly fingers rubbing against each other as if he were trying to feel some invisible something he shook his head i and this body will await you in the torture room he answered me before i could even say no i do not plan to harm this body anita but i do need it to walk about i will leave this host if there is one that you would prefer i take he turned and stared at the rest of the group his gaze came to rest at last on damian i could take this one balthasar would enjoy that i think i shook my head no is this one also your friend i glanced at damian not my friend no but hes still mine the traveler turned his head to one side staring at me he belongs to you how is he your lover i shook my head no brother cousin ancestor no i said then how is he yours i didnt know how to explain it i wont give damian to you to save willie you said it yourself youre not hurting him and if i was would you trade damians safety for your friend i shook my head im not going to debate this with you i am merely trying to discern how important your friends are to you anita i shook my head again i didnt like where this conversation was going if i said the wrong thing the traveler was going to start cutting willie up i could see it coming it was a trap and everything i thought to say led right into it jeanclaude interrupted ma petitevalues her friends the traveler held up a hand no she must answer this one herself it is her loyalty that i wish to understand not yours he stared at me from less than a foot away uncomfortably close how important are your friends to you anita answer the question i thought of one answer that might not lead where the traveler wanted to go important enough to kill for i said his eyes flew wide his mouth opened in amazement are you threatening me i shrugged you asked a question i answered it he threw his head back and laughed oh what a man you would have made id spent enough time around macho guys to know it was a compliment a sincerely meant one they never understood the implied insult and as long as we werent cutting up people i cared for i wasnt going to point it out thanks i said his face blanked instantly the humor gone like a bad memory only his eyes willies eyes were still alive glittering with a force that crept along my skin like a chill wind he offered me his arm like jeanclaude had done earlier i glanced at jeanclaude he gave the barest of nods i placed my still bleeding hand on the travelers wrist his pulse beat hard and fast against my hand it felt like the small wound had a second heartbeat pounding in rhythm to his pulse the blood flowed faster out of the cut called by his power it dripped in a tickling line down my arm to the elbow to fall inside the arm of the coat soaking into the dark cloth blood spread over his wrist in crimson rivulets my blood my own heart sped up feeding the fear driving the blood faster i knew in that moment that he could stand there and bleed me to death out of that small wound that he could waste all the blood in me all the power in me to make a point my heart was thudding in my ears i knew i should move my hand but i just never seemed to get around to moving it as if something was interfering with the screaming in my head before it could reach my hand jeanclaude reached out to me but the traveler spoke before he could touch us no jeanclaude i acknowledge her as a power to be reckoned with if she can break this hold on her own my voice was breathy rushed as if id been running but i could talk think i just couldnt move my hand what do i get out it he laughed pleased with himself i think id finally asked a question he was comfortable with what do you want i thought about that as the pulse in my hand beat fast and faster blood was beginning to soak the travelers sleeve willies sleeve i wanted willie back safe passage for me and all my people and friends he threw his head back and roared with laughter the laughter stopped in midmotion like a badly made film he turned glittering eyes to me break this hold anita and i will grant you what you ask but if you fail to break it what do i gain it was a trap and i knew it but i didnt know how to get out of it if he kept bleeding me id pass out from blood loss and it would all be over blood i said he smiled i have that now a willing drink from me you dont have that tempting but not enough grey spots were spreading across my vision i was sweating and vaguely nauseous it took a long time to pass out from blood loss but he was speeding it up i couldnt think what to offer him i was having trouble thinking at all what do you want jeanclaude let out a sigh as if id said the wrong thing the truth i collapsed slowly to my knees and only his hand on my elbow kept me upright my vision was going in large greywhite splotches i was dizzy and it was only going to get worse what truth who really killed the earthmover tell me that and you are free i swallowed hard and whispered fuck you i slid to the ground still holding onto him still bleeding he bent over me but through my ruined vision it was just willie willies sharpangled face willie with his loud suits and worse ties willie who loved hannah with a gentle devotion that made my throat tight i reached out and touched that face ran my tingling fingertips through his slickedback hair cradled his jaw in my hand and whispered willie come to me there was a jolt like a shiver of electricity and i could see my body still felt numb and distant but my vision was clear i looked into those glittering eyes and thought of willie there deep inside was an answering scream willie come to me my voice was stronger this time the traveler said what are you doing i ignored him willie was one of the other vampires id accidently called from their coffins like damian and maybe just maybe he was mine in more than friendship with blood i call you willie mccoy rise and come to me the third heartbeat in my hand slowed the traveler was the one trying to get away now trying to break the hold he had forged but it was a twoedged blade it cut both ways and i wanted to make my point deep and sharp come to me willie rise to my voice my hand my blood rise and answer me willie mccoy come now i watched willie spill into those eyes like water filling a cup i felt the traveler forced out i thrust him out shoved him away and slammed a door that i hadnt known i had in my head in willies body i forced the traveler out and he spun shrieking into the darkness willie stared at me and it was him but there was a look in his eyes id never seen before what would you have of me master i collapsed on the floor crying i wanted to say im not your master but the words died in my throat swallowed by a velvet darkness that ate my vision and then the world id fallen asleep with my head in my fathers lap he stroked my hair i snuggled against his lap my cheek resting on his bare thigh bare thigh i was suddenly awake pushing to a sitting position before i could really see jason sat leaning against a stone wall it was his lap id woken up in he gave me a very watereddown version of his usual comehither smile but it left his eyes cold and tired he wasnt up to leering at me tonight things are rough when jason stops teasing jeanclaude and padma were arguing in french they stood on either side of a wooden table a man was bound facedown to the table with silver bands at wrist ankles and neck bands that were bolted to the table itself he was nude but more than his clothes were missing the entire back of his body was one raw bloody mess id found the owner of the skin on the door rafaels darkly handsome face was slack unconscious i hoped he stayed that way for a long time rafael the rat king was head of the secondlargest and strongest band of shapeshifters in the city he was no ones toy what the hell was he doing here like this what is rafael doing here i asked jason he answered voice tired dragging the master of beasts wants the wererats rafael wasnt strong enough not to come when called but he was strong enough to not bring any of the other rats he delivered himself over like a sacrifice jason leaned his head back against the wall eyes closed they couldnt break him they couldnt break sylvie either sylvie i stared around the room it was twenty by twenty not that big she was across the room chained to the wall she sagged in the chains full weight on her wrists unconscious most of her was hidden from view by the table that rafael was chained to she didnt look hurt why is she here the master of beasts called the wolves too richard wasnt here to answer so sylvie came she protected the rest of us just like rafael did for his people what are jeanclaude and the beastieboy arguing about the traveler granted us our freedom but they dont want to include rafael in the bargain the master of beasts says the rat king is not our people nor our friend hes my friend i said he smiled without opening his eyes i knew youd say that i got to my feet pushing against the wall i was a little unsteady but not bad i walked towards the arguing vampires the french was hot and furious jeanclaude turned to me ma petite you are awake his english was heavily accented it often was after hed been speaking a lot of french padma held up a hand no do not influence her jeanclaude gave a sweeping bow as you like i wanted to touch rafael i could see his back rising and falling but i wouldnt really believe he was okay until i touched him my hands sort of hovered over him but there was almost no place left to touch that wasnt raw and hurting i finally touched his hair then drew back i didnt want to wake him unconscious was better than anything else right now who is this one to you padma asked hes rafael the rat king hes my friend hannah walked in through the open dungeon door the moment she appeared i knew it was the traveler he leaned that very feminine body against the side of the door and managed to look masculine you cannot be friends with every monster in the city i stared up at him want to bet he shook his head hannahs blond hair bouncing back and forth just like in the shampoo commercial he laughed and it was girlish oh no anita blake i will not bargain with you again this night he started down the steps hed taken off the high heels and glided down the stairs in stocking feet but there will be other nights i asked for safe passage and you gave it i said you cant hurt us anymore i gave safe passage for tonight only anita i do not remember a time limit being placed on your promise jeanclaude said the traveler waved the objection away it was understood not by me i said he stopped on the other side of the table by padma he stared at me with hannahs grey eyes and frowned anyone else would have known that i meant tonight alone as you yourself have said traveler she is not anyone jeanclaude said he is one council member he cannot bargain for all padma said he can force us to let you go tonight but the rest he cannot do he cannot free you all without a vote of all represented here then his promise means nothing i said if i had dreamt that you meant safety for our entire stay the traveler said i would have asked for more than merely the truth of the earthmovers death we made a deal i kept my end of it i said he tried to cross his arms over his chest but had to settle for his stomach arms cradling the breasts women are just not designed to look tough you have given me yet another problem anita it might be wise to not be so problematic threaten all you want i said but for tonight you cant touch us do not let it go to your head his voice had crawled down a few octaves dragging out of hannahs throat i moved around to stand at rafaels head wanting to stroke his hair and not daring to tears pressed like a hand against the back of my eyes unchain him he goes with us or your word is worth shit traveler i will not give him up padma said you will do as you are told the traveler said i turned away from the sight of rafaels butchered body i also didnt want the bad guys to see me cry turning away from rafael gave me a better view of sylvie what i saw stopped me in my tracks her pants were down around her ankles shoes still on i took a step towards her then another and was almost running by the time i got to her i slid to my knees beside her blood stained her thighs her hands were balled into fists eyes squeezed tight she was whispering something very softly over and over i touched her arm and she flinched her voice rose just enough for me to hear the one word no no no over and over and over like a mantra i was crying id been talking about putting a bullet in sylvie earlier today now i was crying for her some big tough sociopath i turned out to be i had my problems with sylvie but this she didnt even like men under the best of circumstances it made what theyd done worse somehow more insulting or maybe it was just that i remembered her as so proud so confident and full of herself to see her like this was almost more than i could bear sylvie sylvie its anita i wanted to pull her clothes back in place but was afraid to touch her again until i was sure she knew it was me sylvie can you hear me jason came to stand with us let me try she wont want a man to touch her i wont touch her he knelt on the other side of her i smell like pack you dont he very carefully slid his arm in front of her face trying not to touch her smell the pack sylvie know the comfort of our touch she stopped saying no but that was it she wouldnt even open her eyes i stood up and faced the room who did this she could have stopped it at any time padma said given me the pack and it would all have been over she could have gone free i screamed who did this i did padma said i stared down at the floor and when i came back up the uzi was pointed at him im going to cut you in half ma petite you will hit rafael and perhaps me a machine gun was not made for one target in a crowd but hed survive the browning i shook my head he dies for this he dies the traveler stepped beside padma would you slay this body he spread his hands wide and stepped in front of padma would you kill your willies lady love tears hot enough to scald trailed down my cheeks damn you damn you all padma did not personally rape your friend the traveler said any unskilled man can rape but it takes a true artist to skin a live shapeshifter who then my voice was just a little calmer i wasnt going to use the machine gun and we all knew it i dropped the uzi letting it slide back under the coat i wrapped my hand around the browning and thought about it jeanclaude started walking towards me he knew me too well ma petite we all walk out of here in safety at least this night you have given us this do not destroy us all for vengeance now fernando walked through the door and i knew he might not be the only one but hed been one of them he smirked at me the traveler wouldnt let me have hannah i started to tremble a fine quivering that started in my arms and spread across my shoulders and down my body id never wanted to kill anyone as badly as i wanted to kill him right that second he glided down the steps in his bare feet hands roving across his chest playing in the line of hair that started on his belly rubbing his hands along the silk of his pants maybe ill have you chained to a wall he said i felt a smile stretch across my face i spoke very clearly very carefully because if i didnt i was going to scream and if i lost control of my voice i was going to shoot him i knew that just as surely as i was standing there who helped you padma stopped his son drawing him into the circle of his arms i saw real fear on the master vampires face his son was still too arrogant or too stupid to understand i did it myself a laugh that was bitter enough to choke me came out you couldnt do this much damage on your own who helped you the traveler touched fernandos shoulder others unnamed others if the woman can tell you let her if not you do not need to know you will not be hunting them executioner not tonight i said the trembling was quieting that cold icy center of my soul the place where id given up a piece of myself spread outward i was calm deadly calm i could have shot them all and not blinked but you said it yourself traveler there will be other nights jason was talking in a low voice and sylvie was answering i glanced at her she wasnt crying her face was pale and strangely stiff as if everything was held inside tight and hard jason undid the locks on the chains and she slid down the wall he tried to help her pull up her pants but she pushed him away i knelt beside her let me help please sylvie tried to pull the pants up herself but her hands werent working right she kept fumbling and finally collapsed to the floor in tears i started to dress her and she let me she helped where she could but her hands were shaking so badly she couldnt do much her pants were pink linen i couldnt find the underwear it was gone i knew shed been wearing some because sylvie wouldnt go without she was a lady and ladies didnt do that when everything was covered she finally met my eyes the look in her brown eyes made me want to look away but i didnt if she could have that much pain in her face the least i could do was look at it no flinching id even stopped crying i didnt give them the pack she said i know i said i wanted to touch her reassure her and was afraid to she collapsed forward sobbing not crying but sobbing like shed cry out bits and pieces of herself on the floor i put my arms around her tentatively she sagged against me holding me i held her half in my arms half in my lap rocking her slowly i leaned over next to her ear and breathed a sound into it hes dead theyre all dead she quieted slowly then looked up at me you swear it i swear it she huddled against me and said softly i wont kill richard good because id hate to kill you now she laughed and it turned it into more crying but softer now quieter not quite so desperate i looked up at the others the men dead and alive were staring at me rafael comes with us no more debating padma nodded very well fernando turned to him father you cant let her do this the wolves yes but not the rat king hush fernando he cannot be allowed to live if he does not submit you werent rat enough to be dominant to him were you fernando i said hes stronger than youll ever be and you hate him for it fernando took a step towards me padma and the traveler both held him back a hand on each shoulder jeanclaude stepped between us let us be on our way ma petite the night grows long the traveler stepped away from fernando slowly i wasnt sure who he trusted least me or the ratboy he started unfastening the chains that held rafael in place the wererat was still unconscious oblivious to his fate i got to my feet and sylvie came with me she pushed away from me tried to walk and nearly fell i caught her and jason caught her other arm fernando laughed sylvie stumbled she looked like shed been slapped the laughter cut more than any words i laid my lips against her cheek cradled her face against mine with my free hand lips by her ear hes dead remember that she leaned into me for a moment then nodded she straightened and let jason help her walk towards the stairs jeanclaude lifted rafael in his arms as gently as he could balancing the man over his shoulders rafael groaned hands spasming but his eyes stayed shut i stared at the traveler youll need to find another horse to ride i said hannah comes with us of course he said now traveler i said arrogance spread across his face it was a look id never seen on hannahs face before do not let one act of magical bravado make you foolish anita i smiled and knew it wasnt pleasant it was bitter and arrogant and angry my patience is all gone tonight traveler get out of her now or i shoved the browning into fernandos groin they were all huddled that close fernandos eyes widened but he wasnt nearly as afraid as he should have been i pressed the barrel in a little harder makes most men back up he gave a small grunt but leaned into me face bending towards me he was going to try and kiss me i laughed i laughed while his lips hovered over my mouth and the gun pressed into his body it was the laughter not the gun that made him draw back hannah collapsed to her knees the traveler had gone someone needed to help her to the stairs i thought of willie and he came he helped her to her feet without looking at me i kept my eyes on the bad guys one problem at a time why are you laughing fernando asked because you are too fucking stupid to survive i drew back from them the gun still pointed at him is he your only son i asked my only child padma said my condolences i said no i didnt shoot him but staring into fernandos angry eyes i knew thered be other opportunities some people seek death through desperation some people fall into it out of stupidity if fernando wanted to fall i was more than happy to catch him rafael lay on an examining table we were not in the hospital the lycanthropes had a makeshift emergency room in the basement of a building that they owned id had my own wounds tended there once now rafael lay on his stomach hooked up to an iv loaded with liquids and painkillers painkillers didnt always work well on lycanthropes but hey they had to try something hed regained consciousness in the jeep he hadnt screamed but the small squeezed whimperings that clawed from his throat every time i hit a bump were more than enough dr lillian was a small woman with saltandpepper hair cut in a nononsense style she was also a wererat she turned to me ive made him as comfortable as i can will he heal she nodded yes the real danger with this type of injury once you survive the shock and blood loss is infection we cant get infections lets hear it for the terminally furry i said she smiled and patted my shoulder i know humor is your way of dealing with stress but dont try it on rafael tonight he wants to speak with you is he well enough no but he is my king and he wont let me put him under until hes spoken with you ill go look in on our other patient while you hear whatever he thinks is so important i touched her arm before she could move past me how is sylvie lillian wouldnt look at me then finally she did physically shell heal but im not a therapist im not equipped to deal with the aftereffects of an attack like this i want her to stay here for the night but shes insisting that she go with you my eyes widened why lillian shrugged i think she feels safe with you i think she doesnt feel safe here the older woman was suddenly looking very intently at my face is there a reason she shouldnt feel safe here i thought about that have the wereleopards ever been treated here yes she said damn why should that matter this is a neutral place we have all agreed to that i shook my head for tonight youre safe but anything that elizabeth knew the master of beasts knows by tomorrow this may not be a safe haven do you know that for sure she asked no but i dont know for sure that you will be safe either she nodded very well take sylvie with you then but rafael must stay here at least for one night i will make plans to move him by tomorrow she looked around at all the medical equipment we cant take it all but well do what we can now go talk to our king she left the room i was suddenly alone in the hush of the basement i looked at rafael theyd arranged a sort of tent of a sheet over his body covered but not touching the naked skin was covered in salve but no bandages anything they could put on it would hurt worse than nothing they were treating it sort of like a burn i didnt know everything theyd done to treat him because id been off getting my hand stitched up part of the time i walked around the table so that rafael wouldnt have to move his head to look at me moving was bad his eyes were closed but his breathing was fast and ragged he wasnt asleep lillian said you wanted to talk to me he blinked and looked at me his eyes rolled at an awkward angle he tried to move his head and a sound came from low in his chest id never heard a sound quite like it i didnt want to hear it again dont move please i found a little stool with wheels on it and brought it over with me sitting we were nearly the same height you should let her pump you full of drugs you need to sleep if you can first he said i must know how you freed me he took a deeper breath and the pain passed over his face in a flinching wave i looked away then back no flinching i bargained for you what his hands spasmed and he closed his full lips into a tightpressed line when he spoke again his voice was lower more careful as if even a normal speaking voice hurt what did you give up for me nothing he would not have given me up so easily rafael stared at me his dark eyes willing me to tell him the truth he thought i was lying that was why he couldnt rest he thought id done something noble and awful to save him i sighed and told him a very abbreviated version of the night it was the easiest way to explain see it didnt cost any extra to throw you in he almost smiled the wererats will remember what you did tonight anita i will remember maybe we dont go shopping together or even out to the shooting range but you are my friend rafael i know that if i called you for help youd come yes he said yes i would i smiled at him ill go get lillian now okay he closed his eyes and some piece of tension flowed out of him it was almost as if now he could finally give himself over to the pain yes yes i sent lillian into him and went to find sylvie she was in a small room where lillian had hoped she could get some sleep sylvie had been joined by her lady friend significant other lover whatever jason had called her i hadnt known she existed gwens voice came very clearly down the hallway you have to tell her sylvie you have to i couldnt hear sylvies answer but then the high heels werent quiet they knew i was coming i stepped in through the open door to find gwen looking at me and sylvie decidedly not the white pillow framed her very short very curly brown hair she was three inches taller than me but managed to look fragile in the small bed gwen sat in a straightbacked chair beside the bed holding sylvies hand in both of her own gwen had long softly waving blond hair and big brown eyes in a delicate face everything about her was dainty feminine like a pale finely made doll but the intensity in her face the intelligence in her eyes was a vibrating thing gwen was a psychologist she would have been a compelling person even without the trickle of lycanthropic energy that trailed around her like perfume what do you need to tell me i said how do you know i was referring to you gwen said call it a hunch she patted sylvies hand tell her sylvie turned her head but still wouldnt meet my eyes i leaned against the wall and waited the machine gun pressed into the small of my back forcing me to lean mostly shoulders against the cinderblock wall why hadnt i taken some of the weapons off lay a gun down somewhere and thats when youll need it most i trusted the traveler to keep his word but not enough to bet my life on it silence spilled into the small room until the whirr of the air conditioner was as loud as the blood in your own ears sylvie finally looked at me the master of beasts ordered stephens brother to rape me she looked down then up again anger spilling into her eyes gregory refused i didnt bother to hide the surprise on my face i thought gregory was one of the stars of rainas porno films he was sylvie said softly what i wanted to ask was when did he get to be squeamish but that seemed crude did he suddenly grow a conscience i asked i dont know she was staring at the sheet holding onto gwens hands like there was worse to come he refused to help torture me the master of beasts said hed punish him gregory still refused he said that zane had told him that anita was their new alpha that all bargains made through elizabeth werent binding that he needed to deal with you for them sylvie withdrew her hand from gwens and stared up at me her brown eyes were furious but it wasnt me she was angry with you cant be their leader and our lupa you cant be both he was lying i sighed afraid not but how look its late and were all tired lets just do the short version i killed gabriel technically that makes me the wereleopards leader zane acknowledged me after i put a couple of nonsilver bullets in him why didnt you kill him sylvie asked its sort of my fault i didnt understand what leaving them without a leader would mean someone should have told me that they were meat for anybody with out a leader i wanted them to suffer sylvie said i was told you wanted them all dead that if you had your way the pack would have hunted them down and killed them all yes she said yes i want them all dead i know they helped punish you and other pack members she shook her head hands in front of her eyes it took me a second to realize she was crying you dont understand theres a film of me out there a film of the leopards raping me she brought her hands down and stared at me with tearfilled eyes the rage and pain in her face was raw i was outspoken against raina and marcus it was my punishment raina wanted to make an example of me for the others it worked too everyone was scared after that i opened my mouth closed it then said i didnt realize now do you see why i want them dead yes i said gregory had raped me once why wouldnt he do it again why did he refuse to hurt me tonight if he really believes that im his leader then he knows what id do to him did you mean it in the room did you mean it about us killing them all oh yeah i said i meant it then gregory was right i frowned at her what do you mean he said you were their lйoparde lionnй their rampant leopard i dont know the term i said gwen answered lйoparde lionnй is a term from french heraldry its a leopard or even a lion rampant in action on a crest it symbolizes brave and generous warriors having done some brave deed in this case it means a protector even an avenger gabriel was a lion passant a sleeping lion he led but did not protect in effect gregory did not merely refuse to harm sylvie he also told the master of beasts that if he was harmed you would save him how can i be their lйoparde whatyoucallit if im not a leopard lйoparde lionnй sylvie said how can you be lupa and neither be wolf nor our ulfrics lover she had me there fresh tears streamed down sylvies face padma tried to get vivian his personal pet while hes here to do things to me said i liked women and maybe that would loosen my tongue she refused and she gave the same reason that gregory did i remembered vivian staring at me her frightened eyes pleading for me to help her shit you mean she really expected me to rescue her tonight sylvie just nodded gwen said yes shit i honestly didnt think of it until after we were in the jeep i swear i didnt think of it sooner sylvie said but i didnt say anything because i wanted them to suffer i cant stop hating them just like that do you understand i did sylvie you and i have one thing in common we are both vindictive as hell so yeah i understand but we cant leave them there like that not if they were expecting to be saved she wiped at the tears you cant go up against them tonight we cant do anymore tonight im not planning to fight anymore tonight sylvie but youre planning something she sounded worried i smiled yeah gwen stood dont be foolish anita i shook my head foolish im way past foolish i stopped in the doorway and turned back by the way sylvie dont challenge richard ever her eyes widened how did you know i shrugged doesnt matter what does matter is that ill kill you if you kill him it would be a fair fight i dont care you havent seen him anita hes on the edge you can forbid me from challenging him but there are others and they wont be nearly as good for the pack as i am then make it carte blanche i said if anyone kills richard ill execute them no challenge no fair fight ill just take them out you cant do that sylvie said oh i think i can im lupa remember if you forbid fights of succession gwen said youre undermining richard youre saying in effect that you dont believe he can really lead the pack ive been told by two pack members today that richard is out of control damn near suicidal that hes pulled his selfhatred his loathing of his beast and my rejection down around his ears i wont let him die because i chose someone else in a few months when hes healthier then ill step down ill let him take care of himself but not right now ill pass the word gwen said you do that youre going to try and bring out the leopards tonight arent you sylvie said i kept seeing the bruises on vivians body the pleading in her eyes they expected me to save them and i didnt you didnt know gwen said i know now i said you cant save everyone sylvie said everyone needs a hobby i started to walk out again but gwen called me back i turned in the doorway tell her the rest gwen said softly sylvie wouldnt look at me she spoke staring down at the sheet when vivian refused to hurt me they called in liv she looked up tears glittering in her eyes she used things on me did things to me sylvie covered her face with her hands and rolled onto her side crying gwen met my eyes the look on her face was frightening in its hatred you need to know who to kill i nodded she wont leave st louis alive and the other one the council members son gwen asked him either i said promise it she said i already have i said i walked out then searching for a phone i wanted to talk to jeanclaude before i did anything jeanclaude had taken everyone else to my house they were boarding up the basement windows so that the vamps could be tucked safely away before dawn the traveler had refused to let them take their coffins besides have you ever tried to rent a truck on a weekend after midnight what was i going to do about the wereleopards damned if i knew jeanclaudes voice floated over the phone my phone my house hed never been there before what has happened ma petite jason made it sound urgent i told him about the wereleopards he was quiet for so long i had to say something talk to me jeanclaude are you actually thinking of endangering us all for the sake of two people one of whom you have never met before and the other who you once described as a waste of skin i cant leave them there if they expected me to help them ma petite ma petite you have a sense of noblesse oblige that does you credit but we cannot save them tomorrow evening the council will come for us and we may not even be able to save ourselves are they here to kill us padma would kill us if he could he is the weakest of the council and i think he fears us the travelers the one we have to convince i said no ma petite the council are seven in number always an odd number so that a vote may settle a question padma and the traveler will vote against one another this is true it has been true for centuries but yvette is here to vote in the place of her lord morte damour she hates padma but she may hate me more for that matter balthasar could persuade the traveler against us and we are lost what about everybody else do they represent anybody asher speaks for belle morte beautiful death it is her line that i am descended from as is he he hates your guts i said we are sunk i believe the choice of four was very deliberate they wish me to take a council seat so i am the fifth vote if the traveler votes with you and yvette hates padma more than she hates you ma petite if i act as a voting member of the council then they will expect me to return to france and take my place on the council france i said he laughed and it slithered over the phone like a swarm touch it is not leaving our fair city that frightens me ma petite it is holding the seat if the triumvirate were fully formed perhaps perhaps it would he possible to appear frightening enough to force wouldbe challengers to choose another are you saying without the fourth mark the triumvirate is useless silence on his end so long and deep that i said jeanclaude i am here ma petite the fourth mark will not make our triumvirate functional unless richard heals himself you mean his hatred of me his jealousy of us together yes that is a problem but not the only one ma petite his loathing of his beast is so intense it weakens him weaken any link in a chain and it may snap did you know about whats been happening in the pack richard has forbidden any of the wolves to tell me anything without his permission i believe you are under the same restriction it is and i quote none of my damn business im surprised you didnt force jason to tell you anyway have you seen richard within the last month no i have he is on the edge ma petite i did not need jason to tell me it is plain for all to see his torment will be viewed as a weakness among the pack weakness attracts them like blood to a vampire they will challenge him eventually ive had two lukoi tell me that they dont think richard will fight that hell just let someone kill him do you believe that suicide by simply not defending himself hard enough hmm he was quiet again then finally said i had not thought of such a thing if i had ma petite i would have told you of my concerns i do not wish richard harm yeah right he is our third ma petite it is in my own interest to make him healthy and happy i need him like you need me i said he laughed low and deep and even over the phone i could feel it tickling along my body oui ma petite richard must not die but to cure his despair he must embrace his beast i cannot help him do that i have tried and he will not hear me he takes what limited help he needs to keep himself from invading your dreams or you his but beyond that he wants nothing from us nothing he will admit whats that supposed to mean i asked it is your tender mercies that he needs ma petite not mine tender mercies i made it a question if you could accept his beast completely it would mean something to him i cant jeanclaude i wish i could but i cant i saw him eat marcus i id only seen richard shapeshift once hed been injured from the fight with marcus he halfcollapsed with me underneath him id been trapped under him while fur flowed muscles formed and shifted bones broke and reknit clear liquid had gushed from his power pouring over me in a nearscalding wave maybe if id just been watching it would have been different but trapped under him feeling his body do things on top of me that bodies were never meant to do it had been too much if richard had handled it differently if i had seen him change in a nice calm way from a distance then built up to the whole ride maybe maybe but it had happened and i couldnt forget it i could still close my eyes and see his manwolf shape gulping down a red bloody piece of marcus i leaned my back against the wall cradling the receiver i was rocking ever so slightly it reminded me of jason in the hallway i made myself stand very still i wanted to forget i wanted to be able to accept richard but i couldnt ma petite are you all right fine im fine jeanclaude let that go he really was getting smarter at least about me i do not wish to cause you distress ive done what i can for richard on my end i told jeanclaude what id told the werewolves you surprise me ma petite i thought you wanted nothing more to do with the lukoi i dont want richard to die because i broke his heart you would feel responsible if he died now is that it yeah he took a deep breath and let it sigh over the phone it made me shiver for no particular reason how badly do you wish to help the wereleopards what kind of question is that an important one he said what are you willing to risk for them what would you endure for them you have something specific in mind dont you padma might give up vivian in exchange for you gregorys freedom could be won if we gave them jason i notice youre not trading yourself in i said padma would not want me ma petite he is neither a lover of men nor of other vampires in particular he prefers his companions warm and female why jason then a werewolf for a wereleopard might be an acceptable trade to him not to me we are not trading one hostage for another and i am certainly not giving myself to that monster you see ma petite you will not endure that you will not risk jason to save gregory i ask again what will you risk for them ill risk my life but only if ive got a good chance of getting out alive no sex absolutely not no trading one hostage for another nobody else gets skinned alive or raped hows that for parameters padma and fernando will be disappointed but the others might agree i will do the best i can within the limits you have given me no rape no maiming no actual intercourse no hostages does that really tie your hands that much when we have survived all this ma petite and the council has gone home i will tell you stories of my time at court i have seen spectacles that even in the telling would give you nightmares nice to know you think were going to survive i am hopeful yes but not certain i said nothing is certain ma petite not even death he had me there my beeper went off it pulled a gasp from my throat nervous who me are you all right ma petite my beeper went off i said i checked the number it was dolph its the police i need to return the call i will begin negotiations with the council ma petite if they ask too much i will let your leopards remain where they are padma will kill vivian now that he thinks she belongs to me he might have killed her before but it would have been by accident if we dont get her out of there hell do it on purpose one meeting with him and you are so sure of this you think im wrong i asked no ma petite i think you are exactly right get them out of there jeanclaude make the best deal you can i have your permission to use your name in this yeah my beeper went off a second time dolph impatient as usual ive got to go jeanclaude very well ma petite i will bargain for us all then you do that i said wait yes ma petite you arent going to go back to the circus in person tonight are you i dont want you in there alone i said i will use the phone if you prefer he said i do you dont trust them he said not hardly wise beyond your years he said suspicious beyond my years you mean that as well ma petite if they will not negotiate over the phone he asked then let it go you said you were willing to risk your life ma petite i didnt say i was willing to risk yours ah he said je taime ma petite i love you too i said he hung up first and i dialed the police here was hoping whatever dolph had in mind was some nice straightforward police work yeah right the victim had been rushed to a hospital by the time i arrived at burnt offerings its one of my favorites of the newer vampire businesses it was far from the vampire district the only other vamp businesses were blocks miles away as you walked through the doors there was a poster from the s movie burnt offerings oliver reed and bette davis staring down at you there was a life size waxwork of christopher lee as dracula in the bar there was one wall with framed caricatures of horror stars of the sixties and seventies floor to ceiling no tables allowed to obstruct the view it wasnt uncommon to see clusters of visitors trying to identify who was who at midnight whoever had the most correct guesses got a free dinner for two the place was pure schlock some of the waiters were real vamps but others were just wannabes for some it was just a job and they specialized in plastic halloween teeth and jokes for others it was their chance to pretend they had dental caps over their canines and worked very hard at being the real thing other waiters or waitresses were dressed up as mummies the wolf man frankensteins monster to my knowledge the only real monsters were the vamps if a shapeshifter wanted to come out of the closet there was better money to be made in more exotic locales the place was always packed i wasnt sure whether jeanclaude was sorry he hadnt thought of it first or if he was simply embarrassed by it it was a little dйclassй for him me i loved it from the haunted house soundtrack to the bela lugosi burgers extra rare unless otherwise requested bela was one of the few exceptions to the s and s movie decor hard to have a horror theme restaurant without the original movie dracula you havent lived until youve been there on a friday night for scary karaoke i took ronnie veronica ronnie sims is a private detective and my best friend we had a blast but back to the body all right not a body a victim but if the bartender hadnt been fast with a fire extinguisher it would have been a body detective clive perry was the man in charge hes tall slender sort of denzel washington without the broad shoulders hes one of the most polite people ive ever met ive never heard him yell and only seen him lose his composure oncewhen a large white cop had pointed a gun at the nigger detective even then i was the one who pointed my gun at the rogue cop i was the one that was ready to shoot while perry was still trying to talk the situation down maybe i overreacted maybe i didnt no one died he turned with a smile soft voice ms blake good to see you good to see you too detective perry he always affected me this way he was so polite so softspoken that i fell into the same pattern i was never this nice to anyone else we were in the bar with its lifesize waxwork of christopher lee as dracula looming over us the bartender was a vamp named harry who had long auburn hair and a silver stud in his nose he looked very young very cutting edge and could probably remember the jamestown charter though his british accent showed he was newer to the country than the s he was polishing the bar like his life depended on it even with his nice blank face i could tell he was nervous couldnt blame him i guess harry was part owner as well as bartender a woman had been attacked in the bar by a vampire patron very bad for business the woman had thrown a drink in his face and lit him with her lighter ingenious in an emergency vamps burn really well but the quiet bar in a familyoriented tourist trap didnt seem the place for such extreme measures maybe she panicked witnesses all say she seemed friendly until he got a little too close perry said did he bite her perry nodded shit i said but she lit him up anita hes badly burned he may not make it what could she have thrown on him to get thirddegree burns so quickly how quickly he checked his notes seconds and he went up i asked harry what was she drinking he didnt ask who just said straight scotch best we had in the place high alcohol content he nodded that would have been enough i said once you get a vamp burning they burn until theyre put out theyre very combustible so she didnt come in here with some sort of accelerant he asked i shook my head she didnt need it what i dont like is the fact that she knew to light the drink if hed been human and gotten out of hand shed have thrown the drink and yelled for help he did bite her perry said if she had that much problem with a vampire sinking fang in her she wouldnt have been cuddling with him in a bar somethings off about this yes he said but i dont know what if the vampire survives hes going to be up on charges id like to see the woman dolph took her to the emergency room to get the bite tended hes got her down at our headquarters he said to come on down if you think you need to see her it was late and i was tired but dammit something was wrong i walked over to the bar was she trolling for vamps harry he shook his head came in to use the phone then sat down shes a beauty didnt take long for someone to hit on her just bad luck it was a vampire yeah i said bad luck he kept polishing the bar in small round circles while his eyes watched me if she sues us itll ruin us she wont sue i said tell that to the crematorium in boston a woman got bit there and sued them out of business they had pickets going outside i patted his hand and he went utterly still under my touch his skin had that hard almost wooden feel that vamps can have when they arent trying to be human i met his dark eyes and his face was as immobile and unreadable as glass ill go talk to the supposed victim he just looked at me it wont help anita shes human were not nothing they do in washington will change that i took my hand away and resisted an urge to wipe it on my dress i never liked the way vamps felt when they went hard and otherworldly they didnt feel like flesh then almost plastic like a dolphin but harder as if there was no muscle underneath nothing but solidness like a tree ill do what i can harry were monsters anita well always be monsters ive really enjoyed being able to walk the streets like everyone else but it wont last maybe maybe not i said lets take care of this problem before we borrow another one okay he nodded and walked away to stack glasses that was very comforting of you perry said anyone else on the squad would have said it wasnt like me to be comforting of course anyone else would have already given me a hard time about the dress i was going to have to go down to rpit headquarters dolph would be there and zerbrowski probably theyd know just what to say about the dress three oclock found me at the headquarters for the regional preternatural investigation team another squad had buttons made up for us with the abbreviation rip bleeding down the front of the button in red or green your choice zerbrowski handed them out and we all wore them even dolph the first vampire we killed after the buttons arrived came through the morgue with one of the buttons pinned to its shirt never did find out who did it my money was on zerbrowski zerbrowski met me on the steps leading into the squad room if that dress was slit any higher itd be a shirt he said i looked him up and down his pale blue shirt was coming untucked from a pair of dark green dress slacks his tie so loose it looked like a bulky necklace jeez zerbrowski is katie mad at you he frowned no why i motioned at the tie that matched neither shirt nor slacks she let you wear this out where people could see you he grinned i dressed in the dark i touched the blackfigured tie that i believe but it didnt faze him he pushed the door open to the squad room with a flourish he beamed at me beauty before age it was my turn to frown what are you up to zerbrowski he gave me innocent eyes me up to something i shook my head and walked through the door there was a stuffed toy penguin on every desk everyone answered phones filed worked on their computers no one paid me any attention just the penguins sitting on every desk it had been almost a year since dolph and zerbrowski had seen my penguin collection the teasing didnt start right away i thought i was safe when zerbrowski got back off sick leave after the new year the penguins had started showing up at every creme scene on my car seat in my trunk they must have spent a couple of hundred dollars on the things by now i still didnt know how to react ignore it pretend that there werent a dozen penguins sitting around the room collect them as i went through the room and take them home get mad if i could have figured out the reaction that would stop the joke id have given it to them so far id tried ignoring and collecting neither stopped it in fact it seemed to be getting worse i suspected that they were building to some grand climax i had no idea what and wasnt sure i ever wanted to find out glad to see everybodys so energetic at three am no effort too great no hour too late zerbrowski said wheres dolph in the interview room with our victim there was something about the way he said it that made me look at him dolph called her the supposed victim over the phone why doesnt anyone believe her he smiled dolph would be mad if i spoiled it he crooked his finger at me come along little girl we have someone we want you to meet i scowled at him if this is some elaborate joke i am going to be pissed he held the door for me did we interrupt your date with count dracula none of your damn business a chorus of ooohs went through the squad room i went through the door with everyone calling after me some of the suggestions were rude one physically impossible even with a vampire sexual harassment or just being one of the guys it was always a thin line i peeked back through the door and said youre all just jealous that brought more catcalls zerbrowski was waiting on the stairs for me i dont know whether youll flash me more leg if i walk in front of you looking back or behind you i think in front push it too far zerbrowski and ill tell katie on you she knows im a lech he walked down the stairs looking back at me i walked down the stairs and let the dress fall where it might when you wear a dress slit nearly to your hips even if it is to have a gun handy you are either comfortable with men looking or you wear something else how did you ever convince katie to date you let alone marry you i got her drunk he said i laughed ill ask her next time im over for dinner he grinned shell give you this cockandbull story about something romantic and stupid dont believe her he stopped in front of the first interview room and knocked softly dolph opened the door he filled the doorway very completely he isnt just tall hes bulky like a prowrestler his tie was knotted perfectly whitestarched collar tight to his neck his grey dress slacks still had a sharp crease his only concession to the heat and the lateness of the hour was the long white sleeves of his shirt no jacket i could count on one hand the times id seen dolph in shirt sleeves all cops perfect a bored face or a blank face some even a mildly amused face but they all eventually have a face that keeps everything inside an emptiness settles in their eyes that keeps all their secrets dolph gave great blank face when questioning suspects the look on his face now was angry id never seen him so obviously pissed questioning a suspect whats up i asked he closed the door behind him stepping into the hallway he shook his head i dont know why this ones getting to me tell me i said his eyes flicked to my clothing as if hed just noticed the frown softened into something close to a smile somebody has become a bad influence on your wardrobe i frowned at him ive got a gun in a bellyband okay with the slits its easier to get to i would never have explained my dress to zerbrowski but to dolph ooh zerbrowski said flash us flash us dolphs smile widened enough that his eyes were shiny if youre going to flash that much leg at least its in a good cause i crossed my arms over my stomach is there really a suspect in there or did you call me down here just to yank my chain the smile faded and the angry frown returned shes not the suspect shes the victim i know you talked to perry at the scene but i want you to hear her story then tell me what you think with that he opened the door that was dolph never liked to influence his people but frankly it was a little abrupt i didnt have time to put my professional face on i made eye contact with the woman while i still looked sort of surprised i had an impression of huge blue eyes silky blond hair delicate features and yet she was tall even with her sitting down i could tell that very few women can be both tall and dainty but she pulled it off ms vicki pierce this is anita blake id like you to tell her your story ms pierce blinked big blue eyes tears welling in themnot falling mind you but glittering she dabbed at them with a kleenex there was a bandage on the side of her neck sergeant storr ive told you what happened ive told you and told you a single tear slid down her cheek im so tired and its been such a traumatic night do i have to tell it all over again she leaned towards him in the chair arms held protectively in front of her almost pleading with him a lot of men would have buckled under the sweet pressure of those eyes too bad the performance was wasted on dolph just one more time for ms blake he said she looked past me to zerbrowski please im so tired zerbrowski leaned against the wall hes the boss shed tried using her womanly wiles but it wasnt working she switched to sisterly unity with only a blink of her baby blues youre a woman you know how it is being so alone among all these her voice dropped to a hush men she stared down at the table top then back up with real tears trailing down her perfect skin it was an oscarworthy performance i wanted to applaud but id try sympathy first there was always time for sarcasm later i walked around the table to her and leaned against it without really sitting i was only inches from her definitely an invasion of personal space i patted her shoulder and smiled though i wasnt a good enough actress for it to reach my eyes youre not alone now ms pierce im here please just tell me your story are you a lawyer she asked if she asked for a lawyer and was insistent the interview was over i knelt in front of her taking her still trembling hands in mine i stared up at her i couldnt manage to look sympathetic but i was interested i gave her all my attention i stared at her face like id memorize it and said please vicki let me help you her hands had gone very still under mine she stared at me with her big eyes like a deer that had scented the gun but thought if it held very still the gun wouldnt fire she nodded almost to herself more than to me she gripped my hands and her face was utterly sincere i had car trouble and i went into the bar side of a restaurant to use the phone she ducked her head not meeting my eyes i know i shouldnt have gone in there a woman in a bar alone is just asking for trouble but there werent any phones anywhere else you have a right to go anywhere you want anytime you want vicki being a woman doesnt take away that right i didnt have to pretend to sound outraged she looked at me again eyes studying my face i could almost see the wheels in her head turning she thought she had me god she was young her fingers tightened on my hands a fine tremor going up her arms i called a friend of mine to come look at the car im in college and dont have a lot of money so i didnt want to call a garage right away not until my friend had seen the car i hoped he could fix it she was volunteering too much information already justifying herself or maybe shed just told the story too many times naw id have done the same thing i said and i might have she squeezed my hands and leaned towards me a little eager getting into her story there was this man at the bar he seemed nice we talked and he asked me to sit with him i told him i was waiting for my friend he said fine wed just talk again she looked down he said i had the most beautiful skin hed ever seen she looked back at me eyes wide i mean it was so romantic it was so rehearsed go on i let him buy me a drink i know i shouldnt have she dabbed at her eyes i asked if he minded me smoking and he said no there was a full ashtray at her elbow neither dolph nor zerbrowski smoked which meant little vicki was damn near a chain smoker he had his arm around me and leaned in to kiss me i thought the tears came faster she hunched over a little back shaking he bit me on the neck i swear until that second i didnt realize he was a vampire she looked at me from inches away vibrating with sincerity i patted her arm a lot of people cant tell vampires from humans especially if theyve fed first she blinked at me fed first if a vampire is full of blood then he looks more human she nodded oh what did you do when he bit you i threw my drink at him and lit it with my lighter lit it i said it the liquor or it the vampire both she said i nodded vamps are very combustible he burned real good didnt he i didnt know hed go up in flames like he did she said a person just doesnt burn like that no i said they dont i started to scream and run away from him my friend came in the door then people were shouting and screaming it was awful i stood up i bet it was she stared up me blue eyes sincere but not full of horror for what shed done there was no remorse she gripped my arm suddenly very tight as if she could will me to understand i had to protect myself i placed my hand over hers and smiled what made you think of lighting the liquor once youd thrown it i remembered that vampires were afraid of fire but if you threw a drink in a humans face and lit it it would only burn until the liquor was gone a whoosh and it would be all over a human would leave you alone after that though theyd be hurt werent you afraid that youd just make the vampire more angry but vampires are very combustible you said it yourself vicki said my smile widened so you knew hed go up in flames yes she said clutching me willing me to understand her plight dolph said i thought you didnt know the vampire would go up in flames ms pierce i didnt not until he burned like that she said i patted her hand but vicki dear you just said you knew he was combustible but you said it first vicki you just said you knew hed go up in flames when you lit him up i didnt i nodded yes you did she drew her hands away from me sitting very straight in her chair you are trying to confuse me i shook my head no vicki youre doing that all on your own i moved away from her while still maintaining eye contact whats that supposed to mean she asked a little bit of anger peeked through her helplessdamsel act what restaurant was it i asked as if i hadnt been there twenty minutes earlier interrogations are so often repetitive what she asked what was the name of the bar i dont remember dolph i asked burnt offerings he said i laughed a notorious vampire hangout its not in the vampire district she said how was i to know that it was a vampire bar how about the picture of christopher lee as dracula on the sign outside i said it was quite late and nothing else was open in university city on delmar on a friday night come on vicki you can do better than that i said she touched the bandage on her neck with a delicate trembling hand he bit me her voice shook and more tears trailed down her face i walked back to her i put a hand on either side of her chair and leaned my face into hers youre lying vicki she burst into tears hiding her face i put a finger under her chin and lifted her face damn youre good but not good enough she jerked away from me standing so suddenly the chair crashed to the floor i was attacked and youre making me feel like the bad guy youre a woman i thought youd understand i shook my head can the universal sisterhood appeal vicki it dont wash she jerked the bandage from her neck and threw it to the floor look look what he did to me if she expected me to flinch she had the wrong girl i walked up to her turning her head to one side it was vampire fang marks pretty fresh a neat nice bite but there was no bruising no hickey mark spreading across her creamy flesh it was just two neat fang marks i stepped back from her you threw your drink into his face as soon as he bit you yes i didnt want him touching me a filthy vampire i said a walking corpse she had a point thank you vicki thank you for talking to me i walked to the door and motioned dolph to follow zerbrowski stayed behind with ms pierce dolph closed the door behind us what did you see in the bite that i didnt he asked if a vamp plunges fang into you but doesnt have time to feed much it leaves a hickey just like a human sucking on your neck the fangs arent hollow they just pierce the skin so that the vamp can suck the blood one of the reasons theyre so small if the vamp feeds long enough he takes blood away from the area and you dont get marking no way did a quick bite and suck leave her clean like that she had someone else do it ahead of time and it took a lot more time than a few seconds i knew she was lying dolph said and shook his head but i thought shed thrown more on him than a drink i thought shed come into the bar with some sort of accelerant i shook my head once you get a vamp burning they burn until theyre put out or burned to ash you may get a few bone fragments left but vamps burn more completely than any human dental records wont even help you the bartender used a fire extinguisher from behind the bar witnesses say he was quick i nodded yeah good ol harry its a miracle the vamp is still alive i know theres some hardcore opposition to a vampire business outside the vampire district theres a petition and some sort of city meeting scheduled ms pierce will make a great witness to the dangers of vampires being outside the district the restaurant owner said the bad publicity could ruin him i nodded oh yeah it could also be a personal motive against the vampire not little miss blue eyes but someone she knows that wanted him dead she could be a member of humans first theyd love all the vamps to burn a fanatical vampire hater wouldnt let a vamp do their neck like that no humans first might have paid her to discredit the bar she may be a member of humans against vampires hav or even humans first but she doesnt really believe the bite proves that could the vamp have captured her mind i dont think so but ive got some better questions for your other witnesses now such as he asked are they sure the vampire in question even got a taste of her are they positive that he bit her ask them if she smelled of blood when she came in explain dolph said if she came in with the bite then some of them might have smelled it might not the wound was pretty clean which was probably why the vamp did it that way if hed just bitten her and brought the blood to the surface the vamps would have all scented it dolph was writing it all down in his trusty notebook so a vamps involved he may not know what she was planning to do id check for a vamp boyfriend maybe or at least one shes dated boyfriend may be too strong a word for ms pierce id see if she has some background in acting check out her major in college maybe already done dolph said shes got a background in theater arts i smiled why did you need me you had it all solved the bite the fact that vampires burn that easily he shook his head none of this shit is in the literature the books arent designed for police work dolph maybe you should do a book he said yeah right do you have enough to get a warrant for her bank records if im careful what judge i ask maybe you know even if she is charged and convicted the damage is done the petition and the meeting are scheduled for next week all theyll have is rumors of an attack and it will grow in the telling dolph nodded nothing we can do about that you could go down there and tell them what youve learned about vicki in there why dont you do it because im the whore of babylon to the rightwingers im boffing the head bloodsucker they wouldnt believe a damn thing i said i dont have time to attend civic meetings anita you think the vampire businesses should be segregated i asked dont go there anita you wont like the answers i dropped it dolph thought vampires were monsters that the public needed to be protected from i even agreed with him to an extent but i was sleeping with one of the monsters it made it hard to stay on the same bandwagon as dolph we agreed to disagree it kept the peace and kept us working together if you hate vamps so much why didnt you buy ms pierces story i asked because im not stupid dolph said sorry i said sorry that i thought even for a second that personal feelings might interfere with your job youd never allow it would you he smiled i dont know youre not in jail yet if you had proof of wrongdoing i might be you might he said the smile faded from his face his eyes went empty cop eyes what happened to your hand i glanced down at the bandaged hand as if it had just appeared kitchen accident i said kitchen accident he said yeah what happened sliced my hand with a knife what were you doing he asked i never cook at home dolph knew that slicing a bagel i gave empty eyes back to him once not long ago my face showed everything every thought plain to see but not now i stared at dolphs suspicious face and knew my face gave him nothing only the blankness itself was a clue that i was lying but he knew i was lying i wasnt going to waste his time or mine by coming up with a really good lie why bother we stared at each other theres blood on your hose anita that must have been some bagel he said it was i said then couldnt help smiling i would have said i was mugged but youd want me to fill out a report he sighed you little shit youre wrapped up in something else right now right this minute his large hands balled into fists nearly the size of my face id yell at you but it wouldnt do any good id throw you in a cell overnight he laughed and it was bitter for whats left of the night but i dont have any charges do i i havent done anything dolph i raised the injured hand i was doing a favor for a friend raising some dead i got cut for more blood thats it the truth he asked i nodded yeah why didnt you just tell me he asked because it was a favor no money if bert finds out im raising the dead for free hell have a heart attack hell believe the bagel story dolph laughed he wont ask how you got hurt he doesnt want to know i nodded very true just in case the kitchen gets any hotter remember to call if you need help ill keep it in mind dolph you do that he put up his notebook try not to kill anyone this month anita even in clear selfdefense you pile up too many bodies and youre going to get locked up i havent killed anyone in over six weekshell nearly seven im cutting down he shook his head the last two were the only two weve ever been able to prove anita both selfdefense one with witnesses out the ass but weve never found harold gaynors body just his wheelchair in that cemetery dominga salvador is still missing i smiled at him people say the seсora went back to south america there was blood all over that chair anita was there your luck is going to run out and i wont be able to help you i didnt ask for help i said besides if the new law goes through ill have a federal badge being a cop no matter what kind doesnt mean you cant be arrested it was my turn to sigh im tired and im going home good night dolph he looked at me for another second or two then said good night anita he walked back into the interview room and left me standing in the hall dolph had never been this grumpy before he found out i was dating jeanclaude i wasnt sure he was aware of how much his attitude had changed towards me but i certainly was a little undead nookie and he didnt trust me anymore not completely it made me sad and angry what was really hard was the fact that less than two months ago id have agreed with dolph you cant trust anyone who sleeps with the monsters but here i was doing it me anita blake turned into coffin bait sad very sad it wasnt any of dolphs business who i dated but i couldnt blame him for the attitude i didnt like it but i couldnt bitch about it okay i could bitch but it wasnt fair of me to do it i walked out without going through the main squad room again i wondered how long theyd keep the penguins on their desks waiting for me to come back the thought of all those sillylooking toy birds sitting forlornly waiting for me to return brought a smile to my face but it didnt last it wasnt just that dolph mistrusted me he was a very good cop a good investigator if he really started digging he might get proof heaven knew id done enough unsanctioned kills to put me in prison id used my animating powers to kill humans if it could be proved it was an automatic death sentence a death sentence for someone who had used magic to kill was not the same sort of sentence as say an axe murderer got a guy could chop up his family and spend the next fifteen years on death row with appeals there are no appeals for magicinduced murder trial conviction death within six weeks usually less the prisons are afraid of magic and dont like to keep witches and such around long there was a sorcerer in maine who called down demons while in his cell how anyone left him alone long enough for that particular ritual i dont know the people who had goofed all ended up dead so they couldnt be questioned they never did find the heads even i couldnt raise enough of them as zombies to get them to talk or write down what had happened it was a mess the sorcerer escaped but was later recaptured with the help of a coven of white witches and strangely a group of satanists nobody who performs magic likes it when someone goes rogue it gives us all a bad name the last witch burned alive by a mob in this country was only in her name was agnes simpson id seen the blackandwhite photos of her death anyone who studied preternatural anything had to have her picture in at least one textbook the photo that stayed with me was one in which her face was untouched pale even from a distance terror plain on her face her long brown hair moving in the heat but not yet burning only her nightgown and robe had caught fire her head thrown back screaming the photo won the pulitzer prize the rest of the photos arent seen as often a progression of photographs that ends with her burned and blackened and dead how anyone could stand there and keep taking pictures i dont know maybe the pulitzer prize was a charm against nightmares then again maybe not i pulled into the lot of the apartment building with its secret hospital in the basement it was nearly five dawn pressed like a cool hand against the wind the sky was grey caught between darkness and light that trembling edge where the vampires are still moving and you can get your throat ripped out moments from sunrise a taxi drew up in front of the building a tall woman with very short blond hair got out she was wearing a very short skirt and a leather jacket no shoes zane got out next someone had paid his bail and it wasnt me which meant he had been in the beast masters tender care just luck that he hadnt been part of sylvies torment if hed refused hed have been hurt worse than he appeared to be if hed done it id have had to kill him that would have been damned awkward he saw me walking towards them i put the long coat and its weaponry back on zane waved to me smiling he was wearing nothing but shiny black vinyl pants tight enough to be skin and boots oh and a nipple ring mustnt forget the jewelry the tall woman stared at me she didnt look happy to see me not hostile exactly but not pleased the driver said something and she got a wad of bills out of her jacket pocket and paid him the taxi drove away vivian the beast masters pet while he stayed here hadnt gotten out gregory stephens brother with his new conscience hadnt gotten out either i was short at least two wereleopards what was going on zane walked towards me like we were old friends i told you cherry shes our alpha our lйoparde lionnй i knew shed save us he dropped to his knees in front of me my right hand was in my pocket gripping the browning so he had to settle for my left hand id spent enough time around the werewolves to know that being alpha was a touchiefeelie sort of thing like the animals they sometimes were shapeshifters seemed to need the reassurance of touch so i didnt fight it but i did let the safety off the browning zane took my hand gently almost reverently he laid his cheek against my knuckles then rolled his face from side to side like a cat chinmarking me his tongue gave one slow lick to the back of my hand and i gently withdrew it it took a lot of willpower not to wipe my hand on the coat the tall woman cherry i presumed just looked at me she didnt save all of us her voice was an almost startling low contralto it purred even in human form where are vivian and gregory i asked she pointed back the way theyd come back there theyre still back there the deal was that all my people got out zane bounced to his feet the movement was so quick it caught my heart and my throat and my finger went from triggerguard to trigger i set the safety on the browning and eased my hand out they werent going to hurt me but if zane kept bouncing around like a punk version of tigger i might accidently fire the gun my nerves were usually better than this the master of beasts said that anyone who wished to acknowledge your dominance could leave if they could walk out but hed already made sure that gregory and vivian couldnt walk something cold and tight filled my stomach what do you mean vivian was unconscious when we left cherry looked at the ground when she spoke the next words gregory tried to crawl after us but he was hurt too badly she raised her eyes and there were tears trembling in them she kept her eyes very wide he cried after us begged us not to leave him she wiped at the tears with an angry swipe of her hand but i left him i left him screaming because i wanted out of there more than anything else in the world even if it meant leaving my friends to be tortured and killed and raped she hid her face with both her hands and cried zane came up behind her and hugged her gabriel could never keep us all safe either she did her best like hell i said zane looked at me he rubbed his cheek against the side of cherrys neck but his eyes were serious he was glad to be alive but he hadnt wanted to leave them im going to make a phone call i walked into the building and after a few seconds they followed me i used the same phone id called jeanclaude on earlier i only had moments before true dawn and he would be down for the count he answered the phone like hed been expecting the call oui ma petite gregory and vivian didnt make it i thought you negotiated for them the others forced padma to agree but he set up one rule that whoever wished to leave had to walk out i knew what he meant to do but it was the best bargain i could make please believe that fine but i wont leave them if they can split hairs this finely so can we what do you plan ma petite im going back and help them walk out padma didnt say anything about walking out under their own power did he no jeanclaude gave a long sigh dawn is frightfully near ma petite if you must do this thing wait at least two hours time enough for even the most powerful of us to be asleep but do not wait much longer i do not know how much sleep the council members need they may awaken very early ill wait two hours i will send some of the wolves to you with padma asleep they will be useful to you fine i must go the phone went dead and i felt the sun burst above the horizon i felt it like a great weight and for just an instant i couldnt breathe my body felt heavy so heavy then the sensation was gone and i knew that jeanclaude was gone for the day even with three shared marks id never felt anything like that before i knew he protected me from things that the third mark would let me feel he even protected richard of the three of us jeanclaude knew more about the marks how to use them how not to use them and what they really meant months into it all and i hadnt asked many questions sometimes i wasnt sure i wanted to know richard seemed equally reluctant according to jeanclaude the vampire just seemed patient with us like a parent with a backward child cherry leaned against the wall arms crossed over her stomach she wasnt wearing anything under the leather jacket her eyes were cautious like shed been disappointed often and badly youre going in after them why zane was sitting by her legs back against the wall because shes our alpha cherry shook her head why would you risk yourself for two people you dont know i accepted your dominance because i wanted out of there but i dont believe it why would you go back in there i wasnt sure how to explain it they expect me to save them so she said so im going to try why i sighed because because i remember vivians pleading eyes and the bruises on her body because gregory cried and screamed for you not to leave him because padma will hurt them worse now than he would have before because he thinks that by hurting them he hurts me i shook my head im going to find a bed for a couple of hours i suggest you do the same but you dont have to come with me this thing is strictly volunteer i dont want to go back there she said then dont i said ill come zane said it almost made me smile somehow i knew you would i lay in the narrow hospital bed in one of the spare rooms the evening dress was folded on the rooms only chair the chair was shoved up under the doorknob flimsy lock the chair wouldnt keep out someone truly determined but it would give me a few seconds to aim id showered and thrown the bloodsoaked hose away i was wearing just my panties they didnt even have a spare hospital gown i fell asleep in a strange bed with sheets clutched to my naked breasts and the firestar under my pillow the machine gun was under the bed i didnt think id need it but where else was i going to stash it i was dreaming something about being lost in an abandoned house searching for kittens the kittens were crying and there were snakes in the dark eating the kittens you didnt have to be freud to interpret this one the moment i thought that clearly that it was a dream and what it meant the dream melted away and left me awake in the dark i woke staring upwards sheets spilled down my body so that i was nearly nude in the blackness i could feel my body pulsing it was like id been running a race in my sleep there was sweat under my breast something was wrong i pulled the sheet up over me as i sat up even though i wasnt cold as a child id thought that the monsters in the closet and under the bed couldnt get me if i was covered after waking from a nightmare i still reached for the sheet no matter how hot it was of course i was in a basement with airconditioning it wasnt hot so why did my body feel almost fevered i reached under the pillow and got the firestar out i felt better with it gripped in my hand if id just been spooked by a dream i was going to feel silly i sat in the dark and strained to hear anything before i hit the lights if there was someone out in the hall theyd see the light under the door if they were trying to ambush me i didnt want them to see the light not yet i felt something coming down the hallway towards me a roil of energy heat that played over my body like a hand it was like a storm was rushing towards me with that prickling brush of lightning growing like weight in the room i clicked the safety off on the firestar and suddenly knew who it was it was richard richard striding towards me richard coming like an angry storm i clicked the safety back on but didnt put up the gun he was mad i could feel it id seen him toss a solid oak four poster kingsize bed around like it was nothing when he was angry id keep the gun just in case i didnt like keeping it but the moral dilemma didnt bother me enough to put it away i hit the lights i sat blinking in the sudden brightness a hard knot forming in my stomach i did not want to see him i hadnt known what to say to him since the night id first slept with jeanclaude the night id run from richard run from what he was on the night of the full moon run from the sight of his beast i padded barefoot to the chair and gathered my clothes up i was struggling into the strapless bra gun beside me on the bed when i smelled his aftershave i felt the air move under the door and knew it was his body disrupting the currents of air his aftershave wasnt that strong i shouldnt have smelled it i knew suddenly as if it had been whispered in my ear that richard could smell me through the door that he knew id worn oscar de la renta parfume for jeanclaude i felt his fingertips press to either side of the door in a small push up motion felt him draw a breath and scent my body deep into him what the hell was going on wed been bound for two months and id never felt anything like this not with richard and not with jeanclaude richards voice achingly familiar anita i need to talk to you the anger was in his voice in his body rage he was like thunder pressed against the door im getting dressed i said i heard him pace in front of the door i know i can feel you in there whats happening to us that was a loaded question if ever id heard one i was wondering if he could feel my hands as id felt his a moment ago we havent been this close at dawn since we were bound jeanclaude isnt here to act as a buffer i hoped that was it the only alternative i could think of was that the council had done something to our marks i didnt think that was it though but we wouldnt know for sure until we could ask jeanclaude damn richard tried the door handle whats taking so long im almost done i said i slipped the dress on it was actually the easiest piece of clothing to get into the shoes were not comfortable without hose but i would have felt even less prepared barefoot cant explain it but shoes make me feel better i moved the chair and unlocked the door i stepped back a little too quick until i was on the far side of the room i put my hands behind me still holding the gun i didnt think hed hurt me but id never felt him like this his anger was like a burning knot in my gut he opened the door carefully as if he was having to think before each movement his control was a trembling line between his rage and me he was six foot one broadshouldered with highsculpted cheekbones and a wide soft mouth there was a dimple in his chin and he was altogether too handsome his eyes were still perfect chocolate brown only the pain in them was new his hair fell in thick waves around his shoulders a brown so full of gold and copper highlights that there should have been a different word for it brown is a dull word and his hair was not dull id loved running my hands through his hair grabbing fistfuls of it when we kissed he was wearing a bloodred tank top that left his muscular shoulders and arms bare i knew that every inch of him you could see and what you could not was tanned a nice soft brown but it wasnt really tanned just his natural skin color my heart was beating in my throat but it wasnt fear he stared at me in the black dress face scrubbed clean of makeup my hair uncombed and i felt his body react to the sight of me i felt it like a twist in my own body i had to close my eyes to keep from looking at his jeans to see if what i was feeling was visible when i opened my eyes he hadnt moved he just stood there in the middle of the room hands balled into fists breathing a little too hard his eyes were wild showing too much white like a horse about to bolt i found my voice first you said you wanted to talk so talk i sounded breathless it was like i could feel richards heart his chest rising and falling like it was my own id had moments of this with jeanclaude but never with richard if wed still been seeing each other it would have been intriguing now it was just confusing he relaxed his hands flexing them fighting not to make fists jeanclaude said he was protecting us from each other keeping us from getting too close until we were ready i didnt believe him until now i nodded its awkward he smiled and shook his head but the smile never took the anger out of his eyes awkward is that all it is to you anita just awkward you can feel what im feeling right now richard answer your own damn question he closed his eyes and pressed his hands together in front of his chest he pressed his palms together until his arms trembled with the effort and the muscles corded straining against his skin all the way up to his shoulders i felt him withdraw from me though that doesnt cover how it felt it was like he built a wall between us he was raising mental shields between us someone had to i hadnt thought to try the sight and feel of him in my mind had turned me into a pulsing hormone it was too embarrassing for words i watched his body relax a muscle at a time until he opened his eyes slowly almost sleepily his body quiet at peace id never been that good at meditation he lowered his arms and looked at me better i nodded yes thank you he shook his head dont thank me it was either control it or run screaming we stood there staring at each other the silence was uncomfortably thick what do you want richard he gave a choking laugh that brought heat in a rush up my face you know what i meant i said yes he said i know what you meant you invoked your status as lupa while i was out of town you mean protecting stephen he nodded you had no right to go against sylvies express orders she was the one i left in charge not you shed removed pack protection from him do you know what that means better than you do he said without protection of a dominant youre anybodys meat that wants you like the wereleopards after you killed gabriel i pushed away from the wall if you had told me what was happening to them richard id have helped them would you he asked he motioned to the gun in my hand or would you just have killed them no thats what sylvie wanted to do not me but i stood there with the gun in my hand and didnt know a graceful way to put it down i know how much you hate shapeshifters anita i didnt think youd give a damn and no one else did either or theyd have told you they all thought you wouldnt care i mean if you could reject someone you supposedly loved because they turned into a monster once a month what chance did strangers have he was being deliberately cruel id never seen him do anything just to hurt just to try and dig the knife in a little deeper it was petty and that was one thing richard was not you know me better than that i said do i he said he sat down on the bed grabbing two handfuls of sheet he raised the cloth to his face and took a long deep breath he watched me with angry eyes while he did it the smell of you still moves me like some kind of drug and i hate you for it i just spent a few minutes inside your head remember you dont hate me richard itd be less painful if you did he crumpled the sheet in his lap hands balling the cloth into tight fists love doesnt conquer all does it he asked i shook my head no it doesnt he stood in an almost violent movement pacing the room in a tight circle he came to stand in front of me there was no magic now just two people but it was still hard to stand so close to him still hard to know i wasnt allowed to touch him anymore dammit it shouldnt have been this hard id made my choice you were never my lover now youre not even my girlfriend you are not a shapeshifter you cannot be my lupa are you really angry that i protected stephen you ordered pack members to guard him and a wereleopard you told them youd kill them if they didnt obey you you dont have that right you gave me that right when you made me lupa i held up a hand to keep him from interrupting and whether you like it or whether you dont it was a good thing that i had some clout to throw around stephen might be dead now if i hadnt been there for him and zane would have caused an even worse mess at the hospital lycanthropes dont need any more bad press were monsters anita you cant have good press if youre a monster you dont believe that you believe were monsters anita you proved that youd rather sleep with a corpse than let me touch you what do you want me to say richard that im sorry i couldnt cope i am sorry that im still embarrassed that i ran to jeanclaudes bed i am that i think less of myself for not being able to love you even after what i saw you do to marcus you wanted me to kill marcus he was going to kill you if you didnt so yeah i wanted you to kill marcus but i didnt tell you to eat him when a pack member is killed in a dominance struggle we all feed its a way to absorb their energy marcus and raina arent really gone as long as the pack remains you ate raina too where did you think the bodies went did you think your friends on the police force had hidden all the corpses i thought jeanclaude had arranged it he did but it was the pack that did the dirty work the vampires dont care about a body once its cold if the blood isnt warm they dont want it i almost asked if he preferred warm flesh to cold but didnt i didnt really want to know this entire conversation was going nowhere that i wanted to be i looked at the watch on my wrist ive got to go richard go rescue your wereleopards i looked at him yes thats why im here im your backup was that jeanclaudes idea sylvie told me that gregory refused to harm her regardless of what they did under gabriel theyre lycanthropes and we help our own even if they arent lukoi do the wereleopards have a fancy name for themselves i asked he nodded they call themselves pard the werewolves are the lukoi the leopards are the pard i walked past him shoulder brushing his bare arm that one touch raised the hairs on my body like hed touched something much more personal but id get used to it id made my choice and no matter how confused i was i wasnt that confused so i still lusted after richard even loved him id picked the vampire and you cant have your vampire and your werewolf too i got the machine gun out from under the bed and slid the strap across my chest jeanclaude said that we werent supposed to kill anybody richard said he knew you were coming here i asked he nodded i smiled but it wasnt happy he didnt tell you richard asked no we were left looking at each other again you cant trust him anita you know that youre the one who let him give you the first mark voluntarily what i did richard i did to save your lives both of you if you really thought he was so damn untrustworthy whyd you bind us to him richard looked away then and spoke very softly i didnt think id lose you go wait in the hall richard why ive got to finish getting dressed his gaze slid to my legs very white against the blackness of the dress and the heels hose he said softly a new holster actually i said the hose got trashed last night now please get out he did he didnt even make a last cutting remark it was an improvement when he closed the door behind him i sat down on the bed i did not want to do this going back in for the leopards was a bad idea going in with richard as backup was worse but wed do it i couldnt tell him to stay home besides i needed the backup no matter how emotionally painful it was to be around him he was one of the most powerful shapeshifters id ever met if he hadnt been crippled by a conscience the size of rhode island hed have been dangerous of course marcus would probably have said richard was plenty dangerous just as he was and hed be right richard drove his x to the circus i sat beside him but in some ways i might as well not have been there at all he never looked at me let alone spoke but the tension in his body was enough he knew i was there cherry and zane rode in the back seat it had surprised me when cherry slid into the car her eyes flashed white eyelids fluttering like a nervous tic she looked like she was going to faint zane was his usual self smiling eyes secret his usual self that was almost funny id known him less than twentyfour hours i didnt know what the hell was usual for him cherry had sunk down on the seat hugging herself she was slowly curling into a little ball id known her less time than id known zane but this wasnt normal for anybody i turned as far as the seat belt would allow and said whats wrong cherry her eyes rolled to me then closed tight she shook her head and huddled further into herself there was a fresh bruise forming on her cheek she might have had it when i first saw her i just wasnt sure zane whats wrong with her shes scared he said his voice was neutral but there was something in his face that was angry i told her this was strictly voluntary she doesnt have to come tell that to mr macho he said he was staring at the back of richards head i turned in the seat until i was staring at his profile he wouldnt look at me whats going on richard shes coming he said voice very quiet why because i said so bullshit he glanced at me then he tried for it to be a cool look but it was angry youre my lupa but i am still ulfric my word is still law fuck that you are not dragging her into this because youre mad at me the muscle in his jaw clenched tight enough for me to see it they both deserted their people now they are both going to make it right his voice was still quiet low and careful like if he wasnt very careful hed lose control he spoke like people talk when they want to yell look at her richard shell be worse than useless shell just be one more victim we have to keep safe he shook his head you dont leave one of your own behind not for any reason its the law pack law but shes not pack until you stop being my lupa anita what belongs to you belongs to me you arrogant prick he smiled but it was just a baring of teeth more snarl than humor everyone has to do something to take the edge off it took me a second to realize what he meant then i was embarrassed but id be damned if id sit there and explain that i hadnt meant it literally he knew i hadnt meant it literally he was trying to embarrass me fuck it did you hit cherry he was suddenly very interested in the road but his hands smoothed on the steering wheel he didnt like that hed hit her neither did i you wanted me to be strong well you got your wish there is a difference between being strong and being cruel richard really i never could tell the difference i think that last was meant for me but you can only make me feel guilty for so long and then i just get mad fine if what belongs to me belongs to you then it works the other way too he glanced at me frowning what do you mean i liked the unease in his face i enjoyed turning his logic back on him in my own way i was just as angry at him as he was at me i didnt have his moral high ground but i hadnt turned cannibal either maybe i did have some moral high ground after all if you can force cherry to go with us then i can order the pack to guard stephen i can order them to do any damn thing im dominant enough to make them do no he said why not i asked because i said so i laughed then and even to me it sounded bitchy he screamed a long ragged yell of frustration and anger god anita god were going to cut each other up if we dont work something out i said he glanced at me again his eyes werent angry anymore they were almost panicstricken youre sleeping with the vampire theres nothing to work out the three of us are bound to each other for what could be a very very long time richard were going to have to find a way to live together he laughed and it was bitter live together you want a house for three with jeanclaude down in the basement and me chained out in the yard not exactly but you cant keep hating yourself like this its not me i hate its you i shook my head if that were true id leave you alone but you hate your beast and your beast is you he pulled in front of the circus were here he turned off the engine and silence filled the car cherry can wait here thank you richard i said he shook his head dont thank me anita he smoothed his hands over his face into his hair combing his fingers through it the gesture showed his arms and chest to wonderful advantage hed never been aware of how much the simplest thing he did had moved me dont thank me he got out of the car i told cherry to stay low i didnt want them to get any ideas about taking her while we were inside rescuing the others it would sort of defeat the purpose of the entire trip zane kissed her on the forehead the way youd calm a child he told her everything would be all right that id keep them safe god i hoped he was right a man had walked up to meet richard hed been waiting for him i reached in the coat pocket and clicked off the safety on the browning because i knew him zane who was very close behind me asked is something wrong i shook my head hello jamil hello anita he was just shy of six feet wearing a white tank top almost the twin of the one richard wore except that jamil had cut out the neck arms and chopped out the middle of the shirt so that his slender waist and cobblestone abs showed the white tank top was in startling contrast to the rich solid brown of his skin his hair was waistlength worked in thin corn rows intertwined with bright beads he was wearing white sweat pants and looked like hed just come from the gym the last time id seen jamil hed been trying to kill richard what are you doing here even to me it didnt sound friendly he smiled a quick baring of teeth im richards enforcer so they allowed us each one backup plus the wereleopards richard said he spoke without looking at me staring at the front of the circus rising into the bright sunlight im short one wereleopard and a backup i said he did look at me then his face was as closed and guarded as id seen it i thought jeanclaude had told you and youd just decided against any backup id take backup into hell richard you know that dont blame me if your boyfriend forgot to mention it he probably thought youd mention it he just looked at me with his angry eyes is there anything else you forgot to tell me he just said to tell you dont kill anyone he mention anyone in particular not to kill i asked richard frowned then as a matter of fact he did he said the next in a bad french accent tell ma petitenot to kill fernando no matter what the provocation it brought a tight smile to my face fine jamil was staring at me the look on your face babe that is the most evil little smile ive ever seen what did this fernando do to you to me personally nothing he raped your geri your second in command zane said both of the werewolves stared at him a sudden flash of hostility that made zane step back he moved a little behind me which didnt quite work since he was nearly a foot taller hard to cower behind someone whos shorter than you are he raped sylvie richard asked i nodded he has to be punished richard said i shook my head i told sylvie id kill him that wed kill them all all richard made it a question all i said he looked away then not meeting my eyes he asked without turning around how many two that shes told me about there may be more but if there is shes not ready to talk about it yet youre sure there was more than just this fernando richard looked at me eyes hopeful almost like he wanted me to tell him it wasnt really as bad as it seemed it was gang rape richard they took great pride in telling me that who was the second one he asked he asked i answered liv he blinked at me shes a woman im aware of that he just stared at me how i raised eyebrows at him you really want me to get that technical richard shook his head he looked ill jamil didnt he met my eyes without flinching his face thinned into tight angry lines if they can take one of our highest wolves and use her like that then the packs threat means nothing that too i said but im not going to kill someone just to keep the packs rep in good repair then why jamil said i thought about that for a second because i gave my word id do it they dug their grave when they touched her all im doing is filling in the dirt why jamil said you hated sylvie it seemed important to him that i answer as if the question meant more than it should have at least to him they didnt break her all that they did to her and they couldnt break her she could have stopped the torture by giving up the pack she didnt give them up i tried to put it all into words that kind of loyalty and strength deserves the same in return what do you know about loyalty richard asked thats it i said i turned to him and poked a finger in his chest we can have one knockdownglorious fight after we save gregory and vivian they gangraped sylvie do you really think theyre doing less to two shapeshifters that they thought had no alpha to protect them i was spitting every word into his face voice squeezed tight and low because if i let go id be screaming we are going to get them out and take them some place safe when we do all that then you can go back to being pissed at me you can wrap your jealousy and selfhatred around us both until we choke but right this second we have work to do okay he looked at me for a heartbeat or two then gave the barest of nods okay great i said id abandoned my purse at the hospital but i had the key to the front door in my coat pocket along with id what else did a girl need you have a key to the front door richard asked drop it richard i said youre right youre right and im wrong i havent been paying attention to business for two months sylvie told me that i didnt listen maybe if i had she maybe if id been listening she wouldnt have gotten hurt jesus richard dont pull another guilt trip on me you could be attila the hun and the council would still have come no show of strength would have kept them out what would have he asked i shook my head they are the council richard the stuff of nightmares nightmares dont care how strong you are what do they care about he asked i shoved the key into the lock scaring you the big double doors pushed inward i drew the browning out of my pocket we arent supposed to kill anybody richard said i remember i said but i kept the gun out i couldnt kill anybody but jeanclaude hadnt said i couldnt maim someone it might not be as satisfying but when you need to back up your threat someone writhing on the floor in pain is almost as good as a body sometimes its better i stood with my back to the closed door the others fanned out around me soft filtered light came down from the high high windows the midway looked dark and tired in the morning sunlight the ferris wheel towered over the haunted house and mirror maze and the game booths it was a complete traveling carnival that didnt travel it smelled like it was suppose to cotton candy corn dogs funnel cakes two men stepped out of the huge circus tent that took up one entire corner they walked towards us side by side the taller man was about six foot squareshouldered with hair that was somewhere between blond and brown the hair was straight thick and just long enough to trail the edge of his shirt collar white dress shirt tucked into white jeans complete with white belt he wore white loafers no socks he looked like he should have been walking along a beach in a creditcard commercial except for his eyes even from a distance there was something odd about his eyes they were orangeish people didnt have eyes that color the second man was about five foot seven with dark gold hair cut very short a brownish mustache graced his upper lip and curved back to meet brownish sideburns nobody had worn a mustache like that since the s his white pants were tight and slid into polished black boots a white vest and a white shirt peeked out from beneath a red jacket he looked like he should have been riding to the hounds chasing small furred animals his eyes were a nice normal brown but the first mans eyes just got stranger the closer he came to us his eyes were yellownot amber not brownyellow with orange spikes radiating from the pupil like a pinwheel of color they were not human eyes no way no how if it hadnt been for the eyes i wouldnt have recognized him as a lycanthrope but the eyes gave it away id seen pictures of tigers with eyes like that they stopped a little distance from us richard moved up beside me zane and jamil at our backs we all stood looking at each other if i hadnt known better id have said that the two men looked uncomfortable or embarrassed the smaller man said i am captain thomas carswell you must be richard zeeman his voice was british and uppercrust but not too uppercrust richard took a step forward im richard zeeman this is anita blake jamil and zane i am gideon the man with the eyes said his voice was almost painfully low as if even in human speech he growled the sound was so low that it made my spine thrum where are vivian and gregory i said captain thomas carswell blinked and looked at me he didnt look happy about the interruption nearby first said gideon we need your gun miss blake i shook my head i dont think so they exchanged glances we cannot allow you to go forward with a gun in your hand miss blake carswell said every time someone wants to take my gun it means either they dont trust me or theyre planning to do something i dont like please gideon said in his gravelly voice surely you must understand our reluctance you do have a certain reputation anita richard said halfquestion halfsomething else i clicked the safety on the gun and held it out to gideon i had two more guns and two knives left they could have the browning gideon took the gun from me and stepped back to stand beside carswell thank you miss blake i nodded youre welcome shall we go carswell said he offered me his arm as if he were escorting me to dinner i stared at him then back at richard i raised my eyebrows trying to ask what he thought without asking he gave a halfshrug i slid my left arm through carswells arm youre being very civilized about this i said there is no reason to lose all good manners just because things have become somewhat extreme i let him lead me towards the tent gideon fell into step with richard they were almost the same height and the roil of energy that came off them made the hair on my neck stand up they were trying each others power tasting each other without doing anything at all but lowering their hardwon control jamil and zane brought up the rear like good soldiers we were almost at the tent when carswell stopped hand tightening on my arm i slid my right hand behind my back under the coat touching the machine gun there is something heavy on your back miss blake something that is not a purse his grip on my left arm grew tighter not hurting but i knew he wouldnt let go not without a fight i swung the machine gun around on its strap with my right hand and put the barrel into his chest not shoving just there like his hand on my other arm everybody be calm i said the other men were suddenly very very still we are going to give you your people miss blake gideon growled there is no need for this thomas here asked what i had on my back im showing him you do not know me well enough to call me by my christian name miss blake carswell said i blinked at him there was no fear in him he was humanone pull on the trigger and he was gonebut there was no fear i stared into his brown eyes and saw only sadness a tired sorrow as if hed almost welcome it i shook my head sorry captain carswell we cannot possibly let you go inside the tent with this weapon his voice was very calm matter of fact be reasonable anita richard said if things were reversed youd want them without weapons the trouble was i had to take off the coat to take off the machine gun if i took off the coat theyd see the knives i didnt want to lose the knives of course id still have the firestar i let the machine gun slide back out of sight ill have to remove my coat carswell released my arm cautiously and stepped back still close enough to grab me i stared at his careful clothing the jacket was too tailored for a shoulder holster the pants had no pockets but he could have had something at the small of his back ill remove my coat if you remove yours i said i have no weapons miss blake remove your coat and ill believe you he sighed and slid out of the red jacket then turned in a full circle arms spread to his sides as you see no weapons to be really sure id need to pat him down but i didnt want him returning the favor so i let it go i slipped out of the coat and watched his eyes widen at the wrist sheaths miss blake i am impressed and disappointed i let the coat fall to the floor and slipped the strap over my head i hated giving up the machine gun but i did understand theyd been doing awful things to gregory and vivian i wouldnt necessarily trust me with a gun if i were in their place i took the clip out of the gun and handed the weapon to carswell his eyes widened a little fearful that i will turn on you and your friends i shrugged cant blame a girl for being cautious he smiled and it almost reached his eyes no i suppose i cannot i slid one of the knives out of its sheath and handed it to him hiltfirst he waved it away you may keep your knives miss blake they will only be protection if someone gets very close very personal i think a lady should be allowed to defend her honor damn he was being nice gentlemanly if i kept the second handgun and he found out later he might not be so nice damn i said carswell frowned i have one more gun it must be very well concealed miss blake i sighed again inconveniently so yes do you want it or not he glanced back at gideon who nodded yes please miss blake everybody turn their backs amused or bemused looks all around i have to raise the dress and flash the room to get the gun i dont want anyone peeking all right it was stupid and juvenile but i still couldnt just raise the dress in front of five men my daddy brought me up better than that carswell turned without being asked a second time i got some very amused looks but everyone turned except for gideon i would be a poor bodyguard if i allowed you to shoot us in the back while we were defending your modesty he had a point all right ill turn my back which i did fishing the gun out for the last time the bellyband was a good idea but the firestar was going in the other coat pocket when i got it back i was tired of messing with it i handed the gun to gideon he took it still looking amused is that everything except for the knives yes i said your word of honor i nodded my word he nodded too as if that was enough i knew already that carswell was someones human servant he was the genuine article a british soldier of queen victorias army but until that moment i hadnt known that gideon was as old lycanthropes dont age that slowly he was getting help from somewhere or he was more than just a shapeshifter lycanthrope i said but what else are you he smiled then flashing small fangs top and bottom the only other lycanthrope id seen with fangs like that had been gabriel you get things like that if you spend too much time in animal form guess he said in a whisper so low and rumbling it made me shiver carswell said may we turn around miss blake sure i said he slid his jacket back on smoothing it in place and offered me his arm once more shall we miss blake anita my names anita he smiled then you may call me thomas he said it as if he didnt let a lot of people call him by his first name it made me smile thank you thomas he tucked my arm more securely in the crook of his own i do wish anita that our meeting could be under better circumstances i met his sad eyes and said whats happening to my people while you delay me here with your polite smiles he sighed i am hoping he will be finished before we walk in upon them a look almost like pain crossed his face it is not a sight fit for a lady i tried to pull my arm free and he gripped it more tightly his eyes werent sad anymore they were full of something i couldnt read know that this is not my choice let go of me thomas he let me draw my arm free of him i was suddenly afraid of what was inside the tent id never spoken with vivian and gregory was a perverted piece of shit but i suddenly didnt want to see what had happened to them gideon said thomas should she let her he said she has only the knives i didnt exactly run but i was close when i reached the closed flap of the tent i heard richard say anita i felt him coming up behind me but i didnt wait i flung the flap aside and stepped inside the tent had just one ring the center ring gregory lay in a naked heap in the center of that ring hands bound behind his back with thick grey tape his body was a mass of bruises and cuts i could see bone glistening in his legs jagged and wet where theyd broken his legs compound fractures are very nasty things that was why he couldnt walk out on his own power theyd broken his legs there was a small sound that drew me down the aisle to the railing around the ring vivian and fernando were in the ring too id missed them because they were too close to the side of the railing hidden from view vivian raised her face up from the ground tape across her mouth one eye bloody and swollen shut fernando shoved her face back to the ground showing her hands bound with tape showing what he was doing to her he drew himself out of her wet and finished at last he patted her bare butt giving her a small slap that was nice i was already walking towards them across the sand of the ring which means id gotten over the railing in spike heels and a floorlength skirt i didnt remember doing it fernando stood fastening his pants smiling at me if you hadnt bargained for her freedom id have never been allowed to touch her my father doesnt share i kept walking i had one of the knives out held to the side of the dress i wasnt sure if hed noticed or if i cared i held my empty left hand out to him youre a big man when the ladys tied and gagged how are you when the ladys armed he smiled and it was mocking he touched vivian with his foot casually like youd poke a dog shes beautiful but a little too submissive for my tastes i like them with a little more fight to them like your wolfbitch he finished fastening his pants running his hands up his chest as if remembering ctune bonne bourre i knew enough french to know that hed said sylvie was a good lay i balanced the knife it wasnt made for throwing but in a pinch itd do there was the faintest shadow in his eyes as if for the first time he realized that there was no one here to save him then something leaped over the railings a blur of speed and motion that hit fernando hard enough to roll him across the ground when they came up richard was on top of him i yelled dont kill him richard dont kill him i ran for them but jamil got there first jamil knelt by richard grabbing his arm saying something to him richard grabbed jamil by the throat and flung him across the ring i ran to jamil kneeling beside him but it was too late his throat was crushed his eyes were wide frightened he tried to breathe but it wasnt working his legs spasmed spine bowing as he fought to breath he grabbed my hand his eyes screaming at me there was nothing i could do either hed heal it or hed die i screamed shit richard help him richard plunged his hand into fernandos stomach he didnt have claws yet it was only human fingers digging in the flesh searching for the heart he was strong enough that hed dig it out unless we stopped him i stood and jamils hand slid out of mine he let me go but his eyes would haunt me i ran for richard screaming his name richard he looked at me with amber wolf eyes in his human face he reached towards me with one bloody hand and the mental shields that kept us safe from one another crashed my vision went black and when i could see again i was kneeling in the ring i could feel my body but i could also feel richards fingers pushing their way through thick flesh the blood was warm but there wasnt enough of it he wanted to use teeth to open the belly and was fighting the urge thomas knelt beside me use your marks to calm him before he kills fernando i shook my head my fingers were tearing through flesh i had to press my hands against my eyes to remember what body i was in i found my voice and that helped separate us helped me know who i was what i was shit i dont know how then take his rage his beast thomas touched my hands gripping them tight not to hurt but to help me anchor myself in this body i gripped his hands and stared into his face like a drowning woman i dont know how thomas he made an exasperated sound gideon will have to intervene until you can calm him it was almost a question i nodded sure id been about to kill fernando myself but i knew that if we killed him we would never see another dawn padma would kill us kill us all i kept looking at thomass face but i felt gideon grab richard felt him pull him off fernando richard twisted and hit gideon knocking him to the ground then leaped on him they rolled over and over on the ground each trying to get on top the only thing that kept it from being a killing fight was that both held onto their human forms and still tried to fight like they had claws but richards beast was growing inside him if he shifted short of killing him wed never keep him from killing someone else thomas touched my face and i realized that i hadnt been seeing his face i was seeing gideons strange eyes from inches away as my hands tried to crush his throat but they werent my hands help me i said just open to his beast thomas said simply open and it will fill you the beast is seeking a channel of escape give it one and it will flow into you i knew in that instant that thomas and gideon were part of a triumvirate just like we were im not a lycanthrope i said it does not matter do it or we will have to kill him i screamed and did what he said but it wasnt just opening to it i reached out to that rage that power that he called his beast came at my touch i smelled like home to it somehow and it poured into me over me through me like a blinding storm of heat and power it was similar to the times id raised power with richard and jeanclaude but this time there was no spell to use the power on nowhere for the beast to run it tried to crawl out my skin tried to expand inside my body but there was no beast to call i was empty for it and it raged inside me i felt it growing until i thought i would burst apart in bloody fragments the pressure built and built and had nowhere to go i screamed one long ragged shriek after another as fast as i could get breath i felt richard crawling towards me felt his hands and legs move over the ground felt the muscles in his body that turned crawling into a sensuous art a stalking thing he appeared above me just his face staring down his long hair fell around his face like a shadowing curtain blood glistened at the corner of his mouth i felt him want to lick the blood away but stop himself and bound this closely i knew why he stopped for me fear that i would think he was monstrous his power was still trying to find a way out of my body it wanted the blood too it wanted to lick the blood off his face and taste at his mouth wanted to wrap the warmth of his body around itself and become one his power cried out like a frustrated lover for him to open his arms his body his mind to it and embrace it richard gave it a name apart from himself his beast but it wasnt separate in that moment i realized why richard ran so hard and so long from the power it was him just as the furred shape of him was pulled from the matter of his own human body so the rage the destruction was pulled from his very human psyche his beast was formed of that part of our brains we bury only dragging into our consciousness in the worst of our nightmares not the dreams where we are hunted by the monsters but the dreams where we are the monsters we raise bloody hands to the sky and scream not from fear but from joy the pure joy of slaughter the cathartic moment when we plunge our hands into the hot blood of our enemies and there is no civilized thought to stop us from dancing on their graves the power flared inside me like a hand stroking from the inside out reaching out towards him as he knelt over me fear filled his eyes and it wasnt fear for me or of me it was the fear that the beast was the reality and that all the careful morals everything he was or ever had been was the lie i stared up at him richard i whispered were all creatures of light and darkness embracing your darkness wont kill the light goodness is stronger than that he dropped from his knees flat to the ground only propping himself on his elbows his hair brushed my face on either side and i had to fight the urge to rub my face back and forth in it this close i could smell his skin aftershave but underneath that was him the warm scent that was his body i wanted to touch that warmth to wrap my mouth around it and try and hold it forever i wanted him the power flared at the thought primitive thoughts excited it made it harder to control he whispered blood still trickling from his mouth how can you say goodness is stronger i want to lick the blood off my own body i want to press my bleeding mouth onto yours i want you to feed off my wound that is evil i touched his face the barest trace of fingertips and even that made power jump between us its not evil richard it just isnt very civilized blood was building into a single trembling drop on the edge of his face it fell against my skin and it was burning hot his power flared upward and took me with it it wanted toi wanted tolick the blood off richards face part of me was still saying no while i raised my head just enough to run lips my tongue and lightly my teeth along his face i lay back down with the salty taste of him in my mouth and wanted more the more scared me i was just as scared of this part of him of me as he was that was why i ran from him the night of the full moon it wasnt that he ate marcus though that hadnt helped or that hed handled it all so badly the memory that haunted was the moment id been carried away by the packs power and for just an instant id wanted to drop to my knees and feed with them i was afraid that richards beast would take what was left of my humanity i was afraid for the same reason richard was afraid but what id said was true it wasnt evil just not very human he laid his lips against mine in a trembling kiss a sound came from low in his throat and he was suddenly pressing his mouth against mine until it either bruised or i opened my mouth to him i opened and his tongue plunged inside me his lips feeding on mine the cut inside his mouth filled my mouth with the taste of him salty sweet i held his face in my hands my mouth searching his and it wasnt enough a small high keening sound crawled out of my mouth into his the sound was made up of need frustration a desire that wasnt civilized and never had been wed been playing ozzie and harriet but what we wanted from each other was more hustler and penthouse we moved to our knees mouths still pressed together my hands slid over his chest his back and something deep inside me clicked and relaxed how could i ever be this close to him and not touch him his power tried to spill outward but i held it back i held it like i could hold my own magic letting it build until i couldnt hold any longer richards hands slid up my legs finding the lace top of the black panties his fingers traced my naked spine and i was undone the power spilled upward outward filling us both it flared over us in a rushing wave of heat and light until my vision swam in pieces and we both cried out with one voice his beast slid inside of him i felt it crawl out of me pulled like a large thick string spilling inside of richard coiling into his body i expected to feel the last bit of it spill between us like draining the last drop of wine from a cup but that drop remained somewhere in that rush of power id felt richard take control of his beast and send that pulsing warmth outward into jamil i wouldnt have known how to do it but richard did id felt jamil heal under the thundering rush of power richard knelt with me in his arms my face pressed to his chest his heart beat against my cheek like a living thing sweat had broken over his body in a light dew i licked the sweat from his chest and stared up at him his eyes were heavylidded dazed youd almost have mistaken the look for sleep but not quite he cupped his hands on both sides of my face the wound on his mouth was healed the rush of power his beast had healed it he lowered his soft lips to mine and just barely brushed my mouth what are we going to do i held his hands against my face were going to do what we came to do then what he asked i shook my head rubbing my face against his hands survive first richard worry about the niceties later something filled his eyes with a sudden rush of panic jamil i could have killed him you also healed him he let that take some of the panic from his face but he still got to his feet and went to his fallen enforcer an apology at the very least was needed i couldnt really argue with that i stayed kneeling not sure i could walk yet for a variety of reasons not the way gideon and i would have done it thomas said but in a pinch it will do i felt heat rush up my face sorry dont apologize gideon growled it was a lovely show he crawled towards us one arm cradled against his body blood dripped down the arm and shoulder the red showed brilliantly against the white shirt i had absolutely no desire to lick the blood off his body i was grateful for that richard did that i asked he was beginning to change form when you called him you drank his beast and he calmed he sat leaning to one side bleeding a little puddle on the floor but he never asked for help not by word or expression but thomas reached out to him touched his shoulder in a neutral almost brotherly gesture their power strengthened in a skinprickling rush that oozed over me like a cold wind but if i hadnt been able to sense it id have never known is this just european reserve i asked or are richard and i doing something terribly wrong thomas smiled but it was gideon who answered you do nothing wrong in fact i feel quite cheated he patted thomass hand and smiled flashing fangs there are ways to share power that are quieter and less showy but for today you did what needed to be done it was a desperate thing and called for desperate measures i let it go no need to explain how often being around richard ended in such desperate measures across the ring jamil sat up with richards help zane had untied both the wereleopards hed led vivian over to gregory they both knelt by him vivian hugging zane and crying i got my feet under me and found that i could walk great richard got there before i did he stroked gregorys tangled hair out of his face until the wereleopard looked up at him we have to set these legs gregory nodded lips in a thin tight line that reminded me of cherry we need a hospital for this i said richard looked up at me the legs have already begun to reknit like this anita every minute the bones are out of alignment is another minute that they heal badly i stared down at gregorys legs he was totally nude but the wounds were so fearful that it wasnt embarrassing it was just piteous his legs from the knees down bent the wrong way i had to close my eyes and look away if it had been a corpse i could have looked at it but gregory was still bleeding still hurting made it worse somehow i looked back you mean the legs would heal like that yes richard said i stared down into gregorys frightened eyes they were still the surprised cornflowerblue of stephens they looked even bluer from the mask of blood that covered his face i tried to think of something to say but he spoke first his voice was thin scratchy as if hed screamed until he was hoarse when you left without me the first time i thought you were going to let them keep me i knelt beside him youre not something to keep youre a person you deserve to be treated to say better than this seemed too obvious i tried to hold his hand the way youd comfort a child but two of the fingers were broken so badly i didnt even know how to touch him vivian spoke for the first time is he dead her voice was breathy husky somewhere between that of a little girl and a seductress she would be great on the phone the look in her eyes was neither childish nor seductive it was frightening she stared past us to where fernando lay and her hatred was a hot scalding thing not that i blamed her i went to check on our little rapist gideon and thomas got to him first i noticed that they hadnt gone near him until i did why did i think that they didnt like him much better than we did fernando just had a way of pissing people off it seemed to be his only talent his bare stomach was a bloody mess where richard had tried to dig his intestines out but the wound was healing filling itself in like a fastforward motion picture you could actually see his body rebuild itself hell live i said even to me i sounded disappointed yes thomas said and that one word sounded as disappointed as i felt he visibly shook himself and turned sad brown eyes to me if he had died then padma would have destroyed the city seeking you make no mistake anita padma loves his son but more than that he is his only son the only chance he has of having an heir i wouldnt think a vampire would sweat that i said he comes from a time and a culture where a son is an incredibly important thing no matter how long we live or what we are in the end we start out as people we never quite lose all that we were during life it haunts us over the centuries our humanity youre human he smiled and shook his head once perhaps i opened my mouth to ask something but he held his hand up if there is time gideon and i would enjoy speaking with you and richard at length on what a triumvirate can be but now you must leave before fernando awakes during daylight hours he is in charge of us my eyes widened and i looked at gideon but hes not alpha enough to take on gideon padma is a harsh master anita we obey or we suffer which is why gideon said you must all leave as soon as possible what the petit bвtard would order us to do to you if he awoke now is best left unsaid he had a point gregory screamed a high shrieking that ended in whimpering richard had said the legs had begun to heal bent backwards i suddenly realized what that meant if the legs had healed broken gregory would have been crippled i said yes gideon said it was padmas idea of punishment fernando groaned eyes still shut we had to get out of here i need my guns back i said they didnt even argue they just gave them all back either they trusted me or they figured i wouldnt shoot fernando while he was unconscious they were right though hed earned it id killed people for a lot less than what the ratboy had done a lot less gregory had mercifully passed out richard held him as carefully as he could in his arms theyd found wood from somewhere and used richards shirt to tie the makeshift splints to gregorys legs vivian leaned heavily on zane as if her legs werent quite working she was also trying to cover her lower extremities so hurt she could barely walk and she was embarrassed about her nudity we were sort of out of clothes to offer her the coat id brought was in the outer area thomas saved the day by giving her his spiffy red jacket it was large on her and covered enough just making it outside the tent to the midway made my shoulders relax a notch i picked up the coat and put a gun in each pocket the machine gun was already across my chest thomas held the door for us i went through last thank you i said we both knew i didnt mean the door you are most welcome he closed the door behind us and i heard it lock i stood in the hot summer sunlight and felt my body sink into the heat it was good to be outside in the daylight but night was coming and i still didnt know what price jeanclaude had bargained away to get vivian and gregory out of there but the thought of gregorys lovely body deliberately crippled forever and vivian passed around like so much meat made me glad wed bargained i wouldnt say that whatever the price it would be worth it but close jeanclaude had said no rape no actual intercourse no maiming no skinning alive the list had seemed safer and more complete an hour ago we pulled into the driveway of my rented house with two wounded wereleopards two unwounded wereleopards two very silent werewolves a partridge in a pear tree and enough equipment for richard to rig up a pair of traction splints in my bedroom gregory needed to be in traction splints for twentyfour hours according to dr lillian the hospital was being evacuated if fernando was in charge for the day the evacuation wasnt just a precaution it was a necessity the ratboy hadnt wanted to free rafael and hed certainly want revenge on richard for beating him so both the wererats and the werewolves were in danger the thought of what hed do if he got his paws back on gregory and vivian was too scary to think about the best we could do was keep them with us and try not to be anywhere fernando would think to go i was halftrusting thomas and gideon to keep the ratboy from searching too hard i dont usually trust people that easily but gideon had called him the petit bвtard the little bastard they didnt like him any better than we did hard to believe but maybe true besides where could we go where wed be safe we couldnt go to a hotel that would endanger everyone in the place same thing with most houses one of the main things id been looking for in a rental was isolation frankly i liked a little city around me but my life had turned into a freefire zone lately no apartments no condos no neighborhoods something with lots of ground and no neighbors to get shot up was what id wanted i got it though the isolation was about all id gotten that i wanted the house was too big for just me it was a house that cried out for a family with walks in the woods and a dog running circles around the kiddies richard had never seen the house i would have been more comfortable with him seeing it before wed had our little makeout oh umh makeup session before jeanclaude had interfered richard and i had been engaged wed been planning the kind of future that went with this kind of house i dont know if richard had woken up and smelled the bloodsoaked coffee but i had the future that included a picket fence and children just wasnt in the cards for me i didnt think it was in the cards for him either but i wasnt going to burst his bubble not as long as his bubble didnt include me if it did we had a problem the house had a mediumsized rectangular flower bed that got full sun almost all day it had been a rose garden but the last owners had dug up the plants and tried to take them with them it looked like the far side of the moon complete with craters it had looked so barren that id spent a weekend planting the damn thing rose moss for the border just because i loved the bright little flowers zinnias behind that because the flower colors echoed each other it was a riot of color nothing subtle butterflies and hummingbirds were attracted to the zinnias id planted cosmos behind the zinnias towering feathery and tangled at the same time with lovely pale open flowers that the butterflies loved and the hummingbirds werent so fond of the colors of the cosmos were a little too pastel compared with the other colors but hey it still worked in the fall the cosmos would have seed heads for the goldfinches the flower bed had been some sort of admission to myself that i might be here awhile that i couldnt go back to an apartment or a condo that my life didnt allow me the luxury of close neighbors richard had remarked as we drove up nice flowers i couldnt just leave it bare he made a noncommittal noise nearly three months away from each other and even without the marks he knew me well enough to know when not to say something it bugged me that i had been unable to leave the flower bed barren and ripped i hated the fact that id been driven to make it pretty no i am not comfortable with my feminine side richard and jamil carried gregory in on the stretcher that the hospital had loaned us lillian had pumped the wereleopard so full of painkillers that he was feeling no pain i was grateful for that awake he had a tendency to whimper and scream strangely cherry turned out to be a nurse shed taken one look at gregory and suddenly turned into a professional a layer of confidence and competence crawled out of nowhere she was like a different person once gregory let her touch him didnt reject her help cherry was calm though truthfully it wasnt until dr lillian had seemed to trust cherry that i did too lillian was confident that she could help us put gregory into traction and not injure him further i trusted lillians opinion but i still didnt trust cherry i might not have approved of richard smacking her around but i agreed that anyone who left you behind to die wasnt trustworthy no shame in being weak but id never trust her at my back vivian wouldnt let zane carry her into the house even though walking was obviously painful she clung to my arm with both her small hands truthfully her hands werent any smaller than my own but somehow she seemed fragile it wasnt size or even just the rape but something about vivian herself even wrapped in the borrowed red coat and a scruffy blue robe that lillian had loaned her vivian looked delicate feminine lovely in an almost ethereal sort of way its hard to look lovely and ethereal with half your face swollen tight with bruises but she managed it she stumbled on the rock walkway to the house i caught her but her knees buckled and i came damn near dropping her on the rocks zane tried to help me but vivian let out a small sound and hid her face against my shoulder once we hit the car she hadnt wanted any man to touch her it had been zane who untied her but it seemed to be me she looked upon as her rescuer or maybe i was just the only female rescuer and female was safe right now i sighed and nodded my head zane backed off if id been in jogging shoes or even flats id have just carried vivian into the house but i was wearing three inch spike heels i could not carry someone nearly my own body weight wearing these shoes if i kicked the shoes off then the dress would be so long id trip i was beginning to really hate this outfit vivian she didnt respond vivian she was still sliding towards the ground i braced my legs far enough apart to get as much leverage as i was going to get in the shoes and was ready for her when her legs collapsed completely i might have been able to carry her in a firemenscarry even with the heels but id seen her body and there were deep bruises on her stomach slinging her over my shoulders would hurt i managed to lift her in my arms but i knew better than to try and walk get cherry i said zane nodded and went into the house i stood there holding vivian waiting for help to arrive the july sun beat down on my back through the black coat sweat trickled down my spine cicadas filled the heat with their buzzing song there was a small army of butterflies feeding on the flowers dont tell but i drank at least one cup of coffee every day out here watching the stupid things it was all very picturesque but i was getting impatient how long did it take for zane to tell cherry to get her butt out here of course maybe she was busy with gregory and his fearful injuries if she was it could be a while it wasnt that i couldnt stand there holding her it was that i felt stupid wearing heels so high that i couldnt carry her into the house it made me feel girlish in the worst way i tried to wait by counting how many different species of butterflies were visible tiger swallowtail spicebush swallowtail greater frittilary giant sulphur black swallowtail redspotted purple and painted lady a trio of tiny blue hairstreaks spun into the air like glittering bits of sky beautiful but where the hell was cherry enough of this i started very carefully forward my ankle twisted and i had to throw myself backward to keep from dumping vivian to the rocks i ended up on my butt in the flower bed crushing the border of rose moss flat and taking a few zinnias with me the cosmos towered over me some of them as tall as six feet vivian gave a small moan blinking her one good eye open its all right i soothed its all right i sat there holding her half rocking her with my butt in the flowers and my feet almost straight out in front of me id managed to keep my feet through vampires shapeshifters human servants and arsonists but a pair of high heels had set me back on my ass vanity thy name is woman though whoever wrote that had never seen an issue of gq a tiger swallowtail nearly as big as my outstretched hand fluttered near my face it was pale yellow with sharp brown stripes on its wings it hovered over vivian then finally settled on my hand butterflies will lick the sweat from your skin for the salt but usually you have to hold still for it if you move they float away this insect seemed determined its proboscis is not much thicker than a straight pin a long curved tube but you can feel it like a tickling line it was maybe the third time in my life that id had a butterfly feed off my skin i didnt try to chase it away it was cool its wings pulsed up and down very slowly as it fed its tiny feet almost weightless against my hand cherry walked out the door eyes widening when she saw me are you hurt i shook my head still careful not to scare away the butterfly just cant get the leverage to get back up cherry knelt by us and the butterfly glided away she watched it for a moment ive never seen a butterfly do that it was after the salt in my skin butterflies will feed on dogshit or spoiled fruit too i said cherry made a face thanks for ruining another idyllic image she took vivian out of my arms wobbling on one knee vivian moaned in her arms as cherry stood trying to get the balance of it all lifting isnt just strength its balance and an unconscious body is not the best thing for balance you need a hand up she asked i shook my head getting to my knees cherry took me at my word and just walked towards the house she was smarter than id first thought of course if id spent the night in padmas tender care maybe i wouldnt have made a good first impression either i was trying to fluff up the crushed flowers when the butterfly came fluttering back with it hovering around my face i felt the first prickling brush of power if it had been dark id have said vampire but it was broad daylight i stood up and slipped the browning out of the coat pocket the bright yellowandbrown insect batted at my face with paperthin wings what had been fun a moment before was suddenly ominous for the first time in my life i brushed a butterfly away as if it had been something loathsome and maybe it was i am not implying that the butterfly was literally a vampire they couldnt shapechange not to my knowledge of course they couldnt be out in full daylight either they were the council did i really know what they were capable of the butterfly floated away from me towards the woods on the far side of the driveway it fluttered back and forth back and forth like it was waiting for me i shook my head i felt silly holding the gun with just the butterfly there by the woods but something else was out there i stood in the summer heat feeling the sun beat down on the top of my head i should have been safe at least from vampires it wasnt fair that they changed the rules i was about to go into the house and yell for backup when i saw a figure tall with a thick hooded cloak pulled around him even with the cloak i knew it was a him shoulders that broad and that height and i even knew it was warrick except it couldnt be him he wasnt even close to powerful enough to be out in daylight i stared at that tall shape in the shimmering white cloak he stood so still as if he were carved from marble even mr oliver the oldest vamp id ever seen had avoided direct sunlight but there warrick stood like a ghost that had learned the trick of walking about in daylight of course he wasnt walking he stood in the wavering shadows of the trees he didnt try and come out into the direct light of the clearing maybe he couldnt maybe that thin band of shade was all that kept him from bursting into flames maybe i walked towards him i stretched my senses but his was the only power i felt it could be a trap an ambush but i didnt think so if they meant to trap me it wouldnt have been this blatant but just in case i stopped a good distance back from the woods if i saw any movement id yell for help and run for the house might even get off a shot or two warrick stood with his head bowed so low the hood completely hid his face he stood immobile as if he didnt know i was there only the wind making a soft folding line in the white cloth showed any movement he was like a statue with a cloth thrown over it the longer he stood there motionless the more eerie it seemed i had to fill the silence what do you want warrick a shiver went through him and he raised his head slowly rot had spread across that strong face his skin was green and black as if that thin layer of tissue were holding in centuries of death even his blue eyes had dulled with a film like a fish that had been dead too long to eat my mouth was hanging open youd think after what id seen yvette do to him it wouldnt have shocked me but it did some sights you dont grow jaded about is yvette punishing you i asked no no my pale mistress sleeps in her coffin she knows nothing of this visit his voice was the only thing that remained normal the voice was still strong and firm it didnt match what was happening to his body whats happening to you warrick when the sun rose i did not die i thought it was a sign from god that he was giving me permission to end this foul existence that he had given me the chance to walk into the light for one last time i walked into the rising sun and did not burn but this happened he raised his hands out of the cloak showing me the greying flesh the fingernails were blackened even the ends of the fingers seemed shriveled will it heal i asked he smiled and even with that horrific visage it was a smile full of hope his rotted face showed a light that had nothing to do with vampire powers the butterfly hovered above his face god will call me to his arms soon i am after all a dead man i couldnt argue with him there why did you come here warrick a second butterfly joined the first then a third they fluttered above his head like a carousel warrick smiled up at them i have come to warn you padma fears jeanclaude and your triumvirate he will see you dead if he can thats not news i said our master morte damour has given yvette orders to destroy you all that was news why i asked i dont believe that any of the council truly believes that jeanclaude means to set up his own rival council in this country but they all see him as a part of this new legal vampirism they see him as part of a change that may sweep away our old existence the old ones who have power enough to be comfortable do not want any change in our status quo when the vote is taken anita there will be two against you who else gets to vote i asked asher has the proxy for his mistress belle morte beautiful death he hates jeanclaude with a fine burning hate like sunlight through glass i do not think you can count upon his help so they have all come to kill us i said if they had come merely to kill you anita they would have done so by now then im confused i said padmas fear is too strong but i believe our master would be content if jeanclaude gave up his seat of power here and joined the council as he was meant to the first challenger that comes along will take him out i said no thanks so jeanclaude keeps saying warrick said i am beginning to think that he underestimates himself and you hes cautious and so am i a host of butterflies had formed above his head they fluttered around him in a multicolored cloud one landed on his hand bright wings fanning softly as it fed off the rotting flesh his power thrummed along my body it wasnt councillevel power but it was masterlevel warrick was a master vampire and he hadnt been last night are you borrowing power from someone else from god he said of course the longer we are away from our master the weaker yvette grows and the stronger i grow the holy fire of gods eternal light has entered my body once more perhaps he will forgive me for my weakness i feared death anita i feared the punishment of hell more than i feared yvette but i walk in the light i burn with gods power once more personally i didnt believe god had a private torture chamber hell was being cut off from god cut off from his power his energy him we walked through his power every day of our lives until it was like white noise something we ignored or failed to hear but somehow lecturing warrick on the fact that hed let yvette torture him for centuries because he feared eternal damnation which i didnt in fact believe existed seemed pointless nay cruel im happy for you warrick i would ask one boon of you anita a boon is a favor right i asked didnt want to agree to something and be wrong yes he said ask do you have a cross upon you i nodded show me please i didnt think this was a good idea but i pulled the silver chain up until the cross sparkled in the sunlight it didnt glow it just dangled warrick smiled the holy cross does not reject me i didnt have the heart to tell him that the cross didnt always glow around all vampires it seemed to wait for one that meant me harm though there were exceptions both ways i like warrick didnt question gods wisdom i figured he knew what he was doing and if he didnt i really didnt want to know warrick walked to the edge of the tree line he stood there in the white cloak with its black lining hesitating i watched the struggle on his face he wanted to cross into that last band of pure sunlight and was afraid to i didnt blame him he stretched out his hand to the trembling edge of solid golden light then fell back my courage and my faith they still fail me i am still not worthy i should stride into the light and grab the holy cross and hold it unafraid he covered his face with his darkened hands the butterflies lit on every inch of naked skin wings fanning there was nothing to see but the white cloak and the fluttering insects for a moment the illusion was perfect that the butterflies were all that was inside the cloak warrick spread his hands slowly carefully so as not to disturb the insects he smiled i have heard the masters speak of calling their animals for centuries but have never understood until now it is a wondrous bond he seemed happy with his animal me id have been a little disappointed a butterfly wasnt going to be much defense against the sort of animals that most vamps could call but hey as long as warrick was happy who was i to bitch yvette made me swear an oath to god on some of her secrets i have not betrayed my word or my oath are you saying there are things i should know that you havent told me i asked i have told you all i am free to tell anita yvette was always clever she manipulated me all those years ago to betray all i held dear she bound me with oaths before we arrived on your shores i didnt understand it at the time but i do now she knew i would see you as a person of honor a person who protects the weak and does not abandon her friends you make the councils talk of honor and responsibility seem a pale pretense saying thanks didnt seem enough but it was all i had thank you warrick even when i was alive there was a vast difference between the nobles that truly led and tended their peoples needs and those who just took from them it hasnt changed that much i said i am sorry to hear that he said he glanced upward maybe at the sun maybe at something i couldnt see as the sun approaches its zenith i feel weaker do you need a place to rest for the day i asked the moment i said it i wasnt sure i should have made the offer did i really trust him down in the basement with jeanclaude and the gang without me to watch him every minute not exactly if this would be my last day in the daylight then i would not lose it by hiding i will walk in your delightful woods then i will dig among the deep leaves i have hidden among the leaves before they fall thick and deep in the hollows i nodded i know somehow i figured you for a city boy i have lived in a city for many years but my first days were among trees thicker and more lush than these my fathers lands were far from any city though that has changed there are no trees now where i fished and hunted as a boy it is all gone yvette allowed me a trip home in her company i wish i had not gone it has tainted my memories and made them seem like some dreams the good stuff is as real as the bad stuff i said dont let yvette take that from you he smiled then shivered the butterflies whirled into the air like autumn leaves flung into the sky i must go he moved off through the trees followed by a line of eager butterflies i lost sight of the white cloak as he walked down the far side of a hill but the butterflies trailed after him like tiny vultures marking the line of death crossed the yard the driveway and was back on the sidewalk when the sound of a car coming down the gravel driveway turned me around it was ronnie shit id forgotten to call her and cancel our morning jog veronica ronnie sims was a private detective and my best friend we worked out together at least once a week usually on saturday mornings sometimes we went to the gym sometimes we ran it was saturday morning and id forgotten to cancel i held the gun along my side hidden in the coat not that shed care it was just automatic if you were privileged enough to be allowed a carry permit for your gun you didnt flash it around deliberately flashing your gun in public without just cause is called brandishment and can get your permit revoked its like a new vampire flashing fangs its a sign of an amateur i was feeling guilty that id made ronnie come all the way out here for nothing when i realized she wasnt alone louie fane dr louis fane who taught biology at wash u was with her they spilled out of the car together laughing holding hands as soon as the car wasnt between them they were both dressed for jogging his shirt was untucked coming down low enough on his fivefootsix frame that his shortshorts barely showed his black hair was cut short and neat and didnt match the oversized tshirt ronnie was wearing a pair of lavender bikers shorts that showed her long legs to perfection a croptop tshirt in the same color showed flashes of flat stomach as she walked towards me she never dressed this nicely just to go exercise with me her shoulderlength blond hair was freshly washed blowdried and shiny the only thing missing was makeup but she didnt need it her face glowed her grey eyes had that tinge of blue they get when she wears the right color outfit shed chosen the color and louie had eyes only for her i stood there watching them walk hand and hand up the sidewalk and wondered when theyd notice me they both looked up almost startled as if id appeared out of thin air ronnie had the grace to look embarrassed but louie just seemed content i happened to know for a fact that they were having sex but just watching them together would have been enough his fingers played lightly over her knuckles as they stood looking at me i wasnt sure they were in love but lust that i was sure of ronnie looked me up and down a little overdressed for jogging arent you i frowned sorry i forgot to call i just got home what happened louie asked he still held ronnies hand but everything else changed he was suddenly alert taller somehow black eyes searching my face noticing for the first time the bandage on my hand and other signs of wear you smell like blood and his nostrils flaredsomething worse i wondered if he could smell warricks rotted flesh on my shoes but i didnt ask i didnt really want to know he was one of rafaels lieutenants and i was surprised he didnt know what had been happening have you guys been out of town they both nodded and ronnies smile was gone now too we were up at the cabin the cabin had been part of her divorce settlement from a twoyear marriage that ended very badly but it was a great cabin yeah its nice up there whats happened louie asked again lets go inside i cant think of a version short enough not to need coffee they followed me into the house still touching but some of the glow had leaked away i seemed to have that effect on people hard to be bright and shiny in the middle of a kill zone gregory was lying on my couch still drugged into blissful unconsciousness louie stopped in his tracks of course maybe it wasnt just the wereleopard there was a large persian rug underneath my white couch and chair it wasnt my rug there were bright pillows on the white furniture that echoed the colors of the rug the colors were like jewels in the early morning sunlight ronnie said stephen she even went forward as if to touch him but louie pulled her back its not stephen how can you tell i asked they dont smell the same ronnie was just staring this is gregory louie nodded i knew they were identical twins but yeah i said i have got to get out of this dress but let me make one thing clear gregory is mine now hes a good guy no abusing him louie turned to me and his black eyes had bled across the pupil so that his eyes were like black buttons rats eyes he tortured his own brother i was there louie i saw it then how can you defend him i shook my head it has been a long night louie lets just say that without gabriel to force the wereleopards to be evil theyve been choosing different paths he refused to torture one of the wolves and thats why they broke his legs the look on louies face said he didnt believe it i shook my head and made shooing motions go in the kitchen make coffee let me slip out of this damn dress and ill tell you everything ronnie pulled him towards the kitchen but her eyes watched me full of questions i mouthed later to her and she went into the kitchen i trusted her to keep louie busy until i got changed i didnt really think that hed harm gregory but the wereleopards had pissed off so many people better to be safe than sorry richard was up on a stepladder drilling holes in the ceiling above my bed so much for my security deposit my bedroom was the only one on the first floor id given it up so they wouldnt have to get gregory up the stairs little flakes of ceiling covered his bare torso in a fine white powder he looked very handymannish in just jeans cherry and zane were on the bed holding pieces of the traction apparatus for him helping him measure the drill stopped and i asked wheres vivian gwen took her to see sylvie richard said his eyes were very neutral as he looked at me voice careful we hadnt said much to each other since our moment in the ring nice to have a trained therapist in the house i said cherry and zane were both watching me they reminded me of golden retrievers in the obedience ring eyes earnest intent on every word and gesture i didnt really like people looking at me like that made me nervous i just came in to get clothes i want out of this dress i moved past them to the chest of drawers jeanclaude had been busy in here too it just wasnt as obviously not my taste at the far end was a bay window complete with window seat it was full to overflowing with my toy penguin collection there was a new penguin sitting on the bed with a large red bow on its neck and a card leaning against its furry belly bits of ceiling had already rained down on its black fur the drill stopped and richard said go ahead check the card thats what he meant for you to do i looked up at him and there was still anger in his eyes and pain but underneath that there was something else something i had no words for or perhaps didnt want words for i took the penguin off the bed dusting it off and opened the card with my back to him the drill didnt start up again i could feel him watching me while i read the card it said something to sleep with when i am not with you it was signed simply with an elegant j i shoved the card back in the envelope and turned to face richard penguin clutched to my stomach his expression was very careful as neutral as he could manage it he looked at me fighting to keep his face empty and finally failing a rawness spilled into his eyes of need and words and things unsaid zane and cherry backed off the bed gliding towards the door they didnt leave but they made a point of not standing between us i didnt think we were going to have a fullout battle but i couldnt blame them for getting out of the way you can read the note if you want but im not sure it will help he made a small abrupt sound not quite a laugh should you be offering your boyfriends love letters to your exboyfriend i dont want to hurt you richard i really dont if seeing the note will make it better you can see it except for that first time ive never done anything you didnt know about i dont intend to start now i watched the muscles in his jaw clench until the tension swelled his neck and shoulders he shook his head i dont want to see it fine i turned around penguin and card in one arm and opened the dresser drawer i grabbed what was on top not really paying attention i just wanted out of the suddenly silent room away from the weight of richards eyes i heard someone come in with you he said voice quiet who was it i turned penguin and clothes clutched in a mass louie and ronnie richard frowned did rafael send louie i shook my head they were off in a love nest together louie doesnt know whats been happening he seems really pissed at gregory is it personal or what he did to stephen stephen richard said louie is very loyal to his friends there was something in the way he said that last that seemed to imply that maybe not everyone in the house was as loyal or maybe i was just reading things into an otherwise innocent statement maybe guilt is a manysplendored thing but meeting richards truebrown eyes i didnt think i was hearing anything he didnt mean for me to hear if id known what to say to him id have sent the wereleopards out of the room so we could talk but god help me if i knew what to say until i had time to think about things the talk could wait in fact it had better wait i hadnt expected to still be able to feel something for richard or him for me i was sleeping with another man in love with another man it complicated things just thinking that made me smile and shake my head whats so funny he asked his eyes were so hurt so confused funny i said nothing richard absolutely nothing i fled to the downstairs bathroom to change this was the biggest bathroom in the house the one that had a sunken marble tub it wasnt as big as the one jeanclaude had at the circus but it was close white candles encircled the head and foot of the tub untouched fresh new waiting for nightfall hed chosen peppermint candles he loved scented candles that smelled eatable his food fetish was showing there was a second card taped to the stem of a silver candlestick there was nothing on the outside of the envelope but call it a hunch i opened it the note said if we were alone ma petite i would have you light them at dusk and i would join you je rкve de toi the last was french for i dream of you this one wasnt even signed he was such a confident little thing according to him i was the only woman in nearly four hundred years to ever turn him down and even i had finally lost the battle hard not to be confident with a track record like that truthfully id have loved to fill the tub light the candles and been waiting naked and wet for him to rise for the night it sounded like a very very good time but we had a house full of guests and if richard was staying the night we were going to behave ourselves if richard had dumped me for another woman i wouldnt have taken it quite as badly as he was taking it but i couldnt have stayed in a house and listened to him have sex with the other woman even my nerve wasnt that strong i certainly wasnt going to put richard into that position not on purpose i had to make two trips back and forth into the bedroom from the bathroom first i forgot a normal bra a strapless bra was just not meant to be worn this long second i traded the shorts id grabbed first for jeans i was very aware of richard watching me as i came and went zane and cherry watched both of us like nervous dogs that expect to be kicked the tension was thick enough to walk on and the leopards could feel it the tension was more than physical awareness it was like he was thinking very hard and i could feel it a building pressure that had a lecture at the end of it or a fight i ended up dressed in a pair of new jeans in that wonderful dark blue color that never lasts a royal blue tank top white jogging socks and white nikes with a black swoosh i shoved most of the old clothes into the dirty clothes hamper and folded the dress on top of it the dress was of course dry clean only i tucked the firestar down the front of the jeans i had an inner pants holster for it but it was in the bedroom i didnt want it badly enough to go back in there right this second i felt like i was tempting fate every time richard and i passed each other eventually hed insist on talking and i wasnt ready maybe for this particular talk i would never be ready i folded the borrowed coat over my arm with the browning hanging heavy in one pocket the machine gun i kept on my shoulder like a purse when the bedroom cleared out id put the machine gun in the closet the trick about having this many loaded guns is that you dont dare leave them lying around lycanthropes are great in a fight but most of them dont seem to know one end of a gun from the other theres something about a gun just lying around especially one as nifty as a submachine gun that tempts people there is an almost physical itch to pick it up point it go bangbang you either make a gun safe unloaded or locked up or you keep it on your body where you can control it those are the rules deviating from the rules is what lets eightyearold kids blow the heads off their baby sisters i went into the living room gregory was gone from the couch i started to assume hed been carried to the bedroom then walked into the bedroom to make sure be damn silly to let gregory get snatched from my living room and not notice it cherry and richard were tucking him into the bed with zanes help gregory had woken enough that he was whimpering richard caught me peeking in the doorway just making sure gregory was all right i said no you were making sure that the bad guys hadnt gotten him he said i looked down then up yeah i said we might have said more but gregory woke up as they put his legs in traction he started screaming lycanthropes metabolized drugs incredibly quickly cherry readied a needle full of a clear liquid i fled i dont like needles but truthfully i didnt want richard to lecture me over the guns his being a lycanthrope wasnt our only problem richard thought i killed too easily maybe he was right but id saved his ass more than once with my quick trigger finger and hed endangered me more than once with his squeamishness i went back down the stairs shaking my head why did we even bother we had too many important areas that we disagreed on it wouldnt work so we lusted after each other even loved each other it wasnt enough if we couldnt find a way to compromise on the rest of it wed just end up cutting each other apart better to just make the break as cleanly as possible my head agreed with the logic other body parts werent so sure i followed the smell of coffee into the kitchen it was a lovely kitchen if i ever cooked or entertained it was all dark wood cabinets with a large island in the middle with hooks above it for cooking pots and pans i didnt own enough kitchen stuff to fill one whole cabinet let alone the rest of the gleaming expanse of all the rooms in the new house this was the one that made me feel most like a stranger it was so not what i would have chosen ronnie and louie were sitting at my small twoseater kitchen table it sat on a raised platform in a threesided bay of windows the area was meant for a fullsized dining room table my little breakfastnook set looked like a temporary measure except for the flowers the flowers took up most of the small table the flowers were another addition i didnt have to count to know that there were a dozen white roses and one lone red one jeanclaude had been sending me white roses for years but ever since we made love for the first time there had been a thirteenth rose red crimson a spot of passion lost in a sea of white purity there was no card because there was no need for a card jamil leaned against the wall near ronnie and louie sipping coffee he stopped talking when i entered the room which meant hed probably been talking about me maybe not but the silence was thick and ronnie was very busy not looking at me louie looked at me a little too hard yep jamil had been spilling the beans i didnt even want to know before i had some caffeine in me i poured coffee into a mug that said warning the surgeon general has determined that bothering me before ive had my first cup of coffee is hazardous to your health the mug had been at the office until my boss accused me of threatening the clients i hadnt picked out a new mug yet i had to find something suitably irritating there was a sparkling new espresso machine on the cabinet by the coffeemaker with another card i took a sip of coffee and opened this one something to warm your body and fill this empty cuisine the last was french for kitchen he often did that in notes as if even after a hundred years in this country he still sometimes forgot the correct english phrase his speech was flawless but many people speak a second language better than they write it of course it could be his backhanded way of teaching me french it was working hed write a note and id hunt him down and ask what it meant having french sweetnothings whispered in your ear is great but after a while you wonder exactly what hes whispering so i asked there had been other lessons but nothing much that i could share in public nice flowers ronnie said her voice was neutral but shed made herself very clear on the subject of jeanclaude she thought he was a pushy bastard she was right she thought he was evil i didnt agree on that one i sat down at the far end of the octagon back to the wall head below the level of the windows i dont need any more lectures today ronnie okay she shrugged and sipped her coffee youre a big girl anita thats right i am it sounded petulant even to me i settled the submachine gun beside me on the floor with the coat i breathed in the coffee black and thick sometimes i added cream and sugar but for the first cup of the day black would do jamils been filling us in louie said did you and richard actually raise power in the middle of the circus i took a sip of coffee before answering apparently there is no equivalent among the wererats for the wolves lupa but is it common to be able to call power like that ronnie was glancing back and forth from one to the other of us her eyes were a little wide id been telling her what was happening in my life shed been hanging around with me and the monsters long enough to meet louie but it was still a strange new world for her sometimes i thought shed be better off keeping further away from the monsters but like shed said we were both big girls sometimes she even carried a gun she could make her own decisions jamil answered i have been a werewolf for over ten years this is my third pack i have never even heard of a lupa that could help her ulfric raise power outside of the lupanar our place of power most lupas cant even do that raina was the first id met that could call power within the lupanar she could do small powers without the full moon to boost her power but nothing like what i felt today jamil says you helped richard raise enough power to heal him louie said i shrugged carefully so the coffee wouldnt spill i helped richard control his beast it raised something i dont know something richard went into one of his rages and you helped bring him back louie asked i looked at him then youve seen him when he loses control he nodded once the memory made me shiver once is enough but you helped him control it she did jamil said he sounded pleased louie looked at him and shook his head whats going on i asked ive been telling richard that he wont get better unless he gets you completely out of his system i thought he had to forget you to heal himself you sound like youve changed your mind i said if you can help richard regain control of his beast then he needs you i dont care what arrangement you work out anita but if he doesnt do something soon hes going to end up dead to stop that from happening id do almost anything for the first time i realized that louie didnt like me anymore he was richards best friend i guess i couldnt blame him if hed dumped ronnie as badly as id dumped richard id be pissed too even encouraging richard to see me again i made it a question is that what you want i shook my head and wouldnt meet his eyes i dont know were bound to each other for eternity thats a long time to bitch at each other richard appeared in the doorway a very long time he said to watch you in his arms he didnt sound bitter then he sounded tired his thick hair and muscular upper body were covered in fine white dust even his jeans were coated he looked like something out of a porno movie where the handyman consoles the lonely housewife he walked over to stand in front of the roses forever to see white roses with your name on them he touched the single red rose and smiled nicely symbolic his hand closed around the crimson flower when he opened his hand red petals scattered across the table a drop of blood fell to the pale table top hed found a thorn ronnies eyes were wide staring at the ruined rose she glanced at me eyebrows raised but i didnt even know what expression to give her in return that was childish i said richard turned to me hand stretched out towards me too bad our other third isnt here to lick the blood off i felt an unpleasant smile curl my lips and spoke before i could stop myself or maybe i was just tired of trying there are at least three people in this room that would love to lick the blood off your skin richard im not one of them he balled his hand into a fist you are such a bitch woof woof i said louie stood stop it both of you i will if he will i said richard just turned away speaking without looking at anyone we changed the sheets on the bed but im still a mess he opened his hand blood had spread along the lines in his hand like a river following its banks he turned to me with angry eyes can i use one of the bathrooms to clean up he raised the hand slowly to his mouth and licked the blood very slowly very deliberately off his skin ronnie made a small sound almost a gasp i managed not to faint id seen the show before theres a full bath with shower upstairs door across the hall from the bedroom he put one finger in his mouth in slow motion like hed just eaten some fingerlickin good chicken his eyes never moved from my face i was giving my best blank look empty nothing whatever he wanted from me blankness was not it what about the fancy tub downstairs he asked help yourself i said i sipped coffee the picture of nonchalance edward would have been proud wouldnt jeanclaude be upset if i used your precious tub i know how much you both like water someone had told him that wed made love in the tub at the circus id have loved to know who and hurt them heat rose up my face i couldnt stop it a reaction at last he said youve embarrassed me happy he nodded yes yes i am go take your shower richard or your bath light the damn candles have a ball are you going to join me there was a time when id wanted an invitation like that from richard more than almost anything in the world the anger in his voice when he said it brought something very close to tears to my eyes i wasnt exactly crying but it hurt ronnie stood and louie put a hand on her arm everyone stood or sat and tried to pretend they werent witnessing something painfully personal a couple of deep breaths and i was okay i wasnt about to let him see me cry no way i didnt join jeanclaude in the tub richard he joined me maybe if you hadnt been such a frigging boy scout itd be you i was with right now and not him was one good fuck all it would have taken was it just that easy for you i pushed to my feet coffee sloshing down my hand onto the floor i set the mug on the table which put me within touching distance of richard ronnie and louie had moved back from the table giving us room i think theyd have left the room if they had been sure we wouldnt come to blows jamil had set his coffee down as if he was getting ready to jump in and save us from ourselves but it was too late to save us far too late you bastard i said it took us both to get where we are richard three of us he said fine i said my eyes were hot my throat tight maybe one good fuck would have done it i dont know do your high ideals keep you warm at night richard does your moral high ground make you less lonely he took that last step that put us almost touching his anger flowed over me like an electric current you cheated on me but you have him in your bed and i have no one then find someone richard find anyone but let it go let it the fuck go he stepped back so abruptly it made me sway he left the room striding his rage trailing after him like the smell of disturbing perfume i stood there for a second then said get out everyone out the men left but ronnie stayed i wouldnt have cried honest but she touched my shoulders hugged me from behind and whispered im so sorry i could have withstood anything except sympathy i cried with my hands covering my face still hiding still hiding the doorbell rang i moved as if to answer it but ronnie said let someone else get it zane called from the living room ill get it which made me wonder where jamil and louie were comforting richard maybe i pushed away from ronnie scrubbing at my face who could it be out here were in the middle of nowhere jamil and louie were suddenly back in the room either theyd heard me or they were just as suspicious as i was i picked the machine gun off the floor and stood in the doorway with the gun held at my left side out of sight the firestar was in my right hand also out of sight louie and jamil moved into the living room to either side dont cross my line of sight i said they both moved a little farther apart ronnie said i didnt bring my gun the browning is in the coat on the floor her grey eyes were just a touch wide her breathing just a little fast but she nodded and went for the gun zane was looking back at me with wide eyes he looked a question at me and i nodded he checked the peephole looks like a delivery guy with flowers open it i said zane did blocking my view of the man the mans voice was too soft to hear zane turned back to me says you have to sign for the flowers who are they from the man peered around zane raising his voice to say jeanclaude just a minute i laid the machine gun on the floor out of sight and kept the firestar hidden behind my leg as i moved for the door jeanclaude kept me supplied with flowers but he usually waited for the old ones to start to die or at least fade of course he had turned on the romantic overtime today he was a small man holding the box of roses in his arm his left hand on top of the box with a clipboard and a pencil with one of those strings on it zane stepped away from the door to let me move up but i got my first look in the little plastic window of the box yellow roses i stopped moving forward and tried to smile youll need a tip wait there while i get my purse the mans eyes flicked around the room watching jamil move up to his left and louie to his right i stepped to one side trying not to be directly in front of him he followed me with the box with his hand under the box jamil had the best angle i made his name a question jamil yes was all he said but it was enough i dont need a tip the man said but im running behind could you just sign for it so i could get going sure i said jamil had picked up what was going on but zane was still looking puzzled ronnie was somewhere behind me i didnt dare look for her but i moved just a little more offline and the man followed me with the hand i couldnt see with the hand that jamil had confirmed had a gun in it i was almost even with louie hed stopped moving waiting for me to come to him hed figured it out too great now what it was ronnie who decided it drop the gun or i drop you her voice confidentcertain i spared a glance to see her standing feet apart browning in a twohanded grip pointed at the man in the doorway jamil yelled anita i turned and pointed the firestar in one movement the man was already raising the hand and the box i got a glimpse of the gun he ignored ronnie completely pointing the gun at me if hed just fired from his hip hed have had time for one shot but he tried for a better shooting stance and that was that zane finally reacted when what he should have done was stay out of the way which just goes to show that super strength and super speed are not enough you got to know what to do with it he slapped the box and clipboard out of the mans hand making his first shot ring into the floor ronnies first shot went wide into the doorjamb zane was blocking my line of fire i watched the gun come back up pointed towards ronnie this time zane grabbed for the gun and the gun went off twice more zanes body jerked falling in slow motion to the floor i had the gun pointed so that when zanes body cleared the way i was ready ronnies second shot took the man in the shoulder pushing him backwards he fired at me slumped in the doorway his bullet went wide mine didnt blood blossomed on his chest he stared at me eyes wide and almost puzzled as if he didnt understand what was happening to him even with that first touch of death filling his eyes he started to raise the gun trying for one last shot two shots went off like thunderous echoes my shot took him in the chest ronnies shot took the top of his head off glazer safety rounds will do that to unprotected flesh i walked up to the man gun pointed at him ready to shoot him again but it was over his chest was a mass of blood and his head looked like someone had scalped him and gone a little too deep heavier fluids than blood were leaking all over my porch step ronnie came up beside me gun pointed at him she took one look and stumbled outside nearly tripping over the dead mans legs she fell into the grass retching and crying zane just lay there bleeding louie was checking his pulse hes dying he wiped the blood on his tshirt and went out into the sunlight to take care of ronnie i stared down at zanes pale chest one bullet had taken him low in the lungs red bubbles filled the wound making that horrible sound that sucking chest wounds make that says without a medic or a doctor the person is dead just a matter of when not if wed called the ambulance and found that they werent coming right away too many other emergencies ahead of us it was louie who pried the phone out of my hands and apologized to the nice operator cherry ran to the kitchen i could hear her opening and shutting drawers cabinets banging i walked into the kitchen she was standing in the middle of the room with a drawer pulled all the way out in one hand her eyes were almost wild before i could say anything she said i need a ziploc bag masking tape and scissors i didnt ask stupid questions i opened the small drawer beside the stove and handed her the tape and scissors the ziploc bags were one of the few things in the roomy pantry closet cherry snatched them from my hands and headed for the living room i had no idea what she had in mind but she had the medical training i didnt if it would give zane a few more minutes then i was for it the ambulance would come eventually the trick was having him alive for it to matter as far as i could tell she didnt use the scissors she taped the bag over his chest plastering it with tape except for one corner it was very obviously meant to be left that way but i had to ask why is the one corner untaped she answered without looking up from her patient the open corner lets him breathe but when he sucks in air the bag collapses and seals the wound its called an inclusive bandage she sounded as if she was lecturing i wondered not for the first time what cherry was like outside the monster stuff she was almost like two different people id never meant anyone monster or not who seemed so divided will it keep him alive long enough for the ambulance to get here i asked she finally looked up at meeyes very serious i hope so i nodded it was better than i could have done i was great at putting holes in people not so good at keeping them alive richard brought a blanket and folded it over zanes legs letting cherry take the upper part of the blanket to fix the way she wanted around the wound richard was wearing nothing but a towel around his waist his tanned skin beaded with water as if he hadnt even taken time to dry off the towel clung in a smooth tight line to his butt as he folded the quilt over zane his thick hair hung in heavy strands so wet that water trickled from it in fine lines down his back he stood up and the towel flashed a lot of thigh i have larger towels i said he frowned at me i heard gunshots i wasnt really worried about the size of the towel i nodded youre right sorry my anger with richard seemed to shrink in direct proportion to his clothes if he really wanted to win the war all he had to do was strip id have put up a white flag and applauded embarrassing but almost true he ran his hand through his hair smoothing it back from his face and squeezing out the excess water that small movement showed his arms and chest to wonderful advantage he arched his back just a little which stretched the rest of his body in one long muscled line it was the back arch that did it i knew he was showing his body off on purpose hed always seemed unconscious of the effect his body had on me until now now staring into his angry eyes i knew hed shown me his body very deliberately his way of saying without words see what you passed on see what you lost if it had just been the great body id lost out on it wouldnt have hurt so much i missed sunday afternoons watching old musicals saturday hiking through the woods birdwatching or entire weekends of rafting on the meramec i missed hearing about his day at school i missed him the body was just a very nice bonus i wasnt sure there were enough roses in the world to make me forget what richard had almost been to me he stalked away towards the stairs and his interrupted shower if id been as strong of will as i liked to think i wouldnt have watched him walk away i had a sudden vivid image of licking water off his chest and jerking that tiny white towel away the image was clear enough that i had to turn away and take a few deep breaths he wasnt mine anymore maybe he never had been i dont mean to interrupt the stud watch jamil said but who is the dead guy and why did he try to kill you if i thought id been embarrassed before i was wrong the fact that id let the shit with richard distract me from the much more vital question of the wouldbe murderer just proved that i wasnt up on my game it was too careless for words the sort of carelessness that can get you killed i dont know him i said louie lifted the sheet that someone had thrown over him i dont recognize him either please ronnie said she was looking somewhere between grey and green again louie let the sheet fall back but it was flatter somehow and clung to the top of his head the blood soaked up the cotton like oil to a wick ronnie made a small sound and ran for the bathroom louie watched her run out i watched him watch her he caught me looking and said shes killed people before the implied why is this worse went unsaid once before i said he stood up did she react like this i shook my head i think it was the sight of his brains leaking all over the porch that did it gwen walked into the room a lot of people who can take the sight of blood dont like to see other things leaking out thank you ms therapist jamil said she turned to him like a small blond storm her otherworldly energy spiraling through the room you are a homophobic bastard i raised eyebrows i miss something jamil is one of those men who believes that every lesbian is just a heterosexual woman waiting for the right man he was persistent enough to me that sylvie kicked his ass such language from a trained therapist jason said hed rushed up from the basement where the vampires were stored for the day when the shooting started when the excitement died down hed gone back to check on everybody all quiet down below i asked he gave me that grin of his that managed to be both mischievous and just a touch evil quiet as a tomb i groaned because he expected it but the smile left my face before it left his could it be the council i asked could what be the council louie asked whoever sent the hit man i said do you really think he was a hit man jamil asked you mean was he a professional assassin jamil nodded no i said why wasnt he a professional gwen asked not good enough i said maybe he was a virgin jamil said you mean a first timer yes maybe i glanced at the sheetcovered lump he picked the wrong career if it had been some suburban housewife or an investment banker hed have done okay jamil said sounds like you know he shrugged ive been an enforcer since i was fifteen my threats not worth anything unless im willing to kill how does richard feel about that i asked jamil shrugged again richards different but if he wasnt then id be dead hed have killed me right after he killed marcus its standard op for a new ulfric to kill the old leaders enforcers i wanted you dead he smiled and it was tight but not altogether unpleasant i know what you wanted youre closer to being one of us than he is sometimes i just dont have a lot of illusions jamil thats all you think richards morality is an illusion he nearly crushed your throat earlier today what do you think i think he also healed me marcus and raina couldnt have done that would they have hurt you that badly by accident i asked he smiled a quick baring of teeth if raina had gone for my throat it wouldnt have been by accident on a whim gwen said but not by accident the werewolves all had a moment of perfect understanding none of them mourned raina not even jamil who had sort of been on her side i shook my head i just dont think the council would send out some amateur with a gun theyve got enough daytime muscle to do the job without hiring outsiders then who jamil asked i shook my head again i wish i knew ronnie came back into the living room we all watched her as she made her shaky way back to the couch she sat down eyes redrimmed from crying and other things louie brought her a glass of water she sipped it very slowly and looked at me i expected her to talk about the dead man maybe to accuse me of being a horrible friend but shed decided to ignore the dead body and work on the live ones if you had slept with richard when you first started dating all this pain could have been avoided youre so sure of that i said i let ronnie change the subject she needed something else to concentrate on id have preferred the topic to be something besides my love life but i owed her yes she said the way you look at him anita the way he looks at you when hes not being cruel yeah im sure part of me agreed with her part of me thered still be jeanclaude she made an impatient sound i know you if youd had sex with richard first you still wouldnt be sleeping with that damn vampire you think sex is a commitment i sighed wed had this talk before sex should mean something ronnie i agree she said but if i had your scruples id still just be holding hands with louie were having a wonderful time but where is it going she closed her eyes and leaned her head against the back of the couch anna you make your life harder than it has to be she opened her eyes and moved just her head so she could look at me and still slump why cant a relationship just be what it is why does everything with you have to be so damn serious i folded my arms over my stomach and stared at her if i thought i was going to stare her down i was wrong i looked away first it is serious or should be why she said i was finally reduced to shrugging if i hadnt been having sex with a vampire out of wedlock id have had some moral high ground to stand on as it was i had nothing to fight back with id been virtuous for so long but when i lost it i lost it big time from celibacy to fucking the undead if id still been catholic it would have been enough to get me excommunicated of course being an animator was enough to get me excommunicated lucky for me i was protestant you want some advice from your auntie ronnie that made me smile a small smile but it was better than nothing what advice go upstairs and join that man in the shower i looked at her suitably scandalized the fact that id been pretty much fantasizing about doing just that not ten minutes ago only made it more embarrassing you saw him in the kitchen ronnie i dont think hes in a coed shower sort of mood a look came into her eyes that suddenly made me feel young or maybe naive you strip off and surprise him and he wont kick you out you dont get that kind of anger without heat he wants you as badly as you want him just give into it girlfriend i shook my head she sighed why not a thousand things but mainly jeanclaude dump him she said i laughed yeah right is he really that good so good that you couldnt give him up i thought about that for a minute and didnt know what to say it finally boiled down to one thing and i said it out loud im not sure there are enough white roses in the world to make me forget richard i held up a hand before she could interrupt but im not sure there are enough cozy afternoons in all eternity to make me forget jeanclaude she sat up straight on the couch staring at me a look almost of sorrow filled her eyes you mean that dont you yeah i said ronnie shook her head jesus anita you are screwed that made me laugh because she was right it was either cry or laugh about it and richard had gotten all the tears he was getting from me for one day the phone rang and i jumped now that the danger was over i could be jumpy i went into the kitchen and picked up the phone before i could even answer i heard dolphs voice anita you okay the police grapevine is even faster than i thought i said what are you talking about i told him what id told the operator i didnt know dolph said then why did you want to know if i was okay nearly every vampireowned business or house in the city was hit about the same time this morning they firebombed the church of eternal life and weve had oneonone hits on nonvamps all over the city fear rushed through me like fine champagne useless adrenaline with nowhere to go i had a lot of friends that were undead not just jeanclaude dead daves has it been hit i know dave resents being kicked off the force after he died but we take care of our own his bars got a uniformed guard until we find out what the hell is going on we got the arsonist before he could do more than smoke up an outside wall i knew that only the bad vamps were at the circus but dolph didnt he might find it strange if i didnt ask the circus they defended themselves against a couple of arsonists why didnt you ask about the love of your life first anita isnt he home dolph asked like he already knew which could mean he knew or it could mean he was fishing but i was pretty sure the council flunkies wouldnt have told the whole truth halftruth it was jeanclaude stayed over last night the silence this time was even thicker than before i let it build into something thick and unpleasant enough to choke on i dont know how long we listened to each other breathe but it was dolph who broke first lucky for him did you know this was coming that caught me off guard if he thought id held out on something this big no wonder he was pissed at me no dolph i swear i had no idea did your boyfriend i thought about that for a second i dont think so but ill ask him when he gets up dont you mean when he rises from the dead yeah dolph i said thats what i mean you think he could have known about all this shit and not told you probably not but he has his moments yet you still date him i just dont understand that anita if i could explain it so that it made sense to you dolph i would but i cant he sighed you got any ideas why someones hitting all the monsters today you mean why monsters or why this date i asked either he said youve got some suspects in custody right yes they havent talked only to ask for a lawyer a lot of them ended up dead like yours humans against vampires or humans first maybe i said would either of them hit shifters my stomach clenched into a nice tight knot what do you mean a man walked into a bar in the loop with a submachine gun with silver ammo for a minute i thought dolph meant the lunatic cafe rainas old restaurant but it wasnt an openly lycanthrope hangout i tried to think what was up there that was openly shifter the leather den i made it a question yeah he said the leather den was the only bar in the country to my knowledge that was a hangout for sadomasochistic gay men who happened to be shapeshifters it was a triple threat to any hatemonger geez dolph if it wasnt happening with everything else id say it could be almost any rightwing fruitcake did you get the machine gunner alive nope dolph said the survivors ate him bet they didnt i said they used teeth to kill him anita thats eating him in my book id seen shapeshifters eat people not just attack them but since most of those were illegal kills ie murders i let dolph win the fight he was still wrong but hard to show him my proof without getting people in trouble whatever you say dolph he was quiet for long enough that i had to say you still there why do i think youre holding back on me anita would i do that in a heartbeat he said his asking about the date had triggered some vague memory there is something about todays date what is it he asked i dont knowsomething do you need me to come in since almost all this shit is preternaturalrelated every uniform and his k is asking for us so yeah we need everybody in the field today theyve been hitting the monster isolation wards of most of the major hospitals jesus stephen i said hes all right they all are dolph said a guy with a mm tried for them the cop at the door got hit he all right i asked hell live dolph didnt sound happy and it wasnt just the hitter or a wounded cop what happened to the shooter i asked he laughed an abrupt harsh sound one of stephens cousins threw him up against a wall so hard his skull cracked nurses say the shooter was about to put a round right between the uniforms eyes when he was stopped so stephens cousin saved the cops life i said yeah dolph said you dont sound happy about that leave it alone anita sorry what do you want me to do the detective in charge is padgett hes a good cop no small praise coming from you i said why do i hear a but coming but dolph said he gets freaked around the monsters someone needs to go down there and hold his hand so he doesnt get carried away with the murderous shapeshifters so im a babysitter its your party anita i can send someone else i thought youd want this one i do and thanks dont stay all day anita make it as quick as you can pete mckinnon just called me to ask if he could borrow you was there another arson yes but it wasnt his firebug i told you they bombed the church of eternal life yeah malcolm is in there he said shit i said malcolm was the undead billy graham founder of the fastestgrowing denomination in the country it was the vampire church but humans could join in fact they were encouraged though how long they stayed human was debatable im surprised his daytime retreat was that obvious what do you mean most master vamps spend a lot of time and energy hiding their daytime address so that shit like this doesnt happen to them is he dead you are amusing as hell today anita you know what i mean i said no one knows mckinnons going to call you with more details hospital first then his scene when you get done there call me ill figure out where to send you next have you called larry you think hes up to this much solo action i thought about that for a second he knows his preternatural stuff dolph said i hear a but coming i laughed we have worked together too damn long yeah but hes not a shooter and i dont think thats going to change a lot of good cops arent shooters anita cops can go twentyfive years and never clear leather vampire executioners dont have that luxury we go in planning to kill things the things were planning to kill know that if all you have is a hammer anita every problem begins to look like a nail i read massad ayoob too dolph i dont use my gun as the only solution sure anita ill call larry i wanted to say dont get him killed but i didnt dolph wouldnt get him killed on purpose and larry was a grownup hed earned the right to take his chances like everyone else but it hurt something inside of me to know hed be out there today without me as backup they call it cutting the apron strings it feels more like amputating body parts i suddenly remembered why todays date was important the day of cleansing i said what dolph said the history books call it the day of cleansing the vampires call it the inferno two hundred years ago the church joined forces with the military in germany england oh hell almost every european country except franceand burned out every vampire or suspected vampire sympathizer in a single day the destruction was complete and a lot of innocent people went up in the flames but the fire accomplished their goal a lot fewer vampires in europe why didnt france join with everyone some historians think the king of france had a vampire mistress the french revolutionaries put out propaganda that the nobility were all vampires at one point which wasnt true of course some say thats why the guillotine was so popular it kills both the living and the undead somewhere during the minilecture i realized that i could ask jeanclaude if he missed the french revolution it wasnt by much for all i knew hed fled the revolution by coming to this country why hadnt i thought to ask because it still freaked me out that the man i was sleeping with was nearly three hundred years older than i was talk about a generation gap so sue me if i tried to be as normal in some areas as possible asking my lover about events that happened when george washington and thomas jefferson were still alive was definitely not normal anita are you all right sorry dolph i was thinking do i want to know about what probably not i said he let it go not more than a handful of months ago dolph would have pushed until he thought id told him everything about everything but if we were going to stay coworkers let alone friends some things were best left unsaid our relationship couldnt survive full disclosure it never had but i dont think dolph understood that until recently day of cleansing okay if you talk to any vampires dont call it that call it the inferno the other phrase is like calling the jewish holocaust a racial cleansing youve made your point he said remember while youre out there doing police work that youre still on someones hit parade gee dolph you do love me dont push it he said watch your own back dolph anything happens to you zerbrowskis in charge dolphs deep laughter was the last thing i heard before the phone clicked dead i dont think in the nearly five years id known dolph that hed ever said goodbye on the phone the phone rang as soon as i put it down it was pete mckinnon hi pete just got off the phone with dolph he told me you wanted me down at the main branch of the church he tell you why something about malcolm weve got nearly every human member of his church screaming for us to make sure their big cheese didnt get toasted but we opened the floor up to check on some vamps on the west side and they werent in coffins two of them went up in smoke if we let malcolm get cooked trying to save him lets just say i dont want to do the paper work what do you want me to do i seemed to be asking that a lot lately we need to know if its safe to leave him alone until he can rise on his own or if we need to figure out how to rescue him vampires cant drown can they i thought the last was a strange question except for holy water vamps dont have any problem with water even running water he asked youve been doing your homework im impressed i said im big into selfimprovement what about running water to my knowledge water isnt a deterrent running or otherwise why do you ask youve never been to a building after a fire have you he asked no i said unless the basement is airtight itll be full of water a lot of water could vampires drown it was a good question i wasnt sure maybe they could and that was why some of the folklore talked about running water or maybe it was like saying that vampires could shapechange not true at all they dont always breathe so i dont think theyd drown i mean if a vampire woke with his coffin underwater i think they could just not breathe and get out of the water but truthfully im not a hundred percent sure can you tell if hes okay without going down there truth is im not sure ive never tried anything like that will you try i nodded realized he couldnt see it and said sure but youre second on my list not first all right but hurry the media is all over this thing between them and the church members we are not having a good time ask them if malcolm is the only vamp down there ask them if the basement is steelreinforced why would it be a lot of the basements where vamps sleep have concrete ceilings reinforced with steel beams the churchs basement doesnt have any windows so it could mean that the lower area was specially designed with vamps in mind i think youd need to know that even if you decide to open the floor up we do take some of the bitching faithful aside and ask them questions you need to know the answers either way and itll at least give them the illusion that somethings happening until i can get there that is the best idea ive heard in two hours thanks ill be there as soon as i can promise i had a thought wait pete does malcolm have a human servant a lot of the people here have vampire bites no i said i mean a true human servant i thought that was just a human with one or two vampire bites so did i once i said a human with just a couple of bites is what the vamps call a renfield as in the character from the novel dracula id asked jeanclaude what they called them before the book came out hed said slaves ask a silly question whats a human servant then pete asked it reminded me of dolph a human whos bound to the vampire by something called marks its sort of mystical and magical shit but it gives the servant and the vamp a tie that we could use to see if malcolm is okay can any vampire have a servant no only a master vampire and not even all of them ive never heard of malcolm having one but he could if he wanted to ask the faithful though i think if he had one the servant would be yelling louder than the rest its still worth a shot if you solve it before i get there call dolph says theres plenty of other shit to go around hes not kidding the city is going nuts so far weve managed to contain the fires to just a few buildings but if the crazies keep this up its going to get out of hand theres no telling how much of the city could go up we need to know whos behind this i said yes we do pete said get here as soon as you can he sounded so sure i could help i wished i was as certain i wasnt sure i could do shit in broad daylight id been told once that the only reason i couldnt raise the dead at high noon was that i thought i couldnt i was about to put it to the test i still didnt think i could do it doubt is the greatest enemy of any magic or psychic ability selfdoubt is a selffulfilling prophecy ill be there as soon as i can great i wont lie im relieved that somebody with vampire experience is going to be onsite the cops are starting to get some training on how to handle the preternatural but no one trains firemen for this kind of shit it had never occurred to me that firemen have to deal with the monsters almost as much as the police they dont hunt them down but they enter their houses that can be just as dangerous depending on if the monster in question realizes youre there to help or not ill be there pete well be waiting see ya bye pete we hung up i went for my shoulder holster and a different shirt the shoulder holster would chafe with just a tank top on i changed into a navy polo shirt and didnt run into richard the water had stopped running but he hadnt come out i did not want to see him again especially not half naked i wanted away from him lucky for me the shit had hit the fan professionally speaking police work lots of it maybe enough to keep me out of the house all day fine with me the ambulance arrived and zane was loaded in cherry went with him i felt guilty not going with him but she could do more good than i could the police had still not shown up for the corpse i hated leaving the others to talk to the cops without me but i had to go the fact that i was relieved to go caused me a few moments of guilt but not much ronnie had gone back to sitting on the couch she asked just before i walked out the door am i going to jail tonight i knelt in front of her taking her strangely cold hands in mine ronnie you didnt kill him i shot the top of his head off what kind of ammo do you have in that gun of yours anyway i shot him twice in the chest there isnt enough left of his heart to scrape up with a spoon i said she closed her eyes his brains are leaking out all over the porch dont tell me that wouldnt have killed him all by itself i sighed and patted her hands please ronnie you did what you had to do maybe it will take a medical examiner to decide which bullet did him in but when the cops get here make sure you dont take credit ive been here before anita remember i know what to say and what not to say she looked at me and it wasnt an entirely friendly look i released her hands and stood im sorry ronnie ive only shot two people and both times i was with you both times you did it to save my life i said she looked up at me with bleak eyes i know i touched her face and wanted to pat her on the head or something comfort her the way youd comfort a child but she wasnt a child i am sorry this happened ronnie truly but what else could you have done nothing she said and that makes me wonder if im in the right business something inside of me tightened dont you mean wondering if you have the right friends this didnt happen because of your business it happened because of mine she gripped my hand tight best friends anita forever thanks ronnie more than youll ever know i dont think id ever get over losing you as a friend but dont decide to stay with me because of loyalty think about it ronnie really think about it my life doesnt seem to be getting any safer if anything its getting more dangerous you might want to think about whether you want to be in the line of fire just making the offer made my eyes burn i squeezed her hand and turned away before she could see that the scourge of vampirekind was tearing up she didnt call me back and profess undying friendship id half wanted her to but the other half was glad she was really thinking about it if ronnie got herself killed because of me i just might pull the guilt down over my ears and crawl into a hole i caught richard watching me from the doorway below the stairs maybe he and i could share a hole together thatd be punishment enough whats happened now he asked hed dried his hair into a shining mass of waves that slid over the top of his shoulders as he moved into the room hed put his jeans back on and found a shirt that fit him it was a large tshirt with a caricature of arthur conan doyle on it i used it for sleeping it was a little snug on richard through the shoulders and chest not small mind you just tight on me the shirt hung nearly to my knees see you found the blow dryer and the tshirt drawer help yourself i said answer my question he said ask jamil hes got all the details i asked you richard said i dont have time to stand here and tell it twice ive got to go to work police or vampire you used to ask that because you worried more if i was out on a vampire execution you were always relieved if it was just police work why the hell do you want to know now richard what do you care i walked out without waiting for an answer i had to step over the dead man on my porch i hoped the cops got there soon it was a typical july day in st louishot and claustophobically humid the body would start to smell if it didnt get carried away soon just another of the many joys of summer my jeep was in the garage where it should have been id let jeanclaude use it to ferry everyone here though he hadnt driven id never met an older vamp that drove the older ones tended to be a bit technophobic i was actually backing out of the garage when i saw richard in the rearview mirror he looked angry i thought very seriously about just continuing out hed move but just in case hed be stupid enough not to i waited for him to come up to the driversside window i pressed the button and the window whirred down like it was supposed to what i asked i let that one word be as hostile as his eyes three of my pack in danger three of my people may be under arrest and you didnt tell me im taking care of it richard its my job to take care of my wolves you want to go down there in person and announce that youre their ulfric you cant even go down there and be their friend because that might jeopardize your precious secret he gripped the edge of the window hard enough for his fingers to grow pale most pack leaders have secret identities anita you know that raina was your public alpha richard she would have gone down to the hospital for them but shes dead you cant go whos left something popped in the door i will be pissed if you break my car i said he moved his hands slowly as if he needed something to hold just to keep his hands busy dont get too comfortable as lupa anita i am going to replace you we stared at each other from less than a foot away once hed have come out to the car for one last goodbye kiss now it was one last fight fine but until you find someone else im all youve got now ive got to go and see if i can keep our wolves out of jail they wouldnt be in police custody if you hadnt put them in harms way he had me there if i hadnt put guards on stephen and nathaniel theyd be dead right now i shook my head and started easing the jeep back richard stepped out of the way so i could do it without risking his toes he stood there and watched me drive away if hed asked i would have found him a shirt but it wouldnt have been that one one it was a favorite two it reminded me of a particular weekend thered been a sherlock holmes movie marathon starring basil rathbone not my favorite mainly because they make dr watson out to be a buffoon but still good i wore the shirt that weekend even though it was too big to wear outside the house the fashion police didnt get me but richard loved the shirt had he just grabbed a shirt and not even remembered or had he worn it to remind me of what id given up i think i preferred it as a vindictive gesture if he could wear the shirt and not remember that weekend i didnt want to know wed managed to spill popcorn all over me and the couch richard wouldnt let me get up and dust myself off hed insisted on cleaning me up himself cleaning up seemed to involve no hands at all and a lot of mouth if the memory meant nothing to him then maybe wed never been in love maybe it had all been lust and i just confused the two god i hoped not another crime scene another show at least the body had been removed that was an improvement from my house id left three werewolves behind to guard stephen and nathaniel two of those werewolves were in the hallway lorraine was still dressed like the ideal secondgrade school teacher except for the handcuffs which didnt seem to match the outfit she was sitting in one of those straightbacked chairs that all hospitals seem to have this one was in a horrid orange color which matched none of the soft pastel walls she was sobbing with her hands covering her face her wrists looked small in the handcuffs teddy knelt beside her like a small weightlifting mountain patting her thin back there was a uniformed cop on either side of them at attention one of the uniforms had his hand sort of casually resting on the butt of his gun the strap that held the gun in the holster was already unsnapped it pissed me off i walked up to the cop in question way too close invading the hell out of his personal space better snap up the weapon there officer before someone takes it away from you he blinked pale eyes at me maam use your holster the way its meant to be used or get away from these people whats the problem here murdock a tall lanky man with a headful of dark curls walked towards us his suit hung so loose on his thin body that it looked borrowed his face was taken up by a huge pair of blue eyes except for the height he looked like a twelveyearold who had borrowed his daddys clothes i dont know sir murdock said eyes front i was betting that hed been in the military or wanted to be he just had that taste to him of a wannabe the tall man turned to me what seems to be the problem detective he left a long blank space for me to put a name in blake anita blake im with the regional preternatural investigation team he held out a largeknuckled hand to me he pumped my hand a little too vigorously but he didnt squeeze hard he wasnt trying to test me just glad to see me his touch made my skin tingle he was psychic a first among the police id met except for a witch theyd hired on purpose you must be detective padgett i said he nodded and dropped my hand smiling wonderfully smiling made him look even younger if he hadnt been nearly dolphs height hed have had real trouble with being authoritative but a lot of people mistake height for in charge ive struggled against the opposite reaction most of my life he put a hand across my shoulders and led me away from the werewolves i didnt much care for the hand on my shoulders if id been a guy he wouldnt have done it i let him herd me to one side then stepped out of the circle of his arm didnt make a point of it just did it who says i havent mellowed fill me in i said he did it was pretty much what dolph had told me the only addition was that it had been lorraine who slammed the man into the wall which explained her tears she probably thought shed be going to jail i couldnt promise she wouldnt be if shed been a human female that had just saved a policemans life by inadvertently killing a bad guy she wouldnt go to jail not today but she wasnt human and the law isnt evenhanded or blind no matter what wed like to believe let me test my understanding here i said the officer on the door was down the shooter had the gun pointed at the officers head and was about to deliver the coup de grвce when the woman dived into him her momentum carried them both back into the far wall where he hit his head that about right padgett glanced at his notes yeah thats about right why is she in handcuffs his eyes widened and he gave me his best little boy smile detective padgett was a charmer didnt matter that he looked like a scarecrow he was accustomed to getting by on charm at least with women i was betting his act had worked even less well on lorraine shes a lycanthrope he said smiling as if that explained it all she tell you that i asked he looked startled no you assumed she was a shapeshifter because why the smile wilted replaced by a frown that made him look petulant rather than angry she threw a man into a wall hard enough to crack his skull little old ladies lift cars off their grandchildren does that make them lycanthropes no but his face closed down defensive im told you dont like shapeshifters much padgett how i feel personally doesnt interfere with my job i laughed and it startled him padgett how we feel personally always affects our job i came here pissed because id had a fight with an exboyfriend so i got in murdocks face about his holster why dont you like lycanthropes padgett they give me the creeps okay i had an idea literally i asked what do you mean literally does being around shapeshifters actually make your skin creep he glanced up towards where the other cops were clustered he bent forward and lowered his voice and i knew i was right its like bugs crawling on my skin every time im around them he didnt look twelve now the fear and the loathing in his face showed lines that put him closer to thirty than twenty youre feeling their energy their aura he jerked back from me the hell i am look padgett i knew you were psychic the second i shook your hand youre full of shit he said he was scared scared of himself dolphs put the word out for any cops that have talent in this area why didnt you apply i am not a freak he said ah the truth comes out youre not afraid of lycanthropes youre afraid of you he raised a large fist not to hit me but just somewhere for his anger to go you dont know anything about me they make my skin crawl too padgett that calmed him a little how can you stand to be near them i shrugged you get used to it he shook his head almost shivering id never get used to this they arent doing it on purpose detective some shapeshifters are better at hiding what they are than others but all of them give off more energy during strong emotions the more you questioned them the more distressed they got the more energy they gave off and the creepier you felt i had the woman in a room alone and i thought my skin was going to crawl off my body wait alone did you mirandize her he nodded did she tell you anything he shook his head not a damn word what about the others the men didnt do anything are they free to go the big one wont leave her and the other one is in the room with the two injured ones says he cant leave them unguarded i told him that we could take care of it he said apparently not i agreed with kevin youve got witnesses that say she didnt mean to hurt the man he isnt even dead yet why is she still here in handcuffs she has already killed one man today i think thats enough he said two things detective first she could snap those cuffs any time she wanted to second if she were human youd have let her go home by now thats not true he said i looked at him he tried to stare me down but he flinched first he said looking at a spot above my head the man is dying if i let her go she could skip out skip out on what she saw a cop about to get his head blown off and jumped an armed man to save him she didnt cut him up she pushed him into a wall trust me detective if shed meant to kill him it would have been a more thorough job she risked her life to save one of your own she didnt risk anything bullets dont hurt lycanthropes silver bullets do they work just like real ammo on a human every hit that theyve investigated today had silver ammo padgett lorraine could have been killed but she didnt hesitate if she had wed have a dead cop on our hands how many citizens would risk their lives to save a cop he finally looked at me eyes so angry theyd darkened two shades of blue youve made your point have i he nodded yes he walked back down towards the waiting uniforms and the sobbing werewolf uncuff her murdock said sir do it murdock padgett said he didnt question it again just knelt in front of lorraine and unlocked the cuffs his partner on the other side unsnapped his holster and took two big steps back i let it go we were winning no need to fight as soon as her hands were free lorraine threw herself at me i knew she didnt mean any harm but i could hear the leather clearing down the hallway i raised my voice and said its okay guys shes okay ease down lorraine was on her knees arms locked around my legs sobbing full out loud and messy i held a hand pointed palm out to either end of the hallway teddy stood and half the guns swiveled to cover him we were on the verge of having things go really wrong padgett get hold of your men i spared a glanced back at him and found his gun out pointed at teddy shit padgett put up your gun and theyll follow your lead have him sit down padgett said voice even and very serious teddy i said softly sit back down very slowly no sudden moves i havent done anything he said doesnt matter just do it please he sat back down under the watchful eyes of half a dozen guns he put his big hands on his knees palms down showing he was unarmed like hed had practice trying to look harmless now put your gun up detective i said padgett looked at me for a second i thought he wasnt going to do it i looked into those big blue eyes and saw something dangerous a fear so deep and wide that he needed to destroy the thing he feared he put the gun up but that one moment of nakedness in his eyes had been enough id talk to dolph and see if padgett had any shapeshifter kills to his credit id almost have bet that he did cleared of charges didnt always mean innocent i patted the top of lorraines head its all right everythings all right i had to get them out of here the good guys were almost as big a threat as the bad ones she looked up at me eyes puffy nose running real crying is like real sex if you really do it it isnt pretty i didnt mean to hurt him she whispered i know i glanced at the police up and down the hallway some of them avoided my eyes i shook my head and helped her stand im taking them into stephen and nathaniels room with me detective padgett any objections he just shook his head great come on teddy i can stand up he asked i looked at padgett you think you and your people can hold the rambo routine if he behaves himself sure padgett wasnt trying to be charming anymore i think he was embarrassed about the show i knew he was still angry maybe at me maybe at himself i didnt care as long as he didnt start shooting you got a uniform inside the room i asked he gave one curt nod is he as triggerhappy as the rest of you or can i open the door without being shot at padgett strode to the door and knocked on it smith its padgett detective coming in he opened the door with a flourish and ushered lorraine and me in i looked at the young uniform seated just inside the door kevin was slumped down in a chair across from him an unlit cigarette in the corner of his mouth the werewolf looked at me and one look was enoughnot a happy camper it wasnt just nicotine withdrawal either i halfpushed lorraine into the room then walked back to teddy i held my left hand out to him and he took it i helped him stand though he didnt need the help thank you he said and he didnt mean for helping him stand up no problem i said i escorted him back to the room once they were both safely inside i turned to padgett we need to talk id prefer private if i could be guaranteed no one will get shot while im gone you okay in here smith he asked the young cop said im fine i like animals the look on teddys face was scary even to me that otherworldly energy was rising like a warm stinging tide if the nice policeman behaves himself then so do the rest of you i said teddy stared right at me i know how to follow orders great shall we find some place private detective padgett his breath was coming fast almost a pant he was feeling the rising energy too we can talk right here im not leaving one of my men alone with these things im okay boss the young cop said youre not afraid padgett asked it was a question that cops seldom ask each other they ask are you all right they admit to being nervous never scared officer smiths eyes widened a little but he shook his head i know crossman hes a good guy she saved his life smith sat up a little straighter in his chair said softly these arent the bad guys a tic started in padgetts cheek he opened his mouth closed it then turned abruptly on his heel and left the door slid shut behind him we all stood in the suddenly thick silence stephen said anita he held his hand out to me his face was flawless no scars no marks of any kind i took his hand and smiled i know you guys heal fast but its still impressive you looked pretty bad last time i saw you i looked worse a soft male voice said nathaniel was awake in the other bed his long auburn hair hung like a shining curtain around his face maybe longer than waistlength id never seen a man with hair that long i couldnt see his face because i was too busy staring at his eyes they were the color of lilacs a wonderful pale lavender that was a genuine showstopper it took me a few seconds of staring to be able to see the rest of his face he looked a few years older awake than he had unconsciousnineteen instead of sixteen maybe he still looked drawn and tired ill but there was a vast improvement yeah you looked worse i said stephen turned to officer smith like they were old friends can we have a few minutes alone smith looked at me okay with you i nodded he stood i dont know how padgetts going to like it so if you want to exchange secret codes or anything make it fast thanks i said dont mention it he stopped in front of lorraine before he left thank you crossman has a wife and two daughters i know theyd thank you if they could lorraine blushed and nodded mumbling youre welcome smith left and i walked over to nathaniels bed nice to meet you while youre conscious he tried to smile but the effort showed he held out his left hand to me the right hand was still hooked up to an iv drip i took his hand his grip was tremblingly weak he drew my hand towards his mouth as if to kiss it i let him do it the effort made his hand shake he pressed his lips to my hand eyes closed almost as if he were resting for a second i thought hed passed out but his tongue flicked out a quick wetness i jerked back fighting the urge to wipe my hand on my jeans thanks a handshake would have been fine he frowned up at me but youre our lйoparde lionnй he said so people keep telling me i said he turned his head so he could see stephen you lied to me tears trembled in his pale pale eyes she wont feed us i looked at stephen i have missed part of this conversation havent i have you seen richard share blood with the pack i started to say no then i saw him let jason feed off of a knife wound once jason seemed almost drugged from it stephen nodded thats it gabriel could share blood my eyes widened i didnt think he was strong enough to do that neither did we this from kevin he came to stand near me cigarette transferred still unlit to his left hand its been very interesting listening to nathaniel talk about gabriel nathaniel was addicted to heroin and a street whore when gabriel rescued him gave him a second life bully for him getting him off drugs but gabriel still pimped him out to a sicker clientele kevin patted nathaniels leg under the sheet a casual gesture like youd pat a dog but nat here likes it dont you boy nathaniel looked at him and said softly yes please tell me you didnt enjoy being gutted he closed his eyes no not that but until then it was thats all right i said something occurred to me have you told the police who did this to you he doesnt know kevin said he put the everpresent cig back in his mouth as if just the taste of the paper was sweet what do you mean he doesnt know i asked stephen answered zane chained and blindfolded him then left that was the deal nathaniel never saw them them i made it a question stephen nodded them i took in a deep breath and let it out slowly do you remember anything unique or different that might help identify them perfume like gardenias and a sickly smell great i thought that was helpful he looked full at me and suddenly his eyes werent just dull with illness i realized they were dull with experience it went beyond jaded as if nathaniel had looked into the lower rungs of hell hed lived to tell the tale but he hadnt really survived not intact i remember the perfume id recognize it again if i smelled it okay nathaniel okay in the bottom of the awful emptiness of his eyes was panic he was scared unbelievably scared i patted his hand and when his fingers curled around mine i held on no one will ever hurt you like that again nathaniel i promise you that youll take care of me he looked up at me with a need in his eyes that was so raw so primitive i would have promised him anything to chase that look away yes ill take care of you his whole body relaxed a tension running out of him like water from a cracked cup i felt it run down his arm into his hand into me like a jolt of energy it made me jump but i didnt pull away he smiled up at me lying back against the pillows he looked a little better somehow stronger i slid my hand out of his slowly and he let me go great i turned to the rest of the room we need to get you all out of here i could go home now stephen said but nathaniel still cant be moved i dont trust the cops without me here to act as a buffer padgett is very afraid of us teddy said i nodded i know feed me nathaniel said give me your strength and i will go with you i frowned at him then looked back at stephen hes not seriously suggesting i open a vein for him is he richard could do it stephen said richard couldnt feed one of the leopards lorraine said only us raina could have fucked him back to health kevin said that earned him a long stare from me what are you talking about raina could share energy without sharing blood he said his face registered both distaste and lust as if hed enjoyed some of rainas shows in spite of himself shed run her hands over you then her body it always ended with her fucking you the more hurt you started out the better she liked it but youd be healed when she was finished i turned to stephen because i didnt believe it he nodded ive seen her do it youre not suggesting that she lorraine let the awful thought go unsaid but i was with her i am not opening a vein and i am most certainly not going to have sex with him you dont want me nathaniels voice was tearfilled heartbroken its nothing personal i said im just not into casual sex this entire conversation was too weird even for me then nathaniel has to stay here at least another twentyfour hours kevin said he rolled the cigarette between his fingers while he talked stephen nodded thats what the doctor said we asked when he told me i could go home today dont leave me stephen nathaniel reached out across the space between them as if he could touch him i wont leave you alone nathaniel not without someone to take care of you teddy spoke just because it ended in sex for raina doesnt mean it has to end that way we all looked at him what do you mean kevin asked everything ended in sex for raina but it was the touching that healed i think my injuries were healed before we got down to basics just listening to him talk like that with a sixtyinch chest of pure muscle made my brain hurt it was like finding out your golden retriever talked you just didnt expect to get brains in such a bulky package kevin shrugged i dont know all i know is she healed me i dont remember when i was better i just remember her is there anyone in this room that didnt sleep with raina i asked the only person who raised their hand was lorraine and knowing raina that had been debatable sweet jesus i think anita could heal him without sex just bare skin teddy said i started to say no then remembered sharing energy with jeanclaude bare skin had been important there too maybe it was the same did raina seem to feel tired after healing you all the men shook their heads the consensus was it seemed to energize her not weaken her of course that was raina and she had been an unusual puppy even for a werewolf i didnt want to leave nathaniel here not even with werewolves to guard him i didnt trust padgett there was also no guarantee that the zealots whoever they were wouldnt try for another hit either we all went or we all stayed i had more crime scenes to visit i couldnt sit here all bloody day okay lets try it but i dont have the faintest idea how to begin nathaniel settled back into the pillows with something like a smile of expectation on his face like a child whos about to get the ice cream he was promised trouble was i was the ice cream kevin put a chair under the door handle and we were as secure as we were likely to get id told smith who was now manning the door that i needed to get a feel for things and id be done when i was done i was being treated like a detective so the uniforms would stay out the only worry was padgett hed only stay out until his ego recovered i half expected him to try and barge in on us the only thing that might save us from him was the fact that hed want to break the door in because hed be sensing what we were doing and he wouldnt want to admit that i stood by the bed nathaniel looked up at me with a look that was so trusting it made me nervous i turned away and found everyone else looking at me too okay guys now what ive never even seen this done there was an exchange of looks all the way around stephen said i dont know if we can explain it to you i nodded i know magic is like that you either get it or you dont is this magic teddy asked or is it just psychic ability im not sure there is a difference i said sometimes i think the only difference is that psychic ability is something you do without thinking about it and magic requires a ritual to get your juices going you do more of this kind of shit than we do kevin said were just werewolves not witches im not a witch im a necromancer he shrugged same diff to me he sat down in the chair hed started out in crushing the cigarette into the palm of his hand as if it were lit and his flesh were an ashtray he scowled up at me i didnt know him well enough to be sure but he seemed nervous me too i only knew two ways to raise energy ritual or sex the sex took the place of ritual when i was with jeanclaude or richard but i had no bond with nathaniel no marks no emotion nothing i wasnt his lйoparde lionnй not really it was all lies i couldnt do this without some feeling towards him pity wasnt enough teddy loomed up behind me whats wrong anita i would have walked across the room and whispered but i knew nathaniel would hear anywhere in the small room i need some emotion to work from something emotion he asked i dont know nathaniel i dont feel anything for him except pity obligation neither of those is enough to even get started what do you need his eyes were very serious the intelligence in them was almost touchable i tried to put it into words and ended up saying i need something to take the place of a ritual raina didnt use a ritual kevin said from the chair she used sex sex can take the place of the ritual you raised power at the lupanar that one night with richard stephen said you didnt have sex but you still raised power but i i wanted richard sexually its a sort of energy all of its own nathaniel is handsome stephen said i shook my head its never been that easy for me i need more than a pretty face stephen slid out of the bed in one of those wraparound gowns but it didnt gape as he moved it was wrapped around him like a sheet more cloth than he needed just like it would have been on me one size never really fits all he tried to take my hand and i wouldnt let him let me help you define help suspicious who me he smiled and it was almost condescending the smile men get around girls when theyre doing something sort of cute and girlish the smile alone pissed me off what is your problem i asked you he said softly you know i would never hurt you dont you i looked into his cornflowerblue eyes and nodded never on purpose i said then trust me now let me help you call the power how i asked he took my hand in both of his and this time i let him he drew my hand to nathaniel he rested my fingertips on nathaniels forehead his skin was cool just the touch of his skin and you knew he wasnt well pet him stephen said i looked at him shaking my head i drew my hand back i dont think so nathaniel started to say something but stephen put his fingers across his mouth no nathaniel it was almost like he knew what the other man was going to say but he couldnt know not for sure could he i might have believed it if nathaniel was pack but he wasnt close your eyes stephen said uhhuh i said we dont have time for this kevin said hes right teddy said i understand your natural reluctance but the police are going to knock on the door eventually if nathaniel couldnt leave with us that meant leaving people behind to guard him which put people in danger again if we were all somewhere together at least we wouldnt be endangering innocent policemen though most cops would wince at being called innocent i took a deep breath and blew it out fine whats your idea close your eyes stephen said i frowned at him he looked patient longsuffering even and i closed my eyes he took my hand in his and it wasnt until he began to gently open my fist that i realized id clenched up he started to massage my hand i said stop that then loosen up he said it wont hurt im not afraid it will hurt i said he moved around to stand in back of me so close the hem of his gown brushed my legs but youre still afraid his voice had dropped almost to a whisper can you use that fear to call power my pulse was hammering in my throat and i was afraid but it wasnt the right kind of fear the fear that overwhelms you in the midst of an emergency can call power almost without effort this was the kind of fear that keeps you from jumping out of perfectly good airplanes even though youd decided to do it not an unhealthy fear but it would hold you back no i said then let go of the fear he said he touched my arms gently and sat me on the edge of the bed nathaniel made a small protesting sound as if it had hurt i opened my eyes and stephen said close them it was the closest thing to an order id ever heard him give i closed them he took my hands and laid the tips of my fingers on either side of nathaniels face the skin just over the temples is so soft he drew my fingers in a soft feathery line down nathaniels face fingers gliding on either side as if i were blind and trying to memorize his features he slid my hands into nathaniels hair it was silken unbelievably soft his hair had the texture of satin i balled my hands into that soft warmth lowered my face towards his hair and smelled it there was a faint medicinal smell i buried my face in the satin brush of his hair and found his scent under it all he smelled like vanilla and under that was the scent of wood and field and fur he wasnt pack but the scent was similar he smelled like home something clicked deep inside me like a switch being thrown i opened my eyes and knew what to do how to do it wanted to do it like a distant thought i realized that stephens hands had fallen away long ago i stared down into nathaniels lilac eyes and bent towards that amazing gaze i touched his lips with mine a chaste kiss and that one soft brush brought the power in a warm skintingling rush it spilled out of me like water warm soothing filling but power alone wasnt enough it needed direction guidance and i knew how to do it as if id done it before i didnt question it didnt want to i tried to run my hand down his chest but the gown covered him he was like stephen like me small the gown was fastened in front not in back my hand sought the opening and slid along bare skin slid until i felt the incision i straddled nathaniels legs he made another small hurting sound and i liked it i rose up on my knees so only the sides of my legs touched his body i slid the sheet down around his body and opened the gown exposing him the stitches were a thin dark line across the paleness of his skin that ran nearly from one hip to the other a fearful wound a killing wound he wore nothing below the waist hospitals are always stripping us down leaving us as vulnerable as possible the sight of him naked should have stopped me in my tracks dimly it shocked me i hadnt expected it but it was too late the power didnt care i ran my fingers lightly over the stitches nathaniel cried out only half from pain he was halferect before i lowered my face to the stitches i licked the wound like a dog would long slow caresses he was more than halferect when i raised my face to see his eyes staring down at me i knew in that moment that i could have him that he wanted me to take that last step i could feel the others in the room like a hum of energy a vibrating backdrop to the energy inside me id never been interested in casual sex but the smell and feel of nathaniels body was almost overwhelming id never been so tempted by a stranger but temptation is just tempting you dont have to give in i rose on my knees over him placing my hands on the smooth bones of his hips drawing my hands towards the middle of the incision when my hands touched i put one on top of the other and pressed not with muscle or flesh but with power i thrust that warm rising power into his body he gasped spine bowing underneath me hands grabbing my arms fingers convulsing against my bare skin it was like smoothing out the imperfections in a zombie except this flesh was warm and alive and i couldnt see what i was fixing with my eyes but i could feel it i could feel his body smooth and firm caressing places that no hand was meant to touch rolling them between my fingers filling him up with the rising rushing heat inside me it spilled down my arms my hands into him the heat spread through his body through my body until it was like fever running over the skin through the body forming our bodies into a single thing of heat and flesh and a rush of power that just kept building it built until i closed my eyes but even the darkness was shot with brightness white flowers exploding on my vision my breath came in pants too quick too shallow i opened my eyes and watched nathaniels face his breathing matched mine i forced us slower forced his breathing to slow i could feel his heart as if i caressed it held in my hands i could touch any part of him i could have any part of him i could smell the blood under his skin and wanted a taste he was healed when i lowered myself on top of him pressed my mouth to his i turned his face to one side and ate down the side of his neck until i felt the pulse under his skin i licked the skin but it wasnt enough i laid my mouth over the beating pulse bit gently into the skin until i could hold the throbbing of him in my mouth i wanted to bite down harder and harder until blood flowed i wanted it dimly i knew that jeanclaude had awakened for the day it was his hunger that i felt his need but it wasnt his need that had me straddling nathaniels body it wasnt even mine i remembered nathaniels body and id never met him before i knew the taste of him the feel of him as only an old lover can not my memories not my energy i slid off nathaniel tried to crawl out of the bed and fell to my knees i couldnt stand not yet richard had said as long as the pack existed raina wasnt gone i hadnt understood what he meant until now i was channeling the bitch from hell channeling her and having a very good time doing it but i knew something else something that raina hadnt done couldnt blame her for this one i knew how to heal nathaniels body but i also knew how to tear it apart anything that you can fix you can break when i held his heart in my metaphysical hand id had a split second a dark urge to close that hand to crush that pulsing throbbing muscle until blood flowed and his life stopped a moment the blink of an eye of an urge so evil it scared even me id have liked to blame the bitch from hell but something told me that this little bit of darkness was all mine stephens hand on my mouth was all that kept me from screaming out loud stephens hand held the screams to a whimper he held me against his body hard as if afraid of what id do if i got loose i wasnt so sure myself running seemed like good idea running until i outran the thought of it the feel of it all out of me but like richard i couldnt run from myself that thought made me stop struggling and just sit in the circle of stephens arms are you all right he asked softly i nodded his hand slid away from my mouth slowly as if he wasnt sure id heard him or understood him i sagged against him almost sliding to the floor he stroked my face over and over like youd comfort a sick child he didnt ask what was wrong none of them did nathaniel knelt beside us he didnt just look healed he looked healthy he was smiling handsome in a boyish unfinished sort of way if you cut the hair and changed the eyes he looked like he should have been playing halfback on the highschool football team and dating the homecoming princess the fact that id almost gone down on him two minutes ago brought a rush of heat that made me hide my face against stephens shoulder i did not want to look into that youthful handsome face and realize how close id come to doing him the fact that i could still remember his body in details that id personally never touched didnt help raina was gone but not forgotten i felt movement the vibrating energy of the shapeshifters was getting closer i knew without looking that they were crowding around me the energy tightened like a circle drawing closed it was hard to breathe i felt someones check brush my face i moved my head enough to see kevin inches from me id expected nathaniel teddys large hands stroked down my bare arms he brought his hands to his face you smell like pack lorraine was on her back staring up at me with eyes gone strange and wolfish she smells like raina she rolled her face so that her lips brushed the knee of my jeans i knew that if i allowed it we could sleep in one big communal heap like a litter of puppies that touching was part of what kept the pack together like the mutual grooming that primates do touching comforting it didnt have to be sexual that had been rainas choice they were wolves but they were also people and that made them primates two animals really not just one kevin laid his head in my lap cheek resting on my leg i couldnt see his eyes to tell if theyd gone wolf on me his voice came thick and low now i do need a cigarette it made me laugh once i started laughing i couldnt stop i laughed until tears ran down my face the werewolves ran their hands up and down me faces rubbing my bare skin they were taking my scent rolling in the lingering scent of raina marking me with their scent stephen kissed my cheek the way youd kiss your sister are you all right it was hard to remember but i think hed asked that before i nodded yes my voice sounded tinny and distant i realized i was on the edge of shock not good stephen shooed the wolves away from me they moved languorously as if the energy wed raised had been some sort of drug or maybe sex was a better analogy i didnt know i wasnt even sure i wanted to know richard said that raina wasnt truly gone as long as the pack lived is this what he meant i asked yes stephen said though ive never heard of a nonpack member being able to do what you just did the spirits of the dead should only be able to enter lukoi spirits of the dead i said you mean you dont have a fancy name for them they are munin stephen said that almost started me laughing again memory odins raven he nodded yes what exactly was it is it it wasnt a ghost i know what a ghost feels like youve felt one of them stephen said its the best explanation i can give you its energy teddy said energy is neither created nor destroyed it exists we have the energy of everyone that has ever been pack you dont mean all lukoi do you no he said but from the first member of our pack to now we have them all not all lorraine said he nodded sometimes one of us will be lost to accident and the body cannot be recovered and shared then all they were all their knowledge their power is lost to us kevin had gone back to the chair still sitting on the floor leaning his shoulders against the chair seat sometimes he said we decide not to feed its sort of like excommunication the pack rejects you in death as in life why didnt you reject raina she was a twisted sadistic bitch it was richards choice teddy said by rejecting her body that last time he thought it would have angered some of the other pack members who arent wholeheartedly on his side yet he was right but now we have her inside us shes powerful lorraine said and she shivered powerful enough to possess a lesser wolf old wives tales kevin said shes dead her power survives but only when called i didnt call her i said we might have stephen said softly he lay back on the floor hands covering his eyes as if it was too horrible to look at what do you mean i mean that weve never seen anyone but raina do what you just did i was thinking about her remembering so was i kevin said yes teddy said he had moved back to the far wall as if he didnt trust himself near me lorraine had moved back with him sitting so that their bodies touched lightly a comforting closeness i too was thinking about her glad she was not here happy it was anita she hugged her arms as if cold and teddy put a muscular arm around her hugging her close resting his chin in her hair i wasnt thinking about raina nathaniel said he crawled towards me dont touch me i said he rolled onto his back for all the world like a big pussy cat wanting its belly rubbed he stretched straining from toes to finger tips he laughed and rolled onto his stomach propped on his elbows he looked up at me long rich brown hair like a curtain across his face his lilac eyes stared out at me feral and almost frightening he lay down in a pool of hair and energy his gaze stayed on my face and i realized he was being playful not exactly seductive but playful it was different and almost more disturbing nathaniel managed to be childlike catlike and still be an adult you didnt know whether to pat him on the head rub his belly or kiss him all three seemed to be up for grabs it was too confusing for me i used the far bed to get to my feet when i was sure i could walk without falling down i let go of the bed i swayed just a touch but not too bad i could walk great because i wanted out of here what do you want us to do stephen asked go to my house jeanclaudes there and richard was there what about him kevin asked nathaniel raised his head enough to look at us all he said nothing asked for nothing but i could taste his pulse in my mouth i knew he was scared scared to be left alone again i hoped this empathy with me wasnt permanent i had quite enough men running around in my head without adding another one take him with you i said the leopards are mine as you are mine he is to be protected and treated as pack kevin asked i rubbed my temples i was getting a headache yes yes ive given him my protection any of the leopards that want my protection can have it as our lupa that binds us to protect them lorraine said even to give our life for them will they do the same i wasnt getting a headache i had one nathaniel rolled to his feet in a movement that was too graceful to be real and almost too quick to see he sat on the foot of stephens bed watching me with bright eager eyes he said my body is yours my life if you want it is yours to take he said it almost matteroffactlyno joyously like it was a good thing i stared at him i dont want anyones life nathaniel but if the pack is willing to risk their lives to protect you i expect you to do the same i will do anything you want he said all you have to do is tell me he didnt say ask me he said tell me id never heard it phrased quite like that it implied he didnt have the right to say no i asked does everyone here know they have the right to argue a point with me i mean when i say jump you dont just say how high right we dont stephen said his face was guarded careful how about you i asked turning to nathaniel he rose to his knees leaning his upper body out towards me but with both hands still on the bed railing he didnt try to touch me just get closer how about me what he asked you do understand that you have the right to refuse me that my word is not like from on high just tell me what you want me to do anita and ill do it just like that no questions youll just do it he nodded anything is this a custom among the leopards the pard i asked no stephen said its just nathaniels way i shook my head literally waving my hands in the air as if id just erase it all i dont have time for this hes healed take him with you do you want me to wait in your room nathaniel asked if you need to rest help yourself to a bed i wont be there he smiled happily and i had the oddest feeling that what i was saying wasnt what he was hearing i wanted out of the room away from them all id tell padgett i was sending them all to a safe house and hed buy it because he wanted off this detail he wanted away from them more than i did the doctor was amazed at nathaniels recovery they released him though they started talking about wanting to run more tests i vetoed that we had places to go people to meet they all piled into kevins and teddys cars and i went for my jeep happy to be rid of them for a while happy even if it meant another crime scene happy even if i still didnt know how to tell if malcolm was alive down there in the dark nathaniel watched me through the back window of the car his lilac gaze on me until the car turned a corner hed been lost and now he thought hed been found but if he expected me to be more than friends he was still lost i felt like shit and didnt have a bruise to show for it i concentrated on the next problem pushing what id done and almost done to the back burner nothing i could do about it until i talked to richard and jeanclaude id worried about tying myself to the vampire but id never really worried about being tied to the werewolf i should have known id get shit from both sides i got beeped three times in about three minutes mckinnon first dolph second and an unknown number the unknown number called back twice in ten minutes damn i pulled off into a service station i called dolph first anita how do you always know its me i dont he said whats up we need you at a new location im on my way to the church site for mckinnon petes here with me that sounds ominous weve got a vamp on his way to the hospital he said in his coffin no then how he was on the stairs covered in blankets they dont think hes going to make it but this is one of the halfway houses for the church weve got a twobiter here that says the vamp we took was the guardian for the younger vamps still inside she seems worried about what the vamps will do when they wake and the guardian isnt there to calm them down or feed them feed them i asked says that they each take a small drink from the guardian to start the night without it she says the hunger grows too strong and they may be dangerous isnt she a font of information shes scared anita shes got two freaking vampire bites on her neck and shes scared shit i said im on my way but frankly dolph i dont know what you want me to do youre the vampire expert you tell me a little hostility there ill think about it on the way maybe ill have come up with a plan by the time i get there before they became legal wed have just burned them out ourselves yeah i said the good old days yeah he said i dont think he got the sarcasm but with dolph it was always hard to tell i dialed the third number larry answered anita his voice sounded strained painfilled whats wrong i asked my throat suddenly tight im all right you dont sound all right i said ive just been moving around too much with the stitches and stuff i need to take a pain pill but i wont be able to drive you need a lift he was quiet for a second or two then yes i knew how much it had cost him to call me this was one of his first times in the field on a police job without me the fact that he needed my help for anything must have griped his ass it would have bugged the hell out of me in fact i wouldnt have called id have toughed it out until i passed out this wasnt a criticism of larry it was a criticism of me he was just smarter than i was sometimes this was one of those times where are you he gave me the address and it was close lucky us im less than five minutes away but i cant take you home im on my way to another crime scene as long as i dont have to drive ill be okay its starting to take all my attention just to stay on the road time to stop driving when its this hard you really do have a higher wisdom score than i do which means you wouldnt have asked for help yet he said well yeah when would you have asked for help when i drove off the road and had to call a tow truck he laughed and took a sharp breath as if it hurt ill be waiting for you ill be there i know he said thanks for not saying you told me so i wasnt even thinking it larry honest cross my heart and dont say it you getting superstitious on me larry he was quiet for a space of heartbeats maybe or maybe its just been a long day itll be a longer night i said thanks he said just what i wanted to hear he hung up then without saying goodbye maybe id trained dolph never to say goodbye maybe i was always the bearer of bad tidings and everyone wanted to get off the phone with me as soon as possible naw i expected larry to be sitting in his car he wasnt he was leaning against it even from a distance i could tell he was in pain back stiff trying not to move any more than necessary i pulled in beside him up close he looked worse his white dress shirt was smeared with black soot his summerweight dress pants were brown so theyd survived a little better a black smudge ran across his forehead to his chin the blackness outlined one of his blue eyes so that it seemed darker like a sapphire surrounded by onyx the look in his eyes was dull as if the pain had drained him jesus you look like shit i said he almost smiled thanks i needed that take a pill get in the jeep he started to shake his head stopped in midmotion and said no if you can drive i can go to the next disaster you smell like someone set your clothes on fire you look pristine he said and he sounded resentful whats wrong larry other than my back feels like a redhot poker is being shoved up it besides that i said ill tell you in the car underneath the sulkiness he sounded tired i didnt argue with him just started walking for the jeep a few steps and i realized he wasnt keeping up i turned and found him standing very still eyes closed hands in fists at his sides i walked back to him need a hand he opened his eyes smiled a back actually hands work fine i smiled and took his arm gently half expecting him to tell me not to but he didnt he was hurting he took a stiff step and i steadied him we made slow but sure progress to the jeep his breath was coming in small shallow pants by the time i got him around to the passenger side door i opened the door wasnt sure how to get him inside it was going to hurt any way i could do it just let me hold your arm i can do it myself he said i offered my arm he got a death grip on it and sat down he made a small hissing noise between his teeth you said it would hurt worse the second day why are you always right hard to be perfect i said but its a burden ive learned to cope with i gave him my best bland face he smiled then started to laugh then almost doubled over with pain which hurt more he ended up writhing on the seat for a few seconds when he could sit still again he grabbed the dashboard until his fingers turned colors god dont make me laugh sorry i said i got the aloeandlanolin baby wipes from the trunk of my car they were great for getting blood off theyd probably work on soot i handed him the wipes and helped him buckle his seat belt yes his wounds would have hurt less if he hadnt had the belt but no one rides with me without a seat belt my mom would be alive today if shed been wearing a belt take a pill larry sleep in the car ill take you home after this next scene no he said and he sounded so stubborn so determined that i knew i couldnt talk him out of it so why try have it your way i said but what have you been doing that you look like youve been trying to hide your spots he moved just his eyes to look at me frowning rolling in soot i said dont you ever watch disney movies or read childrens books he gave a small smile not lately ive had three fire scenes where i just had to confirm the vamps were dead two of the scenes i couldnt find anything just ashes the third one looked like black sticks i didnt know what to do anita i tried to check for a pulse i know that was stupid the skull just exploded into ashes all over me he was sitting very stiff very controlled yet his body gave the impression of hunching from pain avoiding the blow of what hed seen today what i was about to say wouldnt help things vamps burn to ashes larry if there were skeletal remains left it wasnt vampire he looked at me then the sudden movement bringing tears to his eyes you mean that was human probablyim not sure but probably thanks to me well never know for sure without the fangs in the skull you cant tell the difference thats not entirely true they can do dna though truthfully im not sure what the fire does to dna sampling if they can gather it they can at least know if its human or vamp if its human ive destroyed any chance they have of using dental records he said larry if the skull was that fragile i dont think anything could have saved it it certainly wouldnt have stood up to dental imprinting are you sure he asked i licked my lips and wanted to lie not a hundred percent youd have known it was human you wouldnt have touched it thinking it was alive would you i let silence fill the car answer me he said no i wouldnt have checked for a pulse i would have assumed it was human remains dammit anita ive been doing this for over a year and im still making stupid mistakes not stupid just mistakes whats the difference he asked i was thinking that what hed done to get his back ripped up was a stupid mistake but decided not to say it out loud you know the difference larry when you get over feeling sorry for yourself youll know the difference dont be condescending anita the anger in his voice stung more than the words i didnt need this today i really didnt larry id love to soothe your ego and make it all better but i am all out of sugarplums and puppydog tails my day hasnt been exactly a barrel of laughs either whats wrong he asked i shook my head come on im sorry ill listen i wasnt even sure where to start and i wasnt ready to tell anybody about what had happened in the hospital room least of all larry i dont even know where to start larry try he said richard is being nasty boyfriend trouble he said he sounded almost amused i glanced at him dont be condescending larry sorry its not just that before this emergency came up they wanted me at the church of eternal life malcolm is bedded in the basement his followers want him to be rescued the firemen want to know if they can leave him until nightfall when hell rise on his own so larry asked so i dont have the faintest idea how to find out if malcolm is alive or dead he stared at me youre kidding wish i was but youre a necromancer he said i raise zombies and an occasional vamp but i cant raise a master vamp of malcolms power besides what if i could would that prove he was alive or prove he was dead i mean if i could raise him it might just mean he was ready to be a zombie hell jeanclaudes awake for the day maybe malcolm is too a vampire zombie larry said i shrugged i dont know im the only person who can raise vamps like zombies that i know of there arent a lot of books on the subject what about sabitini you mean the magician he raised zombies as part of his act and he had vampires that did his bidding ive read eyewitness accounts of it first he died in a little before my time second the vampires were just dupes who went along with him it was a way for vampires who would have normally been killed on sight to walk freely among the people sabitini and his pet vampires they called them no ones ever proved that he was a fraud anita fine but hes dead and he didnt leave any diaries behind raise him and ask larry said i stared at him long enough that i had to hit the brakes fast to keep from ramming a car in front of me what did you say raise sabitini and find out if he could raise vampires like you can hes just a little over a hundred years dead youve raised zombies a lot older than that you missed the case last year where a vaudun priestess had raised a necromancer the zombie got completely out of control and started killing people youve told me about it but the priestess didnt know what he was if you knew going in you could take precautions no i said why not he said i opened my mouth closed it because i didnt have a good answer i dont approve of raising the dead for curiositys sake you know how much money ive been offered to raise dead celebrities id still like to know what really happened to marilyn monroe he said when her family comes and asks maybe ill do it but i am not raising the poor woman because a tabloid waved money at our boss waved a lot of money at our boss larry said enough money that he sent jamison out to try it he couldnt raise her too long dead without a bigger sacrifice i shook my head jamison is a weenie everyone else at animators inc turned it down including you i said he shrugged i might raise her and ask how she died but not in front of cameras the poor woman was hounded alive dead shes still being hounded doesnt seem fair youre a good guy larry not good enough to know that vampires burn to ash and skeletal remains are human dont start larry its just experience i should have told you before you went out today truthfully youre getting so good at the job i didnt think to tell you you assumed i knew he said yeah i have noticed the daily lectures have been in short supply lately i used to take more notes at work with you than i ever did in college not so many notes lately huh i said no i hadnt really thought about it but no he grinned suddenly and it lit up his eyes chased away the horrors of the day for a moment he was the brighteyed optimistic kid who had first shown up on my doorstep you mean im finally learning how to do the job yeah i said you are in fact if you were quicker on the trigger id say you were good at it its just hard to learn everything larry something comes up and you find out you really dont know what the hells going on after all you too he said me too he took a deep breath and let it out ive seen you surprised a time or two anita when the monsters get so strange that you dont know whats going either it usually gets real nasty real fast he was right i wished he wasnt because right now i didnt know what the hell was going on i didnt understand what had happened with nathaniel i didnt know how the marks worked with richard i didnt know how to find out if malcolm was still among the undead or if hed crossed into that more permanent state of true death in fact i had so many questions and so few answers that i just wanted to go home maybe larry and i could both take a pain pill and sleep until tomorrow surely tomorrow would be a better day god i hoped so the house was still smoking when we got there thin greyish wisps of smoke rose from the blackened beams like miniature ghosts some trick of the fire had left the high cupola on top of the building intact the lower stories were gutted and blackened but the cupola rose like a white beacon above the wreck it looked like a blacktoothed giant had taken a great bite out of the house the fire truck took up most of the narrow street there was a spread of water seeping along the street like a shallow lake firefighters waded through the water rolling up miles of hose over their shoulders a uniformed police officer stopped us well back from the action i eased down my window and flashed my id it was a little plastic clipon card and looked official but it wasnt a badge sometimes the uniforms would let me through and sometimes they had to go ask permission brewsters law was going around washington and would give vamp executioners what amounted to federal marshal status i wasnt sure how i felt about that it takes a hell of a lot more to make a cop than just a badge but for me personally id love to have had a badge to flash anna blake larry kirkland to see sergeant storr the officer frowned at the id ill have to clear this with someone i sighed fine well wait here the uniform went off in search of dolph and we waited you used to argue with them larry said i shrugged theyre just doing their job since when has that stopped you from bitching i looked at him he was smiling which saved him from the scathing comeback i had ready besides it was nice to see him smiling about anything right now so im mellowinga little so what the smile widened to a grin a shiteating grin my uncle would have called it it was like the next thing out of his mouth was almost too funny to say i was betting i wouldnt think it was funny at all is it being in love with jeanclaude thats mellowed you or the regular sex i smiled sweetly speaking of regular sex how is detective tammy he blushed first i was happy the uniform was walking down the wet street towards us with detective tammy reynolds in tow oh life was good well if it isnt your little sugarplum now i said larry saw her then the red flush brightened to something the color of raw flame redder than his hair his blue eyes were a little bulgy with the effort to breathe the soot had been wiped away which saved his face from looking like a reddish bruise you wont say anything will you anita tammy doesnt like to be teased who does i said im sorry he said speaking very fast before they could get to us i apologize it will never happen again please do not embarrass me in front of tammy would i do that to you in a hot second he said please dont they were almost at the car dont pull my leg and i wont pull yours i whispered deal he said i eased down the window smiling detective reynolds how good to see you reynolds frowned because i was seldom glad to see her she was a witch and the first police detective ever with preternatural abilities beyond psychic gifts but she was young bright shiny and tried just a little too hard to be my friend she was just sooo fascinated with the fact that i raised the dead she wanted to know all about it id never had a witch make me feel like such a damned freak most witches were nice understanding souls perhaps it was the fact that reynolds was a christian witch a member of the followers of the way a sect going back to the gnostics who embraced almost all magical ability they were all but wiped out during the inquisition due to the fact that their beliefs dont allow them to hide their light under a bushel but they survived fanatics have a way of doing that reynolds was tall slender with straight brown hair falling around her shoulders and eyes that i would have said were hazel but she called green greyishgreen with a large circle of pale brown around the pupil cats have green eyes most people dont shed tried to be my friend and when i wouldnt tell her about raising the dead shed turned to larry hed been reluctant at first for the same reasons i was but she hadnt offered me sex it pushed larry over the edge and into her arms id have complained about his choice of sweeties if id any moral high ground to stand on it wasnt the witch part that bothered me or the cop it was the religiousfanatic part but when you share the sheets with the walking dead you dont get a lot of room to bitch i smiled sweetly at her reynolds frown deepened id never been this happy to see her before good to see you too anita her greeting was cautious but seemed sincere always willing to turn the other cheek a good little christian i was beginning to wonder if i was still a good christian i didnt doubt god i doubted me having premarital sex with a vampire had shaken my faith in a lot of things she bent her five foot ten frame to peer in the window past me at larry hi larry her smile was genuine too her eyes sparkled with it i could feel the waves of lust if not love going from her to him like a warm embarrassing current the blush had left larrys face milkpale with the sprinkling of freckles like brown ink spots he turned large blue eyes to her and i didnt like the way he looked at her i wasnt sure it was just lust on larrys part maybe it wasnt for reynolds either but i didnt worry about her feelings the way i did larrys detective reynolds he said was it my imagination or was his voice just a touch deeper nah larry that one word was full of too much warmth where do you want us to park i asked she blinked hazel eyes at me as if for a second shed forgotten i was there anywhere back here great she stepped back and let me park but her eyes lingered on larry maybe it was more than lust damn we parked larry undid his seat belt carefully grimacing id gotten the door for him at the gas station you want me to get the door he turned stiffly towards the door trying to keep his upper body immobile he stopped with his hand on the handle his breath came in little gasps yes please me id have gotten the door myself just from pure stubbornness larry really was the wiser of the two of us i held the door for him and offered him a hand i pulled he pushed with his legs and we got him standing he started to hunch from the pain but that bent his back which made the pain worse he ended standing as straight as he could leaning against the jeep trying to get his breath back pain will leave you breathless reynolds was suddenly beside us whats wrong you tell her ill go talk to dolph sure larry said voice strained he needed to be in bed knocked out on painkillers maybe he wasnt that much smarter than me it wasnt hard to spot dolph pete mckinnon was standing with them it was like walking towards two small mountains dolphs dark suit looked freshly pressed white shirt crisp tie knotted against the collar he couldnt have been out in the heat long even dolph sweats anita he said dolph ms blake nice to see you again pete mckinnon said i smiled good to know someones happy to see me if dolph got the dig he ignored it everyones waiting for you dolph always was a man of few words pete said i grinned at him good to know its nothing personal dolph frowned at us if you two are through weve got work to do pete and i grinned at each other and followed dolph across the wet street i was happy to be back in my nikes i could walk as good as any of the men in the right shoes a tall thin fireman with a grey mustache watched me stride across the street he was still wearing helmet and coat in the july heat four others had stripped down to tshirts with just the rubberylooking pants on someone had sprayed them down with a water they looked like an ad for a beefcake wet tshirt contest they were drinking gatorade and water like their lives depended on it did a gatorade truck just roll by or is this some arcane postfire ritual i asked pete answered its damned hot in a fire with full gear on you dehydrate water to rehydrate and gatorade for the electrolytes so you dont pass out from the heat ah i said the fireman whod been rolling up the hose came over to us a delicate triangle of face peered out from under the helmet clear grey eyes met my gaze there was a lift to the chin a way that she held herself that was a challenge i recognized the symptoms i had my own mountainsized chip on my shoulder i felt like apologizing for assuming she was a man but didnt it would have been insulting pete introduced me to the tall man this is captain fulton hes incident commander on this site i offered my hand while he was still thinking about it his hand was large bigknuckled he shook hands like he was afraid to squeeze too hard and dropped contact as soon as he could i bet that he was just pleased as punch to have a female fireperson on his unit he introduced the fireperson in question corporal tucker she offered her hand she had a nice firm handshake and eye contact so sincere it was aggressive i smiled nice not to be the only woman on the scene for a change that brought a very small smile to her face she gave the barest of nods and stepped back letting her captain take over how much do you know about a fire scene miss blake its ms blake and not much he frowned at the correction i felt dolph shift beside me unhappy with me his face wouldnt show it but i could almost feel him willing me not to be a pain in the butt who me corporal tucker was staring at me eyes wide face very still as if she was trying not to laugh one of the other firemen joined us his damp tshirt clung to a stomach that had required far too many situps but i enjoyed the view anyway he was tall broadshouldered blond and looked like he should have been carrying a surfboard or visiting barbie in her malibu dream house there was a smear of soot on his smiling face and his eyes were redrimmed he offered his hand without being introduced im wren no rank just his name confident he held my hand just a little longer than necessary it wasnt obnoxious just interested i dropped my eyes not out of shyness but because some men mistake direct eye contact as a comeon i had about as much beefcake on my plate as i could handle without adding amorous firemen captain fulton frowned at wren do you have any questions ms blake he emphasized the ms so it sounded like three zs at the end youve got a basement full of vampires that you need to rescue without exposing them to sunlight or getting any of your people eaten right he stared at me for a second or two thats the gist of it why cant you just leave them in the basement until full dark i asked the floor could cave in at any minute he said which would expose them to sunlight and kill them i said he nodded dolph said one vamp was covered with blankets and rushed to the hospital is that why you think the others may not be in their coffins he blinked theres also a vampire on the stairs leading down its his gaze fell then came up suddenly to grab mine angry ive seen burn victims but nothing quite like this are you sure its a vampire yes why because vamps exposed to sunlight or fire usually burn completely down to ash and a few bone fragments we doused it with water wren said thought it was a person at first what changed your mind it was his turn to look away it moved it was like thirddegree burns down to cartilage and muscle bone and it held out its hand to us his face looked pale haunted no person could have done that we kept coating it with water thinking maybe we could save it but it stopped moving so you assumed it was dead i asked all three of them exchanged glances captain fulton said you mean it might not be dead i shrugged never underestimate a vamps ability to survive captain weve got to go back in there and get it to a hospital wren said he turned as if hed walk back into the house fulton caught his arm can you tell if the vampire is alive or dead fulton asked i think so you think ive never heard of a vamp surviving fire so yeah i think i can tell if its alive if i said otherwise id be lying i try not to do that when its important he nodded twice briskly as if hed made up his mind about me the arsonist threw accelerant all over the floor that were going to be walking on top of and once were down in the basement that same floor will be above us so that floor is not going to hold ms blake im going to make this a strictly voluntary job for my people i looked up into his serious face how likely is the floor to fall and how soon no way of knowing frankly im surprised it hasnt caved in by now its a halfway house for the church of eternal life if its like the last basement i saw at a lifers place the ceiling is concrete reinforced with steel beams that would explain why it hasnt fallen in fulton said so were safe right i asked fulton looked at me and shook his head the heat could have weakened the concrete or even weakened the tensile strength of the steel beams so it could still fall down i said he nodded with us in it great lets do it fulton grabbed my arm and gripped it too tight i stared at him but he didnt flinch and he didnt let me go do you understand that we could be buried alive down there or crushed to death or even drowned if theres enough water let go of me captain fulton my voice was quiet steady not angry point for me fulton released me and stepped back his eyes looked a little wild he was spooked i just want you to understand what could happen she understands dolph said i had an idea captain fulton how do you feel about sending your people in to a potential deathtrap to save a bunch of vampires something passed through his dark eyes the law says theyre people you dont leave people hurt or trapped but i prompted but my men are worth more to me than a bunch of corpses not long ago id have brought the marshmallows and wieners for the roast i said what changed your mind fulton asked kept meeting too many human beings that were as monstrous as the monsters maybe not as scary but just as evil police work will ruin your view of your fellow man detective tammy said she and larry had joined us at last it had taken larry a long time to cross those yards he was far too hurt to insist on going inside the house good ill go in because its my job but i dont have to like it fulton said fine but if we do have a cavein we better get dug out before nightfall because without the vamp chaperone well be facing a basement full of new vamps that may not have perfect control over their hunger his eyes widened showing too much white i would have bet money that fulton had had a close encounter of the fanged kind once upon a time there were no scars on his neck but that didnt prove anything vamps didnt always go for the neck no matter what the movies say blood flows near the surface in lots of places i touched his arm lightly tension sang down his muscles like a string pulled too tight whod you lose what he seemed to be having trouble focusing on me who did the vampires take away from you he stared at me dark eyes focusing on me whatever horrible image was floating behind his eyes retreated his face was almost normal when he said wife daughter i waited for him to say more but the silence gathered round us in a still deep pool made up of all the horror in those two whispered words wife daughter both lost notaken and now you have to go into the dark and save some bloodsuckers and risk yourself and your people that really sucks he took a deep breath through his nose and let it out slowly i watched him gain control of himself watched him build his defenses back piece by piece i wanted to let it burn when i found out what was inside but you didnt i said you did your job but the jobs not done he said softly lifes a bitch i said and then you die larry finished for me i turned and frowned at him but it was hard to argue today he was right the twobiter as dolph so poetically put it was a small woman in her thirties her brown hair was back in a tight ponytail leaving her neck and the vampire bites painfully visible vampire freaks people who just liked vamps for sexual turnons hid their fang marks unless at one of their hangouts human members of the church of eternal life almost always made sure the bites were visible hair worn just right short sleeves if the marks were at wrist or elbow bend they were proud of the bites saw them as signs of salvation the upper set of fang marks were larger the skin redder and more torn someone hadnt been neat with their food the second mark was almost dainty surgically neat the twobiters name was caroline and she stood hugging herself as if she were cold since you could probably fry eggs on the sidewalk i didnt think she was cold or at least not that kind of cold you wanted to see me caroline she nodded head bobbing up and down like one of those dogs you used to see in the backs of cars yes she said voice breathy she stared at dolph and mckinnon then back at me the look was enough she wanted privacy im going to take caroline for a little walk if thats okay dolph nodded mckinnon said the red cross have coffee and soft drinks he pointed to a small truck with a camper shell red cross volunteers giving coffee and comfort to the cops and firemen you didnt see them at every crime scene but they hit their share dolph caught my gaze and gave a very small nod he was trusting me to question her without him trusting me to bring him back any info that pertained to the crime the fact that he still trusted me that much made the day a little brighter nice that something did it was also nice to be doing something useful dolph had been hot to get me to the scene now everything was stalled fulton just wasnt eager to risk his people for corpses but that wasnt it if thered been six humans down there wed have already been suited up and going in but they werent human and no matter what the law said it made a difference dolph was right before addison v clark theyd have gotten a fire crew in here to make sure it didnt spread to the other houses but theyd have let it burn standard operating procedure but that was four years ago and the world had changed or so we told ourselves if the vamps werent in coffins and the roof collapsed they would be exposed to sunlight and that would be it the firemen had used an axe on the wall next to the stairs so i could see the second vamp corpse it was crispycrittered but not dust i had no explanation for why the body had remained so intact i wasnt even a hundred percent sure that come nightfall it wouldnt heal it even i still did it but the body was so badly burned like black sticks and brown leather the muscles in the face had pulled away leaving the teeth complete with fangs in a grimace that looked like pain firemen wren had explained to me that the muscles contract with the heat enough to break bones sometimes just when you think you know every awful thing about death you find out youre wrong i had to think of the body as an it or i couldnt look at it caroline had known the vampire i think she was having a lot more trouble thinking of the body as an it she got a soft drink from the nice red cross lady even i got a coke which meant it was pretty damn hot for me to pass on the coffee i led her to the front yard of a neighboring house where no one had come out to check the scene the drapes were all closed driveway empty everyone gone for the day the only sign of life was a triangular rose bed and a black swallowtail butterfly floating over it peaceful for a moment i wondered if the butterfly was one of warricks pets but there was no feel of power it was just a butterfly floating like a tiny tissuepaper kite over the yard i sat down on the grass caroline joined me smoothing her pale blue shorts down in back as if she was more accustomed to wearing skirts she took a drink of soda now that she had me to herself she didnt seem to know how to start it might have worked better if id waited for her to begin but my patience had been used up long ago it wasnt one of my cardinal virtues to begin with what did you want to tell me i asked she sat her can of soda carefully on the grass thin hands smoothing along the hem of her shorts she had pale pink nail polish on her short nails that matched the pink stripes in her tank top better than pale blue i guess can i trust you she asked in a voice as fragile and pale as she seemed i hate being asked questions like that i wasnt in the mood to lie maybe it depends on what you want to trust me with caroline looked a little startled as if shed expected me to just say sure that was very honest of you most people lie without thinking about it something in the way she said it made me think that caroline had been lied to often by people shed trusted i try not to lie caroline but if you have information thatll help us here you need to tell me i took a drink of my own soda and tried to appear casual forced my body not to tense up not to show how much i wanted to simply scream at her until she told me whatever it was short of torture you cant make people talk not really caroline wanted to tell me her secrets i just had to be calm and let her do it if i was overeager or abusive shed either fold and tell all or clam up and let us rot you never knew which way it would go so you try patience first you can always browbeat them later ive been the human liaison for this halfway house for three months now the guardian who oversaw the younger ones was giles he was strong and powerful but he was trapped in his coffin until true darkness then two nights ago he woke in the middle of the day the first time for him the one on the stairs has to be one of the younger vampires she looked at me brown eyes wide she leaned into me lowering her soft voice even further i had to lean into her just to catch her voice close enough that my hair brushed her shoulder none of the younger ones has been dead two years do you understand what that means it means that they shouldnt have risen during daylight hours it means that the one on the stairs should have been burnt to ashes exactly she said she sounded relieved to finally find someone who understood was this early waking restricted to your halfway house she shook her head whispering now we had our heads together like firstgraders talking in class i was close enough to see the fine red lines in her eyes caroline had been losing sleep over something every house and all the churches were suddenly having vampires rise early the hunger seemed worse on the young ones her hand went to her neck and the messy wound they were harder to control even by the guardians anyone have any theories as to why this was happening i asked malcolm thought someone was interfering with them i had several candidates for who might be interfering with the vamps but we werent here to get my answers we were here to get carolines answers he have any ideas about who you know about our illustrious visitors she asked voice even lower as if she were afraid to say the last if you mean the vampire council ive met them she jerked back from me then shocked met them she said but malcolm has not met them yet i shrugged they paid their respects to the master of the city first malcolm said they would contact us when they were ready he saw their coming as a sign that the rest of vampirekind was ready to embrace the true faith i wasnt about to sit there and tell her why the council had really come to town if the church didnt know they didnt need to know i dont think the council thinks much about religion caroline why else would they come i shrugged the council has its reasons see not a lie cryptic as hell but not a lie she seemed to accept the statement maybe she was used to cryptic bullshit why would the council want to hurt us maybe they dont see it as hurting if the firemen go down in there to save the young ones and they wake without a guardian she drew her knees to her chest hugging her legs theyll rise like revenants mindless beasts until theyve fed people could be dead before they come to themselves i touched her shoulder youre scared of them arent you id never met a human church member who was scared of vampires especially not one that was donating blood as a human liaison she lowered the neckline of her tank top until i could see the tops of her small breasts there was a bite mark on the pale flesh of one breast that looked more like a dog bite than one made by a vampire the flesh had bruised badly as if the vamp had been pulled off her almost as soon as hed started sucking giles had to pull him off of me he had to restrain him looking into his face i knew that if giles hadnt been there hed have killed me not to bring me over or embrace me but just because i was food she let her top slide back over the wound hugging herself tight shivering in the hot july sunshine how long have you been with the church caroline two years and this is the first time youve been scared she nodded theyve been very careful around you then what do you mean she asked i unbent my left arm showing the scars the mound of scar tissue at the crook is where a vamp gnawed on me he broke the arm i was lucky not to lose the use of it what about that she touched the claw marks that trailed down the lower part of the arm shapeshifted witch how did the cross get burned into your arm humans with a few bites like you thought it was amusing to brand me with the cross just amusing themselves until their master rose for the night her eyes were wide but the vampires in the church arent like that we arent like that all vamps are like that caroline some of them control it better than others but they still have to feed off humans you cant really respect something that you see as food but you are with the master of the city do you believe that of him i thought about that and answered truthfully sometimes she shook her head i thought i knew what i wanted what i was going to do for all eternity now i dont know anything i feel so lost tears trailed out of her wide eyes i put my arm across her shoulders and she leaned into me clinging to me with her small carefully painted hands she cried soundlessly only the shakiness of her breathing betraying her i held her and let her cry if i took the nice firemen down into the darkness and six newly dead vampires rose as revenants either the firemen were dead or id be forced to kill the vampires either way not a winwin situation we needed to find out if the vamps were alive needed some control over them if the council was causing the problems maybe they could help fix it when big bad vampires come to town to kill me i dont generally turn to them for help but we were trying to save vampires lives here not just human maybe theyd help maybe they wouldnt but it couldnt hurt to ask all right it could hurt to ask and probably would even over the phone i could tell jeanclaude was shocked at my idea of turning to the council for help call it a guess he was literally speechless it was nearly a first why not ask for their help they are the council ma petite he said voice almost breathy with emotion exactly i said they are the leaders of your people leadership doesnt just mean privileges it has a price tag tell that to your politicians in washington in their threethousanddollar suits he said i didnt say that we did any better thats beside the point theyve helped make this problem they can by god help fix it i had a bad thought unless theyre doing it on purpose i said he gave a long sigh no ma petite it is not on purpose i did not realize that it was happening to the others why isnt it happening to our vampires i think he laughed our vampires ma petite you know what i mean yes ma petite i know what you mean i have been protecting our people dont take this wrong but im surprised you had the juice to keep the council from messing with your people in truth ma petite so am i so youre more powerful than malcolm now it would appear so he said quietly i thought about that for a minute but why the early rising why the increased hunger why would the council want that to be happening they do not want it ma petite it is merely a side effect of their proximity explain i said their very presence will give unprotected vampires extra power early rising perhaps other gifts the more voracious appetite and lack of control of the younger ones could mean that the council has decided not to feed while in my territory i know the traveler can take energy through lesser vampires without possessing them so he takes part of the blood they drink oui ma petite are the others feeding i asked if all of the churchs members are experiencing this difficulty i would think not i think the traveler has found a way to drain energy for all of them though i cannot imagine yvette going for even a night without causing pain to someone she has warrick to pick on the moment i said it i realized i hadnt had a chance to tell jeanclaude about warricks little daytime excursion or his warning jeanclaude had woken from his sleep while i was at the hospital surrounded by wereanimals since then id been moving from one emergency to another warrick came to visit me while you were out for the day i said what do you mean ma petite i told him all of it he was silent only his soft breathing let me know he was still there finally he spoke i knew that yvette gained power through her master but i did not realize he was dampening warricks abilities he laughed suddenly perhaps that is why i did not realize i was a master vampire while i was with the council that first time perhaps my master too was preventing my powers from blossoming does warricks warning change our plans i asked we are committed to a formal entertainment ma petite if we refuse to pay the price for your wereleopards then we will give padma and yvette the very excuse they need to challenge us breaking faith once your word is given is an almost unforgivable sin among us ive endangered us i said oui but being who you are you could not do less warrick a master vampire who would have thought it he has been yvettes plaything for so very long how long i asked jeanclaude was quiet for a heartbeat or two then he was a knight of the crusades ma petite which crusade there were several i said so nice to talk to someone who knows their history ma petite but you have been near him what age is he i thought about it nine hundred give or take which would mean i dont like being quizzed jeanclaude the first crusade in the late s exactement so yvette was old even then i said do you not know her age shes a thousand years old but its a soft one thousand ive met vamps her age that scared the hell out of me she doesnt yes yvette is terrifying but not because of her age or her power she can live until the end of the world and she will never be a master among us and that gripes her ass i said crudely but accurately put ma petite im going to ask the traveler for help we have bargained for all the aid we will ever get from them ma petite do not put yourself further in their debt i beg this of you youve never begged anything of me i said then heed me now ma petite do not do this im not going to bargain i said he let out a breath as if hed been holding it good ma petite very good im just going to ask ma petite ma petite what have i just told you look were trying to save vampire lives here not just human vampires are legal in this country it doesnt just mean you get privileges it comes with a price or it should you are going to appeal to the councils sense of justice he didnt bother to keep the incredulity out of his voice in fact he played on it put that way it sounded silly but the council is partially to blame for whats happening theyve endangered their own people good leaders dont do that no one has ever accused them of being good leaders ma petite they just are it is not a question of good or bad we fear them and that is enough bullshit that isnt enough it isnt even close to enough he sighed promise me only that you will not bargain with them make your request but do not offer them anything for their aid you must swear this to me ma petite please it was the please that did it and the fear in his voice i promise its their job to do this you dont bargain to get someone to do what theyre supposed to do in the first place you are a wondrous combination of cynicism and naivetй ma petite you think its naive to expect the council to help the vampires of this city they will ask what is in it for them ma petite what will you say ill tell them its their duty and call them honorless bastards if they dont do it he did laugh then i would pay to hear this conversation would it help for you to listen in no if they suspect it is my idea they will demand a price only you ma petite could be this naive before them and hope to be believed i didnt think of myself as naive and it bugged me that he did of course he was nearly three centuries older than i was madonna probably seemed naive to him ill let you know how it goes oh the traveler will make very certain that i know the outcome am i about to get you in trouble we are already in trouble ma petite it cannot get much deeper was that meant to be comforting i asked un peu he said that meant a little right oui ma petite vous dispose a apprendre stop it i said as you like he lowered his voice to a seductive whisper as if it wasnt already the voice of wet dreams what were you doing when i awoke today id almost forgotten about my little hospital adventure now it came rushing back hard enough to bring heat to my face nothing no no ma petite that is not correct you were most certainly doing something did stephen and nathaniel arrive at the house they did great ill talk to you later you refuse to answer my question no i just dont know a short version that doesnt make me feel like a slut i dont have time for a longer version right now so can you wait i will wait for all eternity if my lady asks it can the crap jeanclaude if i wish you luck with the council would that please you more yeah yeah it is all right to be a lady anita it is not a bad thing being a woman you try being one then talk to me i said i hung up my lady sounded like my dog ownership i was his human servant short of killing him i couldnt change that but i didnt belong to him if i belonged to anybody i belonged to me and that was how i was going to approach the council as me anita blake vampire executioner police liaison for the monsters they wouldnt listen to jeanclaudes human servant but they might listen to me thomas answered the phone at the circus they have you doing flunky work i asked excuse me he said sorry this is anita blake he was quiet for a second then im sorry we are not open for business until nightfall is fernando there yes thats right nightfall i need to talk to the traveler thomas im asking this on police business not as jeanclaudes human servant weve got some vampires in trouble and i think he can help yes we do take reservations he said i gave him the number of dolphs car phone we dont have a lot of time thomas if he wont help me ive got to go in with cops and firemen on my own i look forward to seeing you tonight he hung up life would be so much easier if fernando were dead besides id promised sylvie wed kill him i always tried to keep my promises dolph was leaning in the door wanting to know what was taking so long when the phone rang i looked at him he nodded and moved away i picked up yes i am told you needed to speak with me i wondered whose lips he was using whose body thank you for calling me back traveler a little politeness couldnt hurt thomas was surprisingly eloquent on your behalf what do you wish of me i explained as briefly as possible and what do you wish me to do about this problem of yours you can stop taking energy through them that would help then i must feed on live humans is there someone you would offer in their place for each of us no no offers no bargains this is police business traveler im speaking with the authority of human law behind me not jeanclaude what is human law to me to us if we go down there and they attack us ill end up killing some of them they may kill policemen firemen thats bad publicity with brewsters law to be decided this fall the council has stopped all vampires in this country from fighting amongst themselves until the law is finalized surely slaughtering policemen is forbidden too it is he said his voice was so careful he gave me nothing i couldnt tell if he was angry or amused or gave a damn either way im asking you to help me save the lives of your vampires they belong to this church of yours they are not mine he said but the council is the overall leadership of the vampires right we are their ultimate law i didnt like the phrasing but i plowed ahead you could find out case by case if the vampires were alive or dead in the burnedout buildings you could keep the vamps from rising early and attacking us here i think you overestimate my powers anita i dont think so i said if jeanclaude will supply us with food i will be more than happy to cease borrowing from the others no you get nothing for this traveler if you give me nothing i give you nothing he said dammit this isnt a game we are vampires anita do you not understand what that means we are apart from your world what happens to you does not affect us bullshit some fanatics are out here trying to duplicate the inferno all over again that affects you thomas and gideon have had to repel invaders while you slept it does affect you it doesnt matter we are in your world but not of it he said look that may have worked in the s or whenever but the minute vampires became legal citizens it changed a vampire got taken to the hospital in an ambulance they are doing their best to keep him alive whatever the hell that means for you guys firemen are risking their lives to go into burnedout buildings to save vampires the fanatics are trying to kill you but the rest of us humans are trying to save you then you are fools he said maybe i said but we poor humans have taken oaths to protect and serve we honor our promises are you implying i do not im saying that if you dont help us here today then you arent worthy to be council you arent leaders youre just parasites feeding on the fear of your followers true leaders dont leave their people to die not if they can save them parasites may i tell the rest of the council your so high opinion of us he was angry now i could hear it like heat across the line yeah tell them all but mark me on this traveler vampires cant just gain privileges with legal citizenship they also gain responsibilities to the human law that made them legal is that so yeah thats so this mysterious in your world but not a part of it may have worked in the past but welcome to the twentieth century because thats what legal status means once youre citizens who pay taxes own businesses marry inherit have children you cant hide in some crypt somewhere and count the decades you are a part of our world now i will think upon what you have said anita blake when i get off the phone with you im going inside the house were going to start bringing out the vamps in body bags to protect them in case the floor caves in if they rise as revenants while were doing it itll be a bloodbath i am aware of the problems he said are you aware that its the presence of the council thats giving them the energy to possibly rise this early in the day i cannot change the effect our presence has on the lesser vampires if this malcolm wishes to claim the status of master then it is his duty to keep his people safe i cannot do it for him cant or wont i asked cant he said hmmm maybe i have overestimated your powers my apologies if i have accepted and i understand how rare it is for you to apologize for anything anita the phone went dead i hit the button that turned off the buzzing line dolph walked back as i got out of the car well dolph asked i shrugged looks like we go in without vampire backup you cant depend on them anita not for backup he took my hand something hed never done squeezing it this is all you can count on one human to another the monsters dont give a shit about us if you think they do then you are fooling yourself he dropped my hand and walked away before i could think of a comeback just as well after talking to the traveler i wasnt sure i had one an hour later i was dressed in a hazardous materials suithazmat for short it was bulky to say the least and turned into a portable sauna in the st louis heat heavy tape was wrapped around my elbows and wrists securing the seal between gloves and sleeves id walked out of the boots twice so they taped my legs too i felt like an astronaut who had gone to the wrong tailor insult to injury there was a selfcontained breathing apparatus scba strapped to my back add underwater and you got scuba but we werent planning to go underwater i was grateful for that there was a mask that covered the entire face instead of a mouthpiece with regulator but other than that it was damn close to scuba gear i had my diving certification got it back in college and keep it updated if you let it slide you have to take the whole damn training course over again updating was less painful i was delaying putting on the mask as long as possible due to a diving accident in florida ive got claustrophobia now not bad enough for elevators to be a problem but enclosed in the suit with a mask about to cover my face and the hazmat helmet going over my entire headi was panicking and didnt know what to do about it do you really think all this is necessary i asked for the dozenth time if theyd just give me a regular fire helmet with the scba i could handle it if you go in with us yes corporal tucker said her three inches of extra height didnt help much we both looked like we were wearing handmedowns theres the possibility of disease contamination if there are bodies floating in the basement lieutenant wren said will there really be that much water in the basement they exchanged glances youve never been in a house after a fire have you tucker asked no youll understand once were in she said sounds ominous its not meant to she said tucker didnt have much of a sense of humor and wren had too much hed been entirely too solicitous while we were wriggling into the suits hed made sure he taped me up and was even now wasting a brilliant smile on me but it was nothing too overt nothing obvious enough for me to say look i have a boyfriend for all i knew he was always like this and id look an ass for taking it personally put the mask on and ill help you fit the hood over it wren said i shook my head just give me a regular helmet and ill use the scba if you fall in the water without the hood sealed anita you might as well not have the suit at all ill take my chances i said tucker said you had trouble walking from the hazmat truck to here youll get better with practice but in deep water even well have trouble keeping our feet i shook my head again my heart was pounding so hard i was having trouble breathing i put the mask on my face i took a breath and that horrible sound began it was like darth vader breathing except it was yours in the water in the dark your breath was the only sound it could become thunderously loud while you waited to die strap needs tightening wren said he started to adjust the strap as if i were five and being bundled off to play in the snow i can do it my voice came over the open radio line in the mask he raised his gloved hands skyward still smiling he was a hard man to insult because id been trying he had this sort of cheerful goodwill that seemed to deflect everything never trust people who smile constantly theyre either selling something or not very bright wren didnt strike me as stupid insult to injury i couldnt get the strap adjusted on the damned mask i always hated trying to work with anything bulkier than surgical gloves i pulled the mask off and my first breath of real air was too loud too long i was sweating and it wasnt just the heat i had the browning and the firestar lying on the side of the fire truck there were enough pockets on the outside of the suit to hold half a dozen guns i had a sawedoff shotgun from my vampire kit in a makeshift pack across my back yeah its illegal but dolph had been with me once upon a time when we went after a revenant vampire they were like pcp users immune to pain stronger even than a normal vamp a force of hell with fangs i showed him the shotgun before i got it out he okayed it wed ended with two dead security guards and one rookie officer spread all over the hallway the last time at least dolph and his men had silver ammo now he and zerbrowski nearly getting killed because they didnt have it was what pushed the paperwork through i gave them a box of ammo for christmas before they got official silver ammo i never wanted to watch any of them bleed their lives away for lack of it id left the knives in their wrist sheaths carrying naked blades in the pockets of a suit that was airand watertight seemed sort of defeatist if i lost both handguns and had to scramble for the knives under the suit then we were probably toast no need to worry about it my silver cross hung naked around my neck it was the best deterrent i had against baby vamps they couldnt force their way past a bare cross not when it was backed up by faith id only met one vamp that could force his way past a blazing cross and harm me and he was dead funny how so many of them ended up that way tucker came over to me ill help you adjust the mask i shook my head leave me till last the less time im in this getup the better she licked her lips started to say something stopped then said are you all right normally i would have said sure but they were depending on me maybe for their lives how scared was i scared not exactly i said youre claustrophobic arent you she said i must have looked surprised because she said a lot of people want to be firemen but in the middle of a fire with the mask down and smoke so thick you cant see your hand in front of your eyes you dont want to be claustrophobic i nodded i can understand that theres a part of training where they cover your eyes completely and make you do the equipment by touch as if the smoke had blacked out the world you learn who doesnt like it close i could take the suit without the scba its the combination of the suit and listening to myself breathe i had a diving accident just after college can you do this no accusations just honesty i nodded i wont leave you stranded thats not what i asked she said we stared at each other give me a few minutes i just didnt understand what hazmat was ill be okay you sure i nodded she didnt say anything else just walked away to let me gather my scattered wits wren had finally wandered over to talk to fulton wren and tucker were going in because they were both paramedics and we might need their medical training also frankly i didnt want fulton in the dark with me and a bunch of vamps he was simply too freaked i didnt blame him but i didnt want him at my back either of course if id been watching me sweat and struggle to breathe calmly i might not want me in there dammit i could do this i had to do this detective tammy reynolds came slogging up in her own suit they didnt have one big enough to fit dolph so she was my armed backup oh joy i couldnt send them in with tammy as their only backup tammy had managed to get her shoulder rig over the suit she had one of those that just rode across the shoulders no belt to put through straps when id been shopping all the holsters that just crossed the shoulders moved around on me too much part of it is having narrow shoulders id have had to have the holster cut down i dont buy things that have to be fussed with not dresses or holsters reynolds smiled at me larrys really disappointed that he cant come along i m relieved i said she frowned at me i thought youd want him to back you up yeah but a gun cant help him if the ceiling caves in on us you think it will she asked i shrugged id concentrated on getting suited up on small details on wrens quiet teasing id managed not to dwell on the thought that we were about to walk across a floor that might collapse underneath us then walk under it and wait for it to collapse on top of us while wading through water full of coffins and vampires what could be better lets just say im cautious and you dont want to risk larry thats right i dont like the idea of larry getting hurt by anything i stared at her while i said it she blinked hazel eyes at me then smiled neither do i anita neither do i i nodded and let it go id done my parenting bit i wasnt even sure why i didnt trust tammy but i didnt womens intuition or maybe i just didnt trust much of anybody anymore maybe tucker came back to us time to suit up she looked right at me i nodded i let her help me adjust the mask over my face i closed my eyes and concentrated on my breathingin out in out in diving if you breathed too fast you could blow your lungs now it was just a way to keep from hyperventilating she fitted the suits hood over my head i watched her do it and knew my eyes were a little too wide wrens cheerful voice came over the radio in the mask breathe normally anita i am breathing normally i said it sounded odd to be able to talk normally while my own breathing was wheezing loud and ominous in my ears with a regulator in you couldnt talk though id learned you could scream with a regulator clenched between your teeth sounds echo like a son of a bitch under water with the helmet over the mask visibility was not the best i practiced turning my head seeing just how big the blind spots were my peripheral vision was almost gone tammys voice came over the radio its hard to see in this thing youll get used to it tucker said i hope were not in this getup long enough to get used to it i said if we say run run like hell tucker said because the floor will be caving in right i said i think she nodded but it was hard to tell through the layers right fine but when we get to the stairs i have to take the lead and if i say run like hell it means the vampires are going to eat us wren and tucker exchanged glances you tell us to run wren said well ask how fast agreed tucker said great i said truthfully it was a damn relief not to have to argue with anyone no debate what a relief if i hadnt been sweating like a pig listening to my own breathing echoing horrifically like the telltale heart having to relearn how to walk in metallined boots id have said working with the fire department was a break but it wasnt id have rather rappelled down on ropes with special forces into a freefire zone than shuffle along in the mummy suit trying not to lose it it was just a phobia dammit nothing was wrong nothing was hurting me my body didnt believe the logic phobias are like that reason doesnt move them wren stepped onto the floor it made a noise like a giant groaning in its sleep he froze then stomped his feet so hard i thought my pulse was going to spill out my mouth shouldnt we be quieter i asked wrens voice came in my ear walk exactly where i walk dont deviate dont spread out why i asked just because the floor is solid where im walking doesnt mean its solid anywhere else oh i said i went right behind wren so i got a closeup view of his little stomping dance it was not comforting tucker came behind me then detective reynolds bringing up the rear id given everybody a cross to put in the pockets of their suits why wasnt everyone wearing one like i was because tucker and wren were carrying a pack of opaque body bags apiece plan was to put the vamps in the bags and take them back up inside an ambulance in the body bags theyd be safe until nightfall if we pulled this off and the ceiling didnt collapse before darkness i was going to be pissed as long as it didnt fall while we were down here that i could pass on i walked where wren walked religiously though i did have to say even out of this suit my stride isnt as big as yours in the suit im damned near crippled can i take smaller steps just as long as the steps are directly in line with mine yes wren said relief the floor was covered with debris nails were everywhere in the blackened boards i understood the metal insoles now i was grateful for them but it didnt make them any easier to walk in there was a line to one side going down a hole in the floor it was a hard suction hose attached to a loud pump some distance away they were draining the water out of the basement if the place was watertight it could be full to the ceiling comforting thought fulton had called in a hazmat tanker for the water he seemed to be treating vampirism like a contagious disease it was contagious but not in the way he seemed to think but he was incident commander i was learning that that title equated with god at a fire scene you couldnt argue with god you could get mad at him but it didnt change anything i concentrated on moving my feet watching for debris stepping in wrens footsteps i let the world slide away except for moving forward i was aware of the sun beating down sweat trickling down my spine but it was all distant there was nothing but moving forward no thinking required my breathing was normal when i bumped into wrens back i froze afraid to move was something wrong whats up i asked stairs he said oh i thought i was supposed to take the lead now i wasnt ready truthfully i wasnt sure how good i could walk on stairs in the damn suit i just hadnt appreciated how hard it would be to walk in it stairs are the most dangerous part of a building like this wren said if anything is going to collapse itll be the stairs are you trying to make us feel better reynolds asked just prepared he said ill test the first few steps if it seems solid ill move back and let blake take it he wasnt teasing anymore he was all business and we were suddenly on a lastname basis watch the body on the stairs he said he moved onto the first step stomping hard enough that i jumped the body on the stairs was black charcoaled the mouth gaped open in a soundless scream you had to look close to see the fangs real vamp fangs just arent that big tendons were stretched naked looking like theyd snap if you touched them the body looked fragile as if one touch and it would be dust i remembered larry and the skull that had turned to powder at his touch this body looked tougher than that but not by much could it be alive was there some spark inside it that with nightfall it would move live i didnt know it should have been ash it should still have been burning in the sunlight no matter how much water they poured on it wrens voice startled me you can take the lead now anita i looked down the steps and found wren several steps below almost halfway the darkness down below spilled around his feet like a pool he was far enough down that a really ambitious vamp might have grabbed a leg and pulled him down i hadnt been concentrating my fault come back up wren i said he did and he was oblivious to the possible danger damn the stairs are concrete which makes it safer you should be okay do i still have to stomp every step itd be safer he said if i feel it going i yell yes he said he brushed past me i stared down into the stygian depths i need a hand for the railing in this suit a hand for the gun im out of hands for a flashlight i said i can try and shine a light in front of you but it wont be where you need it dont worry about it unless i ask it took me over a minute maybe two to fumble the browning out of its pocket the gun was definitely going in one hand i had to use two hands to click off the safety in the bulky gloves i slid my hand inside the trigger guard on the trigger id never have carried a gun like this normally but my gloved finger didnt want to fit inside the trigger guard i was ready to go now if i put safety first id never get a shot off in time id practiced with winter gloves on but id never dreamed of having to shoot vamps in a hazmat suit hell i didnt know what a hazmat suit was until today whats the holdup fultons voice id forgotten he was monitoring everything we said like being spied on these damn gloves arent exactly made for shooting whats that mean he asked it means im ready to go down now i said i kept the browning pointed up and a little forward if i fell in the suit and accidently fired a shot i was going to try very hard not to shoot anyone behind me i wondered if detective tammy had her gun out i wondered how good a shot she was how was she in an emergency i said a short prayer that we wouldnt be finding out got a death grip on the banister and stomped the first step it didnt fall down i stared ahead into the thick blackness at the middle of the stairs the sunlight cut across the darkness like a knife here we go boys and girls i said and down we went water lapped at the last few steps the basement had turned into a lake wrens flashlight passed over the dark water like a tiny searchlight the water was a solid blackness holding all its secrets close and quiet a coffin floated about ten feet from the stairs bobbing gently in the dark dark water even over the wheezing and whoosh of my own breathing i could hear the water lapping there was the sound of wood rubbing together like boats tied up at a dock i pointed and wrens light followed my hand two coffins were bumping against one another near the far wall three coffins visible but there should be four more one for the guardian one for the vamp on the stairs and two more i took that last step into the water even through the suit i could feel the liquid like a distant coolness a liquid weight lapping at my ankles the feel of the water was enough to speed my breathing send my heart pounding in my throat youre going to hyperventilate wren said slow your breathing i took a deep breath and let it out slowly counting to make it slower a count of fifteen then another breath you okay he asked whats going on fulton asked nothing wren said im okay i said whats happening fulton said were missing four coffins two could have sunk but we still have two missing just wondering where they are i said be careful down there he said like a virgin on her wedding night i whispered someone laughed always good to be amusing i tried stomping on the next step kneedeep in water and my feet went out from under me i was suddenly sliding down the steps only my grip on the banister keeping me from going under i sat in water up to my chin feeling stupid and scared a combination im not fond of wren came to stand over me light sliding over the water while he helped me to my feet i needed the help i raised the browning dripping wet into the light will your gun work now he asked i could fire it underwater and it would still work i said it still amazes me how many people think a little water ruins a gun you have to clean it really well afterwards but during the shooting water is fine the days of having to keep your powder dry are long past i eased down the remaining steps and slid slowly down into the cool water my breathing grew ragged fuck it i was scared flatfooted in the water i could have gone for the flashlight in one of the pockets or i could have slid the shotgun out of the bag across my back but before i started changing guns id let detective tammy get down here with her gun to cover me i still didnt know how good she was but it was better than nothing the water slid around my upper chest not quite armpit depth but almost i slid very carefully out into the water more swimming than walking gun held twohanded and ready or as ready as you can be halffloating in a borrowed astronaut suit i didnt like the fact that we were missing two coffins with vamps inside them they probably just sank but my gut was tense waiting for hands to slide over my ankles and yank me under my foot brushed something solid and i couldnt breathe for a second my foot scooted against it paint can maybe i guess even vamps have crap in their basement just like the rest of us ive got some debris over here i said you sound like a real fireman wren said coffin detective tammy asked from the stairs she slid into the water last no just a can of some kind the coffin had almost floated to me no effort i put a hand out to touch it keeping it floating gently in the small waves when wren and tucker get up to the coffin im going to back off cover me while i pull out the shotgun you got it tammy said she had her flashlight and gun in two hands one above the other so the light moved with the barrel of her gun she was sweeping the water for movement just seeing her do that made the tension in my shoulders ease a bit dont open the coffin until im ready i said i had a moment to realize that i wasnt worried about my breathing the suffocating closeness had receded under the pure adrenaline rush of being chestdeep in water with vampires all around i could be phobic later after we survived wren and tucker took either end of the coffin even they were having trouble moving in the water in full suits im going for the shotgun now reynolds youre covered she said i backed off and swung the bag around i had a moment to decide whether to try to put the browning back in a pants pocket or in the bag where the shotgun was now i chose the bag i kept the bag in front though where i could put a hand in if i needed the gun i swung the shotgun around settling the butt of it against my shoulder i braced myself as much as i could in the water and said open it tucker steadied it and wren swung the lid back he crossed my line of fire while he did it youve crossed my line of sight wren what move to your right i said he did it without any more questions but that one delay could have been enough to get him hurt or dead the vampire lay on her back long hair spread around her pale face one hand clasped on her chest like a sleeping child okay to move her wren asked stay out of my line of fire and you can do anything you want i said sorry he said even over the mikes he sounded embarrassed i didnt have time to soothe his ego i was too busy watching for vamps i kept my attention mainly on the one in the open coffin but i had no peripheral vision in the suit my hearing was cut in half or more i felt totally unprepared why arent our crosses glowing reynolds asked from just behind me they dont glow around dead bodies i said wren and tucker were having trouble getting the body into the bag wren finally threw the body across one shoulder and tucker started squirming the legs into the bag the vampire lay utterly limp across wrens back her long hair trailed into the water turning black as it absorbed the water when they slid her the last bit into the bag i got a glimpse of her deathpale face strands of wet hair clinging to it like a drowning victim tucker zipped the bag and said theres water in the bag i dont know how to avoid it wren got the body as balanced as he could and started for the stairs this is going to take a long time with just two of us carrying he said fultons voice came over the radios weve got two more suits ms blake is it safe to send more men down speaking as one of the sacrificial lambs i said yeah why should we have all the fun wren got to the stairs and started climbing up one hand on the banister he tried to do the little stomping routine like we did on the way down and nearly fell back into the water im just going up the stairs if they collapse try not to leave me buried until my air runs out do our best i said thanks he said sarcasm traveling just fine over the mikes tucker had isolated one of the other coffins reynolds slogged over to steady it while tucker got the lid she didnt have enough height to swing it back nicely like wren had she just shoved the lid fell back smacking the other coffin with a loud echoing thunk the sound made the tips of my fingers tingle shit reynolds breathed everything okay fulton asked yeah i said just a little case of nerves you okay down there tucker he asked it was me reynolds said sorry the second vamp was male with short brown hair and a sprinkling of freckles still clinging to his white skin he was over six foot he was going to be even harder to bag tucker came up with the idea of dragging the coffin to the stairs and using the stairs to help leverage the body sounded good to me the bottom of the stairs wasnt in sunlight so the vamp shouldnt mind reynolds and tucker had dragged the coffin to the foot of the stairs by the time wren came back down he laid an unzipped bag over the length of the body if reynolds and tucker steady the coffin i think i can just roll him into the bag sounds like a plan to me tucker said she stepped lower in the water reynolds looked to me and i said sure she moved to the other side of the coffin her gun not pointed at anything anymore flashlight held beamdown into the water like a distant golden ball of light in the dark pool wren leaned in over the body to roll it on its side youre in my line of sight again wren i said sorry he said but his arms were half under the body rolling it he didnt move out of the way move dammit i said ive almost got him in the bag the vampires head spasmed it happens sometimes even in their sleep but i didnt like it now drop him and step back wren now my cross and reynoldss cross flared to life like two small white suns wren did what i asked but it was too late the vampire turned on him mouth wide fangs straining it bit into the suit with a loud hiss of released air they were too close to trust the shotgun reynolds its yours i said wren screamed reynoldss gun made sparks in the near darkness the vampire jerked back from wren a hole in its forehead but it wasnt dead not even close revenants dont die that easy i fired into that pale face the face exploded into blood and bits of meat small heavy pieces rained down into the water with soft plops it fell back against the raised coffin lid head gone hands still spasming in the white satin interior legs kicking wren fell to his butt on the stairs tucker was saying wren wren answer me im here he said voice hoarse im here i came two careful steps closer on the watercovered stairs and put another shell in the vampires chest blowing a hole in it and the coffin lid behind it i pumped another shell in the shotgun and said up the stairs now i knelt by wren hand under his arm the other full of shotgun over the ringing in my ears from the guns i heard tucker say something brushed my leg out now i tried to force them up the stairs with my voice i dragged wren to his feet and pushed him up the stairs he didnt need much urging when he reached sunlight he turned back waiting for the rest of us reynolds was almost with us two wet dripping arms came up on either side of tucker i yelled tucker the arms closed and she was suddenly airborne backwards under the water it closed over her like a black fist thered never been anything to shoot at her voice was crystalline over the radio breathing so ragged it hurt to hear it wren help me i slid down the steps falling into the water letting the blackness close over me my cross flared through the water like a beacon i saw movement but wasnt sure it was her i felt movement in the water seconds before arms grabbed me from behind teeth tore into the suit hands ripping the helmet off like wet paper it rolled me in the water and i let it i let its eager hands carry me around until i shoved the shotgun against its chin and fired i watched its head vanish in a cloud of blood by the glow of my cross i still had the breathing mask on which was why i wasnt drowning tuckers screams were continuous now her screaming was everywhere in the radio in the water echoing and constant i stood up the remnants of the suit sliding down my body i lost some of the echoes of tuckers screams the water was conducting the screams like an amplifier reynolds and wren were both in the water a bad idea he was struggling towards something and i saw it tuckers hazmat suit was floating on the other side of the basement he threw himself into the water trying to swim to her reynolds was trying to stay with him gun in hand her cross was blindingly bright i yelled over the radio everyone out out dammit out no one was listening tuckers screams stopped abruptly everyone else screamed more everyone but me i went quiet screaming wouldnt help there were at least three vamps down here with us three revenants we were going to die if we stayed down here the vampire exploded out of the water in front of me the shotgun fired before i realized id done it the vampires chest exploded and it grabbed for me anyway i had time to jack another shell in but not to fire at moments like this the world goes too fast and too slow you cant stop anything from happening but you can see it all in excruciating detail the vampires fingers dug into my shoulders painfully tight holding me still while he reared back to strike i had a glimpse of fangs framed by a dark beard my crosss glow was almost frantically bright highlighting the vampires face like a halloween flashlight i fired the shotgun straight up under the chin no time to brace just to pull the trigger the head exploded in a red rain all over my face mask i was blinded by blood and thicker things the recoil of the shotgun sat me down in the water i went under without knowing if the thing was still coming or if it was dead i struggled to the surface the water had streaked the face mask clean of blood but heavier things clung to it so i was still blind i jerked the mask off my face losing the radio but gaining my vision the vampire was floating in front of me not face down or face up faceless goody when reynoldss gun fired the shots sounded strange and i realized i was deaf in the ear id fired the shotgun next to the vampires body reacted to the bullets staggering but not stopping she was hitting it full middle body like they teach you on the range i yelled head shot she raised the gun and the gun clicked empty i think she was going for extra ammo in a pocket when the thing jumped her and they both vanished into the water i slid out of what remained of the suit even with the taped joints it slipped off me like a shed skin i exchanged hands to keep the shotgun ready and dived into the water swimming was faster and if there was anything to catch id caught it by now the cross lit my way like a beacon but it was reynoldss cross that i swam for that was my beacon i had seconds to reach her or it was all over i had a sense of movement a second before the last vamp slammed into me i turned starting to point the shotgun at it and it grabbed the gun i think it was just grabbing anything but it tore the gun from my hand and grabbed for me she was almost pretty with her long pale hair streaming behind her like a mermaid straight out of a fairy story the cross made her skin glow as she reached for me i had a knife ready and shoved it up under her chin it slid in easily but didnt reach the brain it wasnt a killing blow not even close she stood in the water hands clawing at the knife i dont think it was pain she just couldnt open her mouth enough to feed i shoved the second blade under her ribs up into her heart her body shuddered eyes impossibly wide her mouth opened enough for me to see my knife blade impaling her she screamed wordlessly and hit me with the back of her hand the only thing that kept me from being airborne was the water it absorbed some of the shock i fell backwards and the water closed over me i had a second of floating then i tried to breathe got a mouthful of water and staggered to my feet coughing falling down as soon as i stood i got my feet under me and felt something warmer on my face than water i was bleeding my vision was going grey with little white flowers in it the vampire was still coming for me with my last two knives in its body there was no more screaming from across the room i couldnt see that far but it could only mean one thing reynolds wren and tucker were gone i was backing up in the water i tripped over something and went down water pouring over me it was harder to get up this time slower id tripped over the hazmat suit and the bag with the browning in it my vision was full of holes it was like watching the vampire through a strobe light i closed my eyes but the white flowers ate the back of my eyelids i let myself sink into the water and found the bag by my foot was i holding my breath or had i just stopped breathing i couldnt remember i got the browning out without opening my eyes i didnt need to see to use it she grabbed a handful of my hair and dragged me to the surface i fired as i came up blowing holes in her body like a zipper until i came to that pale face she put a hand out over the muzzle of the gun and that delicate hand blew into bits of bone a bloody stump i fired into that face until it was a red ruin and i was deaf in both ears the vampire fell backwards into the water and i slid to my knees the water poured over me i tried to push to the surface again and couldnt i think i got one last mouthful of air then the grey and white spots were everywhere i couldnt see the glow of the cross or the black water when darkness swallowed my vision it was smooth and perfect i had a moment of floating a dim thought that i should be scared then nothing i woke up on the grass where caroline and i had been sitting vomiting water and bile feeling like shit but alive alive was good almost as good was detective tammy reynolds standing over me watching the emts work on me her arm was taped to her side and she was crying then nothing like someone changed the channel and i woke up to a different show hospital this time and i was afraid id dreamed reynolds and that she was really dead larry sat in a chair by my bed head back asleep or knocked out on painkillers i took his presence as a sign i hadnt hallucinated reynolds if his sweetie had been dead i didnt think hed be sitting here at least not asleep he blinked awake eyes unfocused from drugs i think how are you you tell me he smiled tried to stand and had to take a deep breath before he could do it if i wasnt hurt id be out helping tammy rescue vamps right now something tight in my chest loosened she is alive then i thought id dreamed it he blinked at me yeah shes alive so is wren how i asked he grinned at me a vampire known as the traveler seems able to inhabit bodies of other vamps says hes a member of their council and hes here to help says you enlisted his aid larry was watching me very closely the painkillers sliding away from his eyes as he tried to will me to tell the truth thats essentially it i said he took over the body of the vamp attacking tammy and wren he saved them she shoved her arm into the vamps mouth and its broken but itll heal what about wren okay but hes pretty broken up over tucker she didnt make it i said he shook his head she was torn up nearly yanked in half all that was holding her together was the hazmat suit so you didnt have to stake her i said the vamps did the job themselves he said they got tuckers body up but not the vamps you did in theyre still down there i looked at him let me guess it caved indidnt it not five minutes after they pulled tuckers body out and laid you on the grass the whole thing went the vamp body that the traveler was using started to burn ive never seen one of them burn before it was impressive and scary the rubble covered the vamp they couldnt dig him out until dark because that would have exposed him to sunlight again he dug his own way out while they were still getting started he attack anyone i asked larry shook his head he seemed pretty calm you were there yep i let it go no sense worrying over what might have happened if the vamp had clawed his way to freedom pissed i also found it very interesting that the traveler couldnt stand the sunlight and warrick could surviving sunlight even dim sunlight was the rarest of talents among the walking dead or maybe warrick was right maybe it was gods grace who was i to know is it my imagination or are you just moving better with less pain i asked its been another twentyfour hours im starting to heal excuse me i said youve been out for over a day its late sunday afternoon shit i said had jeanclaude met with the council without me had the dinner whatever it was already happened shit i said again still frowning he said ive got a message from the traveler for you tell me why you suddenly look so scared and ill give it to you just give it to me larry please still frowning he said the dinner is postponed until you feel well enough to attend i settled back against the pillows and couldnt keep the relief off my face my body what the hell is going on anita maybe it was the concussion maybe it was the fact that i didnt like to lie to larry face to face whatever it was i told him truth i told him all of it i told him about richard and the marks he knew about that but not what id discovered recently i left out a few things but not much when i was done he sat back in the chair looking stunned well say something he shook his head sweet mary mother of god i dont know where to start jeanclaude had a press conference last night with the traveler at his side they talked about vampire and human unity in the face of this awful event whose body did the traveler use i asked larry shivered that is one of the creepiest vamp powers i have ever seen he used some vamp from malcolms church malcolm was at the press conference too the traveler used his powers to help rescue the other vamps including malcolm who acted as intepreter while the sun was up i asked balthasar his human servant balthasar as a public servant that is creepy i said larry frowned he told me he had a thing for men with red hair was he kidding i laughed and it made my head hurt i was suddenly very aware of a growing headache as if it had been there all the time just masked by drugs modern chemistry there is no substitute probably not but dont worry youre not on the menu who is larry asked i dont know yet has dolph found out whos behind the bombings and stuff yes he said that one word like it was enough tell me or i will get out of this bed and hurt you it was humans first the police raided their headquarters earlier today got most of the leaders that is wonderful i frowned which hurt then closed my eyes and said how did humans first know where all the monsters were they hit private homes secret daytime lairs they shouldnt have known where everyone was i heard the door open a moment before dolphs voice said the vampires had a traitor in their midst hey dolph hey yourself good to see you awake good to be awake i said what traitor remember vicki pierceand her little scene at burnt offerings i remember she had a boyfriend that was with humans first she gave him up when we questioned her a second time whyd you bring her in seems she got paid for her little acting assignment we threatened to charge her with assault and attempted murder she folded like a cheap card table what does little miss blue eyes have to do with a vampire traitor shes been dating harry the bartender and part owner of burnt offerings i was confused then why stage the scene at his business why give himself grief her human boyfriend wanted to pay her to do it she didnt want him to know she was seeing harry harry went along with it because he thought it would look funny if his place was the only vampowned business not hit by the fanatics so harry knew what she was using the information for i said i was finding it hard to believe that any vamp would do it let alone one as old as harry he knew he took his cut of the money dolph said why when we find him well ask let me guess hes vanished dolph nodded dont tell your boyfriend anita the vampires may be your only hope of catching harry now but will they turn him over to us or kill him i looked away not meeting his eyes theyre going to be pretty pissed i cant blame them for that but i want him alive anita i need him alive why we didnt get every member of humans first i dont want them out there with some new nasty surprise waiting you have vicki wont she tell you she asked for a lawyer finally and now shes suddenly developed amnesia damn we need him to tell us if theres one last big nasty coming our way but you cant find him i said thats right you dont want me to tell jeanclaude give us twentyfour hours to locate harry if we fail then you can put out a vampire allpoints before they kill him try to get information from him you say that like ill be there when he dies i said dolph just looked at me i met his eyes this time i dont kill for jeanclaude dolph no matter what the street says i wish i believed that anita you dont know how much i wished i believed that i lay back against the pillows believe what you like dolph you will anyway he walked out then without another word as if what he wanted to say was too painful too final dolph kept pushing against us against me i was beginning to worry that he was going to keep pushing until he pushed us apart wed be working together but we wouldnt be friends the headache was getting worse and it wasnt just the drugs wearing off was given a clean bill of health the doctors were amazed at my recuperative powers if only they knew pete mckinnon called late in the day hed found that there were fires similar to those set by our firebug in new orleans and san francisco it took a moment for me to remember why those particular cities were important when i remembered i asked how about boston no no fires in boston why i dont think he believed me when i said nothing but unlike dolph he let it go i wasnt ready to point the finger at the vampire council just because the mysterious fires happened in cities theyd been visiting didnt mean it had to be them thered been no fires in boston just because there were now mysterious fires in st louis and the council was here didnt prove anything yeah and the easter bunny brings me goodies every year i told jeanclaude about my suspicions but why would the council wish to burn empty buildings ma petite if one of them could call fire to their hands they would not waste it on empty real estate not unless the real estate being burned gained them something you mean a financial motive i said he shrugged perhaps though a personal motive would suit them better i cant find out much more information without giving the council up to the authorities as suspects i said he seemed to think about that for a second or two perhaps you could wait upon committing absolute suicide for us until after we have survived this evening sure i said true darkness found me in a short formfitting black velvet dress with a vneck and no sleeves the waist of the dress was open lace my skin showed pale and enticing through it black thighhigh hose that actually came up a bit higher than midthigh like all the way up until the black lace stretch top brushed against the black satin panties with their lace edgings the hose were a size too large jeanclaude had purchased them and done it deliberately id tried thighhighs before and had to agree that the longer length was more flattering for my shorter legs it sort of framed the right area if wed been planning extracurricular activities id have loved to see his face when i was standing in nothing but the stockings as it was it was just frustrating and a little scary id vetoed the high velvet heels hed picked out instead i used my own black pumps not as spiffy maybe not even more comfortable but the heels were low enough that i could run in them or carry fainting wereleopards if the need arose you are perfection ma petite except for the shoes forget it i said youre lucky to have gotten me in the hose the thought that im dressing just in case the rest of the party sees my underwear is just creepy you talked to the traveler of price and responsibility well tonight we pay the price for your wereleopards are you regretting it now gregory was still trussed up in my bedroom pale and fragile looking vivian was tucked in a guest room speaking in monosyllables no no i dont regret it then let us gather the rest of our party and be on our way but he didnt move he stayed lying on his stomach on the white couch head resting on his folded hands if it had been anyone else id have said they were sprawled on the couch but jeanclaude did not sprawl he posed he lounged but he did not sprawl he lay full length his long body stretched out only the tips of his black boots over the edge of the couch he was wearing an outfit id seen before but repetition didnt make it less lovely i loved his clothes loved watching him dress and undress what are you thinking i asked i wish we were staying home tonight i want to undress you one piece of clothing at a time enjoying your body between every unveiling just the suggestion made my body tight me too i said and knelt on the floor in front of him i folded the short skirt under so it wouldnt wrinkle or ride up he didnt teach me that my grandma blake did over a lifetime of sunday church services where what i looked like seemed more important than the sermon i laid my chin on the couch near his face my hair spilling around me brushing the sides of his folded hands curling against his face do your undies look as nice as mine i asked brushed silk he said softly i had a sensory memory so strong it made me shiver the feel of him through the thick silk the almost living texture that the brushed fabric had over the hardness of his body i had to close my eyes to keep from letting him see it in my face the image was so vivid it made me clench my hands i felt him move a second before he kissed my forehead he spoke with his lips still touching my skin your thoughts betray you ma petite i raised my face upward sliding his lips down my face he was utterly passive as i moved against him until our lips met then his mouth pressed against mine lips and tongue working neither of us used our hands only our mouths touching our faces pressed together can i cut in the familiar voice was so heavy with anger that it made me draw back from jeanclaude richard stood at the end of the couch staring down at us i hadnt heard him come up had jeanclaude i was betting he had somehow i never thought that even in the throes of passion jeanclaude would ever let anyone sneak up on him or maybe i just didnt think i was that distracting poor selfesteem who me i sat back on my heels and looked up at richard he was dressed in a black tux complete with tails his long hair slicked back into a ponytail so tight it gave the illusion of short hair you always knew richard was handsome but it was only when you got rid of the hair that you realized how perfect his face was the highsculpted cheekbones the full mouth the dimple he stared down at me with that handsome familiar face and he looked arrogant he knew the effect he had on me and wanted to turn the knife a little more jeanclaude sat up on the couch his mouth smeared with my lipstick the red so vivid against his pale skin it looked like the surprised scarlet of blood he ran his tongue around the outside of his mouth then ran his finger across his upper lip slowly until it came away red he put the finger in his mouth and sucked the lipstick off of it very slowly very deliberately his eyes were on me but the show was for richard i was both grateful for it and angry about it he knew richard was trying to hurt me so he was hurting richard but he was also baiting him rubbing the proverbial salt in the wound the look on richards face was so raw i had to look away thats enough jeanclaude i said thats enough jeanclaude looked amused as you like ma petite richard looked down at me again i met his eyes maybe there was something in my face that was too raw to look at too he turned abruptly and left the room go freshen your tasty lipstick then we must leave jeanclaudes voice held regret the way it sometimes held joy or sex i took his hand raising it gently to my mouth are you still frightened of them even after all the good publicity surely if they were planning to kill us they wouldnt have appeared on camera with you i touched his leg running my fingers over the cloth feeling his thigh underneath the traveler shook hands with the mayor of st louis for heavens sake he touched my face cradling my cheek in his hand the council has never before tried to be what you would call mainstream it is their first foray into a very new arena but they have been the stuff of nightmares for thousands of years ma petite one day of human politics does not make them into something else but he touched fingers to my lips it is a good sign ma petite that i will agree to but you do not know them as i do you have not seen them at their worst my mind flashed on rafaels raw bloody body sylvie sagging in the chains voice small and broken the sight of fernando using vivian ive seen them do some pretty awful things since they hit town i said you set up the rules jeanclaude they cant maim us or rape us or kill us whats left he kissed me lightly on the lips and stood offering me his hand i took it let him pull me to my feet he was wearing his amused mask the one that once upon a time id thought was his normal face now i knew it meant he was hiding things he looked like that a lot when he was scared and didnt want people to know youre scaring me i said softly he smiled no ma petite they will do that for me for us all with that comforting shot he went off to round up the others i went for my purse and the tasty lipstick the council had laid down some conditions of their own no weapons tonight which was why i was dressed like i was one glance was enough to know i wasnt carrying anything jeanclaude thought this would keep them from having an excuse to pat me down when i asked what the big deal was all he would say was you dont want to give them a reason to touch you ma petite trust me on this i did trust him i didnt want any of the council touching me ever it was going to be a long night what had once been jeanclaudes living room and nikolaoss throne room before that had been turned into a banquet room theyd found a table that was over ten feet long what you could see of the table was heavy clawed feet with lions mouths carved in bold relief a tablecloth so thick with gold embroidery that it shimmered under the lights covered the table if they had meant for us to actually eat off it id have been worried wed trash it but there was no food there were no chairs there were no plates there were white linen napkins with gold rings crystal wineglasses and one of those industrialsize warmers with blue gas flames under its gleaming surface there was a man hanging by his wrists feet dangling helplessly over the gleaming table he was hanging directly over the empty warming pan his name was ernie his muscular upper body was bare a gag cut across his face trapping part of his long ponytail his hair was shaved to nothing on either side of his face the council hadnt done it as torture hed done it to himself he was one of jeanclaudes newest hangerson a human who wanted to be a vampire and was serving his apprenticeship acting as a sort of maid and errand boy now apparently he was the appetizer richard jeanclaude and i stood with jamil damian jason and surprisingly rafael at our backs the rat king had insisted on accompanying us i hadnt argued too hard we were allowed one person apiece plus jason yvette had requested him especially by taking him we gained a werewolf but his blue eyes were wide and his breathing a little too quick yvette was jasons idea of hell and hell had sent out an invitation ernie stared at us all kicking his feet and struggling trying to talk through the gag i think he was trying to say get me down but i couldnt swear to it what is the meaning of this jeanclaude said his voice filled the huge room hissing and tumbling until the shadows gave his words back in harsh sibilant echoes padma stepped out of the far hallway he was dressed in a suit that glittered as gold as the tablecloth he was even wearing a golden turban with peacock feathers and a sapphire bigger than my thumb he looked like someone had called down to central casting for a maharaja you have offered us no hospitality at all jeanclaude malcolm and his people have offered us refreshment but you the master of the city have offered us nothing he motioned upward at ernie this one walked in without our permission he said he was yours jeanclaude walked until he stood by the table and could look up into ernies face you came home two days early from your family visit the next time if there is a next time call first ernie stared at him eyes wide making small hmmm sounds through the gag he kicked his legs enough that he started to swing struggling will just make your shoulders hurt more jeanclaude said be at peace as he said it ernie slowly grew limp jeanclaude had captured him with his eyes and was lulling him to if not sleep peace the tension drained from him and he stared at jeanclaude brown eyes empty waiting at least he wasnt scared anymore gideon and thomas came up to stand on either side of padma thomas was in full uniform boots polished like a black mirror the helmet was white with a long tassel on top that was probably horsehair the coat was red the buttons brass white gloves even a sword gideon was pretty close to naked a white thong was all he wore on his body it barely covered him a heavy gold collar encrusted with small diamonds and huge emeralds covered almost his entire neck his carefully combed golden hair fanned over it a chain led from the collar to thomass hands padma put his hand out and thomas gave the chain to him neither thomas nor gideon exchanged so much as a glance theyd seen the show before the only thing that kept me from making some scathing remark was that id pretty much given my word to let jeanclaude do the talking tonight he thought i might say something to piss someone off who me jeanclaude walked around the table richard and i fell two steps back mirroring padma and his pets the symbolism wasnt lost on anyone thing was richard and i were pretending i didnt think the others were i suppose you mean to slit his throat into the warmer then serve his blood to all jeanclaude said padma smiled and gave a gracious nod of his head jeanclaude laughed that wonderfully touchable laugh of his if you really meant to do that master of beasts youd have hung him by his ankles richard and i did exchange glances behind his back i turned and looked at ernies peacefully hanging figure how had jeanclaude known youd have to hang him by his ankles ask a silly question are you saying we are bluffing padma asked no jeanclaude said merely grandstanding padma smiled and it almost reached his eyes you always did play the game well jeanclaude gave a small bow never taking his eyes from the other vampire i am honored that you think well of me master of beasts padma gave a sharp laugh a honeyed tongue master of the city the humor died abruptly gone poof his face was suddenly harsh empty except for anger but the point remains you have been a poor host i have fed through my servants he slid a dark hand caressingly down gideons bare shoulder the weretiger never reacted it was as if padma were not there or maybe as if he gideon were not there but there are others who are not so blessed as i they hunger jeanclaude they stand in your territory as your guests and know hunger the traveler was feeding them jeanclaude said i thought he was feeding you as well i do not need his castoff energy padma said he was sustaining the others until that one he pointed at me with his free handtold him to stop i started to say something almost asked permission and thought screw it asked him to stop i said no one tells the traveler what to do there that was so diplomatic my teeth hurt his laughter entered the room ahead of him the travelers new body was young male handsome and so newly dead he still had a good tan balthasar came at his side hands sliding over the other mans body possessively a new toy to explore id been told that malcolm was loaning the traveler a church member i wondered if malcolm really knew what the traveler and balthasar were doing with the body i would have said they were both wearing togas but that wasnt quite it the traveler wore a rich purple cloth pinned at one shoulder with a rubyandgold brooch his left shoulder was bare showing the smooth tanned skin to good advantage the garment was gathered at the waist with two woven red cords it fell nearly to his ankles giving glimpses of sandals tied around his ankles balthasar wore red with an amethystandsilver brooch at one shoulder his bare shoulder showed just enough chest to prove he was muscular as if thered been any doubt the red garment was bound at the waist with purple cords you guys look like the bobbsey twins i said jeanclaude cleared his throat i stopped talking but if everyone had such nifty clothes i wasnt sure i could stop myself from making remarks i mean it was just too easy the traveler threw his head back and laughed it was a joyous laugh with an edge underneath like the hissing of snakes he turned brown eyes to me but down in the depths it was him id have known him no matter whose eyes he was looking out of balthasar was actually shorter than the new body by an inch or two he stood close enough for the traveler to take him under his arm like a tall man will walk with a woman cradled against his body protected i saved your humans today anita i saved many vampires is that not enough for you jeanclaude i made his name a question he let his breath out in a long sigh it was pointless to make you promise be yourself ma petite but try not to be too insulting he stepped back so that we were all even with each other maybe he hadnt liked the symbolism either im thrilled that you saved my friends today i said im ecstatic that you saved all the trapped vampires but you got a lot of good press out of it without any risk to yourself i thought you agreed that you guys needed to modernize a little come into the twentieth century but i do agree anita i do agree the traveler rubbed his cheek against balthasars face staring at me hard enough that i was glad he wasnt heterosexual then what is this medieval shit i jabbed a thumb backwards at ernie his eyes flicked to the man then back to me i would have let it go but the others voted and it is true that jeanclaude has been a lax host jeanclaude touched my arm if you had come at my invitation or even requested permission to enter my territory i would have been more than happy to grant you hunting rights though you will find one of the other benefits to legality is an amazing number of willing victims people will even pay you to quench your thirst on their bodies it is an old law among us the traveler said not to feed in anothers lands without their permission i sustained the others but then your human servant showed me that my powers were having serious side effects on your local population he stepped away from balthasar coming within touching distance of jeanclaude but none of your vampires were affected i could not steal their energy or give them extra energy you prevented that that has surprised me more than anything else you have done jeanclaude it smacks of a power that i would never have credited you with not now not a thousand years from now he paced to stand in front of richard and the new body was still taller six foot four at least he stood so close that the purple cloth brushed the length of richards body he moved around him so closely that the cloth never stopped touching sliding over the tailored tux like a cloth hand padma has not gained such power from his joining he ended standing between jeanclaude and richard he raised a hand to stroke richards face and richard caught his wrist thats enough richard said the traveler drew his wrist slowly downward so that his hand brushed richards he turned to balthasar with a smile what do you think i think jeanclaude is a lucky man balthasar said a red flush crept up richards face his hands curled into fists he was placed in the position usually reserved for women if you deny that youre sleeping with someone they wont believe you the harder you deny it the surer everyone is that youre guilty richard was smarter than i was he didnt try to deny it he just turned and looked at the traveler he stared him nearly eye to eye and said get away from me all the bad guys laughed none of us did us included gideon and thomas strangely enough what were they doing with padma what series of events had trapped them with him if we all survived maybe id get a chance to ask them but it was doubtful if we killed padma they would probably die too if padma killed us well there you go the traveler walked over to me in a cloud of purple cloth which brings us to you anita his new body towered over me over a foot taller but hey you get used to it what i said staring up at him he laughed again he was so damn happy i realized what it wasafterglow he and balthasar had been polishing the family jewels i stared up into that smiling face and said is this new body doublejointed or something or does balthasar just like a change of menu the laughter faded from his eyes his face like the sun sinking below the horizon what was left was cold and distant and nothing you could talk to maybe i did talk too much jeanclaude touched my shoulders and moved me back he started to move in front of me but i stopped him i pissed him off dont protect me from him jeanclaude let me stay in front but at some unseen signal the rest of our entourage moved up fanning out behind us yvette and warrick came out of the hallway with liv you all look good enough to eat she laughed at her own joke she was dressed in a simple white formal her bare shoulders were whiter than the cloth as soon as i saw her i knew she hadnt fed sleeves that were not attached to the dress covered her from armpit to wrist the fitted bodice flared into a full white skirt with layers that were mirrored in the layers of the strange unattached sleeves her whiteblond hair fell in braided loops and whorls around her face no period costume for yvette only the cutting edge of fashion would do her makeup was just a little dark against the paper whiteness of her skin but it was hard to get that understated look when you were so terribly drained warrick wore a white suit with one of those round collars so there was no place to put a tie it was a lovely suit that matched yvettes dress so well they looked like the top of a fashion wedding cake yvette wore the dress like it had been made just for her warrick looked chokingly uncomfortable liv glared at all of us impartially she was dressed in a blue formal that was meant for a woman with softer edges and less muscle it had been cut down or up for her and she wore it badly this was the first time id seen liv since i learned that shed helped torture sylvie i expected to regret not having killed her when i had the chance but there was an uncertainity in her eyes an unease in her body that said maybe shed seen another side of the council since then she was afraid i was glad you look like youre wearing handmedowns liv i said like someones poor relative has the traveler given you to yvette as her handmaiden jeanclaude asked has he given you away so quickly yvette merely helped me dress she said head high but her hands were trying to smooth the dress into place nothing helped you had much more attractive outfits in your own closet jeanclaude said but no dresses yvette said for a formal occasion you must have dresses for the women she smiled sweetly it made me regret wearing a dress i know what you did to sylvie liv i was regretting not blowing your head off when i did your knees but you know what liv a few years with the council and you may be regretting it too i regret nothing she said but there was a tightness around the eyes a flicker through those lovely eyes something had spooked her good and solid part of me wanted to know what had been done to her but it was enough just to see how scared she was im glad youre enjoying yourself liv i said asher walked out in the middle of the scene his hair had been pulled back in a tight braid his hair was still nearly the color of the metallic thread in the tablecloth an unearthly color even if hed been human the hair pulled back left the scars on his face naked it was hard not to look at them hard not to stare the rest of the outfit didnt make it any easier his naked upper body was a wonderment of contrasts it was like his face half angelic beauty half melted nightmare his pants were black leather with a line of bare flesh showing from hip to midcalf where boots covered the rest the flesh glimpsed on the right side of his thigh was scarred the scars seemed to stop about midthigh it left the big question had his torturers made him a eunuch or left him whole it was like a car crash you wanted to know and you didnt jeanclaude anita so good of you to join us he made the polite words a mockery filling them with a hissing warmth of threat your presence is the same pleasure it has always been jeanclaude said those words were blank utterly neutral compliment or snide putdown it was the listeners choice asher glided towards us a smile curling his perfect lips again both sides of his mouth worked the muscles were still whole underneath all the scars he came to stand directly in front of me he was about two steps closer than was comfortable but i didnt back up or complain i just met his smile with one of my own neither smile touched our eyes do you like my outfit anita a little aggressive dont you think he traced a fingertip down the lace at my waist the fingertip slid inside the open lace touching my bare skin it brought a small gasp from my throat you can touch me anywhere you like he said i moved his hand i cant return the offer sorry i think you can the traveler said i looked at him no i said i cant jeanclaude was very clear on your rules the traveler said asher needs to feed it is within the rules for him to feed off of you anita he would prefer to sink something else into you but he will have to be content with fangs i shook my head i dont think so ma petite jeanclaude said softly i didnt like the way he said my name i turned and one look was enough you have got to be kidding me he stepped close taking me to one side the guidelines you gave me said nothing against sharing blood i stared up at him do you really want him to feed off of me he shook his head it is not a matter of want ma petite but if they cannot torture us or rape us we leave them little else if you wish to trade back one of my wereleopards padma said vivian perhaps i would grant you safe passage for the return of my so sweet vivian fernando entered the room as if on cue he was bruised but walking mores the pity he was wearing a jeweled vest and something like harem pants the arabian nights maybe instead of a maharaja did fernando tell you he raped her i know what my son has done that doesnt spoil her for you i asked padma looked at me what i do with her once she is mine again is no concern of yours human no way i said then you have no choice you must feed one of us if there is one among us who would please you more someone less hideous we could arrange something perhaps i could take you myself among our own people only yvette finds asher attractive but then her tastes have always run to the strange and grotesque ashers face betrayed nothing but i knew hed heard he was meant to hear hed spent the last two centuries being treated like a circus freak no wonder he was cranky id let asher sink the whole thing into me before id let you touch me surprise showed for a heartbeat on padmas face then arrogance but he hadnt liked the insult goody perhaps before the night is over anita you will get your wish not comforting but asher was having trouble looking at me as if he were afraid not of me exactly but that this was some elaborate game to hurt him he had that casual tension that victims get when they are slapped too often for too many different things jeanclaude whispered thank you ma petite i think he was relieved i think hed thought i might go down in flames rather than submit before padma had made his little joke i would have put up more of a fight i was going to do this if i drew the line here and refused that meant we fought them we would lose if donating a little blood would keep us all alive come morning i could spare it a leopard screamed it raised the hairs on my arms two leopards padded into the room jeweled collars sparkling around their necks the black one elizabeth i assumed snarled at me as they went past the leopards were just leopardsize not as tall as a great dane but longer they paced like velvet over muscle their energy and anger filling the room prickling along the other shapeshifters like a drug the leopards sprawled at padmas feet i felt richards power swell it flowed out of him in a soothing wash willing the leopards quiet calling them back to human form padma said no no they are mine i will keep them in whatever form i choose however long i choose they will begin to lose human characteristics richard said elizabeth is a nurse she cannot do her job if she has fangs or eyes that do not change back she has no other job than to serve me padma said richard took a step forward jeanclaude touched his shoulder he is baiting us mon ami richard shook his hand off but nodded i dont think the master of beasts could stop me if i forced them back to human form is that a challenge padma asked the wereleopards dont belong to you richard i said these two dont belong to anybody he said they can be mine if they want to be i said no padma said no i will give up nothing else no one else to you he stepped back against the wall dragging gideon with him by the jeweled collar thomas followed almost as closely asher take her asher tried to grab my arm but i backed up hold your horses hasnt anyone told you anticipation adds to the experience i have been anticipating this for over two hundred years ma cherie if anticipation adds then it will be wondrous indeed i stepped away from his eager eyes and went to jeanclaude any advice he will try to make it rape ma petite he stopped me before i could say anything not actual rape but the effect is surprisingly similar make it a seduction if you can turn necessity into a pleasure it will be the last thing he expects and it will unnerve him how unnerved i asked that will depend i think upon how strong your nerve is i glanced back at asher the eagerness on his face was frightening i was sorry hed been picked on for centuries but it wasnt my fault i dont think its that good richard had been listening he came close enough to whisper youre donating blood to one vampire whats one more ma petiteand i do not have to share blood to share power jeanclaude said richard frowned at him then at me still holding back dont you know how to give yourself completely to anyone jeanclaudes face was very neutral blank and beautiful i looked from his impassive face to richards angry one and shook my head if i could find someone else to fill our third spot i would richard but were stuck with each other so stop being such an ass i pushed past him hard enough for him to stumble and it was all i could do not to slap him as i went by being nasty in private was one thing doing it in front of the bad guys was against the rules asher dragged me to a corner and the others gathered around on the floor like story time in elementary school or maybe showandtell was a better analogy he jerked me roughly against him one hand in my hair controlling my head he kissed me roughly enough to bruise unless i opened my mouth i did better than that i closed my eyes and french kissed him running my tongue between his fangs id perfected the art of french kissing a vampire without bleeding and apparently i was good at it because asher drew back first there was a look of astonishment total and complete he couldnt have looked more surprised if id slapped him no less surprised he expected the slap jeanclaude was right if i could just outmaneuver asher be bolder than he was he might never sink fang into me it was worth a try i didnt even let jeanclaude feed off of me i wasnt sure it was the lesser evil but a girls got to draw the line somewhere asher put his face so near mine our noses almost touched look at me girl look at me you dont want to touch this the startling pale blue of his eyes almost a whiteblue framed by golden eyelashes was lovely i concentrated on the eyes undo your hair i said he pushed me away from him hard enough that i stumbled i was pissing him off stealing his revenge cant rape the willing i went to him stalking around him half wishing for the heels jeanclaude had wanted me to wear ashers back was pure and untouched only a few dribbling scars where the holy water had trailed down his side i ran my hands up that smooth skin and he jumped as if id bit him he whirled grabbing my arms holding me away from him he searched my face almost frantically whatever he saw it didnt please him he moved his hands upward until he held my wrists then placed one of my hands on the scarred side of his chest its easy to close your eyes and pretend easy to touch that which is not spoiled he pressed my hand against the rough ridges that had been his chest this is the reality this is what i live with every night what i will live with for all eternity what he did to me i stepped in close pressing my upper arm against the scars as well as my hands the skin was rough ridged like frozen fleshy water i looked up into his face from inches away and said jeanclaude did not do this to you men who are long dead did this to you i rose up on tiptoe and kissed his scarred cheek he closed his eyes and a single tear slid from his eye to trail down that rough cheek i kissed the tear away and when he opened his eyes they were suddenly startlingly close in his eyes i saw a fear loneliness a need so overwhelming that it had eaten his heart as surely as the holy water had eaten his skin i wanted to take away the hurt i saw in his eyes i wanted to hold him in my arms until the pain eased i realized in that moment that it wasnt me it was jeanclaude he wanted to heal ashers pain he wanted to take away that awful emptiness i looked at asher through a film of emotions that id never had for him a patina of nostalgia for better nights of love and joy and warm bodies in the cold darkness i kissed my way down his chin careful to touch only the scars ignoring the perfect skin as id ignored the wounded skin earlier strangely his neck was whole untouched i kissed his collar bone and its white ridge of scars his hands eased but didnt release me i pulled out of his grip as i moved down his body one soft kiss at a time i ran my tongue across his belly where it vanished into his pants he shuddered i moved to the open skin on his hip and worked down when the scars ended at midthigh so did i i stood and he watched me watched me almost afraid of what i would do next i had to stand on tiptoe to reach behind him to the braid of his hair it would have been easier from behind but hed have taken it as a rejection i couldnt turn away from the scars not even if that wasnt what i was doing at all i loosened the braid i separated the strands of hair then had to lean my body against his just to steady myself while i combed my fingers through the golden strands there is something very personal to touching a persons hair in the right situation i took my time enjoying the feel of it the extraordinary color the thick richness of it between my fingers when his hair fell in waves around his shoulders i lowered myself flatfooted my calves were cramped too long on point i put into my eyes what i saw that he was beautiful asher kissed me on the forehead a light touch he held me against him for a moment then stepped back i cannot capture you with my eyes without that or the throes of passion it would only cause you pain i can feed on anyone what i saw in your face no one else could give me he looked out at jeanclaude they stared at each other for a long moment then asher stepped out of the circle and i made my way back to jeanclaude i sat down beside him knees tucked under skirt smoothed back he hugged me and kissed me on the forehead as asher had done i wondered if he was trying to taste ashers mouth on my skin the thought didnt bother me maybe it should have but i didnt ask him i wasnt sure i wanted to know the traveler came to his feet as if by magic just suddenly standing i dont think we could be more astonished if anita had conjured a dragon from thin air she has tamed our asher and paid no blood for it he glided to the open floor space yvette is not so easily sated he smiled at her as she rose to her feet are you my dear she ran her hands through jasons hair as she glided past he jumped as if shed stung him which amused the hell out of her she was still laughing when she turned with a swoosh of white skirts and held her arms out to him come to me jason he huddled in on himself curling into a little ball of arms and elbows and knees he just shook his head you are my choice my special one yvette said you are not strong enough to refuse me an awful thought occurred to me i was willing to bet that jeanclaude hadnt covered rotting on people as a nono jason might not recover from another embrace from the messily dead i leaned into jeanclaude and asked you did cover torture no outright torture right of course he said i stood you can feed on him but you cant rot on him she turned cool eyes to me you have no say in this jeanclaude negotiated for no torture rotting on jason while you feed is torture to him you know that its why you want him i want my bit of werewolf blood and i want it exactly the way i like it best she said richard said you can feed off of me you dont know what youre offering richard i said i know that jason is mine to protect and he cant endure this he got to his feet splendid in his new tux has jason told you what happened to him in branson i asked jason had been having a forced tryst with two female vamps when they began to rot they turned into longdead corpses while he was still lying naked with them it was his worse nightmare almost a phobia now id witnessed the event even had those dead hands on my body when i waded in to to rescue him i couldnt blame him for being terrified jason told me richard said hearing about it isnt the same thing as being there richard jason had hidden his face against his knees he was saying something low i had to kneel to hear it he was saying im sorry im sorry im sorry over and over and over i touched his arm and he screamed eyes wide mouth open in astonishment its okay jason its okay richard was right jason couldnt do this i nodded youre right richard no padma said no the wolf king is mine i will not share him i will take nothing less than a shapeshifter yvette said jamil stood richard said no its my job to protect jason not yours jamil its my job to protect you ulfric richard shook his head and started undoing the black bow tie he undid the top few buttons on the pleated shirt baring the strong perfect line of his neck no yvette said she stamped her foot hands on hips he is not afraid i want someone whos afraid in my head i thought he will be afraid hell be very afraid notice i wasnt jumping up and offering myself in jasons place id seen this particular show i had no desire to star in it and i have my own plans for the ulfric padma said the traveler tsked at them like naughty children it is a fair offer yvette the ulfric himself for one of his lesser wolves it is not the potency of the blood i want it is the terror it is too generous an offer for someone who is not council padma said do they always squabble like this i asked oui jeanclaude said neareternal life frightening power and they were petty how disappointing how typical i touched jasons face made him look at me his breath was coming in short gasps i touched his hands his skin was cold jason if she didnt rot on you could you let her feed he swallowed twice before he could talk i dont know a truthful answer he was terrified ill go with you he looked at me then looked at me and not at the screaming in his head she wont like that fuck her she can take it or leave it that got me the ghost of a smile he gripped my hands where they lay on top of his he nodded i looked at jeanclaude still sitting by us youre not being much help i too have seen the show ma petite he was echoing my thoughts so closely i wondered whose thoughts were which but what he was saying was frightening he wouldnt offer himself to yvette not just to save jason i stood up drawing jason to his feet he clung to my hand like a kid on the first day of kindergarten afraid mommy would leave him alone with the bullies if you give your word of honor that you wont rot on him you can feed off of him no yvette said no that spoils it all its your choice i said you can have richard if padma will let you but he wont be afraid you can rot on him though but you wont get jasons horror of you i moved so she could see him clearly jason flinched but stayed standing but he wouldnt or couldnt meet her eyes he stared at me i think he was actually looking down my dress but for once i didnt make him stop distraction was just what he needed knowing jason i wasnt surprised that a peekaboo show was what he chose yvette licked her lips finally she nodded i led jason towards her he was dressed for his own peekaboo show he was wearing a pair of leather pants dyed a blue two shades darker than his eyes the pants looked painted on sliding seamlessly into boots dyed to match he wore no shirt only a vest that matched the pants fastened with three leather thongs he stumbled as we entered the cleared space yvette glided towards him and he hung back only my hand kept him from bolting easy jason easy he just kept shaking his head straining against my hold on his wrist he wasnt exactly struggling but he wasnt cooperating either its too much to ask richard said he is my wolf and i will not see him tormented i looked at richard proud arrogant hes my wolf too i released jasons wrist slowly and put a hand on either side of his face if this is too much to ask say so and well do something else he gripped my wrists and i watched him collect himself i watched his hardwon control fill his eyes his face dont leave me im right here no yvette said you cannot hold his hand while i feed i turned to her jason so close our bodies touched without hands then its over you dont touch him first you tame asher now you seek to tame me you have nothing i want anita i have jason she hissed at me all that careful beauty breaking down and showing the beast inside she snatched at him around me and he jerked back she pawed at him like a cat and i kept my body between them moving us into the center of the circle i felt jasons back hit the wall and i grabbed yvettes arm feel his terror yvette i can feel his heart pounding against my back my holding his hand wont make him unafraid nothing i could do would make him not fear your touch jason hid his face against my back hands sliding around my waist i patted his arm his body was one throbbing beat as his heart his blood pumped through his body so hard i could feel it his terror rode the air like a hot invisible mist agreed she said she backed away to the center of the cleared floor she held one pale hand out to us come anita bring our prize i slid in his arms until i was leading him by the hand again his palms were sweating i led him to stand with his back to her he gripped my hands in both of his his hands trembled he stared at my face as if it were the only thing left in the world yvette touched his back he whimpered i drew him into me until our arms were touching our faces only inches apart i had no words of comfort i could offer nothing but a hand to hold and something else to think about yvette trailed her fingers around his shoulders until she came to the thongs that tied the vest her hands brushed the front of my body as she fumbled with the ties i started to step back and jasons hands sang with tension i stayed where i was but my own pulse was beating in my throat i was afraid of her too afraid of what she was she had to slide her hand around his waist to get the last tie molding her body against his back she licked his ear a quick flick of her pale pink tongue he closed his eyes bowing his head until our foreheads touched you can do this i said he nodded his head eyes still closed forehead still touching mine yvette ran her hands up his back under the vest then curved them around to his naked chest running her nails down his flesh in a quick rush jason gasped and i realized in that instant that it wasnt just fear he had slept with her before he knew what she was she knew his body knew how to bring him to passion as only a lover can shed use that against him now jason drew his face back from mine he looked at me and he seemed lost she shoved the vest up around his shoulders and licked a long wet line up his spine he turned his face from me so i wouldnt see his eyes its all right if some of it feels good jason he turned back to me and there were other things in his eyes beside fear id been more comfortable with the fear but he was the one hurting yvette knelt and did something low on his back with her mouth his knees buckled suddenly taking us both to the floor i ended up flat on my back with jason on top of me i had one leg free which was a help and a hindrance since it put him perfectly on top of me i could tell his body was happy to be there i wasnt sure about the rest of him he was making small sounds low in his throat i scooted out from under him enough so that his groin wasnt pressing mine and i could sit up to see what yvette had done to him there were fangs marks low on his back near the spine the blood beaded on the blue leather like it had been scotchgarded his arms locked around my waist dont leave me please his cheek was pressed against my waist the tension in his body made my heart thud i wont leave you jason i stared at yvette over his body she was kneeling with the white skirt pooled around her as if a wandering photographer would be coming by she smiled and it reached her eyes filling them with a dark joyous light she was enjoying the hell out of herself youve fed its over i said that wasnt a feeding and you know it ive tasted him but i havent fed it had been worth a try she was right i knew she hadnt fed then just do it yvette if you had let me rot then it would be quicker but i want his terror and his pleasure that takes longer jason made a small sound like a child crying in the dark i looked out at richard he was still standing but he wasnt angry with me now there was real pain in his eyes hed have rather it be him than jason like a true king hed have taken the pain i smelled forest rich and green leaf mold so wet and new it made my throat tight i stared at richard and knew what he was suggesting wed had our little fight about the munin hed truly thought i was safe from them because i wasnt a shapeshifter he hadnt known the marks i shared with him would put me at risk but now it had possibilities not channeling raina i never wanted to do that again but the power of the pack their warmth their touchthat could help i closed my eyes and felt the mark open like curtains parting in my body jason raised his head staring up at me his nostrils flared scenting me scenting the power yvette ripped the vest down his back like it was paper jason gasped she licked along his body then suddenly her mouth closed over his ribs i saw the muscles in her jaw tense as jasons body spasmed against me he collapsed against me hands scrambling along the floor as if he didnt know what to do with his them or with his body yvette drew back leaving neat red holes blood dripped from the wound she licked her lips and smiled at me does it hurt i asked jason yes he said and no i started to raise him up yvette put a hand in the middle of his back no i want him on the ground i want him below me i smelled the sharp musk of fur jason tried to look at me but yvette forced his head down into my lap she used him to support her body while she peered into my face what are you doing i am his lupa i call the pack to his aid they cannot help him she said yes i said they can i slid down wriggling under jasons body the little black dress ended up about waist level everyone was getting a great view of the hose and undies good that everything matched but i could see jasons face i could feel his body a little more than i wanted to but it was his eyes i wanted his face i wanted him looking at me id never tried missionary position with a man exactly my height the eye contact was incredibly intimate he gave a nervous laugh ive had fantasies like this funny i said i havent ooh too cruel his spine bowed body pressing against mine yvette had taken another taste the fear was back in full force filling his eyes with panic im here were here he closed his eyes and took a deep breath he drew in the scent of leaves and fur and dark places full of bodies that all smelled like pack and yvette struck again jason screamed and i raised myself up enough to see that the vampire had pulled a strip of skin loose so it flapped blood poured down his skin jeanclaude came to the edge of the circle that is torture not feeding it stops here no yvette said i will feed then feed jeanclaude said but do it quickly before our patience is at an end she crawled up his body putting her weight on top of his grinding me into the floor the leather stitching over his groin was ground so hard against me that it hurt his breath came in quick pants fast and faster he was going to hyperventilate look at me i said yvette jerked his head back by the hair no look at me because i will hurt you jason i will haunt your dreams no i said the power swelled inside of me and i spit power into her pale face blood flew in a long shallow cut down her cheek everything froze yvette raised a hand to her bleeding cheek how did you do that if i said i wasnt really sure would you believe me no she said then believe this bitch finish this now or i will cut you up i believed it when i said it even though i wasnt sure i could ever repeat the performance only master vampires could cause cuts like that from a distance id never even seen jeanclaude do it yvette believed me she leaned close enough that the blood from the cut dripped onto jasons blond hair as you like putain but know this i will not put him under for this she showed the cut to me by a turn of her facehe will suffer aint it always the way i said she frowned at me not the response she was expecting apparently i put a hand on either side of jasons face forced his eyes to meet mine there was puzzlement under the fear now because jason knew id never done anything like what had just happened to yvette but we couldnt say golly gee whiz howd i do that in front of the bad guys yvette shifted until her body was pressed along the length of jasons he moved against me there was nothing between jason and me but the leather of his pants and some satin my body reacted it was my turn to close my eyes so he wouldnt see maybe it was the physical reaction but i was suddenly drowning in the scent of fur and the warm close knowledge of his body the munin was here in a warm building rush i lifted my face and kissed him the moment our lips touched the power flowed between us it was a binding of a different sort better than with nathaniel and i knew why nathaniel wasnt pack jason didnt kiss me back at first then he sank into my mouth into the warm power and the power grew until i could feel it like a small hot wind across my body across our bodies the power flowed over yvette and made her cry out she plunged fangs into jasons neck he screamed into my mouth body stiffening but the pain rode on the warm building power and was washed away i could feel yvettes mouth like a siphon sucking the power away i thrust it into her and sent her reeling from us drunk on more than blood freed of yvettes body jason moved against me he kissed me as if hed climb inside and pull me around him and i kissed him back id welcomed rainas munin and i didnt know how to turn it off i felt his lower body react felt him come and that was enough to help me swim back into control what a nice embarrassing moment to be driving again jason collapsed on top of me panting but not from fear i turned my face away so that i wouldnt catch a glimpse of anyone gathered around us yvette lay on her side near us curled into a ball blood trailing down her chin she licked the blood almost halfheartedly as if even that small effort were too much she spoke french to me je reve de toi id heard a version of this before from jeanclaude she said shed dream of us i heard myself say why do the french always know exactly what to say at times like this jeanclaude knelt beside us it is genetic ma petite ah i said i had trouble meeting his eyes with jason still sprawled across my body jason i said tapping his bare shoulder he said nothing just rolled off me to lie on the floor closer to yvette than id have ever thought hed be willing to get i suddenly realized that my skirt was still up around my waist jeanclaude helped me sit up while i wiggled the dress down richard knelt with us i expected a scathing remark id certainly given him enough ammo for one he surprised me by saying raina gone but not forgotten i said no joke im sorry anita when you told me i didnt realize it was an almost complete melding i understand why youre afraid of it now there are things you can do to keep it from happening again i was too angry at you to believe it was this bad a look crossed his face part pain part confusion i am sorry for that if you can keep that from happening again apology accepted padma was suddenly looming over us you and i will dance next ulfric after the show your lupa gave us i am more eager than ever to taste you richard glanced at me then at jason and yvette both still lying on the ground as if any movement was too much i dont think im that good i think you underestimate yourself wolf padma said he offered richard a hand but he stood on his own the two men were almost the same height they stared at each other and i could already feel the power flaring between them testing each other i lay against jeanclaudes chest and closed my eyes get me out of here before they start i cant stand to be near this much power so soon he helped me to stand and when my legs wouldnt hold me he scooped me up in his arms holding me effortlessly he just stood there holding me as if expecting me to protest i put my arms around his neck and said just do it he smiled and it was wondrous i have wanted to do this for a very long time was it romantic to be carried in his arms at last yes but when jason managed to stagger from the floor the front of his blue leather pants was stained and that wasnt romantic at all padma and richard faced each other just out of reach each was letting his power out like a lure at the end of a line to see who took the bait first richards power was as it always was an electric heat but padmas power was similar more than any other vamp id been around his power was warm alive for lack of a better word it did not have the electric shimmer of richards but it had heat their power filled the room as if the very air were charged with their energy it was everywhere and nowhere richards power bit along my skin drew a gasp from my throat that jeanclaude echoed padmas power flared along the skin like being too close to an open flame the two energies combined were almost painful rafael came to stand beside us jeanclaude was still holding me in his arms which lets you know how shitty i was feeling the rat king wore a very ordinary navy blue suit white shirt understated tie his black loafers were polished to a gloss but he could have been going anywhere from a business meeting to a funeral yeah it had the look of one of those suits that only came out for deaths and marriages they feel evenly matched he said but it is a lie he said it softly as if just talking to us but we were close enough that richard could hear he did much the same with me then he crushed me he didnt crush you i said you won only because you rescued me no i said you didnt give him the wererats you won i touched jeanclaudes shoulder and he put me down i could stand yippee very impressive ulfric padma said but lets see just how impressive you can be shall we thank you rafael for spoiling the surprise i will return the favor someday the gloves as they say were off padmas power thundered through the room i staggered and only jeanclaudes hand kept me from going to my knees richard screamed and did fall to his knees we were just getting the backwash of padmas power richard was getting the full treatment i expected him to do with richard what hed done with me but he didnt he had other plans change for me richard i like my food with fur richard shook his head his voice came out strangled as if the words were being dragged through his throat never never can be a very long time padma said i felt his power like insects marching over my skin ants with redhot pokers taking bites it was what hed done to the wereleopard elizabeth when he punished her richard didnt writhe on the floor like she had he said no he got his feet under him and took a staggering step towards the vampire the burning got worse the redhot bites closer together like a continuous sheet of tiny fires i made a small sound and still richard stood he took another staggering step the rush of power stopped so abruptly that the absence of pain brought richard to his knees nearly at padmas feet his breathing was loud in the sudden silence pain will not bring you to me padma said shall we dispense with the games ulfric shall i feed now just get it over with richard said padma smiled and there was something in his smile that i didnt like as if he had everything under control and everything was going as planned he stood behind richard and dropped gracefully to his knees he smoothed his hand down the side of richards neck turning his head to the side for a good clean strike one arm slid across richards chest pinning him to his body the other hand pressed his face to one side padma leaned over him and whispered something in his ear a spasm ran the length of richards body he tried to break free of padma but the vampire was amazingly quick he slid both arms under richards fingers clasped behind richards neck a classic full nelson richards struggles ended with him on the ground and the vampire on top of him if it had been a wrestling match richard would have been pinned lost but no referee was coming to say time whats happening i asked i warned richard rafael said but hes always been so strong what i asked he is calling richards beast ma petite jeanclaude said i have seen him do it before richards body spasmed so violently his head hit against the floor with a sharp crack he rolled on his side but the vampire stayed on him whispering whispering did he manage to call your beast like this i asked rafael yes i looked at him he stared at the show not meeting my eyes he called my beast like water pouring over my skin then drained it away he did it over and over until i passed out i woke as you found me on the rack being skinned his voice was neutral as he told it all as if it were a story about someone else help him i said turning to jeanclaude if i enter that circle padma will use it as an excuse to challenge me if it is a duel i will lose hes baiting you then i said he is also enjoying himself ma petite breaking the strong is his greatest joy in this existence a scream poured from richards mouth a scream that ended in a howl im going to help him how ma petite padma cant challenge me to a duel and he cant call my beast touch makes the marks stronger right oui i smiled and started walking towards richard jeanclaude didnt try to stop me no one did richard had managed to get to his knees with the vampire still molded to his back richards eyes were amber wolf eyes and he was close to panicking this near i could feel his beast like a huge shape just below the surface of some dark lake when it broke the surface it would take him with it rafael seemed to have accepted his loss but richard wouldnt richard would take the defeat and beat himself with it what are you doing human padma asked staring up at me im his lupa and his third im doing my job i held richards face in my hands and that was enough the physical touch was all it took to strengthen his control i felt his heart slow the pulsing of his body ease i felt that great shape sink back into the depths richard drew on my mark like a drowning man with a rope coiling it around himself no padma said he is mine i smiled at him no hes mine whether we like it or whether we dont hes mine richards eyes bled back to their normal brown and he mouthed the words thank you padma stood in a rush so quick it was almost like magic he grabbed my wrist hard enough to bruise and i said you cant challenge me because im not a vampire you cant feed off of me because i can only play victim once tonight and asher was my once richard lay on the floor one arm braced so he wasnt actually lying down but i had a flash of how boneweary he was so tired so weak you know our rules well anita padma said he jerked me close to him bodies almost touching you are not vampire or food but you are still his lupa you going to try and call my beast i said you cant call whats not there i felt your power with the little werewolf he raised my hand to his face and sniffed along my skin like he was smelling some exotic perfume you smell of pack anita there is something in you to call whatever it is i will have it she is not part of the bargain jeanclaude said she interfered padma said that makes her part of this bacchanal do not worry i will not hurt her too much he leaned into me and spoke low soft it was french and i didnt speak enough french to follow it i caught the word for wolf and power and moon and i felt the power rise inside of me it was too soon after jason the power was too close to the surface too near padma called to it and i didnt know how to stop it the power burst over my skin in a hot wash my knees buckled and he caught me as i collapsed against his body richard touched my leg but it was too late he tried to strengthen my control as id done for him but i didnt have any control yet padma called and the munin answered i was channeling raina for the second time in an hour the power filled my skin and i stood pressing my body into padma staring at him from inches away the power wanted to touch someone anyone it didnt care i cared and i had enough control this time to refuse it i said no i pushed away from him falling to the ground as i did it padma followed me touching my hair my face as i crawled away from him the power is sexual in nature a mating urge perhaps how very interesting jeanclaude said leave her alone master of beasts he laughed what do you think would happen if i kept calling her beast do you think she would give in do you think she would fuck me we will not find out jeanclaude said if you interfere with my fun then it is challenge between us that is what you have wanted all along padma laughed again yes i think you should be killed for the earthmovers death but i cannot kill you just for that the council has voted that down but if you kill me in a duel then no one will blame you is that it that is it i huddled on the floor hugging myself trying to swallow the power back but it wasnt going anywhere richard crawled to me touching my bare arm i recoiled from him as if his touch had burned because i wanted him wanted him in a way so raw and primitive it made my body hurt dont touch me please how did you get rid of it last time sex or violence the munin leaves after sex or violence or healing i thought though that had been sex too in a way padmas power rode over us like a tank a tank with a spiked tread we both screamed and jeanclaude screamed with us blood poured from his mouth in a red rush and i knew what padma had done id felt him try to do it to me hed shoved his power into jeanclaude and opened it burst something inside of him jeanclaude fell to his knees blood spattering the white shirt i was on my feet without thinking standing between padma and jeanclaude the power burned along my skin my anger fed it as if it truly were a beast get out of my way human or i will kill you first and then your master it was like standing inside an invisible wall of fire and pain to be this close to padma now hed weakened richard then me done something to the marks without us jeanclaude could not win i stopped fighting the energy inside me i embraced it fed it and it spilled out of my mouth in a laugh that raised the hairs on my arms it wasnt my laugh it was a laugh id never thought to hear this side of hell padma grabbed me a hand on each arm lifting me off my feet i am allowed to kill you if you interfere with a duel i kissed him a soft brush of lips he was so startled for a second he just froze then he kissed me back locking his arms behind my back still with my feet dangling off the ground he raised his face enough to say even if you fuck me here and now it wont save him that laugh spilled from my lips and i felt a darkness fill my eyes that cold white part of me where there was nothing but static and silence the place where i killed opened up inside my head and raina filled it i remembered the feel of nathaniels heart in my hands the moment id realized i could kill him that i wanted to kill him more than i wanted to heal him so much easier to kill i locked my arms around padmas neck and kissed his mouth i shoved the power into him like a sword his body stiffened arms opening but i was holding on now his heart was slick and heavy it beat against the power like a fish in a net i crushed the power around it he fell to his knees and screamed into my mouth blood flowed in a warm gush filling my mouth with the warm salty rush of it hands pulled at me tried to tear me away from padma i clung to him legs wrapped around his waist arms around his neck back off or ill shatter his heart back off now thomas fell to his knees beside us blood trickling down his chin youll kill me and gideon i didnt want to kill them the power began to slide away buried in regret no i said it out loud i fed the power on my anger my outrage the munin swelled and filled me i squeezed padmas heartgently slowly i laid my face against his cheek and whispered why arent you fighting back master of beasts where is that large burning power of yours there was no answer but his labored breathing i squeezed a little tighter he gasped we could die together he said in a voice wet with his own blood i rubbed my cheek against his face the blood from his lips smeared along our skin id always known that blood was a turnon for lycanthropes but id never fully appreciated the appeal it wasnt so much the feel of the blood as the smell of it hot sweet flatly metallic and underneath the scent of fear he was so very afraid i could smell it feel it i raised back from him enough to see his face it was a mask of blood part of me was horrified part of me wanted to lick him clean like a cat with a bowl of cream instead i gave his heart a little extra squeeze and watched the blood flow faster from his mouth his power built in a warm wash i will kill you before i die lupa i held him and felt his power begin to build still weakened but enough to do the job are you still a good hindu i asked his eyes showed confusion how much bad karma have you accumulated this turn of the wheel i gave a quick lick over his mouth and had to put my forehead against his and close my eyes to keep from doing what the munin wanted what raina would have done if shed been here what would be punishment enough for your evil deeds in the next reincarnation padma how many lives would it take to balance this one turn i drew back enough to see his face i had enough control again not to clean his face with my tongue looking into his eyes i knew i was right he feared death and what would come after what would you do to save yourself padma what would you give who would you give i whispered that last he whispered back anything anyone i asked he just looked at me jeanclaude was sitting up cradled in richards arms it is still a duel until one is dead it is within our rights to insist on finishing this are you so eager to die the traveler said the death of one is the death of all he stood above us and a little back as if he didnt want to be too closely associated with us too bloody too primitive too mortal that is a question for padma to answer not me jeanclaude said what is your price padma asked no more punishment for olivers death he lost a duel it is as simple as that jeanclaude coughed and more blood spattered from his lips agreed padma said agreed the traveler said i never wanted them dead because of the earthmovers death yvette said agreed asher said the earthmover earned his death agreed jeanclaude held his hand out to me come ma petite we have our safety i shook my head laying a kiss on padmas forehead gentle chaste i promised sylvie that everyone who raped her would die padmas body jerked reaction at last the woman you can have but not my son do you agree to that traveler you who liv calls master now do you give her up so easily will you kill him if i refuse he asked i gave sylvie my word i said and i knew that would mean something to them then liv is yours to do with as you see fit master she said silence the traveler said see liv theyre just monsters i stared down into padmas bloody face and watched fear fill his eyes like water pouring into a glass i watched him look into my face and see the emptiness no for the first time i wanted to kill not for revenge or safety or even my word but just because i could because in some dark part of me it would be a pleasure to crush his heart and watch dark blood pour from him id have liked to blame it on rainas munin but i wasnt sure maybe it was just me maybe it always had been hell maybe it was one of the boys i didnt know and it didnt matter i let the thought fill my face and eyes i let padma see and fear filled his face his eyes because he understood i want fernando i said softly he is my son someone must die for his crimes padma i would rather it were him but if you wont give him to me then ill take you in his place no yvette said we have been more than generous here we have let you kill a council member and go unpunished we have given you back your traitor and our new toy we owe you nothing else i looked at padma but i spoke for the travelers ears if you had just insulted the vampires of this city then it would be over and you would owe us nothing but we are lukoi and not vampires you called our geri to your hand and she came you tried to break her and when she would not bend you tortured her you tortured her when you knew it would not give you the lukoi you dishonored her for no reason other than that you could you did it because you expected no reprisal the master of beasts thought our pack was beneath notice pawns in a larger game i released his heart because if i hadnt the munin would have killed him i shoved the power deeper into him i shoved it hard and fast until he screamed gideon and thomas echoed the scream padma collapsed backwards onto the floor with me riding his body i rose up hands flat over his chest legs straddling his body we are the thronos rokke the throne rock people and we are no ones pawns fernando knelt just outside the circle father he said his life or yours padma his life or yours padma closed his eyes and whispered his father you cant give me to her to them your word of honor that he is ours to punish as we see fit even unto death i said padma nodded my word damian jason and rafael just suddenly appeared around fernando he reached out to his father i am your son padma would not look at him even when i crawled off him he curled on his side away from fernando i wiped blood off my chin with the back of my hand the munin was leaving draining away i could taste blood all the way down i rolled onto my side and threw up blood does not improve the second time around jeanclaude reached out to me and i went to him the moment his cool hand touched mine i felt better not a lot but some richards hand touched my face gently i let them draw me into the circle of their arms jeanclaude seemed to gain strength just from my touch he sat up a little straighter i glanced over to find gideon and thomas doing much the same with padma blood poured from all of them but only padmas eyes were still haunted by fear id pushed him to the edge of the abyss pushed us both id been raised catholic and i wasnt sure there were enough hail marys in the world to cover what was happening to me lately fernando tried to make a break for it but he was outmanned or would that be outmonstered they bound him with silver chains and gagged him the last was to stop his constant begging he just couldnt believe his father had betrayed him liv didnt fight she seemed to take it almost resignedly what seemed to surprise her most was the fact that i didnt kill them both where they stood but i had other plans for them theyd insulted the pack it would be pack justice that was sort of a group activity maybe wed invite the wererats and have a cross species jamboree when they were led away a silence so deep and wide that it thundered in the ears filled the room yvette stepped into that silence she was smiling and lovely fresh and beautiful on jasons blood and our mingled power jeanclaude must still answer for his traitorous ways she said what are you babbling about the traveler said my master morte d amour has accused him of trying to start another council in this country a council that will steal our power and make us but laughable puppets the traveler waved it away jeanclaude is guilty of many things but that is not one of them yvette smiled and the smile was enough she was going to say something bad what say you padma if he is a traitor then we can execute him for it he can be an example to all others who would dare usurp the councils power padma was still on the ground cradled in the arms of his two servants he still wasnt feeling too good he stared at our little group we were still huddled on the floor too the six of us were not going to be dancing tonight the look in padmas eyes said it all id humiliated him scared the hell out of him and forced him to give up his only son to sure death he smiled and it wasnt pretty if they are traitors then they must be punished padma the traveler said you know this is false i did not say they were traitors traveler i said if they were traitors if they are traitors then they must be punished even you must agree to that but they are not traitors the traveler said i use my masters proxy to call a vote yvette said i think i know what three of the votes will be asher came to stand near jeanclaude and us they are not traitors yvette to say so is a lie lies are very interesting things dont you think harry she held out her hand as if it were a signal and harry the bartender joined her i didnt think i could be surprised anymore tonight i was wrong i see that you know harry yvette said the police are looking for you harry i said i know he said at least he had trouble meeting my eyes didnt make me feel much better but a little i knew harry was one of your line jeanclaude said but he is truly one of yours oui what is the meaning of this yvette the traveler said harry leaked the information to those awful fanatics so they would kill monsters why the traveler asked my question exactly i said my master is frightened of change like many of the old ones making us legal is the most sweeping change weve ever been threatened with he fears it he wants it stopped like oliver i said exactement but the vampire killings didnt stop it i said if anything its given the provamp lobby a boost but now she said we shall have our revenge a revenge so bloody and awful that it will turn everyone against us you cannot do this the traveler said padma has given me the key the master of the city is weak his link to his servants weaker still he would be easily killed now if someone would challenge him you the traveler said you could challenge jeanclaude but you could never be master of the city yvette you will never have enough power on your own to be a master vampire your masters power has made you try to rise above your station it is true that i will never be a master but there is a master here who hates jeanclaude and his servant asher she said his name like it was planned he looked at her but he seemed startled whatever she planned he didnt know about it he stared down at jeanclaude you want me to kill him while he is too weak to fight yes she said no asher said i do not want jeanclaudes place not like this beating him in a far duel is one thing but this is treachery i thought you hated him yvette said i do but honor means something to me implying i suppose that it doesnt to me she shrugged youre right if i could be master of this city i would do it but i could live another thousand years and i will never be a master but it is not honor that stops you its her she pointed at me there must be some alchemy in you that i do not see anita you bewitch every vampire that comes near you and every shapeshifter youve had a big taste and dont seem too taken with me i said my tastes run to things even more exotic than you animator if asher will not take the city as master then you cannot control the citys vampires you cannot make them do some terrible deed to the humans the traveler said i did not trust ashers hatred to make our plan work it would have been useful to have control of the citys vampires but it is not necessary the carnage has already begun yvette said we were all silent staring at her all of us thinking one thing i said it out loud what do you mean its already begun tell them warrick she said he shook his head she sighed fine i will tell them warrick was a holy warrior before i found him he could call the fire of god to his hands couldnt you he wouldnt look at any of us he stood there this huge figure in shining white head down like a little boy whos been caught playing hooky you set the fires in new orleans and san francisco and here why no fires in boston i asked i told you i began to feel stronger the longer i was away from our shared master in boston i was still weak it wasnt until new orleans that i felt gods grace return to me for the first time in nearly a thousand years i was drunk on it at first i was deeply ashamed that i burned down a building i did not mean to but it felt so wonderful so pure i caught him at it yvette said i told him to do it other places everywhere we went i told him to kill people but even torture wouldnt make him do that he did look up then i made sure no one was injured youre a pyrokinetic i said he frowned i was given a gift from god it was the first sign of his favor to return to me before i think i feared the holy fire feared it would destroy me but i do not fear my own destruction now she wishes me to use gods gifts for evil use she wanted me to burn down your stadium with all the people inside tonight i said warrick what have you done he whispered nothing yvette heard him she was suddenly beside us white skirts swinging she grabbed his chin and forced him to look at her the entire point to burning the other buildings was to leave a trail of evidence that would culminate in tonights little sacrifice a little burnt offering to our master you burned the stadium as we planned he shook his head blue eyes wide but not frightened she hit him hard enough to leave her hand in a red outline on his cheek you holyrolling bastard you answer to the same master that i answer to i will rot the skin from your bones for this warrick stood very straight you could see him preparing for the torment to come he stood shining and white and he looked like a holy warrior there was a peace in his face that was lovely to look upon yvettes power surged forward and i got just the faintest backwash but warrick stood there untouched pure nothing happened yvette turned to all of us who is helping him who is protecting him from me i realized what was happening no ones helping him yvette i said he is a master vampire and you cant hurt him anymore what are you talking about he is mine mine to do with as i see fit he has always been mine not anymore i said warrick smiled and it was beatific god has freed me from you yvette he has finally forgiven me for my fall from grace my lusting after your white flesh that led me to hell i am free of it i am free of you no she said no it seems our brother council member was limiting warricks powers the traveler said as he was giving you power yvette he was keeping it from warrick this is not possible she said we will burn this city to the ground and take credit for it we will show them we are monsters no yvette warrick said we will not i dont need you for this she said i can be monster enough on my own im sure there is a reporter out there somewhere that i can embrace ill rot in front of his cameras on him i will not fail our master i will be the monster he wants us to be the monsters we truly are she held out her hand to harry come let us go find victims in very public places we cannot allow this the traveler said no padma said he pushed to his feet with gideon and thomass help we cannot allow this no warrick said we cannot allow her to tempt anyone else it is enough no it is not enough it will never be enough i will find someone to take your place at my side warrick i can make another of you someone who will serve me for all time he shook his head slowly i cannot allow you to steal another mans soul in my place i will not ransom another man into the hell of your embrace i thought it was hell you feared yvette said centuries of worry that youll roast in punishment for your crimes she pouted at him exaggerating her voice centuries of listening to you whine about your purity and your fall from grace and the punishment that awaited you i no longer fear my punishment yvette because you think youve been forgiven she said he shook his head only god knows if i am truly forgiven but if i am to be punished then i will have earned it as we all have i cannot allow you to put another in my place she came to him trailing fingers across his white tunic i lost sight of her behind his broad back and when she came back around she was rotting she trailed decaying hands down his white suit leaving black and green globs slimy trails like obscene slugs she laughed at him with a face covered in sores richard whispered what is happening to her yvettes happening i said youll return to france with me youll continue to serve me even though youre a master now if anyone would make such a sacrifice it is you warrick no no he said if i were truly strong and worthy of gods grace then perhaps i would return with you but i am not that strong she wrapped her rotting arms around his waist and smiled up at him her body was running to ruin leaking dark fluids over her white dress her rich pale hair was drying out before our eyes turning to crinkling straw then kiss me warrick one last time i must find your replacement before dawn he encircled her with his white robed arms hugging her against his tall body no yvette no he stared down at her and there was something almost like tenderness on his face forgive me he said he held his hands out in front of him blue fire sprang from his hands a strange pale color paler even than gas flame yvette turned her rotting face to look behind her at the fire you wouldnt dare she said warrick closed his arms around her her dress caught first she screamed dont be stupid warrick let me go he held on and when the fire hit her flesh she went like shed been doused in kerosene she burned with a blue light she screamed and struggled but he had her pinned to his chest she couldnt even beat at the flames with her hands the fire bathed warrick in a nimbus of blue but he didnt burn he stood there yellow and white surrounded in blue fire and he did look like a saint something holy and wonderful and terrible to behold he stood there shining and yvette began to blacken and peel in his arms he smiled at us god has not forsaken me only my fear kept me in thrall to her all these years yvette twisted in his arms tried to get away but he held her tight he dropped to his knees bowing his head while she fought him she burned skin peeling back from her bones and still she screamed the stench of burning hair and cooking flesh filled the room but there was almost no smoke just heat building making everyone in the room move back from them finally mercifully yvette stopped moving stopped screaming i think warrick was praying while she shrieked and writhed and burned the blue flames roared almost to the ceiling then changed color they became pure yelloworange the color of ordinary flame i remembered mckinnons story of how the firebug had burned once the fire changed color warrick warrick let her go youll burn with her warricks voice came one last time i do not fear gods embrace he demands sacrifice but he is merciful he never screamed the fire began to eat at him but he never made a sound in that silence we heard a different voice a highpitched screaming low and wordless pitiless hopeless yvette was still alive someone finally asked if there was a fire extinguisher jason said no there isnt i looked at him across the room and he met my gaze we stared at each other and i knew that he knew exactly where the fire extinguisher was jeanclaude whose hand i was still holding knew where it was hell i knew where it was none of us went running we let her burn we let them both burn warrick i would have saved if i could have but yvetteburn baby burn the council went home we had the word of two members that we would not be bothered again i wasnt sure i trusted them but it was the best we were going to get richard and i are meeting regularly with jeanclaude learning how to control the marks i still cant control the munin but im working on it and richard is helping me were trying to be less nasty to one another hes gone out of state for the rest of the summer to finish work on his masters degree in preternatural biology hard to work on the marks from that big a distance hes approached the local pack there for possible lupa candidates i dont know how i feel about that im not even sure its richard that i would miss its the pack the lukoi you can always find another boyfriend but a new family especially one this strange thats a rare gift all the wereleopards have come on board my bandwagon even elizabeth surprise surprise the leopards call me their nimirra leopard queen me and tarzan huh i gave fernando and liv to sylvie other than a few pieces that sylvie kept for souvenirs theyre both gone nathaniel wanted to move in with me im paying for his apartment he seems lost without someone to organize his life zane who recovered from his gunshot wounds says that nathaniel needs a master or a mistress that hes what the s m crowd call a pet the term means someone who is a step below slave someone who cant function alone id never heard of such a thing but it seems to be true at least for nathaniel no i dont know what im going to do with him stephen and vivian are dating truthfully id begun to assume stephen liked guys shows how much i know asher stayed in st louis here strangely hes among friends he and jeanclaude reminisce about things id only read about in history books or seen in movies i suggested asher see a plastic surgeon he informed me that the burns could not be healed because they were caused by a holy object i said what does it hurt to ask when he got over the shocking idea that modern technology might be able to do something his own wonderful body could not he asked the doctors are hopeful jeanclaude and i did christen the bathtub at my new house picture white candles glowing everywhere the light gleaming on his naked chest the petals of two dozen red roses floating on the surface of the water thats what i came home to one morning at about three am we played until dawn when i tucked him into my bed i stayed with him until the warmth left his body and my nerve broke richard is right i cant give myself completely to jeanclaude i cant let him feed i cant truly share a bed he is no matter how lovely the walking dead i keep shying away from anything that reminds me too strongly of that fact like blooddrinking and low body temperatures jeanclaude certainly has the keys to my libido but my heart can a walking corpse hold the keys to my heart no yes maybe how the hell should i know
