sara paretsky burn marks the sixth book in the vi warshawski series thanks angelo polvere of the mayfair construction company in chicago provided me an overview of how a general contractor builds a major project and how a contractors office works jay meyer took me to the top of a sixtystory high rise going up in chicago and walked me back down explaining the different stages of construction i experienced the terrors of an unenclosed concrete deck firsthand ed keane made these connections for me my ignorance of big projects greatly exceeds my knowledge any errors of fact should be credited to my poor understanding rather than to these excellent teachers ray gibson shared different research tools for covering the kinds of things vi looks into in this book dr robert kirschner chief deputy medical examiner for cook county gave me a grand tour of the county morgue it was not pleasant but it was enlightening as is always the case in vis adventures no reference is made to any real public figures currently serving time or in office boots meagher ralph macdonald roz fuentes alma mejicana and wunsch and grasso are products of my perfervid imagination nor is the construction at rapelec towers based on any building now standing or under construction in chicago courtenay cardhu and other friends supported me through the various trials that beset me in writing this book wakeup call my mother and i were trapped in her bedroom the tiny upstairs room of our old house on houston down below the dogs barked and snapped as they hunted us gabriella had fled the fascists of her native italy but they tracked her all the way to south chicago the dogs barking grew to an earsplitting roar drowning my mothers screams i sat up it was three in the morning and someone was leaning on the doorbell i was sweaty and trembling from the dreams insistent realism the urgent ringing recalled all the times in my childhood the phone or doorbell had roused my father to some police emergency my mother and i would wait up for his return she refused to admit her fear although it stared at me through her fierce dark eyes but would make sweet childrens coffee for me in the kitchena tablespoon of coffee mixed with milk and chocolateand tell me wild italian folktales that made my heart race i pulled on a sweatshirt and shorts and fumbled with the locks to my door the ringing echoed through the stairwell behind me as i stumbled down the three flights to the front entryway my aunt elena stood on the other side of the glass door her finger pressed determinedly to the bell a faded quilt made an ungainly cloak around her shoulders she had propped a vinyl duffel bag against the wall a violet nightgown trailed from its top i dont believe in prescience or esp but i couldnt help feeling that my dreama familiar childhood nightmarehad been caused by some murky vibrations emanating from elena to my bedroom my fathers younger sister elena had always been the family problem she drinks a little you know my grandmother warshawski would tell people in a worried whisper after elena had passed out at thanksgiving dinner more than once an embarrassed patrolman roused my dad at two in the morning to tell him elena had been busted for soliciting on clark street on those nights there were no fairy tales in the kitchen my mother would send me to my own bed with a tiny shake of the head saying its her nature cara we mustnt judge her when my grandmother died seven years ago my fathers surviving brother peter gave his share of the norwood park bungalow to elena on condition that she never ask him for anything else she blithely signed the papers but lost the bungalow four years laterwithout talking to me or peter she had put it up as collateral in a wild development venture when the flybynight company evaporated she was the only partner the courts could findthey confiscated the house and sold it to meet the limited partnerships bills three thousand remained after paying the debts with that and her social security elena had been living in an sro at cermak and indiana playing a little twentyone and still turning the occasional trick on the day the pension checks arrived despite years of drinking that had carved narrow furrows in her chin and forehead she had remarkably good legs she caught sight of me through the glass and took her finger from the bell when i opened the door she put her arms around me and gave me an enthusiastic kiss victoria sweetie you look terrific the sour yeasty smell of stale beer poured over me elenawhat the hell are you doing here the generous mouth pouted baby i need a place to stay im desperate the cops were going to take me to a shelter but of course i remembered you and they brought me here instead a very nice young man with an absolutely gorgeous smile i told him all about your daddy but he was just a boy of course hed never met him i ground my teeth together what happened to your hotel they kick you out for screwing the oldage pensioners vicki babyvictoria she amended hastily dont talk dirtyit doesnt sound right coming from a sweet girl like you elena cut the crap as she started a second reproach i corrected myself hastily i mean stop talking nonsense and tell me why youre out on the streets at three in the morning she pouted some more im trying to tell you baby but you keep interrupting there was a fire our lovely little home was burned to the ground burned to an absolute crisp tears welled in her faded blue eyes and coursed through deep furrows to her neck i hadnt gone to sleep yet and i just had time to stuff my thing into a suitcase and get down the fire escape some people couldnt even do that much poor marty holman had to leave his false teeth behind the tears stopped as abruptly as they began to be replaced by a highpitched giggle you should have seen him vicki my god you should have seen what the old geezer looked like with his cheeks all sunk in and his eyes popping out and him shouting in this mumbly kind of way my teeth ive lost my teeth it must have been hilarious i said dryly you cannot live with me elena it would drive me to homicide within fortyeight hours maybe less her lower lip started to tremble again and she said in a terrible parody of baby talk dont be mean to me vicki dont be mean to poor old elena who got burned out of her house in the middle of the nights youre my own goddamn flesh and blood my favorite brothers little girl you cant toss poor old elena out on the street like some wornout mattress a door slammed sharply behind us the banker who had just moved into the firstfloornorth apartment erupted into the stairwell his hands on his hips his jaw sticking out pugnaciously he was wearing navystriped cotton pajamas despite the bleary sleep in his face his hair was perfectly combed what the hell is going on out here you may not have to work for a livinggod knows what you do all day long up therebut i do if you have to conduct your business in the middle of the night show some consideration for your neighbors and dont do it out in the hall if you dont shut up and get the hell out of here im calling the cops i stared at him coldly i run a crack house upstairs this is my supplier you could be arrested for complicity if youre found hanging around out here when the police arrive elena giggled but said dont be rude to him victoria you never know when you may want a boy with fabulous eyes like that to do something for you she added to the banker dont worry sweetie im just coming in well let you get your beauty sleep behind the closed door to onesouth a dog began to bark i ground my teeth some more and hustled elena inside snatching her duffel bag from her when she began wobbling under its weight the banker watched us through narrowed eyes when elena lurched against him he made a face of pure horror and retreated hastily to his apartment fumbling with the lock i tried moving elena upstairs but she wanted to stop and talk about the banker demanding to know why i hadnt asked him to carry her bag it would have been a perfect way for you two to get acquainted make things up a little i was close to screaming with frustration when the door to onesouth opened mr contreras came out a staggering sight in a crimson dressing gown the golden retriever i share with him straining against her collar but when she saw me her lowthroated growls changed to whimpers of excitement oh its you doll the old man said with relief the princess here woke me up and then i heard all the noise and thought oh my god the worst is happening someones breaking in in the middle of the night you oughta be more considerate dollits hard for people who have to work to get up in the middle of the night like this yes it is i agreed brightly and contrary to public opinion i am one of those working people and believe me i had no more desire to get out of bed at three am than you did elena put on her warmest smile and stuck out her hand to mr contreras like princess diana greeting a soldier elena warshawski she said charmed to meet you this little girl is my niece and shes the prettiest sweetest niece anybody could hope for mr contreras shook her hand blinking at her like an owl with a flashlight in its face pleased to meet you he said automatically if unenthusiastically look doll you oughta get this ladyyour aunt you sayyou oughta get her up to bed she aint doing too great the sour yeast smell had swept over him too yep thats just what ill do come on elena lets get upstairs beddybye time mr contreras headed back to his apartment the dog was annoyedif we were all having a party she wanted to join in that wasnt very polite of him elena sniffed as mr contrerass door closed behind us didnt even tell me his own name when i went out of my way to introduce myself she grumbled all the way up the stairs i didnt say anything just kept a hand in the small of her back to propel her in the right direction urging her on when she tried to stop for a breather at the secondfloor landing back in my apartment she wanted to ooh and aah over all my possessions i ignored her and moved the coffee table so i could pull the bed out of the couch i made it up and showed her where the bathroom was now listen elena you are not staying here more that one night dont even think im going to waffle on this because i wont sure baby sure what happened to your mas piano you sell it or something to buy this sweet little grand no i said shortly my mothers piano had been destroyed in the fire that gutted my own apartment three years earlier and dont think you can make me forget what im saying by raving over the piano im going back to bed you can sleep or not as you please but in the morning youre going someplace else oh dont look so ugly vicki victoria i mean itll ruin your complexion if you frown like that and where else am i supposed to turn in the middle of the night if not to my own flesh and blood knock it off i said wearily im too tired for it i shut the hall door without saying good night i didnt bother to warn her not to rummage around for my liquorif she wanted it badly enough shed find it then apologize to me a hundred times the next day for breaking her promise not to drink it i lay in bed unable to sleep feeling the pressure of elenas presence from the next room i could hear her scrabbling around for a while then the hum of the tv turned conscientiously to low volume i cursed my uncle peter for moving to kansas city and wished id had the foresight to hightail it to quebec or seattle or some other place equally remote from chicago around five as the birds began their predawn twittering i finally dropped into an uneasy sleep the lower depths the doorbell jerked me awake again at eight i pulled my sweatshirt and shorts back on and stumbled into the living room nobody answered my query through the intercom when i looked out the livingroom window at the street i could see the banker heading toward diversey his shoulders bobbing smugly i flicked my thumb at his back elena had slept through the episode including my loud calls through the intercom for a moment i felt possessed by the bankers angry impulsei wanted to wake her and make her as uncomfortable as i was i stared down at her in disgust she was lying on her back mouth open ragged snores jerking out as she inhaled puffy short breaths as she exhaled her face was flushed the broken veins on her nose stood out clearly in the morning light i could see that the violet nightgown was long overdue for the laundry the sight was appalling but it was also unbearably pathetic no one should be exposed to an outsiders view while shes sleeping let alone someone as vulnerable as my aunt with a shudder i moved hastily to the back of the apartment unfortunately her pathos couldnt quell my anger at having her with me thanks to her my head felt as though someone had dumped a load of gravel in it even worse i was making a presentation to a potential client tomorrow i wanted to finish my charts and get them turned into transparencies instead it looked as though id be spending the day hunting for housing depending on how long that took i could end up paying as much as quadruple overtime for the transparencies i sat on the diningroom floor and did some breathing exercises trying to ease my knotted stomach finally i managed to relax enough to do my prerun stretches not wanting to see elenas flushed face again i went down the back way picking up peppy outside mr contrerass kitchen door the old man stuck his head out and called to me as i closed the gate i pretended not to hear him i wasnt able to be similarly deaf when i got backhe was waiting for me sitting on the back stairs with the suntimes checking out his days picks for hawthorne i tried leaving the dog and escaping up the stairs but he grabbed my hand hang on a second there cookie who was that lady you was letting in last night mr contreras is a retired machinist a widower with a married daughter whom he doesnt particularly like during the three years weve been living in the same building hes attached himself to my life like an adoptive uncleor maybe a barnacle i jerked my hand free my aunt my fathers younger sister she has a penchant for old men with good retirement benefits so make sure you have all your clothes on if she stops by to chat this afternoon that kind of comment always makes him huffy im sure he heardand saidplenty worse on the floor in his machinist daysbut he cant take even oblique references to sex from me he turns red and gets as close to being angry as someone with his relentlessly cheerful disposition can manage theres no need to talk dirty to me he snapped im just concerned and i gotta say cookie you shouldnt let people come see you at all hours like that least if you do you shouldnt keep them down in the hall talking loud enough to wake every soul in the building i felt like wrenching one of the loose slats from the stairwell railing and beating him with it i didnt invite her i shrieked i didnt know she was coming i didnt want her here i didnt want to wake up at three in the morning theres no need to shout he said severely and even if you wasnt expecting her you coulda gone up to your apartment to talk i opened and shut my mouth several times but couldnt construct a coherent response anyway id kept elena in the hall in hopes shed feel hurt enough to just pick up the duffel bag and go but even as id done it id known in my heart of hearts that i couldnt turn her away at that hour so the old man was right agreeing with him didnt make me any happier okay okay i snapped it wont happen again now get off my backive got a lot to do today i stomped up the stairs to my kitchen muted snores still seeped through the closed door from the living room i made a pot of coffee and took a cup into the bathroom with me while i showered bent on leaving the apartment as fast as possible i pulled on jeans and a white shirt and stopped in the kitchen to scratch together a breakfast elena was sitting at the breakfast table shed put a soiled quilted dressing gown over the violet nightie her hands shook slightly she used both of them to lift a cup of coffee to her mouth she produced an eager smile wonderful coffee you make baby just as good as your mas thank you elena i opened the refrigerator door and took stock of the meager contents im sorry i cant stay to chat but i want to try to find you someplace to sleep tonight aw vickivictoria i mean dont rush around like that it aint good for the heart let me stay here just for a few days anyway get over the shock of living through that inferno last night i promise i wont bother you any and i could get the place cleaned up a little while youre at work i shook my head implacably no way elena i will not have you living here not one night longer her face puckered why do you hate me baby im your own daddys sister family has to stick by family i dont hate you i dont want to live with anyone but you and i lead especially incompatible lives you know as well as i that tony would say the same if he were still around thered been a painful episode when elena announced her independence from my grandmother and moved into her own apartment finding solitude not to her liking shed shown up at our house in south chicago one weekend shed stayed three days it wasnt my fierce mother whod asked her to leavegabriellas love of the underdog somehow could encompass even elena but my easygoing father came home from the graveyard shift on monday to find elena passed out at the kitchen table he put her into a detox unit at county and refused to talk to her for six months after she got out elena apparently also remembered this episode the pouty puckering disappeared from her face she looked stricken and somehow more real i squeezed her shoulder gently and offered to make her some eggs she shook her head without speaking watching me silently while i spread anchovy paste on toast i ate it quickly and left before pity could overcome my judgment it was well past nine now the morning rush was ending and i had an easy run across belmont to the expressway when i neared the loop though the traffic congealed as we moved through a construction maze the four miles on the ryan between the eisenhower and thirtyfirst supposedly the busiest eight lanes of traffic anywhere in the known universe had finally crumbled under the stress of the semis the southbound lanes were closed while the feds performed reconstructive surgery my little cavalier bounced between a couple of sixtytonners as the slow lines of traffic snaked around the construction barricades to my right the surface of the old roadbed had been completely removed lattices of the reinforcing bars were exposed they looked like tightly packed nests of vipershere and there a rusty head stood up prepared to strike the turnoff to lake shore drive had been so cleverly disguised that i was parallel with the barrel blocking one of the exit lanes before i realized it with my sixtyton pal close on my tail i couldnt stand on the brakes and swerve around the barrel i gnashed my teeth and rode down to thirtyfifth then took side streets up to cermak elenas sro had stood a few doors north of the intersection with indiana a niggling doubt id had in her story vanished when i pulled up across the street from it the indiana arms hoteltransients welcome rates by the day or by the monthhad joined the other derelicts on the street in retirement i parked and went over to look at the skeleton when i walked around to the north side of the building i discovered a man in a sport jacket and hard hat poking around in the rubble every now and then hed pick up some piece of debris with a pair of tongs and stick it into a plastic bag hed mark the bag and mutter into a pocket dictaphone before continuing his exploration he spotted me when he turned east to poke through a promising tell he finished picking up an object and marking its container before coming over to me you lose something here his tone was pleasant but his brown eyes were wary just sleep someone i know lived here until last nightshe showed up at my place early this morning he pursed his lips weighing my story in that case what are you doing here now i hunched a shoulder i guess i wanted to see it for myself see if the place was really gone before i put all my energy into finding her a new home come to that what are you doing here a suspicious person might think you were making off with valuables he laughed and some of the wariness left his face theyd be rightin a way i am are you with the fire department he shook his head insurance company was it arson id been so bogged down in the sludge of family relations i hadnt even wondered how the fire started his caution returned im just collecting things the lab will give me a diagnosis i smiled youre right to be carefulyou dont know who might come around in the aftermath of a blaze like this my names v i warshawski im a private investigator when im not looking for emergency housing and i do projects for ajax insurance from time to time i pulled a card from my bag and handed it to him he wiped a sooty hand on a kleenex and shook mine robin bessinger im with ajaxs arson and fraud division im surprised i havent heard your name it didnt surprise me ajax employed sixty thousand people around the worldno one could possibly keep track of all of them i explained that my work for them had been in claims or reinsurance and gave him a few names hed be likely to recognize he thawed further and confided that the signs of arson were quite clear id show you the places where they poured accelerant but i dont want you in the building if you dont have a hard hat chunks of plaster keep falling down i showed suitable regret at being denied this treat the owner buy a lot of extra insurance lately he shook his head i dont knowi havent seen the policies they just asked me to get on over before the vandals took too much of the evidence i hope your friend got all her stuff outnot too much survived this blast id forgotten to ask elena if anyone had been badly hurt robin told me the police violent crimes unit would have joined the bomb and arson squad in force if anyone bad died you wouldnt have been allowed to park without showing good reason for being near the premisesits a fact of life that torchers like to come back to see if the job got done right no one was killed but a good half dozen were ferried to michael reese with burns and respiratory problems torchers usually like to make sure a building can be clearedthey know an investigation into an old dump like this wont get too much attention if there arent any murder charges to excite the cops he looked at his wrist id like to get back to work hope your friend finds a new place okay i agreed fervently and went off to start my hunt with an easy optimism bred of ignorance i began at the emergency housing bureau on south michigan where i joined a long line there were woman and children of all ages old men muttering to themselves rolling their eyes wildly women anxiously clutching suitcases or small appliances a seemingly endless sea of people left on the streets from some crisis or other yesterday the high counters and bare walls made us feel as though we were suppliants at the gates of a soviet labor camp there werent any chairs i took a number and leaned against the wall to wait my turn next to me a very pregnant woman of about twenty holding a large infant was struggling with a toddler i offered to hold the baby or amuse the twoyearold its all right she said in a soft slow voice todd just be tired after staying up all night we couldnt get into the shelter cause the one they sent us to dont allow babies i couldnt get me no bus fare to come back here and get them to find us a different place so what did you do i didnt know which was more horribleher plight or the resigned gentle way she talked about it oh we found us a park bench up at edgewater by the shelter the baby sleep but todd just couldnt get comfortable dont you have any friends or relatives to help you out what about the babys father oh he be trying to find us a place she said listlessly but he cant get no job and my mother we used to stay with her but she had to go into the hospital now it look like she going to be sick a long time and she cant keep up on her rent i looked around the room dozens of people were waiting ahead of me most of them had my neighbors draggedout look bodies stooped over from too much shame those who didnt were pugnacious waiting to take on a system they couldnt possibly beat elenas needsmy needscould certainly take a far backseat to their demands for emergency shelter before i took off i asked if todd and she would like some breakfasti was going over to the burger king to get something they dont let you eat in here but todd could maybe go with you and get something todd showed a great disinclination to be separated from his mother even to get some food finally i left him whimpering at her side went to the burger king got a dozen breakfast buns with eggs and wrapped the lot in a plastic bag to conceal the fact that it was food i handed it to the woman and left as fast as i could my skin was still trembling not st peter the kinds of places elena could afford didnt seem to advertise in the papers the only residential hotels listed in the classifieds were in lincoln park and started at a hundred a week elena had paid seventyfive a month for her little room at the indiana arms i spent four hours futilely pounding the pavements i combed the near south side covering cermak road between indiana and halsted a century ago it housed the fields the searses and the armours when they moved to the north shore the area collapsed rapidly today it consists of vacant lots auto dealers public housing and the occasional sro a few years ago someone decided to restore a blockful of the original mansions they stand like a macabre ghost town empty opulent shells in the midst of the decay that permeates the neighborhood the stilts of the dan ryan l running overhead made me feel tiny and useless as i went door to door asking drunk or indifferent supers about a room for my aunt i vaguely remembered reading about all the sros that came down when presidential towers went up but somehow the impact this had on the street hadnt hit me before there just wasnt housing available for people with elenas limited means the hotels i did find were all full and victims of last nights fire savvier than me had been there at dawn renting the few rooms available i realized that the fourth time a blowsy manager said sorry if youd gotten here first thing this morning when we had something at three i called off the search panicked at the prospect of housing elena for some indefinite future i drove into my loop office to call my uncle peter it was a decision i could make only while panicked peter was the first member of my family to make something substantial of his life maybe the only member besides my cousin boomboom nine years younger than elena peter had gone to work in the stockyards when he returned from korea he quickly realized that the people getting rich in meat packing werent the poles hitting cows over the head with hammers scraping together a few bucks from friends and relations he started his own sausage manufacturing firm the rest was the classic story of the american dream he followed the yards to kansas city when they moved there in the early seventies now he lived in a huge house in the tony mission hills district sent his wife to paris to buy her spring clothes shipped my cousins off to expensive private schools and summer camps and drove latemodel nissans only in america peter also distanced himself as much as possible from the lowbudget end of the family my office in the pulteney building was definitely down market most of the loop expansion in recent years has been to the west the pulteney is at the southeast fringe where peep shows and pawnshops push the rents down the wabash l rattles the fourthfloor windows disturbing the pigeons and dirt that normally roost there my furnishings are spartan gleanings from police auctions and resale shops i used to hang an engraved sketch of the uffizi over the filing cabinet but last year id decided its intricate black detail looked too drab with all the olive furniture in its place id put up some splashy posters of paintings by nell blaine and georgia okeeffe they gave the room a little color but no one would mistake it for the hub of an international business peter had been there once when he brought his three children to chicago for a tour several years ago i had watched him swell visibly as he calculated the gap between our net present values getting hold of him this afternoon took all my powers of persuasion mixed in with a little bullying my first worry that he might be out of the country or equally inaccessible on some golf course proved groundless but he had a phalanx of assistants convinced it was better to handle my business themselves than to disturb the great man the most difficult skirmish came when i finally reached his personal secretary im sorry miss warshawski but mr warshawski has given me a list of family members who hell let interrupt him and your name isnt on it the kansas twang was polite but unyielding i watched the pigeons check themselves for lice could you get a message to him while i hold that his sister elena will be arriving in kansas city on the six oclock flight and has cab fare to his house does he know shes coming nope thats why im trying to get hold of him to let him know five minutes laterwhile i paid prime daytime rates to holdpeters deep voice was booming in my ear what the hell did i mean sending elena to him unannounced like this he wasnt having his children exposed to a lush like that they didnt have guest space he thought hed made it clear four years ago that he was never yes yes i finally stanched the flow i know a woman like elena would just not fit into mission hills the drunks there get manicures every week i understand it wasnt the best opening to a plea for financial aid after hed finished shouting his outrage i explained the problem the news that elena was still in chicago did not as id hoped bring him enough relief to agree to bail her out absolutely not i made this totally clear to her the last time i helped her that was when she foolishly squandered mothers house in that cockamamie investment scheme you may remember that i retained a lawyer for her who saw that she was able to salvage something from the sale that was itmy last involvement in her affairs its time you learned the same lesson vic an alkie like elena will just milk you dry the sooner you realize it the easier your life will be hearing some of my own negative thoughts echoed on his pompous lips made me squirm in my chair she paid for that lawyer though peter if i remember rightly she hasnt ever asked you for cash has she anyway i live in four rooms i cant have her staying with me all i want is enough money to make the rent on a decent apartment for a month while i help her find a place she can afford he gave a nasty laugh thats what your mother said that time elena showed up at your place in south chicago remember not even tony could stomach having her around tony he could tolerate anything unlike you i commented dryly i know you mean that as an insult but i take it as a compliment what did tony leave you when he died that squalid house on houston and the remains of his pension and a name im proud to use i snapped thoroughly roused and come to that you wouldnt have gotten your little meatball machine off the ground without his help so do something for elena in exchange im sure wherever tony is now hed consider it a just quid pro quo i paid tony back to the nickel peter huffed and i dont owe him or you shit and you know damned well its sausages not meatballs yeah you paid back the nickel but a share of the profits even a little interest wouldnt have killed you would it dont try that sentimental crap on me vic ive been around the block too many times to fall for it just like a used car i said bitterly the line went dead in my ear the pleasure of having the exit line didnt compensate for losing the fight why in hell were the survivors in my fathers family peter and elena why couldnt peter have died and tony been the one to hang around although not in the shape he was the last few years of his life i swallowed bile and tried to shut out the image of my father the last year of his life his face puffy his body wrenched by uncontrollable coughing pressing my lips together bitterly i looked at the stack of unanswered mail and unfiled papers on my desk maybe it was time i got into the twentieth century while i still had a decade left to do it in make a big enough success of my work that i could at least afford a secretary to do some of the paperwork for me an assistant who could take on some of the legwork i shuffled through the papers impatiently until i finally found the numbers i needed for my upcoming presentation i called visible treasures to see how late i could bring them in for overnight processing they told me if i got them there by eight they would typeset them and create transparencies for me at only double overtime when i got the price quote i felt a little betterit wasnt going to be quite as bad as id feared i typed up my drafts on my mothers old olivetti if i couldnt afford an assistant maybe at least i should blow a few thousand on a desktop publishing system on the other hand the force it took to use the olivettis keyboard kept my wrists strong it was a little after six when i finished typing i dug through my drawers looking for a manila folder to put the charts in when i didnt find a fresh one i dumped the contents of an insurance file onto the desk and stuck my documents into it now the desktop looked like the city landfill right after the trucks drop off their loads i could see peter looking at it his face creasing into little rivulets of suppressed smugness maybe being committed to truth justice and the american way didnt have to include working in slum conditions i put the insurance material back into its folder and took it over to the filing cabinets where i found a section on business expenses that seemed close enough with a glow of virtue i stuck insurance in between illinois bell and lease having gotten that far i went through the two weeks of mail sitting on the desk writing a few checks filing documents and trashing the circulars near the bottom of the stack i found a thick white letter the size of a wedding invitation with cook county women for open government in engraved script on the top left i was about to pitch it when i suddenly realized what it wasin a fit of insanity i had agreed to be a sponsor for a political fundraiser marissa duncan and i had worked together in the public defenders office an aeon or two ago she was one of those people who live and die for politics whether in the office or on the street and she chose her issues carefully shed been active in our drive to unionize the pds office for example but shed steered clear of involvement in the politics of abortionshe didnt want anything to drag her down if she decided to run for office shed left the pd a number of years ago to work in jane byrnes disastrous second mayoral campaign she now had a cushy job with a big public relations firm that specialized in selling candidates she phones me only when shes masterminding some great campaign when she called four weeks ago id just finished a tricky job for a ballbearing manufacturer in kankakee shed caught me basking in the glow that comes from a display of competence combined with a large check great news shed said enthusiastically riding over my tepid hello boots meagher is going to sponsor a fundraiser for rosalyn fuentes i appreciate your letting me know i said politely i wont have to buy the star in the morning you always did have a great sense of humor vic politicians cant afford to tell you they think youre a pain in the butt but this is really exciting its the first time boots has ever endorsed a woman in such a public way hes going to hold a party at his place in streamwood itll be a terrific chance to meet the candidate get to know some of the people on the county board everyones going to be there rostenkowski and dixon may even stop by my heart is turning over just at the thought how much you selling tickets for five hundred to sponsor too rich for my blood anyway i thought you said meagher was sponsoring her i objected just to be obnoxious a thread of impatience finally hit her voice vic you know the drill five hundred to be listed in the program as a sponsor twofifty to be a patron a hundred to get in the front door sorry marissa way out of my league and i aint that big a fan of boots anyway his real name was donnel hed gotten the nickname when the reformers thought they could get daleys men of the county slate theyd run some poor earnest wimp whose name i couldnt even remember on the slogan of give meagher the boot when daley muscle got the big guy reelected by a landslide his supporters at the bismarck celebration party had screamed boots boots when he appeared and hed never been called anything else since marissa said earnestly vic we need more women out there otherwise its going to look as though roz has sold out to boots and well lose a lot of our grassroots support and even though youre not with the pd anymore your name still commands a lot of respect with local women anyway to make a long story short shed used flattery fuentess prochoice record and my guilt for having dropped out of political action for so long to get me to agree to be a patron and i did have a twothousanddollar check beaming at me from the desk the thick white envelope held the invitation a copy of the program and a return envelope for my two hundred and fifty dollars marissa had scrawled on the program in her giant schoolgirl hand really looking forward to seeing you again i flipped through the booklet looking at the list of sponsors and patrons having agreed to hold the fundraiser boots had gone all out putting the arm on the regular dems or maybe that was marissas work the pages glittered with judges state reps state senators and directors of large corporations near the end of the list of patrons was my name from some ancient yearbook or birth certificate marissa had dug up my middle name when i saw the iphigenia jumping out at me i was tempted to call her and withdraw my supporti try to keep my mothers lunacy in naming me a secret known only to family the function was this coming sunday i looked at my watchsevenfifteen i could call marissa and still make it to visible treasures in time late though it was she was still in her office she tried to sound pleased at hearing from me but couldnt quite carry it offmarissa likes me better when im doing favors for her you all set for sunday vic you bet i said enthusiastically what are we wearing jeans or evening gowns she relaxed oh its casualbarbecue you know ill probably wear a dress but jeans will be fine rosty coming you said he might no but the head of his chicago office will be there cindy mathiessen great i made myself sound like a cheerleader i want to talk to her about presidential towers caution returned to marissas voice at once as she demanded to know why i wanted to discuss the complex the sros i said earnestly you know about eight thousand rooms were lost when they cleared that area to put up the towers ive got this aunt see i explained about elena and the fire so im not feeling too crazy about boots or rosty or any of the other local dems since i cant find her a room but im sure if i bring it to what did you same her name wascindy if i talk to cindy about it shes bound to be able to help me out it seemed to me the phone vibrated with the sound of wheels turning in marissas brain finally she said what can your aunt afford she was paying seventyfive at the indiana arms a month i mean it was past sundown now and the room was dark beyond the pool of light my desk lamp shed i walked over to the wall with the phone to switch on the overheads if i can get her a place will you promise not to talk about presidential towers on sunday with anyone its a little touchy for people for the dems she meant with the spotlight already on the speaker of the house for ethics questions they didnt want anything embarrassing said to one of his buddies i made a show of reluctance can you do it by tomorrow night if thats what itll take vic ill do it by tomorrow night she didnt try to keep the snarl from her voice i had just twenty minutes to get to visible treasures before paying quadruple overtime but i took the extra minute to write out a check to cook county women for open government as i locked the office door behind me i started whistling for the first time all day who says blackmailers dont have fun auntie does a bunk it was almost nine by the time i got off the kennedy at california and headed over to racine i hadnt had dinner hadnt had anything since grabbing a polish at a holeinthewall on canal at two i wanted peace and quiet a hot bath a drink and a pleasant dinneri had a veal chop in the freezer id been saving for just such a tired evening instead i braced myself for a night with elena when i parked across the street and looked up at the third floor the windows were dark as i trudged up the stairs i imagined my aunt passed out at the kitchen table or on the unmade sofa bed in the living room or downstairs seducing mr contreras i hadnt given elena keys or instructions on the two dead bolts i undid the bottom lockthe one that locks automatically when you shut the doorand switched on the light in the little entryway it shed a dim glow into the living room i could see the sofa was restored to its normal upright position i went through the dining room to the kitchen and turned on the light there the kitchen was sparkling the three days accumulation of dishes in the sink had been washed and put away the newspapers were gone the floor washed and the tabletop clean and tidy in the middle sat a sheet torn from one of my yellow pads covered with elenas sprawling unsteady writing shed written vicki then crossed it out and changed it to victoria baby thanks a lot for the loan of a bed last night when i needed it i knew i could count on you in a pinch you always were a good girl but i dont mean to hang around and be a burden on you which i can see i would be so heres good luck to you kid and ill be seeing you in the sweet by and by like they say shed drawn eight big xs and signed her name since three this morning id been cursing my aunt for coming to me and wishing id return home to find that id dreamed the whole episode id gotten my wish but instead of being elated i felt a little hollow under the diaphragm despite her easy camaraderie elena didnt have friends of course the streets and alleys of chicago were strewn with her former lovers but i didnt think any of them would remember elena if she showed up at their doors come to think of it im not sure elena would remember any of them well enough to know which doors to knock on the other unpleasant notion hovering in my minds back cupboard was prompted by elenas final sentence in a high school dramatization of tom sawyer wed sung in the sweet byeandbye it was supposed to be typical of late victorian hymnology as i recalled the sweet byeandbye was a syrupy euphemism for life beyond the grave i had never spent enough time with elena to know if it was just some catch phrase she used or if shed gone off to throw herself over the wacker drive bridge i went carefully through the apartment to see if shed left any clue to her intentions the duffel bag was gone along with the violet nightdress when i looked in the liquor cabinet i saw nothing was missing except five inches from the open bottle of johnnie walker but from the way shed been sleeping this morning i kind of thought shed drunk that before going to bed in a way i wished shed taken the bottleit would have made me more certain she hadnt any immediate intention of suicide on the other hand did someone really spend her whole life drinking and mooching off people and then suddenly have such a strong sense of remorse that at age sixtysix she couldnt take it anymore on the surface it didnt sound too likely lack of sleep and my day among the burnedout buildings of the near south side were making me unnaturally morbid i debated phoning lotty herschel to discuss the matter with her shes a doctor who sees a fair number of drunks in her storefront clinic on damen on the other hand her day starts at seven with hospital rounds this was a bit late for a call whose main function was to allay my uneasy conscience i put the black label back into the cupboard without pouring any the drink part of my program had lost its appeal when i thought about elena swallowing five inches and falling into a redfaced stupor i went into the kitchen pulled the veal chop from the freezer and stuck it in my little toaster oven to thaw while i took a bath unless i wanted to rouse the police there was nothing i could do about my aunt tonight somehow soaking in the tub didnt relax me the way it usually did the image of elena her gallant smile a bit lopsided sitting on a park bench with the family id encountered at the emergency housing bureau kept coming between me and rest i lumbered out of the tub turned off the little oven and got dressed again mr contrerass livingroom light had been on when i came in i went down the front stairs and knocked on his door the dog whimpered impatiently as he scrabbled with the locks when he finally opened the door she leapt up to lick my face i asked the old man if hed seen elena leave of course he hadwhen he wasnt gardening or checking the races he was keeping a close eye on the building we didnt really need a watchdog with him on the premises elena had left around twothirty no he couldnt tell me what she was wearing or if she had any makeup on what kind of person did i think he was staring at people and snooping into their private lives what he could tell me was shed caught a bus on diversey on account of hed gone down to the corner for some milk and seen her climb on eastbound that was right you wasnt expecting her to leave i hunched my shoulders impatiently she doesnt have any place to go not that i know of he clicked his tongue sympathetically and started on a detailed interrogation my thin stack of patience was about gone when the banker once more opened his door he was wearing formfitting ralph lauren jeans and a polo shirt jesus christ if id known you stood around yelling in the stairwell at all hours id never have bought into this place his round face puckered up in a scowl and if id known what a tightassed crybaby you were id have blocked your purchase i responded nastily the dog growled deep in her throat you go on up cookie mr contreras urged me hastily ill call you if i remember anything else he pulled the dog into the apartment with him and shut the door i could hear peppy whining and snuffling behind it eager to join in the fight just what is it you do do the banker demanded i smiled nothing i need a zoning permit for sugar so dont wear out your brain worrying about it well if you dont stop doing it in the stairwells i really will call the cops he slammed his door shut on me i stomped back up the stairs now hed have something substantial to tell his girlfriend or his mother or whoever he phoned at night i live to serve others back in my apartment i turned the little oven on again and started cooking mushrooms and onions in some red wine getting the picture of elena heading east on the diversey bus made me feel a bit easier that sounded as though she had a specific destination in mind in the morning as a sop to my conscience id talk to one of my police department pals maybe they wouldnt mind tracking down the bus driver find out if he remembered her and where shed headed when shed left the bus maybe id be the first woman on the moonstranger things have happened it was well after ten when i finally sat down with my dinner the chop was cooked to a turn just pink inside and the glazed mushrooms complemented it perfectly id eaten about half of it when the phone rang i debated letting it go then thought of elena if shed been trying to sell her ass on clark street it could be the cops wanting me to bail her out it was a police officer but he didnt know elena and he was calling for purely personal reasons at least partly personal reasons id met michael furey when i went to the mallorys last new years day for dinner his father and bobby had grown up together in norwood park when michael joined the police fresh out of junior college bobby kept an avuncular eye on him in chicago people look after their own but bobby is a scrupulously honorable cophe wouldnt use personal influence to promote a friends sons career the boy proved himself on his own though after fifteen years bobby was glad to welcome him into the violent crimes unit at the central district for a while following the transfer eileen invited the two of us up to dinner on a regular basis she longed not so much for my second marriage as for my childrenshe kept trotting the brightest and best of the chicago police by me in the hopes that one of them would look like good father material to me eileen belonged to the generation that believes a guy with a good set of wheels is more appealing than one who can afford only a honda furey had a little money his fathers life insurance he said which hed been able to investand he drove a silver corvette he was attractive and cheerful and i did like driving the corvette but we didnt have much except the mallorys and a love of sports in common our relationship settled into an occasional trip to the stadium or a ball game together eileen masked her disappointment but stopped the dinner invitations vic glad i caught you in michael boomed cheerfully into my ear i finished chewing hiya michael whats up just got off shift thought id check in and see how youre doing why michael i said with mock sincerity how thoughtful of you how long has it beena month or soand you check in with me at ten pm he laughed a little consciously aw heck vic you know how it is i got something to ask and i dont want you taking it the wrong way try me itsuh well just i didnt know you were interested in county politics im not especially i was surprised ernie told me youre listed as a sponsor for the fuentes fundraiser out at boots farm on sunday news sure do travel fast i said lightly but i felt myself tensing in reflexive annoyancei hate having my activities monitored how does ernie know and why does he care ernie wunsch and ron grasso had grown up with michael on the northwest side the odd political jobs theyd done as teenagers and young adults hadnt hurt them any when they decided to join ernies dads general contracting firm after college their company wasnt one of the giants but more and more often you saw cement trucks with wunsch grassos red and green stripes at construction sites their biggest coup had been getting the bid on the rapelec complex an officecondo center under construction near the gold coast i was afraid youd take this the wrong way michael said plaintively ernie doesnt care he knows because he and his old man have done a certain amount of work for the county over the years so of course he gets asked to all the fundraisers you know how it is in chicago vicif you do business with the city or the county you gotta engage in a little reciprocity i knew how it was so of course they got an advance look at the program and ernie knows you and i arewell friends so he mentioned it not something you really need to get hot about no i agreed meekly it just takes me by surprise when two unconnected parts of my life suddenly hook up know the feeling he agreed i just was wondering if i could go with you i might attend anyway since the boys are roping in as many victims as they can if youre going to be there let me think about it i said after a pause too long to be really polite althoughlook i wonder if you could do something for me i told him about elena i dont know much about herwhat her hangouts are and even though i dont want her living with me im a little worried id kind of like to know shes okay wherever she is christ vic you dont want much do you you know damned well theres no way i can go to the cta without a good reason if i start checking routes and talking to drivers their unionll be at uncle bobbys door within the hour screaming for my butt maybe i should call bobby in the morning talk it over with him besides being michaels godfather bobby mallory had been my own fathers protégé and his best friend on the force he might check up on elena for tonys sakei wouldnt expect him to do it for mine no dont do that michael said hastily tell you whatill pass it on to the uniforms on madison and the near south side ask them to keep an eye out for her and call me if they see her i dont want her being hassled i warned him cool your jets vic discretion is my middle name yeah right and im the queen of sheba he laughed so if i look into it youll go to bootss with me on sunday something like that i admitted blushing in spite of myself i ought to run you in for trying to bribe a cop it was a grumble but the tone was goodnatured he promised to call me tomorrow if he turned anything up he arranged to meet me at three on sunday since he knew the way he offered to drive i said id follow him in my own cari didnt want to hang around boots meaghers farm until midnight while michael caught up with his old precinct pals by the time we hung up my chop had gotten cold and the glazed wine sauce was congealed i was too tired to heat it up again tonight sticking the plate in the refrigerator i fell into bed and spent the night in uneasy dreams in which i chased elena across chicago always just missing her as she boarded the eastbound diversey bus royal suite i worked for the county for five years after passing the bar during my summers in law school i interned at the loops giant firms and id held a lot of weird jobs to finance my college education the worst was selling books by phone for timelife from five to nine in the evening you call people at dinner and they scream at you eight or nine times i phoned homes of dead peopleonce the woman had died only the day before i extricated myself from her sobbing daughter swiftly and gracelessly so i know working for myself beats a whole roster of other employers i can list still being a private investigator is not the romance of the loner knight that marlowe and spenser like to pretendhalf the time youre doing some kind of tedious surveillance or spending your day in the daley center checking backgrounds and a good chunk of the rest of the time goes to selling people on hiring your services often not successfully cartwright wheeler insurance brokers listened closely to my presentation on the perils and possibilities of filing false claims they asked a lot of questions but the nine people in the room didnt feel able to make a decision on hiring me without consulting senior staff i exuded warmth professionalism and a positive mental attitude while trying to force a commitment but the best i could get was a promise to discuss it at mondays management meeting i went back to my office to stow my five hundred dollars worth of transparencies in a filing cabinet usually i dont get too upset by a lukewarm response but i was feeling edgy enough about elena that i slammed drawers and tore up mail to vent my irritation larry bowa liked to destroy toilets after a bad game we all have our little immature quirks when id calmed down some i checked in with my answering service marissa duncan had left a message i called back and spoke with her secretary marissa had found a room for elena in a residential hotel on kenmore between wilson and lawrence they wanted ninety a month for it i hesitated a moment i hated to turn it downmarissa would be peeved and she had enough connections that i was better off with her feeling good about me even worse what if elena showed up again at three in the morning she cant move in right away i said at last but ill stop by and pay for the room on my way home cash the secretary said briefly and no pets or children fine i doublechecked the address and hung up for the first time in my life i found myself wondering what elena had done for birth control all those years and i suddenly realized why gabriella had been so accepting the time she showed up at our house thirty years ago i couldnt put my finger on exactly what had been said but elena had been pregnant gabriella helped her find some kind of underground abortion and elena got drunk i sat at my desk my shoulder slumped watching the pigeons fight for space on the windowsill finally i stretched out a hand to switch on the desk lamp and called michael furey at the central district he didnt sound enthusiastic at hearing from me but he said hed checked the morgue and some of the area hospitalsno grayhaired drunk women had been hauled in since yesterday afternoon gotta go vic were hard at it see you sunday normally i would have chafed him about being hard at a poker game but i hung up without saying anythingi wasnt in the mood for jokes id noticed too late that one of the pieces of mail i was shredding was from an old client i rummaged through the scraps on the floor and reconstructed enough of it to see that it was a request for a simple background check it would keep until mondayi wasnt in the humor to do that tonight either the rest of the paper i scooped up and put into the trash embarrassed by my earlier outburst i soberly filed the papers remaining on my desk then went to the ladies room on the seventh floor for some water to scrub down the surface that looked so good that i finished by washing the windowsills and filing cabinets too clean now in thought word and deed i locked up the office en route to the garage i stopped at a cash machine to get the ninety dollars then joined the slow procession out of the loop everyone leaves work early on friday in order to maximize the amount of time spent sitting in traffic before starting the weekend it was a little before five when i reached the windsor arms on kenmore the building had gone up when the duke was in his heyday enjoying goerings hospitality and lending his name to residential hotels that hoped to reflect his royal splendor the duke of windsor was dead now but the hotel hadnt been so lucky if the facade had been washed since george vis ascension it didnt show not much more attention had been paid to basic repairs a number of windows had pieces of cardboard filling in for missing panes the inside smelled faintly of boiled cabbage despite a large poster over the desk that stated emphatically absolutely no cooking in rooms next to the sign alderman helen schillers face smiled beatifically out at her voters no one was behind the desk but a handful of residents sat in a small lounge watching vanna white on a tiny tv chained high on the wall i walked over and asked if anyone knew where the manager was a middleaged woman in a sleeveless housedress looked at me suspiciouslypeople in business suits and nylons who come to residential hotels are usually city inspectors or lawyers threatening action on behalf of the family of a dead resident i gave my most trustworthy smile i understand you have a room here for elena warshawski what about it the woman had the heavy flat drawl of the irish south side im her niece shell be by in a couple of days to move in but i wanted to pay for a month in advance to hold the room for her the woman looked me up and down her watery gray eyes tight and ungiving at last she decided my sanctimonious honesty was the real thing she turned back to the set waited for a commercial then heaved herself ponderously out of the vinylcoated armchair i followed her out to the desk and behind it into a cubbyhole whose outstanding feature was a large lockbox the chatelaine counted my tens twice wrote out a receipt in a labored hand then put the money in a sealed envelope and slid it through a slot in the side of the box i dont know how to get into that sucker so dont think your boyfriend can come around and hold a gun on me to get your money back for you they come and empty it out twice a week no maam i agreed helplessly now ill show you the room when your aunts ready to move in she can come on over make sure she brings the receipt with her we walked up three flights of stairs slowly to accommodate my guides short panting breaths and down an uncarpeted corridor empty glass fixtures over the doors were a reminder of the windsor armss grander daysthe hall was lighted now by two naked bulbs the desk clerk stopped at the second door from the end of the left side and unlocked it whoever owned the building apparently owed marissa duncan a favor either that or hoped marissa would provide a friendly push up the local political ladder the window held all four panes the floor was clean and the narrow bed made up tidily a white plastic chest of drawers stood in the corner a deal table under the window completed the furnishings bathrooms down the hall she can lock her stuff in a chest under the bed if shes afraid of junkies key comes to me when shes not in the room and absolutely no cooking in here the wirings old dont want the place going up in smoke around us i agreed soberly and followed her back down the stairs she returned to wheel of fortune without another look at me once outside i gulped in the air in great mouthfuls i never seem to make enough money to put more than a thousand or so into a keogh plan every year what was i going to live on when i got too old to hustle clients any longer the thought of being sixtysix alone living in a little room with three plastic drawers to hold my clothes a shudder swept through me almost knocking me off balance a woman with three children in tow yanked them past mei was just a fallingdown drunk for her children to stare at on their way home i climbed heavily into the chevy and headed south the mixture of guilt and fear the windsor arms stirred in me took the edge off my pleasure in the weekend i went to the grocery saturday morning and got fruit and yogurt for the week ahead but when i picked out supplies for a pasta salad i was taking to an impromptu picnic that afternoon i bypassed my usual olive oil for a cheap brand how could i spend eleven dollars on a pint of olive oil when i couldnt scrape together enough for a thirdquarter deposit into my keogh i even bought domestic parmesan gabriella would have upbraided me sharplybut then she wouldnt have approved of my buying pasta in a store to begin with i got all three morning papers and read them carefully before going over to the park so far nobody had found any unidentified older women in the river or roaming dementedly about the streets i had to trust that furey or bobby mallory himself would call me if elena had been arrested there didnt seem to be anything else for me to do except join my pals at montrose harbor and take my aggressions out on a softball i couldnt quite shake off my depression but a gamesaving catch i made in the sixth inning cheered mei hadnt known i could still dive for a ball and come up with it the way i did at twenty over soave and grilled chicken afterwards i couldnt quite get into the ribald spirits of my friends i left while the party was still in progress so as to catch the ten oclock news elena still hadnt surfaced in a dramatic way i finally decided she was hanging out someplace with annie greensleeves and went to bed torn between disgust with her and irritation with myself id half been hoping that the gods would blight bootss party with violent thundershowers but sunday dawned with more of the bright merciless sunshine wed suffered from all summer with september drawing to a close the days were merely warm instead of sweltering but the midwest was still suffering from its worst drought in fifty years all around the city sidewalks and roadbeds had buckled and collapsed during the height of the heat wave sparks from the trains had ignited beams holding up the l platforms so that various stations were now closed more or less permanently given chicagos perennial cash shortfall i didnt expect to see those stops reopen in my lifetime i ran peppy to belmont harbor and back then made my way through the sunday papers the suntimes was the hardestive never figured out their organizational scheme and i had to read a lot more than i wanted about home decorating and fall festivals in wisconsin before stumbling on the metropolitan news when id finished the heraldstar without finding any word on elena it was time to shower and dress for my twohundredandfiftydollar barbecue i knew marissa would probably show up in silk lounging pajamas or something equally exotic but unless rosalyn fuentes had changed dramatically she would probably wear jeans it seemed to me good fundraising etiquette dictated not to upstage the guest of honor besides i didnt want to worry about drycleanonly clothes at a giant picnic i put on khaki slacks and a loosefitting olive shirt neatwould camouflage food spills and above all be comfortable for an afternoon in the sun michael arrived a little before three his black hair and dark eyes set off vividly by a navy blazer and pale blue polo shirt his normal good spirits had spilled over into exuberancehe liked big parties he liked getting together with his pals and he had enough oldfashioned dem in him to look forward to an afternoon hobnobbing with patty bigwigs i made a great show of salaams at his elegance you sure you want to arrive at bootss with me its really going to tone down your image he gave me a mock tap to the nose you make me look good warshawski thats why i want you to stay close this afternoon the slum next to the suburb thats kind of how i feel about the whole affair somehow his effervescence made me feel like being disagreeable aw come on warshawski do you really like living in the trash and graffiti secretly down deep wouldnt you live in the clean open spaces if you could afford it you stay in norwood park i reminded him only because those of us who serve and protect you from the graffiti artists have to live in the city and chicago crime is more interesting to be around than the stuff in streamwood well thats what i think too thats why i cant see myself out there i took my billfold from my handbag and stuffed it in a pants pocket along with my invitation to the partyi didnt want to lug a purse around the picnic all afternoon but you do a lot of investigations in the suburbs michael objected as we left my apartment thats why i like city crime better i turned the double locks someone bonks you on the head and steals your purse they dont sit in board rooms raving on about the niggers in chicago while theyre sliding a million or two off the top from the company i could introduce you to some muggers michael offered when we reached the street they need some prmaybe youre just the gal for them he sketched a billboard with his hands i can kind of see itclean honest crime like your granddaddy used to commit i laughed in spite of myself okay okay muggers are scum i just have a chip on my shoulder about the suburbs thats all anyway i cant afford them i wouldnt mind knowing what boots did to finance a move from division and central to streamwood michael framed my face with his hands and kissed me do me a favor vicjust dont ask him this afternoon i disengaged myself and got into the chevy dont worrymy mama brought me up to know how to act in public see you at the ball he hopped into the corvette flashed his lights at me a few times and took off toward belmont with a great screeching of rubber county picnic once we were on the kennedy i lost track of michael he could afford to do eightythe highway patrol would give him a professional wink they wouldnt extend to me he was waiting for me at the exit to the northwest tollway i had him more or less in view as we started winding our way through the hills that swell to the northwest as you leave chicago im not sure i would have found bootss spread if i hadnt been following michael at least not on the first goround the entrance which lay on a twisting unlabeled street was a discreet opening in the hedge separating the road from the gaze of the vulgar michael had been going close to sixty around the curves he braked the corvette and turned without warning so that i had to screech to a halt beyond the entrance and find a long enough flat stretch to make a u in boys will be boys he was waiting for me beside a gate that lay ten feet or so from the hole in the hedge i had turned through the shrubbery lining the drive partly concealed a tenfoothigh fence connected to the gate if you tried to breach the ramparts anyway there were a couple of sheriffs deputies to shoot you down sorry vic furey said penitently i thought the turn off was up the road another half mile shouldnt have been showing off on such a dangerous stretch when one of the deputies asked me for my invitation furey added oh dont bother hershes with me not sos youd notice it i fished in my pocket for the invitation and held it out but the guard waved me on without looking at it this assumption of my relationship to michael added to my ill humor i got back into my chevy while michael joked with the other men maneuvered around the corvette and drove away with a little spit of gravel before the road twisted i could see furey get back into the corvette but i turned a bend and found myself alone on a treelined drive whatever damage the summer had done to the corn crop it hadnt hurt boots particularly the trees here showed full graceful leaves and the grass beyond them was thick and green in the distance i could make out a stand of corn i guess if youre chairman of the county board there are ways to get water to your farm i turned another bend and found myself at the party id been hearing music blaring in the distance ever since leaving the front gate now i could see a big bandstand beyond the main house with a band in straw boaters and navy blazers going full bore on the other side of the house smoke hovered lazily over what was presumably the barbecue pit boots was sacrificing one of his own cows to rozs campaign a sheriffs deputy swinging an outsize flashlight directed me to a crowd of cars in a big yard northeast of the house maybe it was a pasturei remembered seeing one on a girl scout outing when i was eleven despite the presence of the deputiesor because of themi carefully locked the chevy furey caught up with me as i headed toward the bandstand where most of the party was gathered goddamnit vic whats making you so shirty i stopped to look at him michael i paid two hundred and fifty dollars for the doubtful pleasure of coming to this shindig im not your date nor yet the little woman whom you can tuck under your arm and hustle past the guards his goodhumored face tightened into a scowl what the hell are you talking about you treated me like a cipher out thereleaving me standing in the road and then telling the deputies to ignore me because i was your appendage i dont like it he flung up his hands in exasperation i was trying to do you a favor save you a little hassle with the boys at the gate if id known you were going to treat it like a mortal insult id of saved my breath he strode of toward the crowd i followed him slowly irritated as much with myself as with furey i didnt like the little trick stunt hed pulled at the turnoff but that didnt justify my retaliating in kind maybe frustration over elenas disappearance was making me testy or my innate bad humor or just being at a cook county political fundraiser the last time i remembered seeing boots in the news one of his bodyguards had beaten in the face of a man who had come too close to the boss after a county board meeting the man claimed boots had murdered his daughter heavy accusations although he had a long history at elginbut breaking someones nose seemed like an excessive response to insanity in fairness to boots hed picked up the guys hospital tab later onbut why did he need bodyguards at all that was only the most recent public episode meagher had been involved in he also had fingers in dozens of business ventures in the state the kinds of deals where everybody gets rich if they know which way the tax breaks are going to land meagher was a youscratchmyback kind of guyhe wouldnt be hosting rosalyns findraiser if she hadnt made some significant concessions to him it wasnt as though roz were a close pal shed been a community organizer in logan square when i was with the pd id worked with her on some seminars on law and the communitysome abcs to teach the residents their rights in arenas ranging from housing to immigration officers roz was bright energetic and a skillful politician and ambitious and that meant getting into bed with boots if she was going to rule a wider sphere than logan square i understood that and i knew it wasnt any of my business anyway so why was i getting my tail in a knot i skirted my way through the crowd at the bandstand to a bright canopy covering the refreshment arena young women in thighhigh minis were threading their way cheerfully through the throng with canapéladen trays just the costume for a feminist activist like rosalyn i snarled to myself i went up to the bar and got a rum and tonic drink in hand i jostled aimlessly through the crowd behind the refreshment tent people were gathered in a thick noisy clump loud enough to drown out the band beyond that group the throng thinned down rapidly the land there was hilly and uncultivated leading into a small wood the terrain and lack of chairs notwithstanding most of the women were wearing nylons and heels two of them had come prepared thoughthey were sitting on a blanket stretching their long tanned legs and taking innocent pleasure in their own beauty as i passed they cried out to me in an enthusiastic chorus vic ernie told us you might be here come sit down leanns pregnant and we didnt want to spend the afternoon standing in the heat i obligingly stopped for a moment if leann was pregnant it could only be a matter of months before clara started a new baby as well the two had been inseparable since childhood and now adult and married they lived in adjoining oak brook mansions were in and out of each others houses all day long to borrow clothes share a cup of coffee or entertain their children together and while claras light curls contrasted with leanns straight dark hair they looked almost indistinguishable in their anne klein shorts suits you having a good time clara asked great when is the baby due not until the end of march were only telling friends right now i smiled that included about half the people at the picnicanyone she knew by name id met them through michael furey leann was married to ernie wunsch and clara to ron grasso michaels continued tightness with the pals of his youth never ceased to astound me since leaving south chicago for college ive scarcely seen any of the people i grew up with but in addition to ernie and ron michael had seven or eight boyhood friends who got together once a month for poker went to eagle river each october to shoot deer and spent every new years eve together with their wives the pals were a major reason id never really clicked with michael since i had gone out with him though leann and clara now treated me as if i were one of the girls i asked politely about the children two each and was gladdened to learn how much they loved school how happy leann was that they were in oak brook now and didnt have to worry about the public schools an interjection from clara on what a good time theyd had themselves as little girls in norwood park but everything was so different now ron and ernie here i said idly oh yes they went off hours ago to get us something to drink but they know so many people here im sure they got waylaid or sidetracked or something i offered to bring them something but they laughed and said they didnt mind waiting leann put a wellmanicured hand on my knee you have such a good heart vic we dont want to interfere but we know youd be great for michael we were just talking about the two of you when you showed up i grinned thanks i appreciate the testimonial i pushed myself to my feet spilling my drink down my pants leg leeann looked at me anxiously i havent offended you have i ernies always on my case for saying whatever comes into my head without thinking first she reached into a large beach bag and pulled out a handful of kleenex for me i dabbed at the khaki nope trouble is michaels a sox fani just dont think we could ever work things out they gave little shrieks of protesting laughter i left to their chorus of you cant be serious vic i turned back through the crowd to replace my drink near the entrance to the tent i caught sight of ron and ernie they were deep in conversation with michael and a couple of other men their heads were drawn together so that they could talk over the noise they were so intent that they didnt notice my walking up i tapped michael on the arm he jumped and swore when he saw it was me he put an arm around me but he looked cautiously at the other men as if to see how they took my entrance hiya vic enjoying yourself im having a great time you too by the looks of it he again looked doubtfully from his companions to me were right in the middle of something now can i find you in about ten minutes so much for gestures of reconciliation i grinned savagely but tried to keep my tone light you can try i turned on my heel but ron grasso put out an arm vic honey good to see you dont mind furey here he got out on the wrong side of bed today no business is more important than a beautiful lady mickey and nothings more dangerous than keeping one of them waiting the other men laughed politely but michael looked at me seriously maybe he was still pissed on the other hand he knows that kind of joke rubs me the wrong way so maybe he was trying in turn for conciliation i was barely willing to give him the benefit of the doubt ron introduced me to the two strangersluis schmidt and carl martinez also in construction and supporters of rosalyns campaign vics an old friend of rosalyns arent you ron supplied i nodded we used to work together in logan square you were an organizer schmidt asked i was a lawyer i used to help out on legal issuesimmigration housing that kind of thing im a detective now detective huh like sergeant furey here that was schmidt a short stocky man with arms the size of sewer pipes straining his jacket sleeves they were just interested enough to require an answer i work for myself kind of the magnum pi of chicago vic looks into fraud cases ron put in she has quite a track record keeps ernie and me on the straight and narrow let me tell you everyone laughed politely his comment seemed so unanswerable that i didnt try i ran into leann and clara behind the tent i said instead they thought you guys were bringing them something to drink ernie hit his forehead mind like cement after pouring it all these years ill take care of the girls ronniewhy dont you guys wait for me here he took my arm and hustled me away to the refreshment tent buy you something vic no thanks im heading back to the city soon he looked at me seriously eyes dark in a thin weatherbeaten face dont take mickey too seriously hes got a lot on his mind i nodded solemnly i know that ernie and i think this is a good time to leave him alone let him get it sorted out could you at least wait until after dinnergo talk to the girls for a while he was hoping id take their drinks to them i smiled gently sorry ernie i know leann would love to see you for a few minutes before you plunge back into it with the boys shes sitting around back of here with clara okay vic okay he shoved his way to the front of the line something in the set of his shoulders told me he was wondering what the hell mickey saw in me speaking in tongues on my way toward the parking pasture i saw marissa standing near the back entrance to bootss house she was laughing heartily at some remark of the middleaged man talking to her he looked vaguely familiar but i couldnt place him maybe it was just the avid look he was giving marissa i recognizedwith her head thrown back the décolletage of her peach dress sprang into dramatic relief before returning to town id let her know id done my duty by showing up and that i hadnt laid tales of housing woes on any sensitive ears i trotted up the path to the house seen up close her companion was older than id thought perhaps over sixty with a lot of distinguished gray in his dark hair tanned and still muscular he bore his years gracefully probably was wealthy too if his camelhair jacket and texas boots were any sign a good haul for marissa great party marissathanks for inviting me she hadnt seen me come up the smile on her dark face dimmed briefly then glowed again hi vic glad you could make it she didnt really look at mei should have just let well enough alone in fact i should have followed my original impulse and stayed in chicago i didnt want to see any of these people and it was abundantly clear that none of them wanted to see me bye marissa thanks for letting me participate in this wonderful civic enterprise just wanted to let you know i didnt discuss housing with anyone at that she did look at me you leaving vic why not stay until after the speeches i know rosalyn would love to have a chance to see you again my party smile was wearing thin shes got a thousand palms to press this afternoon ill give her a call at campaign headquarters the man in camel hair looked at his watch theyre talking right nowdown around the other side where the pit is wont take more than fifteen minutesboots promised me he wouldnt go gassing on forevercome along i should put in an appearance anyway he held out a wellgroomed hand and flashed a bright white smile ralph macdonald while i recited my name i shook his hand appreciativelyits not often i touch flesh worth several billion dollars as soon as hed said his name i knew where id seen the facein the paper a zillion times or so as ground was broken for this or that project he was financing or as he presented a gargantuan check to the symphony my only question was what he was doing hereid kind of assumed he was a republican when i said as much marissa looked at me with cold disapproval but macdonald laughed boots and i go backway back the boyd never forgive me if i voted republican and he wont forgive me now unless i listen to him blow smoke rings for a while marissa he held out his left arm andvic is it he crooked the right who knows he might like to hear about some of my casesmaybe he needed a few million dollars worth of investigations and didnt even realize it not only that it would make marissa steamin itself a good reason to tag along i took his arm and let him guide me toward the pit the barbecue had been installed on the far side of the house from the refreshment tent a goodsized crowd was milling around the thick pungent smokei couldnt see the poor dead cow through the throng but assumed she was roasting away people were standing in an informal horseshoe around a small platformreally a large tree stump with a few boards nailed to itwhere boots stood with his left arm around rozs shoulders a tall man boots has become majestic in late middle agesilver hair swept in leonine waves from his craggy face broad shoulders usually encased in buckskin and a deep hearty laugh his head was tilted back now as he roared in amusement it was his trademark look the pose he affected for campaign posters but even a nonbeliever like me found his laugh infectious and i didnt know what the joke was the crowd near him included men and women of all ages and races after boots stopped laughing rosalyn called out something in spanish and got a goodnatured hand as id expected she was in faded jeans her concession to the party a crisp white shirt with a mexican string tie she looked just as she used to in logan square her bronze skin clear her eyes bright maybe i was too pessimisticmaybe she was smart enough to figure out how to run with the regular dems and keep her own agenda intact rosalyn jumped down from a crate shed been perched on and disappeared from viewshes not much over five feet tall as she and boots began pressing hands and exchanging quips marissa pulled macdonald away from me i smiled to myself it had to be the first time id ever made marissa downright jealous and all for a billionaire i didnt have any interest in at least not much interest farther back from them i caught sight of the two his panic contractors whod been talking to michael and the boys they were watching me narrowly when they saw me looking at them they smiled guardedly i sketched a wave and thought maybe the moment had finally come when i could get back to chicago before i could make an escape though rosalyn and boots materialized near me rosalyn caught sight of me and clapped her hands vic how wonderful to see you i was ecstatic when i heard you might be here she hugged me enthusiastically then turned to present me to boots vic warshawski she used to work for you boots in the public defenders office but youre working for yourself now arent you they tell me as an investigator i felt like a child prodigy being paraded around for the neighbors i managed to mumble a species of response what kind of investigator vic boots poured his geniality over me private detective primarily financial investigations boots gave his legendary laugh and shook my hand im sorry the county lost you vicwe dont do enough to keep our good people but i hope your own work is successful thank you sir i said primly good luck on the campaign trail roz boots suddenly caught sight of ralph macdonald genuine pleasure warmed his smile mac you old soandso knew your contribution would double if i didnt see your shining face huh boots stretched a hand over my head to smack macdonalds shoulder and of course you found marissa duncanyou always could pick out the best in show couldnt you i ducked away from the arm and the hearty bonhomie marissas face was frozen in the mannequin expression most women assume when theyre getting the wrong kind of compliment reflexively she put a hand to pull the collar ends of her dress together i even found it in me to feel a little sorry for her as i slid away from her i saw rosalyn ahead of me talking to schmidt and martinez to my surprise they were gesturing toward me rosalyn turned her head saw me looking and flashed a smile the stainlesssteel front tooth shed acquired in her povertyridden childhood glinted briefly she spoke earnestly to the contractors then turned once more to me she made extravagant signs for me to join her making a face to myself i shouldered my way through the eager hands stretched out to her warshawski the boys and i were talking about you just now youve met little luis huh hes my cousin my mothers sister married a german down in mexico city and lived to be sorry ever after you know those old love stories she laughed gaily we could use your help warshawski youve got my vote roz you know that more than that though before she could continue boots came up with macdonald in tow he flashed a perfunctory smile at me and dragged roz off to confer in the house wait for me huh gringa ill see you in the porch swingoh in an hour she shouted hoarsely over her shoulder i was left glaring at her back because im a woman in a mans business people think im tough but a truly tough and decisive person would have headed back to town at that point instead i felt the tired old tentacles of responsibility drape themselves around me lotty herschel tells me it comes of being the only child of parents i had to look after during painful illnesses she thinks a few years with a good analyst would enable me to just say no when someone shouts i need you vic perhaps shes rightthe sour thought of my parents conjured by her remembered words mingled with the smell of roasting beef and nauseated me for a moment i felt myself identifying with the dead animalcaught around by people who fed it only to smash its head in with a mallet i didnt think i could eat any of it when the head barbecuer suddenly sang out that they were ready to start carving i hunched my shoulders and left i circled the house to find the porch swing rosalyn had mentioned what boots treated as the back of the house bad actually been designed as the main entrance when the place was built a hundred years ago or so a set of shallow steps led to a colonnaded veranda and a pair of doors inlaid with opaque etched glass the porch faced a flower bed and a small ornamental pond it was a peaceful spot the band and the crowd sounds still reached me but no one else had strayed this far from the action i strolled over to the pond and peered into it clouds turned rosy by the setting sun made the surface of the water shimmer a silvery blue a cluster of goldfish swam over to beg for bread i glared at them everyone else in this country has a fin stuck outwhy should you guys be any different i just dont have any slush left today i felt someone come up behind me and turned as michael put an arm around my shoulders i removed it and backed away a few paces michael whats going on with you today are you peeved because i wanted to drive myself is that why you pulled that number on me at the gate and again with your pals back there you cant muscle me aside and then come caress me back into good humor im sorry he said simply i didnt mean it like that ron and ernie introduced me to those two guysschmidt and martinez theyre breaking into construction just getting a few good jobs and their work sites are being vandalized the boys thought they could use some free police advice when you came up we were in the middle of it i was afraid you were still mad at me and i didnt know how to handle it and not let them think i wasnt listening to them either so i blew it can you still talk to me i hunched a shoulder impatiently the trouble is michael you belong to a crowd where the girls sit on a blanket waiting for the boys to finish talking business and bring them drinks i like leann and clara but theyll never be good friends of mineits not the way i think or act or live oror anything i think that stylethe segregated way you and ernie and ron workits too much part of you i dont see how you and i ever can move along together he was quiet for a few minutes while he thought it over maybe youre right he said reluctantly i mean my mother kept house and hung out with her friends and my dad had his bowling club i never saw them do anything togethereven church it was always her taking the kids to mass while he slept it off on sunday mornings i guess it was a mistake trying to see you at a function like this the sun had set but i could see his smile flash briefly worried not cocky the surface of the pond turned black behind us the house loomed as a ghostly galleon it was michaels ability to think about himself that set him apart from his pals there was a time when it might have seemed worth the effort to work things out with someone who was willing to stop and think about it but im thirtyseven now and no longer seem able to put the energy into dubious undertakings before i could make up my mind what i wanted to say roz whirled up i hadnt expected to see herat a function like this shed have so many demands on her time that a desire to meet with me could easily fade from her mind schmidt and martinez were with her vic her voice had faded to a hoarse whisper after a long day of talking but it vibrated with her usual energy thank goodness you waited for me can we grab a few minutes on the porch i grunted unenthusiastically schmidt and martinez were greeting michael in lowvoiced seriousness i introduced him to rosalyn she shook his hand perfunctorily and hustled me across the yard the lawn was smoothly trimmed even at the pace she set we kept our footing in the dark the porch was outlined by light coming from the other side of the opaque doors i could see the swing and rosalyns shape when she settled in it but her face was in too much shadow for me to make out her expression i sat on the top of the shallow steps my back against the pillar and waited for her to speak on the lawn behind us i could make out the shapes of michael and the two contractors as dark splotches from the other end of the house the band was revving up to a more feverish pitch the increased volume and the noise of laughter drifted to us if i win the election im finally going to be in a position to really help my people rosalyn said at last youve already done a great deal no soap tonight vic i dont have time or energy for pats on the back im setting my sights high getting boots to endorse meit was difficult but necessary you do understand that i nodded but she couldnt see that so i gave an affirmative grunt anyway i did understand it this election is just the first step im aiming for congress and i want to be in a position for a cabinet post if the democrats win in eight or twelve years i grunted again the specific shape of her ambition was interesting but id always known she had the ability and the drive to reach for the top in eight or twelve years maybe the country would even be ready for a hispanic woman vice president she must have been born in mexico thoughthat was why she was thinking only of the cabinet your advice would always be valuable to me i had to strain to hear her her voice had gotten so hoarse thanks for the testimonial roz some peoplemy cousinthink you might do something to hurt me but i told him you would never do such a thing i couldnt begin to fathom what she might be talking about and said as much she didnt answer right away and when she finally did i got the impression shed chosen her words with great care because im working with boots anyone who knows you knows youve always opposed everything he stands for not everything i said just the stuff i know about anyway your cousin doesnt know me we just met this afternoon he knows about you she persisted in her raw voice youve done a lot of significant work one way and another people who are connected around town hear your name i dont need soap any more than you do roz i havent said or done anything to make anyone think id stand in your way hell i even paid twofifty to support your campaign what does your cousin imagine im doing it may be chicken feed to a contractor but thats a big outlay for mei wouldnt do it frivolously she put her hand on mine i appreciate you coming out for me i know it took a lot for you to do both the money and the function she gave a throaty chuckle ive had to swallow a few things too to be herethe sidelong looks from the party regulars i know what theyre thinkingboots is getting a piece of spanish ass and giving her a spot on the ticket as payment so what is schmidt worried about that im from the legion of decency and im going to cook up a sex scandal im really offended roz offended by the thought and by you thinking you had to sound me out over it her callused fingers gripped mine no no vic dont take it that way luis is my little cousin my little brother almost the way he worries about me some men he was talking to told him how negative you are to boots and he got worried on my behalf i told him id talk to you thats all gringa boots has his flaws after all im not blind to them but i can use him i didnt know if i was hearing the truth or not maybe she was sleeping with boots for the good of the hispanic communitythere was very little roz wouldnt do to help her people it would turn my stomach but i didnt really care at any rate prolonging the conversation wasnt going to buy me a copy of her thoughts i dont like you tying your wagon to bootss star but i cant afford to be pickyim selfemployed and its a pretty small operation and theres certainly something to be said for letting boots do your dirty work pulling the plug on abortions at cook county the way he did he owes the women in this town somethingwhy shouldnt it be you roz gave a husky laugh i knew i could count on you vic she summoned enough of her voice to call her cousin hey luis come on we gotta go get a drink and shake a few more hands luis ambled over to the porch with michael carl martinez apparently had taken off you get everything settled roz it didnt sound like a casual question coming up roses you worry too much you knowyoure just like your mama that way we stood up roz hugged me i may call you yet warshawski get you to stuff envelopes or hold my hand if i freak sure roz whatever you want i followed her down the shallow steps when luis had hustled her around the side of the house furey took my arm let me meet you back at your place vic get things talked out i dont want to have matters go completely bust between us without at least saying goodbye in a friendly way i was staring at the corner of the house where roz had disappeared still trying to figure out what the hell that whole conversation had been about i was so busy with my thoughts that i found id agreed with furey without even realizing it a devoted mother it was dark when i pulled up behind michaels silver corvette on racine id expected to be home long ahead of himhed run into ron and ernie after seeing me into my car when i pulled out they were still talking however relying on superior police knowledge of city routesand professional courtesy from the traffic copshe managed to beat me he climbed out of the corvette when he saw me behind him and came over to me vic this is not destined to be our best day a call came in on the radio while i was driving over im not supposed to be on duty until tomorrow morning but uncle bobby doesnt care much about official rosters when theres been a triple homicide sorry ill give you a call tomorrow okay i tried to muster an appropriate expression of sorrow but i was just as happy to be on my own tonight the idea of a nice soak in the tub without having to be pleasant to an outsider had been tantalizing me during the long drive home i barely waited to wave goodbye before heading up the walk to the front door and the shattering of my dreams of solitude elena was parked on the firstfloor landing her duffel bag at her feet next to her sat a young black woman even in the dim hall light i could see she was dressed with a stylishness that highlighted elenas worn face and bedraggled clothes when i saw them my guilty worries about my aunt vanished my stomach knotted and i felt a cowardly impulse to shut the door and head back to streamwood elena sprang jerkily to her feet and opened her arms in a wide meaningless gesture victoria sweetie your nice neighbor let us in so we wouldnt have to wait for you in the lobby the old gentleman hes a real gem you dont find too many as chivalrous as him today he told us you hadnt left town so i figured wed just wait for you stead of coming back later hi elena i said weakly i found a room for you over on kenmore oh vicki victoria i mean familys family and i knew you wouldnt let me down this here is cerise shes the daughter of a buddy of mine from the indiana arms cerise meet my niece victoria finest niece a woman could ever want if anyone can help you she will cerise held out a slim manicured hand pleased to meet you her voice was almost inaudible i cant put her up elena i said grimly no amount of sweettalking is going to make me turn my place into a way station for victims of wednesday nights fire elena pursed her lips in exaggerated hurt no way sweetie i wouldnt dream of it cerise here needs a detective when i heard her story i knew you were just the gal for her i wanted to pull my hair out by the roots or scream or anything extreme that would keep me from pounding my aunt before i could formulate a nonviolent response the door to onenorth opened and the banker popped out again oh its you he said disagreeably i might have known well this time i am calling the cops i saw your pimp pull off just now in that silver corvette what are theseyour drug clients what do you do all day long at work i snapped spy on the clerks to see whos taking five minutes too long at her coffee break you must be one of the most popular guys around if all you do is peer over peoples shoulders into their business its my business if you conduct your sleazy affairs at all hours no no honey my aunt popped up shes a detective a professional weve come to consult her on business you dont want to frown in that angry wayits just as important for a man to keep his looks these days as it is for a girl and youll get terrible wrinkles around your eyes if you keep scowling like that and youve got very nice eyes elena just be quiet will you we can discuss cerises problem upstairs take her on up okay i wasnt going to resolve anything with the guy if elena was mediating elena protested hurt that she was just trying to help me get along better with my neighbors but she finally agreed to start upstairs i looked at the banker debating whether i should say something conciliatoryits not a great idea to have a vendetta with a neighbor in a sixunit building be sure to give the cops the corvettes plates when you call will you i told him the fellow who drives it is a detective with the central districts violent crimes unit the beat guysll enjoy razzing him about getting accused of being a pimp if you didnt catch the plate its fureousthats fureous some days im just more conciliatory than others he scowled at me with dark angry eyes trying to decide whether i was bluffing hearing the license plate spelled out apparently made him decide i wasnt he stalked back into his apartment and slammed the door from the south unit i could hear peppys insistent whimpering as she begged to join in the fray i ran up the stairs two at a time to avoid mr contrerass predictable harangue i ushered elena and cerise into my apartment can i get you something to drink coffee soda ill take a beer cerise said sorry i dont have beer coffee milk or juice or i have seltzer and some coke cerise settled on a coke while elena asked for some of that wonderful coffee like my ma used to make i served up the remains of the pasta salad id taken to yesterdays picnic and heated a couple of rolls neither woman seemed to have eaten much recently beyond cerises asking what the queer white things in the salad were and accepting calamari with a wise nod they both ate rapidly without speaking so whats the problem that needs a detective i asked when theyd finished cerise looked at elena asking her to speak for her its her baby my aunt said in the bright light of my living room i could see cerise wasnt as old as her sophisticated clothes had made her look downstairs she might have been twenty but any legitimate bar would card her yes i said as encouragingly as possible we think she died in the fire elena said died in the fire i repeated stupidly at the indiana arms my aunt said sharply dont gape there like a carp vicki you must remember it yes butyou think dont you know id spoken to cerise she shook her head and again turned to elena my aunt spoke briskly using wild hand motions and pursing her lips periodically to underscore a dramatic point the whole point of an sro vicki is that its single resident occupancy single means no one else in the room with you not even a cockroach if you get my drift and certainly no babies and heres cerise trying to get her life together and she has the sweetest little baby you ever saw fourteen months old and just starting to toddle and whats she supposed to do with it while shes out hunting for work elena paused as if waiting for an answer but i didnt try to interrupt the flow so she leaves it with her ma same as you would if it was you if gabriella was still alive i mean being as how she always wanted the best for you and cerises ma is just the same nothing too good for cerise and shell risk getting thrown right out on her rear endelena smacked her own behind to emphasize the pointif itd help cerise here make a decent life for the baby when i didnt say anything she repeated her last point sharply great i managed elena beamed so her ma is kind of a pal of mine weve knocked back a few beers together not that i drink you understand nor does she just a few beers now and then in a sociable kind of way she stared at me defiantly but i didnt challenge the statement so zerlinathats cerises mais watching the baby while cerise is out of town wednesday night when we have the fire now zerlinas vanishedpoofand poor cerise cant find out if her dear little baby made it out of the building alive she slapped her hands together for effect and watched me expectantly all i could think was that it was sunday night almost four days since the firewhy was cerise surfacing only now so i told her youd help elena prompted me impatiently help do what well vickivictoriashe needs to find the poor little thing shes afraid itll get her ma in trouble if she goes to the police you know for keeping a baby in the room maybe shed never be able to find another place i said you were just the person for her why has it taken this long for cerise to miss the baby i demanded i been out of town it was cerises first contribution to the conversation since shed asked about the calamari otis he the babys father he took me up to the dells we trying to work things out you know i want him to marry me and make a home for me and katterina and he dont want to do it so he promised me a vacation i rubbed my forehead trying to push the more harrowing images of her life out of my brain and you just got back today i went to the hotel she burst out i went straight there people say i dont love katterina leaving her with my mother and all but i do i just cant look after her and have my own life too not twentyfour hours a day i cant even get a job if i got to stay with her all the time but i went there first thing otis dropped me there you can ask him that was yesterday and i saw about the fire and i hunted all over for my mama and finally i found elena this afternoon but she dont know where mama is except maybe in the hospital where they took the people who was hurt in the fire maybe the fire fighters found katterina i offered maybe shes with dcfs have you tried calling them i cant call them they just want to take my baby from me say im an unfit mother she started to cry her long red earrings bobbing into her shoulders there there elena put a soothing arm around her shoulders thats what we need you for vicki we need someone who knows how to talk to all these people who can handle it without getting cerise or zerlina in trouble it didnt sound to me as though there was much hope that katterina had made it through the fire if a baby had been found there surely the newspapers would have trumpeted it im sorry i said helplessly to cerise sorry about katterina but you really are the best person to go to the police and to dcfsyoure her mother youre the only one with a right to ask questions she kept crying without looking up at me i tried explaining that the police were not going to care that zerlina had had a baby in the room with her that they couldnt keep her from renting a room ever again but it washed over both cerise and elena like the tide i thought of the woman id talked to at the emergency housing bureau the despair shed shared with the other people in the room the few rooms and the many people to fill them if you were that helpless the police might become another bureaucratic menace ready to use their power to keep you out of a place to live okay i finally said ill make some calls for you tomorrow elena took her hand from cerises shoulder and came over to where i was sitting in the armchair thats my girl i knew i could count on you i knew you was too much your mas daughter to say no to a fellow human being in trouble right i agreed sourly i looked at the clock on the bookshelves it was ten even if i sent elena over to the windsor arms this late she couldnt take cerise with her gritting my teeth i pulled out the sofa bed dug around in my drawers for a long tshirt for cerise to sleep in and locked myself in my bedroom the lady is indisposed i woke up early the next morning my dreams had been of crying babies and fires id jerked awake twice feeling suffocated by flames when i got out of bed it was again with the feeling that someone had dumped a load of gravel in my head this time without bothering to crush it too fine it was only six cerise and elena were still asleep on the sofa bed cerise lying spreadeagled on her stomach elena on her back snoring i felt like a captive in my own home unable to get to my books or television but if i woke them it would be worse i shut the door softly put on my jeans and went down the back stairs it was too early to wake up mr contreras to take the dog for a run and even though exercise may be the best cure for a sandy head running sounded like the last thing i was in the mood for i walked the half mile to the belmont diner open twentyfour hours a day and had the cholesterol special pancakes with butter and a big order of bacon i lingered as long as i could following the saga of the search for the bears new stadium through all three papers even taking in every word on the latest zoning scandal to beset the mayors chief supporters its boring to read about zoning scandals because their revelation never has any impact on election results so i usually skip them around eight i finally trudged back to my apartment life was stirring on racine avenue as people headed for work when i got to my building the banker was leaving for the day his thick brown hair lacquered to his head hi i said brightly as we passed just getting off the night shift have a good day he pretended not to hear me crossing to the east side of the street as i spoke try to be neighborly and you only get stiffed for your pains like lbj or the duke of wellington elena could sleep anywhere anytime when i opened the kitchen door i could hear her snores oozing from the living room i also caught my favorite smell cigarette smoke cerise was at the diningroom table staring moodily at nothing chainsmoking good morning i said as politely as i could i know youre really upset about your baby but please dont smoke in here she shot me a hostile look but stubbed her cigarette out in the saucer shed been using i took it to the kitchen and tried to scrub the tobacco stains from it after a few minutes she followed me in and slumped herself at the table i offered her breakfast but she wanted only coffee i put water on to boil and got the beans out of the freezer what floor did your mother live on she looked at me blankly and rubbed her bare arms at the indiana arms ill probably need that information if someone is going to search for katterina fifth floor she answered after another long pause five twentytwo it was hard on her on account of the elevator didnt work but she couldnt get nothing lower down when did you leave the baby with your mother again she stared at me but this time i thought there was an element of calculation in her gaze we did it wednesday before we left town she rubbed her arms some more its too cold in here i need to smoke it felt warm to me but i was dressed she was still in the outsized tshirt id lent her i went into my bedroom and got a jacket she put it on but continued to rub her arms i ground the beans and poured boiling water through them what time wednesday you trying to say i saw the fire and shouldnta left my baby her tone was sullen but her eyes were still watchful i poured more water into the beans and tried to muster some empathy her baby was almost certainly dead she was with a stranger and a white woman at that she was terrified of the institutions of law and society and i was conversant with them so to her i was part of them she wanted to smoke and i wouldnt let her thinking about all this didnt make me feel like running over to embrace her but it did help me stifle the more extreme expressions of impatience someone set that fire i said carefully someone hurt your mother and may have hurt your baby if you were there wednesday night you might have seen the arsonist maybe heor sheor theywere hanging around if you saw someone we could give the police a description something to start an investigation with she shook her head violently i didnt see no one we go there at three in the afternoon we give katterina to my mama we leave for wisconsin okay okay i poured out coffee for her why are these questions upsetting you so much she was trembling she took the mug with both hands to steady it you acting like i did something bad like it be my fault my babys hurt no cerise not at all im really sorry if thats how i sounded i dont mean that at all i tried to smile im a detective you know i ask questions for a living its a hard habit to break she buried her face in the mug and didnt answer me i gave it up and went into my bedroom the bed was still unmade my running clothes had fallen on the floor at the end when id kicked the covers off in the night untangling my sweats from the bedclothes i stuffed them into the closet and pulled the covers back up onto the bed the room wasnt exactly ready for house beautiful but it was all the housekeeping i was in the humor for i lay on the bed and tried to remember the name of the insurance man id met at the indiana arms on thursday it was a bird that had struck me particularly at the time because his brighteyed curiosity had made him seem birdlike i shut my eyes and let my mind drift robin that was it i couldnt delve the last name from my memory hole but robin would get me to him i pulled the phone from the bedside table and put it on my stomach to dial when the ajax operator connected me with the arson and fraud division i asked the cheery receptionist for robin hes right hereill put him on for you the phone banged in my earshe must have dropped the receiverthen i got a tenor robin bessinger here bessinger of course robin its v i warshawski i met you at the indiana arms last week when you were digging through the rubble there vi you the detective uhhuh i sat up and put the phone back on the bedside table you said if anybodys been killed the police would have had a homicide investigation set up so i assume everybody was rescued as far as i know id forgotten how cautious he was a bird making sure the worm wasnt really a rifle barrel you know anything to the contrary a baby was staying there wednesday night staying with its grandmother on the fifth floor he started to interrupt and i said hastily i know i know against the rules the grandmother has disappearedmaybe one of the smoke victimsso i dont know if they found the baby or not a baby in there sweet jesus no i dont know anything about it but ill call someone at the police and get back to you was it your friend the one you said had been burned out id forgotten referring to elena as my friend no not her the grandmother was sort of a friend of hers though and the mother just got back into town and found her little girl and her own mama both missing shes pretty distraught or hostile or fried okay he fumbled around for a moment im just real sorry ill call you back in a couple of minutes i gave him my phone number and hung up i looked distastefully at my bedroom because im there only to sleep i dont usually pay much attention to it the queensize bed takes up a good deal of the available space since the closet is large i keep the dresser in there to have enough room to walk around but it still makes me feel hemmed in to spend much time there during the day more than ever i resented elenas snoring presence down the hall pinning me to one room in my own home i paced the short distance from the door to the head of the bed a few times but i kept banging my shin on the bedstead i couldnt possibly practice my singing in these quarters especially not with cerise in the kitchen finally i lay on the floor between the window and the bed and did leg lifts after forty or so with each leg robin called back he sounded subdued v i warshawski he stumbled a bit on my last name iuh ive been talking with the police they say the fire department didnt bring out any children from that place last week are you sure the baby was in there i hesitated reasonably sure i cant swear to it though because i dont know any of the people involved theyre going to send a team out to comb the rubble to see if they can find any well any remains theyd like you to be available to come downtown to meet with them though i promised to check in with my answering service every hour if i left my apartment slowly hanging up the phone i wondered what to say to cerise as i walked to the door elena pounded on the other side yoohoo vicki victoria i mean poor little cerise isnt feeling too hot can you come out and help me settle her upset tummy poor little cerise had vomited all over the kitchen table elena at her brightest as she enjoyed the drama wiped her face with a damp towel while i cleaned up the mess its the shock you know my aunt cooed shes worried sick about her baby i looked at the younger woman narrowly she was sick ail right but i was beginning to think a little more than shock underlay her behavior i think well have a doctor take a look at her i said help me get her dressed and down to my car no doctor cerise said thickly im not seeing no doctor yes you are i snapped this isnt a onewoman social agency you just threw up all over my kitchen and im not spending the day nursing you no doctor no doctor cerise screamed she really doesnt want to go vicki elena stagewhispered at me i can see she doesnt want to go i said brittlely just put her clothes on while i hold her arms still and please dont call me vicki its not a name i care for much i know i know sweetie elena promised hastily it keeps slipping my mind since gabriella had driven home the point forcefully to elena all through my childhoodi didnt name her for victor emmanuel to have people talk to her as though she were a silly ingenuei didnt see how elena could have forgotten but this wasnt the time to argue the point dressing cerise made me glad i hadnt chosen nursing in a mental hospital as my career she fought against my hold screaming and thrashing around in the kitchen chair im in good shape but she strained my muscles to the utmost at one point she raked open my left arm with a long fingernail i somehow managed to hang on to her elena worked with an ineffectuality that brought me close to the screaming point myself she put cerises underpants on backwards and only managed to slide her skirt on after a good fifteen minutes of work just do her shoes i panted she can wear the tshirt on top my keys are in the living room i left them on the coffee table unlock the dead bolts i tried to explain which key worked which lock but gave it up as elena grew more confused by some miracle she managed to undo them in less than an hour cerise had stopped fighting me by then she hunched limply over the kitchen table sobbing to herself and offered no resistance as i escorted her out the door i took the keys from elena youd best get your bag im going to drop you off at your new place as soon as cerise has seen the doctor elena tried to put up a fight of her own but i was past any feelings of guilt i kept cerise propped up against the wall and repeated my demand my aunt finally shuffled back into my apartment after an absence long enough that i wondered if she was back at the black label she came out again shed taken a shower her graying hair hung around her head in damp ringlets but her makeup was complete and for once on target the violet nightgown still hung out the side of the duffel bag she let it trail along the floor as she followed me down the stairs a little help from my friends lotty herschels storefront clinic is about three miles from my apartment near the corner of damen and irving park during the short drive cerise threw up again in the backseat then started shivering uncontrollably i thought i might kill elena who knelt on the front seat watching cerise and giving me minutebyminute updates on what she was doing i jerked the car to a stop next to a fireplug in front of the clinic and jogged inside the small waiting room painted to look like the african veldt was packed with the usual assortment of wailing infants and squabbling children mrs coltrain was keeping order handling the phone and typing records with her usual calm i sometimes suggest to lotty that she found mrs coltrain in a catalog offering to supply offices with oldfashioned grandmothersnot only does she have nine grandchildren but she wears her silvery hair in a bun miss warshawski she beamed at me good to see you do you need to talk to dr herschel rather urgently i have a young woman in my car whos been throwing up and seems now to be going into shock can you ask lotty if shed see her now if i brought her in or if i should take her to the hospital mrs coltrain refused to call lotty or me by our first nameswe gave up urging them on her long ago she relayed my message to carol alvarado the clinic nurse and after a couple of minutes carol came out to help me bring cerise in cerises skin was cold it felt thick like wet plastic not at all like living tissue she was conscious enough to walk if we supported her but her breathing was shallow and her eyes were rolling a murmur of resentment swelled around us as we brought cerise past the waiting room into the examining areapeople whove been waiting an hour or more for the doctor dont appreciate line jumpers carol got cerise onto a table and wrapped her in a blanket lotty swept in a few minutes later what are you bringing me now vic she didnt wait for an answer but went straight to cerise i told her what little i knew about the young woman suddenly this morning she started complaining about feeling cold then she started throwing up i dont know if it was pregnancy or drugs or some combination but i didnt feel like dealing with her on my own lotty grunted and pulled back cerises eyelids shes going to be here for a while why dont you come back in a few hours she turned to carol with a request for a medication in other words it was up to me to find out what to do with her when lotty finished treating her not that id expected lotty to do it but somehow id managed to avoid thinking about cerises future my shoulders sagging i walked on heavy feet back to the car id forgotten cerises eruption but the smell was a pungent reminder i returned to the clinic and got some wet rags and a bottle of disinfectant from mrs coltrain all the time i was cleaning the backseat elena kept chirping questions about cerise i dont know i said wearily as i finally turned the engine on i dont know whats wrong with her or what the doctor will do or if she has to go to the hospital ill find all that out when i go back at noon and ill let you know elena put a tremulous hand on my arm its only because her mother and me are pals vickivictoria itd be the same if it was you in trouble and i took you to zerlina shed feel responsible for you because of me dont you see i took my right hand off the wheel to pat her thin veined fingers sure elena i understand your good heart does you credit we drove in silence for a while then i thought of something whats zerlinas last name her last name sweetie why do you care i want to find her if shes in the hospital i cant go to the reception desk at michael reese and ask for her by her first name they dont keep track of patients that way if she got hurt in the fire sweetie i dont know if shed be up to seeing you not up to seeing me i tried to keep my tone conversational but an overlay of a snarl came through anyway if you and cerise want me to do anything more about the baby shed damned well better be up to seeing me and you should do your best to help me find her language victoria elena said reprovingly talking dirty isnt going to solve your problems and dancing around the mulberry bush on this one isnt going to solve yours i snapped tell me her last name or kiss any help from me goodbye when you scrunch up your face like that you look just like your grandmother the last few months i was living with her i turned north onto kenmore and pulled up in front of the windsor arms my poor grandmother if shed had a stronger personality she would have booted elena out on her rump long before her thirtieth birthday instead except for brief forays my aunt lived with her until she died your own family is always the last to appreciate you i said turning off the engine now why dont you quit screwing around and tell me zerlinas last name elena looked at me craftily is this the new hotel sweetie youre an angel to go to so much trouble for me no no dont you go carrying that heavy bag youre young you need to save your back i took the duffel bag from her and escorted her into the lobby she fluttered off to the lounge area to talk to some of the residents while i dug in my handbag for the room receipt the concierge coming from some basement recess when i tapped the desk bell clearly remembered me but insisted on getting the receipt before shed let elena have the room for a nervestraining moment i was afraid id stuffed it in my skirt pocket on friday but finally found it stuck in the pages of my pocket diary i had intended to beard elena in her room and force zerlinas surname from her but was thwarted by the conciergethis was a singleresident hotel and visitors were not permitted in the guest rooms elena blew me a kiss with a promise to get back in touch with me and you will let me know what happens to poor cerise wont you sweetheart i forced a glittering smile to my face how am i to do that elenaby smoke signal you can leave a message for me at the desk cant she do that honey she added to the concierge i suppose the woman said grudgingly as long as you dont make a habit of it as they disappeared up the echoing stairwell i could hear elena explaining that i was the smartest sweetest niece a woman could ever hope to have i ground my teeth and acknowledged defeat the pay phone for residents was in the lounge with the tv i didnt want to compete with the price is right i walked up kenmore looking for another phone after a twoblock circuit i decided id be better off going back to my apartment the super had finally gotten around to putting up the bankers nameplate i stopped to look at itvincent bottone i felt vaguely affronted that an italian could be treating me so rudelydidnt he know that we were compatriots i glanced at my own nameplatesince my last name was warshawski maybe he hadnt been able to guess id have to try speaking to him in italian and see if that softened him or i realized as i unlocked my apartment door give me a chance to show him up robin bessinger was in a meeting but hed left word with the receptionist to get him if i called i tucked the phone under my ear while i waited and yanked the sheets from the sofa bed i was just stuffing the mattress back into the sofa frame when robin came on the line ms warshawski robin bessinger its vic i interrupted him oh vic ive been wondering what those initials stood for lookthe lab says there isnt any trace of a babys body in the debris on the other hand if it got caught in the fiercest part of the blaze it might have been incinerated so theyve taken samples of the ashes and will get them analyzed whichll take a few days but roland montgomeryhes with the bomb and arson squad would like to talk to you find out firsthand why you think the child was in there i wasnt sure i did think katterina had been in the indiana arms at this point i wasnt sure i believed cerise had a baby or even a mother but i couldnt express any of this to robin the babys mother told me i said where does montgomery want me to meet him can you make it at three in his office central district at eleventh street he hesitated for a moment id like to sit in if you dont mind a death would affect our insured dominic assuevo will be there from the office of fire investigation not at all i said politely i didnt know montgomery but id met assuevo a couple of years ago when my old apartment had been torched he was a pal of bobby mallorys and was inclined to look on me suspiciously by extension before we hung up i asked robin if he knew zerlinas last name he hadnt been given a list of the smoke inhalation victims but promised me hed get it from dominic at our meeting this afternoon i finished tidying up the sofa bed then took the sheets down to the washing machine in the basement im not normally so obsessive about cleanliness but i wanted to get all traces of ceriseand elenaout of my apartment if i washed the sheets it was a clear commitment to myself that i didnt have to put the younger woman up here when i fetched her back from lottys although i didnt know what the hell i was going to do with her it was possible that cerise had given lotty her surname if she hadnt i thought carol might call michael reese for me and get them to give her zerlinas last name i didnt want to meet with the police until i talked to zerlina assuming i could find her at reese when i got to the clinic i learned that a chunk of ray schedule had dropped outcerise had disappeared carol was worried lotty angry lotty had given her a mild tranquilizer and something to control her nausea cerise had slept for about an hour in the examining room the third time carol went in to check on her she was gone mrs coltrain had seen her walk out of the clinic but had no reason to stop hershed assumed since cerise came with me that i had arranged to pay lotty for her treatment separately of course id forgotten the money a hundred dollars to pay cerises bill and help fund some of the clinics indigent patients lotty furious with me for interrupting her day with such a case was in no humor to discount her services i pulled my checkbook from my handbag and wrote out the check i guess i should have taken her to the hospital i said wearily handing it to mrs coltrain but she got sick so suddenly and so violently that i was afraid she might be dying on me i didnt know if she had some neurological disease or was coming down from heroin or what if something like this happens again which i hope it doesnt i wont bother you that pulled lotty up shortshe hates having her standard of care impugned her tone was a little less abrupt when she responded it was a combination of heroin and pregnancy if theres to be any hope for that fetus cerise needs to get into a drug program today i wouldnt bet the farm on her doing it i said i want to try to get in touch with cerises mother i explained that zerlina might be in michael reese recovering from the fire but that i didnt have her last name carol went off to phone the hospital for meshe felt irrationally responsible for cerise roaming the streets pregnant and addicted getting zerlinas last name was something active she could do to help not your problem i tried to tell her when she returned a few minutes later if cerise is bent on destructing you cant stop her you should know that by now yes vic carol admitted i do know it but i feel as though we let you down thats partly why lottys so angry you know she tries to work at such a high level and then when she fails to save someone she takes it personally and for it to be someone you brought in maybe i said dubiously the truth was i was happy that cerise had vanished it was magic i didnt have to look after her anymore anyway the mothers last name is ramsay carol spelled it for me shes in room fourtwentytwo in the main hospital building i told the head nurse you were a social worker so there wont be any problem you getting in to see her i made a face as i thanked her social worker it was an apt description of how id spent my time since elena showed up at my door last week maybe it was time for me to turn republican and copy nancy reagan from now on when alcoholic or addicted pregnant strays showed up at my door i would just say no smoking grandma i climbed into the chevy and slumped over the wheel it was only noon but i was as tired as though id been climbing mount everest for a week a faint odor of vomit still hovered in the car despite the twenty minutes id spent scrubbing the backseat it slowly came to me that i was smelling my own clothes my jeans were soiled where id been kneeling on the car seatid just been too wound up with elena to notice it earlier shuddering violently i turned on the engine and drove south at a reckless pace not even bothering to keep an eye out for the blueandwhites all i wanted to do was to get home get my clothes off get myself scrubbed as clean as i could manage i left the chevy at a wild angle a yard or so from the curb and took the stairs up two at a time barely waiting to get inside to strip i dumped jeans tshirt and panties in a heap in the doorway and headed straight for the bathroom i stood under the hot water for almost half an hour washing my hair twice scrubbing myself thoroughly finally i felt cleansed that addicts and alcoholics were rinsed from my life i dressed slowly taking time to put on makeup and to style my hair with a little gel a gold cotton dress with big black buttons made me feel elegant and poised i even burrowed through the hall closet for a black bag to go with my pumps on the way out i gathered my discarded clothes and took them to the basement the sheets were ready for the dryer but there are limits to my housekeeping fervori stuffed my jeans in with the sheets and started the cycle from the beginning it was a little after one by now i wouldnt be able to eat lunch if i wanted to see zerlina before my meeting with dominic assuevo and i guess i wanted to see her although my enthusiasm for the ramsay family was at low tide i headed over to lake shore drive and joined the flow southward michael reese hospital dominates the lakefront for a mile or two at twentyseventh street i circled the complex a few times until i found someone pulling away from a meteri was damned if i was going to pay lot fees for this visit a guard was stationed behind a glass cage in the entryway she didnt care whether i was a social worker or an ax murderer so i didnt have to use carols cover story to get a pass to the fourth floor the distinctive hospital smellsome combination of medication antiseptic and the sweat of people in pain made me flinch involuntarily when i got off the elevator i had spent too much time in hospitals with my parents when i was younger and the smell always brings back the misery of those years my mother died of cancer when i was fifteen my father from emphysema some ten years later he was a heavy smoker and there are days when i still get angry about it especially today when i was feeling under siege zerlina ramsay was in a fourpack television perched high on facing walls were tuned to conflicting soap operas two women glanced indifferently at me when i came in but returned their attention immediately to the screen the other two didnt even look up i stood dubiously in the doorway for a moment trying to decide which of the three black women might be zerlina none of them bore any overwhelming resemblance to cerise finally i saw a sign attached to one of the beds warning me not to smoke if oxygen was in use the woman lying there had gauze covering her left arm short her massive build amply displayed by the skimpy hospital robe she would have been my last choice but zerlina had been brought in suffering from smoke inhalation so i supposed shed needed oxygen she was attached to what looked like a heart monitor i went over to the bed she turned her gaze toward me reluctantly her eyes narrowed suspiciously in her jowly face mrs ramsay she didnt respond but she didnt deny it either my name is v i warshawski i think you know my aunt elena her dark eyes flickered in surprise she cautiously inspected me you sure about that her voice was husky from disuse and she cleared her throat discreetly she told me you two hung out together at the indiana arms had a few beers together so i gritted my teeth and plowed ahead so she was waiting on my doorstep last night with cerise cerise what planet that girl come down from i glanced around the room as id expected her companions were more interested in live theater than tv they made no effort to mask their curiosity can you go out in the hall with that thing i gestured at the monitor this is kind of private those two took money from you i dont want to hear about it i cant even afford me a new place to sleep let alone pay back all that girls bills it doesnt have anything to do with money she glowered at me belligerently but heaved herself to a sitting position her substantial frame gave the impression not of fat but of a natural monument maybe a redwood tree that had grown sideways but not too tall she brushed away my hand when i tried to take her elbow grunting to herself she slid out of bed sticking her feet into paper hospital slippers lined up tidily under the edge the heart monitor was on wheels rolling it in front of her she made her way to the door and down the hall like a tidal wavenurses and orderlies split to either side when they saw her coming she was panting a bit when we got to a small lounge stuck at one end of the hall she took her time getting her breath before lowering herself onto one of the padded chairs they were covered in cracked aqua oilcloth that had last been washed when michael reese himself was still alive i perched gingerly on the edge of the chair at right angles to zerlina so elena is your aunt huh cant say you look too much like her glad to hear it shes thirty years and three thousand bottles ahead of me i ignored her crack of laughter to add i gotta say you dont look too much like cerise either thats those thirty years you spoke of zerlina said i wasnt so badlooking at her age and i sure look better than shes going to when she gets to be as old as me the rate shes going what kind of story she tell you she and that aunt of yours her baby i said baldly katterina zerlinas face creased in astonishment for a moment i thought she was going to tell me cerise didnt have a baby shes picking a funny time to care about that baby being as how she hasnt paid much attention to it so far to date katterina wasnt with you wednesday night when the indiana arms burned down i couldnt think of a gentle way to ask the question hmunh she shook her jowly head emphatically she left the baby with me on wednesday all right but i couldnt keep her with me not in an sro you know they can be mighty strict about who you got with you which cerise knew but that girl she sat with her hands on her knees looking broodingly at nothing for a moment the heart monitor beeped insistently as though in rhythm with her thoughts she faced me squarely i might as well tell you the whole story i dont know why i should dont know i can especially trust you but you dont look like elena you dont look like an alkie wholl do the best she can to make money out of your sad news to buy her another bottle i felt a little queasy at her words its one thing to think of your own aunt turning tricks with the oldage pensioners its quite another to imagine her blackmailing people for the price of a drink not that i havent had a drink or two in my day too and ill give elena this she makes you laugh you can forget your troubles with her every now and then she looked away again for a moment as though her troubles had come too forcefully to mind well cerise had this baby last year it was and this baby had all kinds of problems on account of cerise is a junkie she was using heroin all the time she was pregnant i told her how it would be she even pretended to be in a program that time they arrested her shed been out stealing her and the boy she was with at the time and they arrested her and on account of it was the first time and she was pregnant they let her go if she promised to go to the program she glared at me again as if daring me to condemn her for having a daughter like that i made what i hoped was a sympathetic sound and tried to look understanding then the baby was bornand my what a time we had poor little thing was in the hospital then maisie the other grandmothertook her home i couldnt you know i just live on a little bit of savings i have i dont have social securityyou dont get it for cleaning houses which is what i did all my life at least until my heart started giving out on me but i helped maisie out as much as i could and by and by we got that baby to sleep at night and even laughing so cerise never took care of her oh no she did finally she did when she got going with otis that was in june then suddenly on wednesday cerise comes by saying she cant take it anymore being home with the baby morning noon and night and i tell her she should be thinking of that before she spreads her legs you know not two years later but she leaves the baby and goes saying her and otis is off to the dells so i go to the pay phone but i cant find a number for his sister so i call maisie and she sends her boy over and gets katterina and if you think cerise is worrying about her think again on account of she hasnt come near me here in the hospital maybe it was my imagination but it seemed to me the heart monitor was beeping faster by the end of her tale i didnt want to ask her anything that might get her more upset i also didnt think i had to be the one to let zerlina know her daughter was pregnant again she demanded to know why cerise had come to see me when i explained that she was asking me to intervene with the fire department zerlina snorted maybe she does think the babys dead maybe thats why she hasnt been to see meshes too ashamed but if her and elena come to see you together girl i advise you to keep your wallet in the bottom of your purse and count all your money before you say goodbye i felt an uneasy twingehadnt looked in my billfold before putting it into my black bag still cerise had been pretty sick maybe too sick to go hunting for money or credit cards before i got up to go i asked zerlina how long they were keeping her she gave a little smile that was half crafty half embarrassed when they brought me in i was unconscious on account of the smoke and they found my heart was kind of acting up high blood pressure high fat in my blood you name it i got too much of everything except money so im kind of dragging it out you know until i can get me a place to stay i see id come across worse crimes in my time i stood up well im glad the babys okay anyway cerise disappeared around noon today and im not going to put a lot of energy into hunting for her but if i see her again ill let her know her kid is at maisies she grunted and got slowly to her feet yeah okay but i got to call maisie and tell her katterina dont go off with cerise again you take it easy girl what did you say your name was vic and you stay those three thousand bottles behind elena you hear me got it i walked slowly down the hall with her to her room door before i said goodbye back in the lobby i checked my wallet the cash was gone and so was my american express card the only thing left was my pi license and that was because it was stuck behind a flap theyd even lifted my drivers license i ground my teeth cerise might have cleaned me out while i was hiding out in my bedroom this morning but for all i knew elena had robbed me when i was struggling with cerise in the kitchen i felt my shoulders tighten from futile rage i found a pay phone in the lobby and called my creditcard companies to report the cards as stolen at least id memorized my phone card number so i didnt have to stop all my phone calls i usually keep an emergency twenty in the zip compartment of my purse when i checked the black bag i found id left one in there on my way out i used it to buy flowers for zerlina it wasnt enough but it was all i could afford firing up the arson squad before leaving the hospital i tried to reach robin bessinger at ajax i was hoping to cancel our meeting with the bomb and arson squad now that i knew the baby hadnt been in the indiana arms but i was too latethe insurance receptionist told me hed already left for the police department i took a deep breath squared my shoulders and headed back to ellis avenue and my car it used to be you could go to central police headquarters anytime day or night and park with ease now that development mania has hit the near south side downtown congestion has clogged the area it took me half an hour to find a place to park that made me about ten minutes late for the meeting which scarcely helped my frayed mood roland montgomery held court in an office the size of my bed a regulation metal desk crammed with papers took most of the available space but he squeezed in chairs for me bessinger assuevo and a subordinate papers were stacked on the windowsill and on top of the metal filing cabinet someone should have told him the place was a fire trap montgomery a tall thin man with hollow cheeks gave me a sour look as i came in he ignored my outstretched hand pointed to the empty chair in the corner and asked if i knew dominic assuevo assuevo was bullshapedthick neck and wide shoulders tapering into narrow hips his graying sandy hair was cropped close to his head the way the boys used to wear it when i was in third grade he greeted me with a jovial courtesy not reflected in his eyes cant stay away from fire huh ms warshawski good to see you again too commander hiya robin i tried to get you a little bit ago but your office told me you were already here i skirted my way past his long feet to the vacant chair robin bessinger was sitting in the opposite corner of the tiny room he seemed a little older than hed struck me when i first met him but of course the hard hat had kept me from seeing that his hair had gone gray he smiled and waved and said hello i squeezed in next to the uniformed man and held out a hand v i warshawski i dont think weve met he mumbled something that sounded like firehorse whiskey i never did learn what his name really was so you think there was a baby in the indiana arms ms warshawski montgomery pulled a folder from the stack in front of him i had to believe hed practiced it that he couldnt know offhand what fire which folder referred to i did when i spoke to mr bessinger this morning that was before i tracked down the babys grandmother i just finished interviewing her in the hospital and she says she had already sent the child to its other grandmother before the fire broke out so were wasting our time here is that what youre telling me montgomerys eyebrows rose to his sandy hairline he made no effort to hide his contempt i gave a tight smile guess so lieutenant there were no babies in the indiana arms when it burned down he swung his neck cranelike across the desk at me i cant say that categorically i only know that the one id been told was therekatterina ramsayhad left the building earlier in the evening for all i know there might have been others you should check with commander assuevo here the young man next to me had started to write this in his open notebook but stopped at a sign from montgomery you have something of the reputation of a wit ms warshawski the lieutenant said heavily personally i have never found your sense of humor entertaining i hope this wasnt your idea of a joke to turn police and fire department resources loose on a wildgoose chase my comedic talents have always been greatly overrated by bobby mallory i said coolly i was feeling pretty angry but it seemed to me montgomery was provoking me deliberately i wanted to be the last one to blink well the next time you feel an urge to make a joke call mallory not me because if you do abuse departmental resources again ms warshawski believe me i will be calling the lieutenant and asking him to give you a good lesson in legalities that seemed to be the end of the interview short of leaping over the desk and pummeling him with my bare hands i couldnt think of anything to say or do to express my frustration effectively i stood up slowly aligned my belt buckle directly under the black buttons pulled an imaginary hair from my dress and shook out the shirt i beamed happily at firehorse whiskey and sketched a wave at robin bessinger i kept the happy smile on my face all the way down the stairs once in the hall i let the waves of anger wash through me what the hell was eating montgomery it could only be his relations with police lieutenant bobby mallory bobby talks about me one way and thinks about me quite anotherhe might easily have told the fire commander i was a pain in the butt and a wiseasshis publicly expressed opinion on many occasions missing would be bobbys affection as an old friend of my parents but that didnt excuse the squad commanders behavior he could have asked me why i had called robin to begin with i certainly wasnt going to start piping out selfexculpation when treated to that kind of routine and bessingerwhy didnt the guy speak up i made a tight face and headed for the south exit you look like a snake stood up and bit you cant you even say hi to your friends it was michael furey i hadnt been scanning faces as i hunched my way down the hall oh hiya michael must be sleep deprivation what are you doing here helping us keep chicago safe and legal his dark blue eyes teased me i forced myself to smile something like that ive just been meeting with roland montgomery about that fire in the indiana arms last week the one where your aunt got caught you oughta stay clear of arsonthats dirty dirty stuff dirty work but someones got to do it since montgomery doesnt want to maybe ill have a crack at it oh montys not doing the investigation his eyebrows shot up and he looked thoughtful doesnt seem too interested i kept my tone light well in that case he broke off you dont want me telling you to mind your own business i bowed slightly call the boy a mind reader he laughed a little but there was a current of annoyance in it i wont then but keep it in mind that if monty isnt touching it there may be good reasons to stay away from it i looked at him steadily like what well it doesnt matter just to keep you happy no ones asked me to look at the arson but the more people tell me not to touch something the more i feel like reaching out a hand just to see whats so special about it he hunched a shoulder impatiently whatever you say vic i gotta run he went on down the hall greeting uniformed men with his usual good humor i shook my head and went on outside bessinger caught up with me as i was crossing state slow down vic id like to know what was going on between you and monty in that meeting i stopped and faced him squarely you tell me i wondered why you didnt say anything to explain why you thought it worthwhile bothering montgomery based just on my phone call he held up his hands ive been around a lot of fires in my time i dont step in between the accelerant and the kindling besides i did try to talk to him thats why i stayed after you but i still cant figure out why hes so angry about this one other than manpower shortages but hes taking it as a personal affront why i shook my head i can see it would piss him and assuevo to have the lab sifting through ashes for a nonexistent body but i only called you in the first place to find out if you knew when you didnt i took the long route which meant getting the last name of the babys mother and tracking down her mother the grandmother i mean you didnt know that when you called his tone was puzzled not accusatory i never saw the young woman beforethe mother of the babyuntil she came to my place late last night shed left the kid with her own mother zerlina ramsay at the indiana arms and she didnt want me talking to mrs ramsay she said if i knew their last name it would get her mother in trouble that shed never find another place to stay shes a junkie thoughi dont know if that came from drugrelated paranoia or real concern about her mother or what we were standing on the pavement near the curb patrolmen heading up state toward the entrance kept brushing against us when i stepped aside to avoid a man being decanted from a stretch limo i ran into a woman trotting down the street toward dearborn cant you watch where youre going she snapped at me i opened my mouth to utter a guerrilla hostility back then thought maybe id done enough fighting for one day and ignored her robin looked at his watch i dont need to go back to the office want to get a drink someplace im afraid if someone else bumps into us montys going to have us arrested the mood hes in i suddenly felt very tired id been running since eight this morning cleaning up after elena and cerise people as different as lotty and roland montgomery had been chewing me out a clean welllighted place and a glass of whiskey sounded like doctors orders to me robin had taken a cab up from ajax he walked back to the chevy with me and we headed through the early rushhour traffic to the golden glow a bar i know and love in the south loop we left the car at a meter down near congress and walked the three blocks back to the bar sal barthele the owner was alone with a couple of men nursing beers at the mahogany horseshoe counter she nodded majestically at me when i took robin over to a small round table in the corner she waited until we were settled and robin had exclaimed over the genuine tiffany lamps to take our orders your usual vic sal asked when robin had ordered a beer my usual is black label up i pictured elenas flushed veined face and my missing credit cards i remembered zerlinas admonition to keep three thousand bottles behind elena then i thought hell im thirtyseven years old if i was going to get drunk every time life threatened me i would have started in years ago when i feel like having a whiskey ill have a whiskey yes i said more vehemently than id meant you sure about that girl sal mocked me gently then went to the bar to fill our order sals a shrewd businesswoman the glow is only one of her investments and she could easily afford to turn it over to a manager but it also was her first venture and she likes to preside over it in person robin took a swallow of his draft and opened his eyes in appreciation ive probably walked by here a hundred times going to the insurance exchange how could i have missed this stuff sals draft is made for her privately by a small brewer in stevens point im not a beer lover but my pals who are think its pretty hot stuff i told robin a little about sal and her operations then steered the talk back to the indiana arms you ever find any evidence that the owner was trying to sell the place robin shook his head too early to tell his limits arent out of line but that doesnt matter its really more a question of whats going on with the building and him and his finances we havent got that far yet what does montgomery say robin frowned and finished his beer before answering nothing hes not going to dedicate any more resources into investigating the arson and you dont agree i drank a glass of water then swallowed the rest of my scotch the warmth spread slowly from my stomach to my arms and some of the tension the day had put into my shoulders disappeared we never pay a claim when arson is involved i mean not unless were a hundred percent sure the insured didnt engineer it he held up his glass to sal and she brought over another draft she had the black label bottle with her but i shook my head over the idea of seconds elena must have been affecting me after all i just dont understand montgomery though ive worked with him before hes not an easy guynot much looseness therebut ive never seen him as nasty as he was to you this afternoon must be my charm i said lightly it hits some men that way i didnt think it was worth explaining my theory about montgomery and bobby mallory to a stranger robin refused to laugh its something about this fire why else would he tell me the file was closed he said theyd only reopened it because you thought there might be a body in there now they want to put their manpower where its more urgently needed ive never worked with the bomb and arson unit but i assume theyre not too different from the rest of the policetoo few people too many crimes it doesnt seem so unbelievable to me that montgomery would abandon an investigation into an underinsured mausoleum in one of the citys tackier districts the fire fighters and police may serve and protect everyone but theyre human theyll respond to the neighborhoods with more political clout first robin made an impatient gesture maybe youre right insurance companies have to be more allergic to arson montgomery may want to concentrate on the gold coast but we cant be so picky even if hes abandoning the indiana arms we wont at least not for the time being or at least not until his boss also got his sense of priorities reorganized but i kept that last unkind thought to myself and let the talk drift to the joys of home ownership robin had just bought a twoflat in albany park he was renting out the ground floor while living on top and trying to rehab the whole place in his spare time on weekends stripping varnish and putting up drywall are not my idea of a good time but im perfectly ready to applaud anyone else who wants to do it after his third beer it seemed natural to think about moving on to food we agreed on i popoli a seafood restaurant near clark and howard after that it seemed natural to drive up to albany park with him to inspect the rehab work one thing kind of led to another but i left before they drifted too fari hadnt packed any equipment when i left my apartment for the day anyway aids is making me more cautious i like to see a guy more than once before doing anything irrevocable still its nice to get an outside opinion of ones attractions i went home at midnight in a far better mood than i would have thought possible when i got up twenty hours ago washing up i slept late the next morning usually as soon as i wake up i get out of bed and get goingim not a napper or a snoozer but today i felt a catlike languor envelop me a sense of wellbeing that came from knowing i had my castle to myself the street noises were subduedthe ninetofivers were long gone about their businessand i felt suspended in a little bubble of privacy by and by i padded into the kitchen to make some coffee the remains of yesterdays shambles made a slight dent in my euphoria enough to decide me not to skip my run two days in a row i had cleaned up after cerise but the dirty rags were still in the sink giving off a faint smell of clorox mixed with old vomit i needed to throw them in the wash and might as well do it at the start of my run down in the basement after doing my stretches my good mood deteriorated further on finding that someone had dumped my laundry on the floorwet a note scribbled in angry haste lay on top you dont own the basement too i knew mr contreras would never have done such a thing the secondfloor tenants were korean their english didnt seem up to the pointedness of the message my thirdfloor neighbor was a quiet older norwegian woman who almost never appeared that left the banker good old vincent bottone i put the clothes back in the washer added the rags poured in a double measure of soap and a good cup of clorox and left westinghouse to do my dirty work i stopped on the first floor for the dog who was more than usually eager to see meit had been several days since shed had a good workout mr contreras was disposed to question me about my aunt and cerise but the dog was whimpering so loudly i was able to make my escape in fairly short order as i jogged up to belmont and across to the harbor my mind kept shifting to vincent bottone trying to come up with some fitting response to his desecration of my laundry of course i shouldnt have gone off and left it all day but did he really have to dump it on the floor and add a hostile note my best idea was to break into his apartment some weekend when he was out and steal his briefcase for peppy to chew to bits but then he might poison the doghe was just the type by the time peppy and i got back home my early euphoria had evaporated completely i turned the dog back to mr contreras and pleaded a heavy work load to escape a second barrage of questions halfway up the stairs i remembered my laundry and stomped back to the basement to shift it to the dryer the washer was still in its final spin cycle propping my elbows on the vibrating machine i tried to resolve on an action plan for the day i had to get my drivers license replaced which meant trekking up elston by busi shouldnt even have been driving last night without it after thati wondered if it was worthwhile trying to confront elena about my missing stuff if she knew she wouldnt admit it anyway the thought of dealing with her coy evasions nauseated me if it was cerise who had robbed me i didnt have any desire to find her even if i knew where to look since i wasnt going to mess with those two anymore there was nothing to stop my getting back to payingand waitingclients i repeated some pretty stern orders to myself about going upstairs getting dressed and heading for the loop but something kept me planted in front of the washing machine the rhythm of the spin cycle was soothing my mind relaxed while i stared at the dials the niggling questions buried by cerise and elenas exigent needs came fluttering back to the surface of my brain rosalyn why had she gratuitously sought me out at bootss party with a thousand people to meetlots of them with lots of bucksdid she really want to assure herself that i was on her side i wished i could believe it i just couldnt she could see id shelled out for her that should have been guarantee enough for someone who wasnt particularly close to her despite her and marissas soap my public support wasnt particularly useful to her i havent been politically active for a long time my name is getting better known in the financial world but it doesnt count for anything in county politics in fact knowing i backed rozor any other candidatecould just as likely make people who know me from my pd days vote against her as for her i couldnt help believing she thought i knew something that might damage her she had some secret and her cousin was worried i knew about it it was after hed pointed at me that shed come back and asked me to meet her at the swing shed sought me out to scout the lay of the land it doesnt matter vic i said aloud so shes got a secret so who doesnt none of your business grunting i moved the heavy wet clothes from the machine to the dryer i slammed the door shut and scowled at the knobs the trouble was shed made it my business by seeking me out in that strange way if she and marissa were making a patsy out of me between themi bit off the thought in midsentence and headed for the stairs i was halfway up when i realized i hadnt turned on the dryer i stomped back to the basement and set the wheel in motion i put on my newest jeans so id look tidy and respectable for the drivers license people with it i wore a rosecolored blouse so id photograph decently all during the slow bus ride up elston and the long wait while state employees processed applicants at a pace just short of total morbidity i toyed with different ways of getting a fix on rozs situation my first thought had been to head to the daley center to see if she was being sued but if someone were on her case the papers would have the storythe first thing the eager reporters do when someone runs for office is check the public record on them with a start i realized my turn had come i filled out the forms handed over my three pieces of identification waited some more agreed to give away my kidneys and eyeballs if some cokehead totaled me and finally got my picture taken my care in dressing had been to no availi still looked like an escapee from the psycho ward at cook county maybe i should lose this license too and try again i trudged back onto the number bus and endured the long trek south the sight of my dementedlooking photograph did make me think of someone who might know what roz was up to velma riter was a photographer whom id met when she was with the heraldstar shed been assigned enough times to cover stories id been involved in that we got to know each other at least by sight shortly before leaving the paper to go into business for herself shed done a big photoessay for a special issue on fifty women who move chicago id been included as had roz the artist was at home shed evidently been expecting some other call because she answered the phone eagerly on the first ring but seemed startled at hearing it was me v i warshawski she repeated slowly drawing out the syllables well well to what do i owe the pleasure i just had my drivers license redone i was wishing you could doctor the photo for me forged passports are my real specialty she said dryly what are you up to these days not much i saw roz fuentes on sunday though out at a big shindig boots meagher was throwing for her i knew about itshe wanted me there but im getting ready for a show i wouldnt even have answered your call if i hadnt been expecting to hear from my agent i made appropriate noises of congratulation wrote down the gallery name and opening date and apologized for disturbing her work you keep up with roz im doing some work for the campaign a thread of impatience hit velmas voice vic i really dont have time for a chat right now i wouldnt be bothering you if i knew someone else to interrupt roz got me kind of worried though i wondered if she was digging herself into some kind of pit her pals ought to know about just what did she say to make you think that not so much what she said but what she did i told her about about roz breaking away from the crowd just to sound out how much i cared about her alliance with boots you worry too much about other peoples business warshawski some people even think youre a pain in the butt go catch some real criminals and leave rozs business alone shes cool her closing words made my cheeks flame i hung up without even trying to reply i had an ugly vision of myself as a crank and a busybody she still shouldnt have come around asking if i was going to do anything to hurt her i muttered aggrievedly to myself hunching my shoulders i went back outside i was flat and i didnt have a cash card the rest of the afternoon was taken up with errands to replace my missing credit to the bank to cash a check and apply for a new card to the grocery to get some food and a new checkwriting card at four i finally took some time to go to the daley center and dig around a little on a background check for an old client velmas words still stung so much i didnt even try looking roz up the documents library closed at fourthirty i walked across town to my office to see what new bills had come in since friday stopping at a deli to pick up a giant chocolatechip cookie and a cup of bitter coffee while i finished the cookie i switched on the desk lamp and called my answering service both michael furey and robin bessinger had phoned and one of the managers from cartwright wheeler the insurance brokers where id made my presentation last friday i sat down heavily a potential client a paying client and i had completely forgotten to make a followup phone call after spending five hundred dollars and two days on a presentation to them maybe this showed the beginning of senile dementia they say the shortterm memory is the first thing to go harassed though id been yesterday by dealing with cerise and roland montgomery i still should have remembered to make a phone call that important i looked at my pocket diarythere it was call cartwright wheeler id even put in the number and the name of the contact person when i phoned it was to get bad newstheyd decided they didnt need my help at this time of course once theyd put off the decision the odds were against their choosing to hire me but velma was righti spent so much time worrying about other peoples business i couldnt even keep track of my own the vision of myself as a grotesque busybody returned the outcome might not have been different if id remembered to call yesterday but at least id feel like a professional instead of a fool caught in the act i returned fureys and robin bessingers phone calls more for something to do to stop my selfflagellation than from any real enthusiasm to talk to either furey wanted to apologize for his comments to me at the department yesterday and arrange a final trip to the sox who like the cubs had long since faded into the sunset i didnt mean to criticize you he added its hard for us bornandbred chauvinists to reform thats okay i assured him with what goodwill i could muster i wasnt at my best anywaylieutenant montgomery was jumping on my ass for the wrong reasons and it didnt leave me feeling very friendly after wed talked a little about the meeting and hed given me some tips on the best way to handle monty he inquired about elena id forgotten asking him to do a search for her more dementia more repellent busybodiedness oh nuts im sorryi should have told youshe showed up sunday night safe and sound with a truly hideous protégée sounds bad he said with ready sympathy what was the protégée someone from the indiana arms daughter i gave him a thumbnail sketch of cerise now shes vanished into the woodwork pregnant addicted and all want to give me her name and description i could ask the boys to keep an eye out for her ugh the last thing i wanted was for someone to drop cerise on my doorstep again on the other hand for the sake of the fetus she was working on someone ought to try to get her into a drug program why not the cops i gave michael the details i dont think this week is a good time for me to set a play dateive been letting too many things slide and its starting to get me down ill call next monday or tuesday okay yeah vic fine he hung up furey was fundamentally goodnatured caring enough to look out for a pregnant junkie hed never seen eileen mallory was righthe was good father material i just wasnt looking for a father at least not for my unborn children i called robin next the lab they used had reported on the samples from the indiana arms theyd confirmed his initial hunch on the accelerantit had been paraffin i tried to force my mind to care about what he was saying is it hard to buy its common he responded easy to get hold of even in large quantities so i dont think we can trace the user by looking for a purchaser whats interesting was the timing device they used to set the thing off a hot plate had been plugged into it in the night mans quarters so maybe the watchman had something to do with it hard to think he didnt if a timer was wired to his own appliance the owner says he had only a night man at the desk that he didnt think the building warranted a watchman we havent been able to locate the guy though vic youve done a lot of work for ajax in the past successful work i wonderedi talked to my bosscould we hire you on this one to do what i asked cautiously i dont know a thing about arsoni couldnt tell an accelerant from a match he didnt respond directly even though the building was underinsured were reserving over a million dollars people were injured and that means liability claims on top of the property loss the police may not care but itd be worth it to us to invest several thousand in a professional investigation if we could save the big money wed like you to try to find the arsonist i watched the windowpanes vibrate at the continuous stream of rushhour ls running just underneath a little dirt shook loose but not as much as whirled up to add to the glasss gray opacity it wasnt a scene to bolster my low sense of competence my fan club at ajax doesnt exactly include a unanimous chorus of senior staff does your boss have the authority to hire me without a lot of other people getting involved in the approval process oh yeah thats easy we budget for outside investigatorsthey dont have to be approved on a casebycase basis he paused could i interest you in dinner tonight try to help you make up your mind i could picture his head tilted birdlike to one side as he watched to see if the worm would pop out of the ground the image made me feel like smiling for the first time since finding my laundry on the floor this morning dinner would be great he suggested calliope a lively place on north lincoln that served greekstyle seafood they didnt take reservations but people could dance in the adjoining cabaret while waiting for their tables after hanging up i shut my office for the day another couple of inquiries had come in that i ought to deal with but i didnt have the emotional energy for work this afternoon by the time i walked back to the north end of the loop for my car and picked my way through the rushhour traffic home i just had time for a long bath before dressing for dinner i lay in the tub a good fortyfive minutes letting my mind float to nowhere letting the water wash away the sharpest edge of selfdoubt when i finally got out and started dressing the latesummer twilight was turning the evening air a grayishpurple i watched mr contreras working in the backyard the tomato season was ending but he was cultivating a few pumpkins with tender care he liked to do halloween in style for the local kids in the dim light i could just make out peppy lying on the grass her nose on her forepaws gloomily waiting for activity that might include her i went down the back way to bid him and the dog good night the old man was on his dignity miffed at my shortness with him this morning but the dog was ecstatic i had to work hard to keep her from transferring leaf loam or manure or whatever mr contreras was piling on the pumpkins to my black silk trousers he refused to be mollified by my light remarks i felt myself on the verge of apologizing and bit back the words in annoyancethere was no reason for him to know every detail of my life if i wanted to keep a few small segments private i shouldnt have to say i was sorry i gave him a cool farewell and slid through the back gate so that the dog couldnt follow her frustrated whimpering accompanied me down the alley i walked the short mile to the restaurant stepping around a wide hole in the concrete i slipped on a discarded hot dog just one more of the joys of city life i dusted my trouser knees the fabric was bruised slightly but not torn not enough damage to justify a move to streamwood robin was waiting for me outside the restaurant door looking elegant in gray flannel slacks and a navy blazer he had come early to sign up for a table and the manager was just calling his name when we walked in perfect if youre born lucky you dont have to be good robin ordered a beer while i had a rum and tonic and some of the cod roe mousse the calliope was famous for how did you become a detective he asked after wed given our dinner orders i used to be with the public defender i spread some of the mousse on a piece of toast trial division its hideous workyou often get briefed on your client only five minutes before the trial begins you always have more cases than time to work them effectively and sometimes youre pleading heart and soul for goons you hope will never see the light of day again so why didnt you just go into private practice he scooped up some of the mousse this is good he mumbled his mouth full i never tried it before it was goodjust salty enough to go down well with beer or rum i ate some more and finished my drink before answering id spent five years in the pds officei didnt want to have to start again at the beginning in a private practice anyway id solved a case for a friend and realize it was work i could do well and get genuine satisfaction from plus i can be my own boss i should have given that as my first reasonit continues to be the most important with me maybe from being an only child used to getting my own way or just my mothers fierce independence seeping into my dna along with her olive skin after the waiter brought salads and a bottle of wine i asked robin how he ended up as an arson specialist he grimaced i dont know anyone whose first choice is insurance except maybe the kids whose fathers own agencies i majored in art history there wasnt money to send me to graduate school so i started work at ajax they had me designing policy formstrying to make use of my artistic backgroundhe grinned brieflybut i got out of that as fast as i could during dinner he asked me about some of the earlier work id done for ajax it was my turn to make a face the company didnt know if it loved or hated me for fingering their claims vice president as the mastermind of a workers comp fraud scam robin was fascinatedhe said thered always been a lot of gossip circulating but that no one had ever told the lowerdowns what their vice president had really been up to over greekstyle bouillabaisse he spent a little time persuading me to go back into the ajax trenches once again i knew i needed a major job not just the nickelanddime stuff that had come over the transom the last few days i knew i didnt feel up to hustling for new clients right now i knew i was going to say yes but i asked him to call me at my office in the morning with some details its been a roughish day i explained tonight i just want to forget the detecting business and unwind he didnt seem to mind the talk drifted to baseball and childhood while we finished eating dancing in the back room afterwards we didnt talk much at all around midnight we decided the time had come to move the few blocks north to my place robin said hed leave his car at the restaurant and pick it up in the morningwed both had too much to drink to drive and anyway it was a beautiful latesummer night we turned the six blocks into a halfhour trek moving slowly with our arms locked stopping every few houses for a long kiss when we finally got to my place i whispered urgent warnings of silence on robini didnt want mr contreras or vinnie the banker descending on us while robin stood behind me with his arms wrapped around my waist i fumbled in my bag for my keys a car door slammed in front of the house we moved to one side as footsteps came up the walk a car searchlight pinned us against the apartment entrance that you vicki sorry to interrupt but we need to have a chat the voice laden with heavy irony was almost as familiar to me as my own fathers it belonged to lieutenant robert mallory head of the violent crimes unit at the chicago polices central district i could feel my cheeks flame in the darkno matter how cool you are it unsettles you when your fathers oldest friend surprises you in a passionate embrace im flattered of course bobby two and a half million souls in the city including your seven grandchildren and when you have insomnia you come to me bobby ignored me say good night to your friend herewere going for a ride robin made a creditable effort to intervene i grabbed his arm theyll put you in cook county with the muggers and the buggers if you hit himits a police lieutenant bobbyrobin bessinger ajax insurance robinbobby mallory chicagos finest in the searchlight bobbys red face looked grayishwhite lines i didnt usually notice sprang into craggy relief he was coming up on his sixtieth birthday after all id even been invited to the surprise party his wife was planning for him in early october but i hadnt thought of the milestone as meaning he might be getting old i pushed aside the stab of queasiness the idea of his aging gave me and said more loudly than id intended where are we riding to and why bobby i could see him wrestle with the desire to grab me and drag me forcibly to the waiting car most people dont know that if youre not under arrest you dont have to go off with a policeman just because he tells you to and most people wont fight it even if they know it even a good cop like bobby starts taking it for granted a citizen like me helps him keep his powers in perspective tell your friend to take a hike he jerked his head at robin if i obeyed him on that one hed play by the rules it wasnt a great compromise but it was a compromise i grudgingly asked robin to leave he agreed on condition that i call him as soon as the police were done with me but when he got to the end of the walk he stood to watch i was touched okay hes gone what do you need to talk about bobby frowned and pressed his lips together just a reflex of annoyance night watchman found a body near a construction site around ninethirty she had something on her linking her to you i had a sudden image of my aunt dead drunk getting hit by a car and left to die i put a hand on the side of the building to steady myself elena i asked foolishly elena bobby was momentarily blank oh tonys sister not unless she shed fifty years and had her skin dyed for the occasion it took me a minute to work out what he meant a young black woman cerise she wasnt the only young black woman i know but i couldnt imagine any of the others dead near a construction site who was it we want you to tell us what did you find that made you connect her with me bobby pressed his lips together again he just didnt want to tell meold habits die hard i thought he was about to speak when the door opened behind me and vinnie the banker erupted into the night this is it warshawski this is the last time you get me up in the middle of the night just so you know it the cops are on their way over dont your friends ever think shining a light straight into a window where people are sleeping and talking at the top of their lungs or are you trying to lure people inside he had changed out of his pajamas into jeans and a white button shirt his thick brown hair was combed carefully from his face he might even have taken the extra time to shampoo and blowdry it before dialing im glad you phoned them vinnietheyll be real happy when they get here and so will the rest of the block when the squad cars cruise in with those new strobes of theirs painting the nighttime blue bobby looked at vinnie you call the cops son the banker stuck his chin out pugnaciously yes i did theyll be here any minute if youre her pimp youve got about two minutes to disappear bobby kept his tone avuncular who you talk to sonthe precinct or the emergency number vinnie bristled im not your son dont think you can buy me off too bobby looked at me his lips twitching you been trying to sell him nickel bags vicki he turned back to vinnie showing his badge i know miss warshawski isnt the easiest neighbor in the world im about to take her off your hands but i need to know if you called or the precinct so i can cancel the squad carsi dont want to waste any more city money tonight pulling patrol officers away from work they ought to be doing because you have a beef with your neighbors vinnie bunched up his lips not wanting to back down but knowing he had to he muttered then said more defiantly and its about time someone took her in bobby looked toward the street and bellowed furey michael climbed out of the car and trotted over just what i needed to complete the transformation of romance into farcemichael must have seen me in a clinch with robin at the door this kid here called when he heard me talking to vickiget on the radio and find out whos coming and cancel them okay and turn off the light guy needs his beauty sleep michael at his most wooden ignored me completely and headed back to the car vinnie tried asking for bobbys badge number so he could lodge a complaint with the watch commanderyour boss as he put itbut bobby put a heavy hand on his shoulder and assured him that everyone had better things to do with their time and if vinnie had to be at the office in the morning maybe it was time he turned back in well at least get this woman to stop conducting her business in the front hall in the middle of the night vinnie demanded petulantly as he opened the front door is that what you do vicki bobby asked lose your lease downtown i gritted my teeth but didnt try to fight it as he took my arm and ushered me down the walkmr contreras would doubtless be out next with the dog if we stayed any longer elena i said shortly shes come around a few times in the last week always after midnight of course i havent seen her since tonys funeral didnt even know whether she was still in town i wish i hadnt seen her since then either she got burned out of her place last wednesdayyou know that sro fire near mccormick place bobby grunted so she came to you underneath it all youre not that different from your folks i guess that left me speechless for the remainder of the short walk bobby opened the back door for me i waved at robin and climbed inside michael was sitting in the front seat john mcgonnigal the sergeant bobby most preferred to work within the back i said hello to both of them they kept up an animated conversation about police business all the way to the morgue even if id wanted to i couldnt have joined in at the rue morgue some practical bureaucrat put the county morgue on the near west side the area with chicagos highest murder rateit saves wear and tear on the meatwagons having to cart corpses only a few short blocks even during the day the concrete cube looks like a bunker in the middle of a war zone at midnight its the most depressing place in town as we walked up to the sliding metal doors marked deliveries furey began a series of morbid oneliners a kind of defense against his own mortality i suppose but still unpleasant at least mcgonnigal didnt join in i moved out of earshot into the entrywaya small box of reinforced glass whose inner door was locked a knot of clerks at the reception counter inside looked me over and went back to an animated conversation when bobby materialized behind my left shoulder the party broke up and someone unlocked the door i pushed it open when the buzzer sounded and held it for bobby and the boys furey still wouldnt look at me not even when i went out of my way to be superpolite last time id go to a political fundraiser with him thats for sure for the public brought in to identify their nearest and dearest the county provides a small furnished waiting roomyou can even look at a video screen instead of directly at the body bobby didnt think i needed such amenities he pushed open the double doors to the autopsy room i followed trying to walk nonchalantly it was a utilitarian room with sinks and equipment for four pathologists to work at once in the middle of the night the only person present was an attendant a middleaged man in jeans with a green surgical gown thrown loosely around his shoulders he was hunched over a carandtrack magazine the sox were on a seveninch screen on the chair in front of him he looked at us indifferently taking his time to get up when bobby identified himself and told him what he wanted he sauntered to the thick double doors leading to the cooler inside were hundreds of bodies arranged in rows their torsos were partially draped in black plastic but the heads were exposed arcing back the mouths open in surprise at death i could feel the blood drain from my brain i hoped i wasnt turning greenit would put the cap to my night if i got sick in front of furey and mcgonnigal at least furey had shut up that was one good thing the attendant consulted a list in his pocket and went over to one of the bodies he checked a tag on the foot against his list and prepared to wheel the gurney into the autopsy room thats okay bobby said easily well look at her in here bobby took me to the gurney and pulled the plastic wrapping away so that the whole body was exposed cerise stared up at me stripped of clothes she looked pathetically thin her ribs jutted ominously below her breasts her pregnancy hadnt yet given any roundness to her sunken stomach her carefully beaded braids lay tousled on the tablei stuck a hand out involuntarily to smooth them for her bobby was watching me closely you know who she is dont you i shook my head she looks like a couple of different women ive met briefly what did she have that made you think i knew her he compressed his lips againhe wanted to yell at me but he belongs to a generation that doesnt swear at women dont play games with me vicki if you know who it is tell us so we can get moving on tracking down her associates how did she die i asked we dont know yet they wont do a postmortem until friday probably a heroin overdose that help you distinguish her from the others bobbys sarcasm is always heavy what do you care anyway dead junkies must be a dime a dozen around here and here are three crack guys from the violent crimes unit only three hours after she was found bobbys eyes glittered you aint running the department vicki i dont account to you how i decide to spend my time the intensity of his anger surprised me it also spelled in large block letters that he hadnt chosen to be here i stared at cerise thoughtfully what about her life or death could bring heat from the top down to the central division in such a short stretch where was she found i asked abruptly on the big construction project going up near navy pier that was mcgonnigal watchman found her in the elevator shaft when he was making his rounds called us she hadnt been dead too long when the squad car got there rapelec towers right what made him look down the shaft mcgonnigal shook his head one of those things why she was on the site well probably never know either nice secluded place at night if you want to shoot up in peace but awfully far from where youd expect to find her so what did she have that made you think of me bobby nodded at furey who produced a transparent evidence bag inside was a plastic square my photograph was glued in the left corner looking just as demented as the one id had taken this morning hmm i said after id looked at it looks like my drivers license bobby smiled savagely this isnt second city victoria and nobodys rolling in the aisles you know this girl or not i nodded reluctantly like bobby i hate giving information across police barricades cerise ramsay howd she get that license she stole it from me yesterday morning i crossed my arms in front of me did you report it report the theft i shook my head without answering bobby slammed his hand against the side of the cart hard enough that the metal rattled why the hell not he really was pissed i looked at him squarely i thought elena might have taken it oh the fire went out of his face he jerked his head at furey and mcgonnigal why dont you boys wait for me in the car when theyd left he said in quiet fatherly tones okay vicki lets have the whole story and not just the sections you think ill find out anyway you know tony would say the same thing if he was here indeed i did its just that i was too old to do things because my daddy told me to i didnt have a client to protect though there wasnt any reason not to tell him the pathetic little i knew about cerise just as long as we didnt do it surrounded by cold bodies bobby got the attendant to show us to a tiny cubicle where the mes drink coffee or whiskey or something in between dissections and i told him everything i knew about cerise including katterina and zerlina i can sign the papers if you want her mothers got a bad heart i dont think it would do her any good to come down here bobby nodded well see about that what were you doing at eleventh street that rattled roland montgomerys cage so bad the shift in topic was casual and expert but it didnt make me jump nothing i said earnestly i dont understand it myself he came to see me with a full head of steam and demanded i run you in if you showed up anywhere near the indiana arms bobbys tone was neutralhe wasnt criticizing just offering me information telling me he couldnt protect me if i got powerful people mad at me at the same time hed make a stab at it if i gave him the inside track on why the indiana arms was a hot topic unfortunately i couldnt help and in the end he got angryhe couldnt see that i wasnt being obstructive that i was well and truly ignorant he thinks i take on clients and cases just to thumb my nose at him that im having a latelife adolescent fit hes waiting for me to grow out of it the way his six children all did it was two when furey driving recklessly and wordlessly dropped me at my apartment i didnt make any attempt to be conciliatingi could understand why he was pissed but at the same time it was just the luck of the draw that hed seen me with robin it was farce not tragedyi wasnt about to pretend to be desdemona i waited inside the front door until his car had screeched its way up racine to belmont my chevy was parked across the street i climbed in made a u and headed south through the empty streets toward navy pier the rapelec complex was a monster it wasnt actually on navy pier of courseno development has been approved there because the aldermen cant figure out how to divide up the zoning payoff pie the site was on the west side of lake shore drive facing the pier a strip of decaying warehouses and office buildings that has suddenly become development heaven the construction site took up the whole section between the river and illinois street the foundations had been poured last may they were up about twenty stories now in the towers but the officeretail complex was going more slowly the sketches in the papers had made it look like a giant high school auditorium they were taking their time with the support structure bare light bulbs slung around the top of the skeleton outlined its iron bones i shuddered im not exactly afraid of heights but the thought of perching up there without walls aroundnot so much the height but the nakedness of the buildingfrightened me even at ground level it seemed menacing with black holes where windows should be and wooden ramps that led only to fathomless pits by now my skin was crawling i had to fight an impulse to run back to the chevy and head for home concentrate on putting one step in front of you vic and curse yourself for a fool for leaving your party clothes on instead of changing to sneaks and jeans i circled the site from the outside the blueandwhites had long gone leaving behind a crimescene barricade but no guard there were at least a dozen ways into the grounds in the dark looking nervously above me i selected an entrance lined with lights that didnt seem to have any steel beams poised to drop on it my pumps made a soft thwick on the plank the boards ended at the third story i stepped off onto a cement slab ahead of me and to the right shadows engulfed the floor and the beams but the lights continued on the left where more wood had been dropped to make a crude floor cover my palms were sweating and my toes felt ticklish when i forced myself down the corridor the lower floors were enclosed at this point but no inner walls had been built the only light came from the naked bulbs strung along the structural beams i could see dimly into the recesses of the building steel beams stuck shadowy fingers upward to support the deck above inky splotches might be holes in the floor or maybe just some piece of machinery i thought of cerise coming here alone to die and the skin at the base of my neck prickled uncontrollably hello i cupped my hands and yelled my voice echoed faintly bouncing from the steel beams no one answered sweat now dropped from my neck inside my cotton sweater a faint night breeze dried it leaving me shivering the rough flooring suddenly ended in a nest of plywood cubicles the door to the one on my right stood open i went in the room was dimly lit by the bulbs from the hall outside i hunted around for a switch finally finding a likely candidate in a thick cable i touched it nervously afraid i might be electrocuting myself but the room lights came on two large drafting tables were set up against one wall cradles holding books that looked like giant wallpaper samples covered the other three i pulled one out it was very heavy and didnt handle easily straining i laid it across the cradle and flipped it open it held blueprints they were hard to follow but it seemed to me i was looking at a corner of the twentythird floor in fact this whole volume seemed to be devoted to the twentythird floor i shut it and slid it back into its nest a couple of hard hats stood on one of the drafting tables underneath them lay a stack of work logs these documents were much easier to interpretthe leftmost column listed subcontractors next to them were slots to fill in billable hours for every day of the week i studied the log idly wondering if id see any familiar names wunsch and grasso figured prominently as the lead contractor in the joint venture that was building the complex hurlihey and frain architects also had put in a bunch of hours i didnt realize architects kept working on a project after construction started one name struck me as rather humorousfarmworks inc i wondered what agricultural needs a building like this had farmworks put in a lot of time toothey were submitting over five hundred hours for the week just ending a heavy step sounded on the wood flooring outside i dropped the papers my heart jumping wildly hello my voice came out in a quaver furious with myself for being so nervous i took a deep breath and went out into the corridor a thickset black man in coveralls and a hard hat scowled at me he held a flashlight the other hand rested on the butt of a gun strapped to his waist who are you and what the hell are you doing up here his baritone was heavy and uncompromising my names warshawski im a detective and im here with some followup questions about the dead girl you found police left hours ago he moved his hand away from the gun but his hard eyes didnt relax i just came from the morgue where i met with sergeant mcgonnigal and lieutenant mallory they forgot to ask a couple of things i need to know also since im here id like to see where you found her for a tense moment i thought he was going to demand some police identification but my fluency with the right names apparently satisfied him i cant take you down to where i found her unless you have a hard hat i picked up one of the hurlihey and frain hats from the drafting table why dont i just borrow this one his cold eyes weighed me some more not wanting to let me do it but he seemed to be a man of logic and he couldnt argue himself into sending me back to mallory empty if you people did your homework you wouldnt have to waste so much of my time come on im not going to wait while you trip around in those ridiculous shoes of yoursour liability policy doesnt pay for police who dont dress right for the job i picked up the hard hat and followed him meekly back into the shadowy maze tender site as i stumbled behind him in the dark i persuaded him to tell me his nameleon garrison he was a night security man head of a team working the rapelec site his firm lockstep specialized in guarding construction projects it seemed to me part of his anger toward me was hurt pride that someone had climbed onto the premises to die without his knowing about it he was further annoyed that id managed to come in undetected as well when i explained id shouted a couple of times to try to rouse someone it didnt cheer him any he took me down to the bottom in a hoist that ran along the outside of the building moving the levers with a morose efficiency when we got off he shone the flashlight in swift arcs in front of him uncovering coils of wire boards loose chunks of concrete by staying half a step behind him i could see the obstacles in time to avoid them i had a feeling that disappointed him he stopped abruptly in front of a deep square pit you know anything about construction he demanded nope that improved his mood enough that he explained they put the elevators in last after the shafts were built up to the height of the building and the machinery installed on top the cradles they rest in go down a good way they have to be able to cushion the elevators if the cables break or some other ghastly accident occurs this building had four banks of eight elevators each garrison moved along to the hole where hed discovered cerises body looking in each one to make sure no more unwelcome surprises awaited him when we got to the right one he pointed the flashlight up so i could see the platform supporting the crane some twenty stories overhead the crane took up the space that the elevators would fill once the place was finished between the depth of the pit and the crane platform swaying gently overhead i felt a rush of nausea as i stepped back from the edge i thought i caught a little smirk on garrisons facehed been trying to upset me why did you look in here anyway i tried to sound forceful not as though i was on the brink of throwing up we had a fire in one of the cradles last week guys like to dump trash in here on account of its an open hole someone flipped a butt in and things started burning i just check to see what kind of rubbish were piling up i asked him to shine the flash down into the pit again a roughhewn set of slats had been nailed down the side so that you could climb in and out if you wanted to but it wasnt at all easy to get into it was hard to believe cerise or any addict would go to all that work just to find a private place to shoot up how often do you check them just once a night usually that was near the start of my shift since the fire i look in the pits first and you saw her and called he scratched the back of his head behind the hard hat strictly speaking i called august cray first hes in charge of the site at night he came down here took a look and told me to call the police then he called the contractor wunsch and grasso youd have to ask craythis projects got a bunch of contractors working on it they need to know if anything special is happening on the site and i guess you could call a dead body pretty special he seemed to be smirking again although it was kind of hard to tell in the dark i wondered where this cray person had been when i was calling out on the third floor anyway he phoned someone at wunsch and grasso maybe ernie himself then ernie buzzed his boyhood pal furey and told him to make sure the building site was clean that they didnt get any adverse publicity or any liability suits that was plausible even likely but it didnt explain why bobby had been called in and why he was ticked about it unless the boys had used their connection to boots to get county heat on the investigation but that didnt make any sensethey would want to keep the thing as quiet as possible and getting boots and the county involved would have the opposite effect i prodded garrison as best i could but he didnt know whom cray had called or why the city had sent the head of their violent crimes unit in you see everything you need garrison asked roughly i dont want another relay coming from the cops tonight telling me they forgot one last diddleshit question theres plenty of work to do here this should do it i said i think you can feel safe from the police for at least twelve hours id better be he snapped off the flash and headed back toward the hoist i guess id better tell cray youve been herehe likes to know whos on the site at night we rode back to the third floor youre dressed kind of funny for a cop arent you he said when we got off im dressed funny for a construction site i corrected even detectives have private lives cerise ramsays death interrupted mine the memory of bobby shining his spotlight on robin and me popped into my head it seemed funnier now than it had at the time i bit back a laugh as garrison knocked on the door to one of the little cubicles cray turned out to be a heavy white man in his late fifties he eyed me suspiciously as garrison outlined the reason for my visit you didnt hear her when she came up here the security man asked i was in the john cray answered briefly you get what you need here next time call ahead i smiled brightly next time i sure will who did you callernie or ronafter garrison told you about the body crays frown deepened does it matter it kind of does a dead junkie shouldnt bring down a senior cop and im trying to figure out why why not ask your boss that he kept a heavy unpleasant edge to his voice lieutenant mallory i did ask himhe wasnt saying just for the record hes not my boss just a minute here cray got to his feet lets see some id from you i pulled out my wallet and took out the laminated miniature of my pi license to show him youre not with the police we went through all that for you and youre not a cop goddamn you i ought to get your ass arrested i smiled at him again i can give you lieutenant mallorys home number if you want to ask him to do it but i never said i was with the city i told mr garrison i was a detective he could have asked for my id up front i know ernie and roni can phone up tomorrow and see who you called then do that get off my building fast before some one has an accident and drops a load of steel on your cute little head he was breathing hard i didnt see any reason to be so excited but it seemed to me that the prudent course was to vacate the premises there are just so many dead bodies a construction site can absorb in one night back in the chevy i suddenly felt a wave of exhaustion wash over me my feet were sore they throbbed inside my pumps it had really been stupid to subject the poor things to so much rough terrain i slipped out of them and drove home in my nylons the cold accelerator pedal felt good against my hot soles at the apartment i resisted the temptation to ring vinnies bell not out of any nobility of characteri wanted to sleep in and hed be bound to retaliate in some awful way if i woke him now peppy whimpered behind mr contrerass door when she heard me go by but thankfully she didnt start barking the old man was just deaf enough that hed sleep through her crying but not her barking upstairs i started shedding clothes as soon as i got inside by the time i reached my bedroom i was naked i climbed into bed and was asleep almost immediately i slept deeply but my dreams were filled with elena and cerise chasing me through miles of steel beams id think i was in the clear and then suddenly a giant elevator pit would open in front of me just as i was backing away cerise would be there staring at me naked as shed been at the morgue her braids tangled stretching her arms out and begging me to save her in the background velma riters voice echoed against the steel saying mind you own business vic a lot of people think youre a pain in the butt when the ringing phone woke me at ten i came to heavily i fumbled with the phone before getting the mouthpiece the right way up lo i mumbled heavily may i speak to victoria warshawski please it was the efficient voice of a professional secretary i managed to get the idea across that it was me when she put me on hold i sat up to grapple with a sweatshirtin case it was a client i didnt want to be seen naked vic ernie wunsch hope im not disturbing you my girl said she thought she woke you up when hed dated leann shed been his girl now she was his wife and his secretary had become his girl it was too confusing a concept to put across with my mind so heavy from sleep so i only grunted i had a message a few minutes ago from the rapelec site saying youd stopped by there in the middle of the night i grunted again something wrong we can help you with vic it gets me kind of pissed to think you were going on my site behind my back hang on a minute ernie ill be right with you i put the phone down and went to the bathroom i didnt hurry things and on my way back i stopped in the kitchen for a glass of water by the time i picked the phone up again ernie was well and truly pissed but my head felt a bit clearer sorry erniei was right in the middle of something when you called you know a young woman was found dead at the site last night some black junkie what business was it of yours she was a protégée of mine ernie i promised her mother i would look after her and i failed pretty miserably i could see zerlina ramsays strong anguished face in my minds eye and it didnt cheer me any so so when i heard shed died at the rapelec site i thought id better go check it out see if i could learn any reason she might have gone there you ever want to talk to my people again vic you check it out with me first cray was damned angry that you came there impersonating a police officer he was all for having you arrested if i hadnt known it would embarrass the hell out of mickey i would have done it too you want to play at detective you go do it someplace else he sounded downright ugly while im playing at detective ernie there is one thing you can tell mewhy was it so important to you that somebody really senior come and investigate if youd left it with the beat people theyd have just reported a dead junkie and i probably never even would have heard about it even as i asked the question part of the answer came to me ernie called furey because he was a pal and he was with the cops furey got bobby involved no that didnt make sensefurey would have wanted mallory to stay far away to minimize any fuss at the rapelec site well maybe hed botched it and hadnt been able to keep it from bobby but that didnt make sense because bobby was pissed at being called insomeone had ordered him to go there when he hadnt wanted to while all this was spinning through my head ernie said heavily just learn to mind your own business vic everyone will like you better i was getting kind of peeved at this message oh go make ugly faces at someone whos scared of you ernie you dont impress me any as he hung up i thought i heard him mutter i still dont see what mickey sees in you and i couldnt see what a sweetie like leann saw in him what did she do when he started rattling his chains at her probably giggled and said oh ernie dont be such a crybaby i stumbled into the kitchen for some coffee my feet tender and swollen from last nights escapade was ernie angry because he felt id undermined his control of his project site or was there something specific about cerises death that was bugging him i couldnt imagine what but i couldnt come up with any reason why bobby had been dragged unwillingly into the investigation my brain was still woolly and remote though not churning ideas with any facility i resisted the temptation to take my coffee to the bathroom and while away the morning soaking my sore toes in the tub i know that however unappetizing it seems running is the best antidote to a thick head anyway a big dog like peppy depends on running for her mental healthit wasnt fair to leave her to the sedate walks mr contreras could manage i grumbled my way to the living room to do my stretches they took longer than usual even so i didnt feel fully fit when i pulled on my sweats and stomped down the back stairs peppy heard me coming and raced up to greet me she was always ready to move from deep sleep to intense action without taking time between to loosen up recognizing my sweats she whipped herself into a frenzy dancing around me several times rushing to the bottom of the stairs then darting back up to check my progress mr contreras came to his back door as we passed just taking her serene doggedness out for a spin i said he nodded without speaking and retreated into the kitchen still feeling wounded i gritted my teeth but didnt try calling to him i wasnt ready to kiss and make up i moved up the alley to belmont at a slow gait calling peppy back to me at the intersections trying to avoid pulling a muscle at the harbor i finally felt loose enough to actually run full out for the better part of a mile but i kept it to a jog again as i started back i picked peppy up at her usual spot by the lagoon shed found a family of ducks and was diving after them hopefully until they finally took off toward the lake she pretended not to hear me callinga fit response for ignoring her the last couple of days then she came loping up to me tongue out grinning wickedlyi knew you were calling me all along but youll never be able to prove it my head felt a lot cleaner on the way home back at the apartment i even felt good enough to make up with mr contreras i knocked on his kitchen door told him id been up till four on a case and asked if he had any coffee ready that made me feel totally virtuoushis coffee is foul overcooked stuff and it would be faster for me to brew a fresh pot than to chew the fat with him he allowed as how he had some left over from breakfast and opened the door looking sternly from the dog to me whyd you let the princess go in the water let alone its only sixty degrees out the water in that lagoon hasnt been clean since characteristic in order to be forgiven i had to be scolded i bared my teeth in the semblance of a smile i know i know i begged and pleaded with her but you know how it islady wants to do something she does it without taking advice from anyone he gave me a sharp look seems to me ive known ladies like that uhhuh and then you got to just ride it out until theyre ready to listen to you again i smiled significantly thats right thats it exactly now how about some coffee an aunts house is her castle mr contreras gets vicarious pleasure from my thrills hed heard the excitement last night when bobby had accosted robin and me but hed still been on his dignity i know you like to keep your own business to yourself doll was how he put itand so hed kept the slavering peppy inside and i hadnt thought i had blessings to count by the time id stepped him through the morgue and the latenight tour of rapelec towers he was palpably jealous should have taken me with you doll they threaten to dump a load of steel on you id of known how to handle it indeed you would i agreed blenching slightly the time or two hed come to my defense with a pipe wrench still haunts my nightmares thanks for the coffee ive gotta go nowneed to see a man about a dog and all that stuff or a woman about the hair of the dog i thought grimly as i ran up the stairs to my own place time to nail elena down to some approximation of the truth i took a perfunctory shower patted myself dry while pulling on my jeans tucked my rose silk shirt into the waistband and headed for the door i was just starting to lock it when the phone rang i sprinted back inside it was robin robin id forgotten to call him but he didnt seem to be bothered by it everything go okay last night depends on what you mean they wanted me to id a kid whose body theyd found at a construction site he made sympathetic sounds did you yeah she was black poor and an addict so the odds were against a happy ending but it was still a shocker the cops couldve acted a bit more human to you under the circumstances i suppose under the circumstances they were trying to jolt me into telling the truth he hesitated a moment i dont want to be a pest especially after youve had a bad night but have you thought any more about taking on the indiana arms investigation we need to get going i felt a warm little glow under my rib cage someone thought i was a competent human being not a pain in the butt who should mind her own business even though id made up my mind last night to do the job it just felt good to have someonesome mancall up and think first that i should be working not that i should stay home and play with dolls the only trouble is i dont know anything about fires and i dont think i can educate myself fast enough to do a technical investigation we dont need you doing any of the engineering workwe hire a lab to handle that what you can do is a financial check on the owner see if he had any kind of motive to set the fire himself what i hear youre about the best for that kind of work the glow expanded from my ribs to my cheeks fine i took the owners name and address saul seligman on north estes he was in his seventies and semiretired but he went into his office on irving park road most afternoons i conscientiously wrote down the phone number there as well could we try dinner again robin asked someplace near my house so the cops dont arrest you halfway through the evening i laughed how about friday im pretty beat and i have a lot of work the next few days great ill call friday morning to pick a place thanks a lot for taking on the case yeah sure i hung up it was past noon now if my aunt was still the woman she used to be shed just be getting up i drove with a reckless nervousness covering the four miles in under ten minutes and screeched to a halt across from the windsor arms a couple was sitting on the sidewalk their backs against the building deep in an argument over whose fault it was that biffy disappeared i paused long enough to figure out that biffy was a cat the pair didnt spare me a glance i didnt get much more attention in the lobby the chatelaine was watching tv in the lounge her back to me the five or six people with her were absorbed by the intensity of feeling pounding out of the highperched screen one of them looked up but went back to the show as i started up the stairs i took them two at a time and jogged down to elenas room at a good trot the door was shut i tried the knob then pounded loudly no answer i pounded again but didnt call outif she recognized me shed play possum for the next twentyfour hours finally she yelled in a sleepthickened voice go away ive got a right to my beauty sleep same as you you clothheaded bitch i pounded some more keeping it up steadily until she yanked the door open under my hand she tried shutting it in my face as soon as she saw me but i followed her into the room sorry to break into your beauty rest auntie i said smiling gently isnt it a little risky to call the manager a clothheaded bitch victoria sweetie what are you doing here i came to see you elena ive got some bad news about cerise the violet nightdress still hadnt been laundered the mixture of stale beer and sweat it gave off was overpowering i moved to the window and tried to open it but it had been painted shut with a lavish hand i sat on the bed the mattress was about an inch thick the springs underneath creaked and a little tendril of iron poked through into my buttock cerise sweetie she blinked in the dim light what about her i looked at her solemnly im afraid shes dead the police came and got me at midnight last night to identify her body dead she repeated her face changed rapidly as she tried to decide how to react moving from blankness to outrage it seemed to me that one of the intermediate phases was cunning finally a few tears coursed down her veined cheeks you shouldnt break news to people like this its really wrong of you i hope you didnt go pounding your way into zerlinas hospital room waking her up and telling her terrible things about her daughter gabriella would be ashamed if she knew what youd done really ashamed anyway i thought you were keeping an eye on that poor little girl why did you let her run off and get herself killed she was clearly working hard to build up some anger she kind of did it on her own by the time i got back to dr herschels monday afternoon shed taken off i called the cops and asked them to keep a lookout for her but theres a lot of city and not enough boys in blue to patrol it so she died of an overdose in the bottom of an elevator shaft at a construction site elena shook her head lips pursed together thats terrible sweetie terrible i cant take news like that sprung on me so suddenly why dont you go away and let me digest it on my own ill have to see zerlina and what ill ever say to heryou go on now vicki you were a good girl to come and tell me but i need to be alone i kept the gentle smile on my face and looked up at her earnestly i will elena ill go real soon but first i need you to tell me what little scam you and cerise had decided to run she pulled herself up and gave me a look of outraged dignity scam victoria thats a very ungenteel word but it describes the process to a tee what moneymaking scheme had the two of you fixed on the poor girl isnt even cold and you come here sullying her memory i dont know what gabriella would say she plucked nervously at her gown the thought of my mother brought me a smile of pure amusement shed say tell the truth elenait will hurt coming up but then youll feel healthy again gabriella had held a firm belief in the value of purging well irregardless i dont know what youre talking about i shook my head not good enough auntie you and cerise showed up on my doorstep full of fear over the fate of poor katterina somehow overnight that evaporated cerise pulled a disappearing act and you were playing mighty coy yourself if either of you had been that worried you would have figured out some way to get back in touch with me cerise probably didnt have your phone number she probably couldnt even remember your last name i nodded that wouldnt surprise me but all she had to do was wait at dr herschels clinic and there id be readyloyal conscientious and industrious or whatever the scout motto says no the two of you had something in mind or else you wouldnt have been so reluctant to tell me zerlinas last name i just didnt think you should go badgering her ununh you told zerlina last wednesday she couldnt keep the baby at the indiana arms whatd you do blackmail her for the price of a bottle ugly stuff elena but it saved the kids life you knew when you saw me on sunday that zerlina had sent the baby away i want to know what the hell you were doing and why you dragged me into it the intensity of my feeling brought me to my feet i glared down at my aunt the ready tears filled her eyes you get out of here victoria iphigenia you just leave im sorry i ever even came to you after the fire youre just a damned snotnosed buttinski who cant show any respect to her elders you may think you own chicago but this is my room and i can call the police if you dont leave i looked around the room and my anger faded replaced by shame and a wave of hopelessness elena couldnt back up her threatshe didnt even have a phone all she had was her duffel bag and her sweaty filthy nightgown i blinked back tears of my own and left as i walked away under the empty light fixtures i could hear her scrabble the key in the lock out front the couple had stopped arguing and were making up over a bottle of ripple i walked slowly to my car and sat hunched over the steering wheel sometimes life seems so painful it hurts even to move my arms not donald trump what i wanted was to decamp for some remote corner of the globe where human misery didnt take such naked forms lacking funds for that i could retire to my bed for a month but then my mortgage bill would come and go without payment and eventually the bank would kick me out and then id have some naked misery of my own sitting in front of my building with a bottle of ripple to keep it all out of my head i started the engine and drove north to saul seligmans office on foster it was a shabby little storefront the windows were boarded across the bottom on the top right side seligman property management was lettered on the pane in peeling gold scroll between the boarding and the grime on the glass i couldnt see inside but i thought a light was on the door moved heavily under my hand it had caught on a piece of loose linoleum that worked as an effective wedge when i got inside i tried to tamp it down but it curled up as soon as i took my foot away i gave up and moved to the high scarred barricade separating saul from the world beyond if he was rolling in loot he wasnt putting any of it into the front office the back area held five desks but only one was inhabited a woman of about sixty was reading a library copy of judith krantz her faded blond hair was carefully sculpted in a series of waves her lips moved slightly as she slid one pudgy ringencrusted finger down the page she didnt look up though she must have heard me working on the linoleum maybe the book was due todayshe still had about half to read i can tell you how it comes out i offered she put judith down reluctantly did you want something honey mr seligman i said in my brightest most professional tone hes not in dear her hand strayed for the book when do you expect him hes not on a regular schedule now hes retired i found the latch on the inside of the gate in the barricade maybe you can help me are you the office manager she swelled a bit you cant come barging in here honey this is private public out front i shut the gate behind me im an investigator maam ajax insurance hired me to look into the fire that destroyed one of the seligman properties last week the indiana arms oh she toyed with a wedding band that cut deep into her finger is there some kind of problem arsons always a problem i perched on the corner of the desk adjacent to hers the company wont pay the claim until theyre convinced mr seligman didnt have anything to do with setting the fire she pulled herself up in her seat her pale blue eyes darted fire at me behind her glasses that is an outrageous suggestion the very idea mr seligman would no more do you have any proof to back this up i shook my head im not accusing him of setting the fire i just need to make sure that he didnt he didnt i can promise you that great that means the inquiry will be short and sweet how many properties does he ownbesides the indiana arms i mean mr seligman is the sweetest most honestlook hes a jew okay and im a catholic do you think that ever bothered him when my husband left me and i had my two girls to look after who paid their tuition bills so they could stay on at st inannas and the christmas presents he gave them not to mention me if i said it once i said it a hundred times hed better not let fanny see the kinds of presents he gave me not if he wanted to stay happily married which he was until she died three years ago he hasnt been the same since lost interest in the business but if you think he would have burned down a building youre the one whos crazy when she finished she was flushed and panting a little only a beast would have persisted do you collect the rents in here mrs donnelly she snapped the building managers do that look youd better show me some kind of authorization if youre going to come barging in asking questions i dug my license out of my billfold and handed it to her with one of my cards v i warshawski financial investigations she looked them over suspiciously studying the photo comparing it to me for some reason my face had come out a kind of lobster hue in the picture it always fools people and how do i know youre with the insurance company it was a halfhearted snipe but a valid one you can call the company and ask for robin bessinger in the arson division hell vouch for me id have to get something in writing from themid better walk a copy of my contract for services over tomorrow and pick up a letter of authorization her eye strayed to the phone but she seemed to decide it was too much trouble to fight me any further okay ask what you want but youll never find any proof connecting mr seligman to that fire whats your position with the company mrs donnelly im the office manager her face was braced in fierce lines to deflect any attack on mr seligman and that means you people call in with complaints i get the building super to check them out or the property manager whoever is in charge i arrange for bids if any work has to get done that kind of thing detectives come in asking questions i talk to them it was an unexpected flash of humor i grinned appreciatively how many properties are there she ticked them off on her fingersthe one on ashland the one on fortyseventh and so on seven altogether ending with the indiana arms i noted the addresses so i could drive by them but judging by the locations none of them was a big moneymaker no rents werent down any yes they used to have a lot more people in the office that was when mr seligman was youngerhe used to buy and sell properties all the time and he needed more staff to do that now it was just her and him a team like theyd always been and you wouldnt find a warmerhearted person not if you looked through the suburbs as well as the city great i got up from the edge of the desk and rubbed the sore spot where the metal had cut into my thigh by the way where do you banknot you personally seligman properties the wary look returned to her face but she answered readily enoughthe edgewater national as i was opening the gate something else occurred to me who will take over the business for mr seligman does he have any children involved in it she glared at me again i wouldnt dream of prying into such a personal matter and dont go bothering him hes never really recovered from fannys death i let the gate click behind me wouldnt dream of it indeed she probably knew every thought seligman had had for twenty years even more so now his wife was dead as i urged the door over the loose linoleum i wondered idly about mrs donnellys own children whom the old man had so generously educated before getting into the car i found a phone on the corner to call robin he was in a meetingthe perennial location of insurance managersbut his secretary promised to have a letter of authorization waiting for me in the morning the afternoon was wearing on i hadnt had a proper meal all day just some toast with mr contrerass foul coffee its hard to think when youre hungrythe demands of the stomach become paramount i found a storefront polish restaurant where they gave me a bowl of thick cabbage soup and a plate of homemade rye bread that was so good that i had some raspberry cake and a cup of overbaked coffee before moving farther north to find mr seligman estes is a quiet residential street in rogers park seligman lived in an unprepossessing brick house east of ridge the small front yard hadnt been much tended during the long hot summer large clumps of crabgrass and weeds had taken over the straggly grass the walk was badly broken not the ideal path for an elderly person especially when the chicago winter set in the stairs werent in much better shapei sidestepped a major hole on the third riser just in time to keep from twisting my ankle a threadbare mat lay in front of the door i skidded on its shiny surface when i rang the bell i could hear the bell echoing dully behind the heavy front door nothing happened i waited a few minutes and rang again after another wait i began to wonder if id passed seligman somewhere on ridge just as i was getting ready to leave though i heard the rasp of bolts sliding back it was a clumsy laborious process when the final lock came apart the door opened slowly inward and an old man blinked at me across the threshold he must have been about mr contrerass age but where my neighbor had a vitality and curiosity that kept him fit mr seligman seemed to have retreated from life his face had slipped into a series of soft downward creases that slid into the high collar of his faded beige turtleneck over that he wore a torn cardigan one side of which was partly tucked into his pajama pants he did not look like the mastermind of an arson and fraud ring yes his voice was soft and husky i forced a smile to my lips and explained my errand youre with the police young lady im a private investigator your insurance company has hired me to investigate the fire the insurance my insurance is all paid im sure of that but youd have to check with rita as he shook his head bewildered i caught a glimpse of a hearing aid in his left ear i raised my voice and tried to speak clearly i know your insurance is paid the company hired me ajax wants me to find out who burned down your hotel oh who burned it down he nodded five or six times i have no idea it was a great shock a very great shock ive been expecting the police or the fire department to come talk to me but we pay our taxes for nothing these days let it burn to the ground and dont do nothing to stop it then dont do nothing to catch the people who did it i agree i put in thats why ajax hired me to investigate it for them i wonder if we could go inside and talk it over he studied me carefully decided i didnt look like a major menace and invited me in as soon as hed shut the door behind me and fastened one of the five locks i began to wish id finished the conversation on the stoop the smell combined of must unwashed dishes and stale grease seemed to seep from the walls and furniture i didnt know life could exist in such air the living room where he took me was dark and chilly i tried not to curse when i ran into a low table but as i backed away from it i caught my left leg on some heavy metal object and couldnt help swearing careful there young lady these were all fannys things and i dont want them damaged no sir i said meekly waiting for him to finish fumbling with a light before trying to move any farther when the heavily fringed lamp sprang into life i saw that id tripped on a set of fire irons mysteriously placed in the middle of the room as there was no fireplace perhaps that was the ideal spot for them i threaded my way past the rest of the obstacles and sat gingerly on the edge of an overstuffed armchair my rear sank deep within its soft dusty upholstery mr seligman sat on a matching couch that was close by if you discounted an empty brass birdcage hanging between us now what is it you want young lady he was hard of hearing and depressed but clearly not mentally impaired when he took in the gist of my remarks his sagging cheeks mottled with color my insurance company thinks i burned down my own building what do i pay rates for i pay my taxes and the police dont help me i pay my insurance and my company insults me mr seligman i cut in youve lived in chicago a long time right your whole life well me too you know as well as i do that people here torch their own property every day just to collect on the insurance im happy to think youre not one of them but you cant blame the company for wanting to make sure the angry flush died from his cheeks but he continued muttering under his breath about robbers who took your money without giving you anything in return he calmed down enough to answer routine questions on where hed been last wednesday nighthome in bed what did i think he was a don juan at his age to be gallivanting around town all night can you think of any reason anyone would want to burn down the indiana arms he held up his hands in exasperation it was an old building no good to anybody even me you pay the taxes you pay the insurance you pay the utilities and when the rent comes in you dont have enough to pay for the paint i know the wiring was old but i couldnt afford to put in new youve got to believe me on that young lady why didnt you just tear it down if it was costing you so much youre like everyone today just considering a dollar and not peoples hearts people come to me it seems like every day thinking im a stupid old man who will just sell them my heart and let them tear it down now here you are another one he shook his head slowly depressed over the perfidy of the younger generation it was the first building i owned i put together the money slowly slowly in the depression you wouldnt understand i worked on a delivery truck for years and saved every penny every dime and when fanny and i got married everything went into the indiana arms he was talking more to himself now than to me his husky voice so soft i had to lean forward to hear him you should have seen it in those days it used to be a beautiful hotel we made deliveries there in the morning and even the kitchens seemed wonderful to mei grew up in two rooms eight of us in two rooms with no kitchen all the water hauled in by hand when the owners went bankrupteverybody went under in those days scraped together the money and bought it his faded eyes clouded then the war came and the colored came pouring in and fanny and i we moved up here we had a family then anyway you couldnt raise children in a residential hotel even if the neighborhood was decent but i never could bring myself to sell it now its gone maybe its just as well out of respect for his memories i waited before speaking again looking around the room to give him a little privacy on the low table nearest me was a studio portrait of a solemn young man and a shyly smiling young woman in bridal dress that was fanny and me he said catching my glance its hard to believe isnt it i took him gently through the routinewho worked for him what did he know about the night man at the indiana arms who would inherit the business who would profit by the fire he answered readily enough but he couldnt really think ill of someone who worked for him nor of his children who would get the business when he died not that its much to leave them you start out you think youll end up like rubloff but all ive got to show for all my years is seven wornout buildings he gave me his childrens names and addresses and said hed tell rita to let me have a list of employeesthe building managers and watchmen and maintenance crews i suppose someone could burn down a building if you paid him enough its true i dont pay them much but look at me look how i live im not donald trump after all pay what i can afford he saw me to the front door going over it again and again how he paid his taxes and got nothing and had nothing but paid his employees and would they turn on him anyway as i walked down the front steps i could hear the locks slowly closing behind me gentleman caller there was an errand i couldnt put off before going home i squared my shoulders and drove south through the rushhour traffic to michael reese zerlina was still in her fourpack but one of the beds was empty and the other two held new inmates who looked at me with vacant faces before returning to wheel of fortune zerlina turned her head away when she saw me i hesitated at the foot of her bedit would be easier to take her rejection at face value and go home than to talk to her about her daughter quitters never win and winners never quit i encouraged myself and went to squat near her head youve heard about cerise mrs ramsay the black eyes stared at me unblinkingly but at length she gave a grudging nod im very sorryi had to identify her early this morning she looked terribly young she scowled horribly in an effort to hold back tears what did you do to her you and that aunt of yours to drive her to take her own life im sorry mrs ramsay i repeated maybe i should have tried to find her on monday but she left the clinic where id brought her and i didnt have any idea where she might go i tried talking to elena this morning if she knew anything she was keeping it to herself i stayed another five minutes or so but she wouldnt say anything else nor did her face relent when i got back in the car i sat for a long time rubbing my tight shoulder muscles and trying to imagine a place i could go to find some peace not my apartmenti didnt want to confront either mr contreras or vinnie tonight i was too tired though to drive out to the country too tired to deal with the noise and distraction of a restaurant what i needed was a club of the kind peter wimsey used to retire todiscreet solicitous servants leaving me in total peace yet willing to spring into immediate action at my slightest whim i put the chevy into gear and started north going by side streets dawdling at lights finally hitting racine from belmont and coasting to a halt in front of my building on my way in i stopped in the basement for my laundry some kind soul had taken it from the dryer and left it on the floor my limbs heavy and slow i picked it up one item at a time and put it back into the washer i stayed in the dimly lit basement while the machine ran sitting crosslegged on a newspaper on the floor staring at nothing thinking of nothing when the washer clanked to a halt i stood up to dump my things once more into the dryer easily the equivalent of an evening at the marlborough club it was only when i got upstairs that i remembered giving the servants the day off so there was no dinner ready i sent out for a pizza and watched a magnum rerun before going to bed i returned to the basement for my clothes by a miracle i arrived before one of my neighbors had time to dirty them again thursday morning i brought a contract down to ajax got a letter of authorization from them and proceeded on my investigation i spent thursday and friday tracking down seligmans childrenboth in their fortiesand talking to the different night watchmen janitors and building managers who made up the seligman work team mrs donnellyrita to seligmaneven grudgingly let me look at the books by the end of friday i was reasonably certain that the old man had had no role in the fire his children didnt take any active part in the business one daughter was married to an appliance dealer and didnt work herself the other a marketing manager with a schaumburg wholesaler had been in brazil on business when the fire took place that didnt mean she couldnt have masterminded it but it was hard to see why the two stood to inherit the business and it was possible that they were going to torch the properties for their insurance money to increase the value of the estate but it was a slow way to dubious wealth i didnt write them off but i wasnt enthusiastic about them as candidates either my talks with mrs donnelly left me scratching my head she seemed loyal to the old man but i couldnt help thinking she knew something she wasnt telling it wasnt so much what she said as the sly look i got when the talk drifted to her children and what their expectations of mr seligman might be if it hadnt been for that occasional smirk i would have given seligman a complete pass to ajax on saturday i finally found the night man from the indiana arms he was holed up with a brother on the south side trying to avoid any inquiry into his activities on the night of the fire we had a long and difficult conversation at first he assured me he hadnt left the premises for a minute then he came around to the idea that hed heard a noise outside and gone to investigate finally a combination of threats and bribes brought forth the information that hed gotten a list of the races at sportsman park along with fifty dollars in betting money theyd come in wednesdays mail he didnt know who from he certainly hadnt kept the envelope he didnt think it would matter if he left for an hour or two when he got back lateafter a snort with his buddiesthe hotel was burning beautifully he took one look at the fire trucks and headed for his brothers house on sangamon it was clear that someone had cared enough about burning down the building to study the night man find out he bet the races and know he couldnt resist a free night at the track but that someone wasnt saul seligman i put it all together in a report for ajax wrote out a bill and asked whether they wanted me to pursue the matter further if your primary goal is to find the arsonist then i will try to discover who sent the money since no envelope exists and mr tancredi claims never to have seen any strangers regularly lurking around the premises finding who sent the money will be a long and expensive job if all you want is a strong probability that your insured did not burn his own proprty we can stop at this point i believe mr seligman and his subordinates are innocent of arson after putting it in the mail i walked the ten blocks to wrigley field and watched the cubs die a painful death at the hands of the expos although my hapless heroes were twenty games below five hundred the ballpark was packed i was lucky to get a seat in the upper deck even if i could have gotten a bleacher ticket i dont sit there anymorenbc made such a cult of the bleacher bums when the cubs were in the playoffs that drunk yuppies who dont know the game now find it the trendy place to sit it was after five when i got home a latemodel black chevrolet bristling with antennae was parked illegally next to the hydrant in front of my building i looked at it with the usual curiosity you give an unmarked police car when its next to your home the windows were rolled up and i couldnt see through the smoky glass but when the door opened i saw bobby mallory had been driving himself i was surprised to see himit was the first time hed ever come to my apartment without a formal escort i hurried to the curb to greet him bobby good to see you nothings wrong is it he ran a hand through my hair a rare gesture of affection since i graduated from high school just thought id come by and see you vicki make sure youre not playing with some kind of fire thats likely to burn you i see i tried to keep my tone light while a wall of caution shut down part of my mind is that something you can do in one sentence out here on the sidewalk or do you want to come up for some coffee oh lets go inside be comfortable if youve got decaf that isi cant take coffee late in the day anymore im almost sixty you know yeah i know i wondered if he was trying to pump me obliquely for word on what eileen had planned for the big day but i didnt think hed treat me to such an elaborate routine for that i politely held the door for him and let him precede me up the three flights bobby still on his good behavior ignored the untidy heap of papers in the living room i tried not to feel embarrassed at being caught in such chaos by an old friend of my parents and went to scrounge in my kitchen im afraid im out of decaf i apologized a few minutes later i can give you some juice or a coke or wine no beer though he took a coke one of bobbys fetishes in addition to not swearing in front of me is not to drink with mehe cant get over the idea that hed be encouraging me in immorality he drank a little ate a handful of crackers gestured at the piano and asked if i was still working at my singing my mother had been an accomplished musician an aspiring operatic soprano whose career had been cut short when her family shipped her to america to escape fascism one of bobbys unexpected traits was to share her love of opera she used to sing puccini for him he would be a happy cop if id fulfilled her dream and become a concert singer instead of aping my dad and turning into a detective i had to admit my voice was a little rusty seen any rare birds lately another unexpected hobby of bobbys was photographing birds as he discoursed on taking his two oldest grandchildren to the forest preserve last weekend i wondered how long we were going to pretend that this was just a social call mickeys coming out with us tomorrow he said hes a good boy young man i should say but ive known him since he was born yes hes told me youre his godfather i sipped some coke and watched him over the rim of the glass eileen and i were both hoping you two would hit it off but she keeps telling me you cant force these things hes a sox fan it would never work out even though you like sports and race around playing police you want a guy whos more artistic i didnt know whether to jump down his throat for calling my work playing police or be amazed that he put so much thought into my character maybe i just dont want to be married michael hangs out with a crowd where the wife is the little woman who stays home and has kiddies that may be your dream for me but its not my style never has been and never will be never is a long time vicki he held up a hand as the blood rushed to my face hold your fire im not saying youre wrong just dont get yourself out on a limb where youll saw yourself off rather than admit you changed your mind but thats not what i came to say to you it made me downright mad to think of him and eileen sitting at dinner planning my marriage to his godson maybe truelove will get her mind off wanting to be a boy and play boys games with guns and baseballsas though my life and my choices were of no account i bit back a diatribe yelling at bobby could only put me at a severe disadvantage i havent asked mickey anything about you he went on i figure its his business but hes been like a cat on a hot stove since he saw you clinched with that kid the other night i cant call up and apologize for being found necking at my own front door just go easy on him will you vicki im fond of the boy i dont want an explosion on my staff because youre turning them on and off like faucets i know theres been something between you and john even though neither of you admits it i dont want a blowup between him and mickey or mickey and you you may not believe it but im fond of you too my cheeks flamed again this time with embarrassment theres never been anything between mcgonnigal and me he gave me a lift home last winter in the middle of the night i was beat he thought i looked cute when vulnerable we had one kiss and both knew we couldnt cross that line again since then its been like i was cleopatras asp and im damned if im going to apologize to him for that dont swear vicki its not nearly as attractive as you modern young women think he put his glass down on the magazines covering the coffee table and got up i was talking to monty yesterday afternoonroland montgomery bomb and arson squadhe knows i know you he says youre poking around in that indiana arms fire we asked you not to touch i gave a tight little smile just playing police bobby i wouldnt worry about it since its only a game not the real stuff he put a large hand on my shoulder i know you think youre a big girlwhat are you now thirtyfive thirtysix but your parents are both dead and they were my close friends no ones so big they dont need someone else looking out for them if monty said to keep away from that fire you keep away arsons about the nastiest thing on this planet i dont want to see you messed up in it i closed my lips in a tight ball to keep my ugly words in hed touched about ten raw nerves in five minutes and i was too angry to give any kind of coherent response i saw him to the door without telling him goodbye when i heard his car start i sat at the piano and vented my feelings in a series of crashing dissonant chords yeah i ought to practice ought to keep my voice limber before i got too old and my vocal cords lost their flexibility i ought to be everyones good little girl but for my own selfrespect i needed to solve the arson i got up from the piano and jotted a second note to robin i sent you a report this morning but as ive thought over the case during the day i believe it is critical to locate the person who sent jim tancredi the money for the track it was only when id mailed it that i calmed down enough to wonder why bobby had come to see meto talk to me about michael furey or to warn me off the indiana arms investigation heavy warning bobbys visit left such a bad taste in my mouth that i wanted to tell eileen i couldnt make it to her party but bobby was right about one thingyou shouldnt saw off the limb youre sitting on just to salve your pride i called a couple of friends to see if anyone wanted to take in a movie but everyone was out i left messages on various machines and stomped off to the kitchen to scramble some eggs normally sitting home alone on saturday doesnt trouble me but bobbys visit made me wonder if i was doomed for an old age of crabby isolation i turned on the tv and moodily changed channels youd think saturday night they could offer something enticing for the stayathomes but the networks thought all america was out dancing when the phone rang i turned off the set eagerly thinking maybe someone was returning one of my messages i was startled to hear roz fuentess husky voice she didnt even say hello before she started lambasting me for butting my nose into her business what are you trying to do to me warshawski her voice had recovered its usual rich throaty timbre the vibration through the phone made my ear tingle im not doing anything to you roz dont you have a campaign to run why are you picking on me her rich chuckle came but it lacked mirth velma called me she said you were trying to get her to spill some dirt on me that she put you in your place but she thought i ought to know what kind of dirt are you looking for anyway i bared my teeth at the phone hey rozvelma put me in my place relax vic i gotta know she spoke softly urgentlyit was like listening to the chicago symphony string section this campaign means everything to me and my people i told you that last weekend i cant afford to have someone lying in the bushes waiting for me with a shotgun it had been too long a day for me to make any great display of subtlety roz i dont care if youve been sleeping with boots and the whole county board to get yourself on the ticket what bugs me is you going out of your way to ask me if i was sandbagging you what would even make you think such a thing unless youre getting me to sign on to something im going to be very sorry about later im thinskinned roz it gets me itzy if someone is trying to make a monkey out of me i came to you as a show of respect for our old relationship she said indignantly now you are twisting my friendship into something evil velma was right i should know better than to turn to a white girl with my concerns a white boy is okay though i was thoroughly riled boots can be your ally but i cant go save the chicago hispanics roz but leave me out of it we hung up on that fractured note i was mad enough to call velma to demand chapter and verse on not trusting me just because i was white but a conversation like that can go nowhere constructive sunday morning i got a further indication that the fuentesmeagher pot had something cooking in it when marissa invited me to stop by for drinks that evening something spontaneous and casual was how she put it for people she hadnt spent enough time with at rozs campaign i told her i was truly overwhelmed to be remembered by her and that the thought of such an evening was irresistible marissa had herself well in hand though and refused to be ruffled at five i set out for her lincoln park town house one of those threestory jobs on cleveland where every brick has been sandblasted and the woodwork refinished so it glows warmly marissa rented out the ground floor and lived in the upper two when i got to the top of the first flight she met me in the landing to escort me into what she called her drawing room as usual marissa looked great her idea of casual being bulky red silk trousers a matching pajamastyle top and lots of silver jewelry i hadnt worn jeans but i couldnt help feeling shed dressed with the intention of making me look dowdy the drawing room which had once been the two front bedrooms ran the width of the building its row of mullioned windows looking out on cleveland whatever negative thoughts i had about marissa didnt include her tastethe room was simply but beautifully furnished a highvictorian look predominating complete with red turkish rugs scattered at strategic places an exotic array of plants gave the whole scene warmth when i complimented her she laughed and said it was all due to her sister who owned a plant rental business and rotated fresh shrubbery for her every few weeks let me introduce you to some of the folks vic some fifteen or twenty people were chattering with the ease of familiarity as she led me toward the nearest group the doorbell rang again she excused herself telling me to help myself to a drink and see if i knew anyone id half expected to see roz or even the wunsch and grasso contingent but the only person i recognized was ralph macdonald i tipped my hat to marissashe must be even better connected than id realized for the great man to spend a sunday evening at such a lowprofile function as this he was talking to a couple of bankerlooking types whod dressed down for the weekend in opennecked shirts and sport jackets two women in their little group were talking sotto voce to each other so as not to disturb the boys this sample of good wifely conduct made me gladder than ever i hadnt stood by my own man a lawyer who now lived in palatial splendor in oak brook the bar set in the corner behind one of the trees had just about anything ones heart could desire including a bottle of indifferent champagne the whiskey was j b a brand i can take or leave so i poured myself a glass of the chardonnay it made me feel too much like a lincoln park native for comfort but it wasnt a bad wine i took it over to an armchair and watched marissa return with the newcomers a thirtysomething couple i also didnt recognize she brought them to a clump not too far from me where they were greeted enthusiastically as todd and meryl marissa the perfect hostess stayed to chat then moved to the macdonald group before responding again to the buzzer by and by two women in black slacks and white blouses came in with trays of hot hors doeuvres ralph macdonald moved over with the two women from his huddle just as i was helping myself to a couple of spinach triangles vic im ralph macdonaldwe met at bootss shindig last weekend i remember you of coursebut im surprised you know me i tried to sound suave while hastily swallowing the last of my pastry dont be modest vicyoure a pretty memorable gal the comment was innocuous but the tone seemed charged before i could question him he introduced me to the two women who obviously were as enthusiastic at meeting me as i them they filled small plates with a sample of treats and retired to the bankers as marissa brought another unaccompanied man over to us she introduced him as clarence hinton he and macdonald clearly knew each other reasonably well you remember vic from last sunday ralph marissa stated i was just telling her not to undersell herself he turned to me actually i probably wouldnt have remembered you if i hadnt run into clarence here after you left i shook my head clarence and i were both friends of edward purcell i flushed against my will purcell had been chairman of transicon and the mastermind of a major fraud id uncovered in my first big investigation it wasnt my fault hed committed suicide the day before the federal marshals were coming to pick him up but i had to fight back a defensive retort i forced myself to ask clarence in a neutral voice if he was a developer too oh i play around with putting projects together i dont have macdonalds energy for that kind of thing ralph i want a drink and the lady here needs a refill ill be back in a minute mines bourbon on the rocks macdonald said as hinton turned to the bar to me he added im glad you came vicive been hoping to have a chance to talk to you i raised my eyebrows about edward purcell its been almost ten years oh ive always felt sort of disappointed with teddy for that theres no lick so hard you cant fight it in court especially in this town i said dryly he flashed a smile to let me know he got the joke without finding it particularly funny i dont hold teddy against you no i wanted to talk to you about something more contemporary maybe this was going to be my big breakdetective to the stars my chance to fund an international enterprise that would make my uncle peter swoon with envy before i could ask clarence returned with the drinks and ralph shepherded us down the hall to a small back room it had probably been a maids room in the old days of the house but marissa had decorated it in white on white and used it for watching tv i sat in one of the hardupholstered chairs and smoothed my challis skirt over my knees macdonald stood across from me his foot on the rung of the couch while hinton leaned against the door there was no special menace in their faces but the poses were meant to intimidate i sipped a little wine and waited when it was clear i wasnt going to say anything macdonald began donnel meagher has been chairman of the cook county board for a lot of years and you think the time has come for him to pack it in i asked macdonald shook his head far from it hes developed a political savvy in that time that no one else in this area can match i expect you dont agree with all his positions but im sure you respect his judgment if i respected his judgment id agree with his positions i objected his political judgments macdonald smiled thinly after clarence pointed out who you were i asked around about you the consensus is you consider yourself a wit but with good judgment i couldnt help saying he declined the gambit boots picked rosalyn fuentes for the county slate based strictly on her political merits thats the kind of decision i understand you may have a hard time with in my secret heart i hadnt really expected he wanted to hire me but it was still a letdown to think he only wished to warn me off roz i dont have any trouble with that kind of decision boots is clearly a political mastermind and if roz can get his backing her future looks golden so youre not trying to sandbag her campaign that was hintons first contribution to the discussion you guys are making me awful awful curious i said marissa put the arm on me to go to rozs fundraiser in the name of a decadeold solidarity i shelled out more money than ive ever given a candidate was bored out of my head and was getting ready to leave when roz talked to me just to make sure i wasnt going to do anything to hurt her now you two lock me in a little room to pick my brain i dont know anything about rozs secrets and i wouldnt care what they were if people werent going out of their way to make me wonder it really would be better if you minded your own business this time around hinton said in a toneless voice more ominous than a shout macdonald shook his head shes not going to listen to threats clarenceher whole history makes that clear look vicroz needs bootss support if shes going to win her first countywide contest but boots needs her toothe hispanic wards pretty much vote the way she tells them to that wasnt news to me so i didnt say anything roz committed a major indiscretion in her youth she confessed it all to boots when they were talking over the slate and his opinion was that it wouldnt hurt her if it came out in five years when she had a big base but that it could be pretty damaging to her home support if they learned about it now so someone said something to her at the barbecue that made her think you were probing and she was trying to assure herself that you werent and what was that youthful indiscretion macdonald shook his head even if i knew i couldnt tell youboots is an old political hand and he doesnt share secrets with people who dont need to know them well you know my reputationi dont care if she was screwing the village goat but i dont sign on for fraud macdonald laughed you see vic everyone has a different notion of morality there are plenty more people in humboldt park who would care about the goat than any money shed siphoned off a public works project so dont set up your own standards to run the county by okay i smiled sweetly just as long as no one is making me the goat thats probably what i most care about he came over and helped me to my feet it would take a smarter crew than us to do that lets go back to the partyi want some of those little salmon things before the ignorant mob gets them all when we returned to the drawing room marissa caught ralphs eye anxiously he nodded fractionally to telegraph alls well that id been convinced but of what aunties turning tricks again when i got home the sun had just set and the air was still softly lit i went slowly upstairs to my living room and stood at the window looking out vinnie the banker emerged from our building and climbed into his car a latemodel mazda a gaggle of teenage boys headed south yelling raucous slogans and dumping their potatochip bags onto the sidewalk i let the curtain fall and went to sit in my armchair i didnt want to learn something awful about roz i really didnt i wanted strong women in public office and she was better than most so why did she keep rubbing my face in it i hadnt turned on any lamps in the twilight the room seemed ghostly a place where no living creatures moved the image of cerises dead face came into my mind and i felt an unbearable sadness for the waste that had been her life and again unwanted came the nagging question about what bobby was doing at the site within hours of her body being discovered and what was he doing coming to see me yesterday off and on all day id worried over it like a sore tooth but couldnt put it to rest i had one client ajax to look into one issuehad saul seligman burned down his own building as a host of people from bobby mallory to velma riter and ralph macdonald kept reminding me neither cerise nor roz was any of my business of course the cops thought the indiana arms wasnt any of my business either by and by i got stiffly to my feet and went down to mr contrerass apartment to borrow the dog sometimes he has enough sensitivity to spare me an intrusive barrage tonight mercifully was such a time he handed peppy over to me with a stern adjuration not to feed her cheese or anything else dangerous to her delicate gi tract and returned to the tube i walked peppy around the block before returning to my own apartment she thought that was a pretty miserable excuse for a workout but when i fixed her a plate of spaghettini with dried tomatoes and mushrooms to go with my own she cheered up she wolfed it down and came to lie on my feet while i turned to the phone murray ryerson was chicagos leading crime reporter hed been with the heraldstar for almost eleven years moving from covering the city wire stories to nickelanddime stabbings to now where he was a leading authority on the frequent intersection of crime and politics in town he didnt show any particular enthusiasm at hearing from me at times weve been friendly enough to be lovers but both of us covering the same scene and having strong personalities make it hard to avoid conflict after the latest clash between our jobs murray had been furious he still hadnt warmed up he believed id held back significant chunks of a story until it was too late to use them actually id held back significant chunks that he never even knew about so he probably had a right to a grievance tonight he told me astringently that he was very busy and if it was business it could wait until he was in the office tomorrow does she have a name i asked hopefully make it snappy warshawski im not in the mood it was easy to be brief since i didnt have much to say roz fuentes shes on the county ticket and she thinks i think shes hiding something is she god vic i dont know if you had to bother me at home to ask me that i wouldnt have i interrupted him do you know who ralph macdonald is youre wasting my time warshawski everyone knows macdonald hes the leading contender to put together the package for the new stadiumretailhousing complex i hadnt heard that murray told me loftily i didnt know everything that it was just county scuttlebutt because of boots being tight with macdonald and i dont need you calling me at home catechizing me to remember what an inside track ralph macdonald has in county building projects he and boots grew up together they got big together everyone knows that so come to the point or hang up i scowled at the phone but plowed ahead in my best girl scout style ralph is hanging out with a lady i sort of knowmarissa duncan shes kind of a political pr woman fundraiser that type of thing she trotted him out for me tonight at her lincoln park town house to tell me to lay off roz yeah i know marissa shes at all the right events if she and ralph want you to leave them alone its not newsthey must know what a pain in the ass you are it still could have waited until morning when i didnt say anything he grudgingly allowed that he didnt know of anything about roz that the paper was holding back they do that more often than the trusting public likes to thinkthey dont run a juicy story because it will stub an important advertiser or religious figures toe or even worse they want to wait and drop it like a stink bomb when it will hurt the most people but youll check tomorrow for me i persisted only if i get an exclusive on your obituary warshawski i made a face at the phone the number of french fries you eat im bound to outlive you murray did you see anything about a dead junkie picked up at the rapelec construction site i could feel him trying to figure it out on the phone which was the real reason id called roz or the junkie i missed that one he said cautiously friend of yours in a way peppy got up and started sniffing around the corners i idd her it just seemed strange to me that some of the citys top cops were therethought you might know about it well sorry to have bothered you at homeill talk to you at the paper tomorrow warshawskioh the hell with you go find someone else to run your errands he hung up with a bang peppy had found some dust balls behind the piano that she was bent on eating i retrieved them from her mouth and hunted around for a tennis ball to play a little indoor fetch with her she likes to sit on her haunches and catch the ball without letting it bounce the hitch is i have to go scampering after it if she doesnt make it i was lying on my back pulling it from under the piano when the phone rang i clambered upright to answer the phone and bounced the ball to peppy she watched it go by her with a look of pure disgust and slumped dejectedly onto her forepaws it was michael furey i stiffened at once thinking bobby must have given him a little godfatherly advice on the best way to handle stubborn women furey was ill at ease i didnt do anything to make him relax sorry to bother you so late in the day do you have a minute i need to talk to you about something can i come over is this bobbys idea i demanded well yes i mean not that i come over but you can tell him from me to butt out of my business or ill tell him myself dont make this harder for me than it already is vic shes not just your private business even if you wish she was i held the receiver away from my face and looked at it for a minute youre not calling aboutabout tuesday night i asked stupidly no no nothing like that though i admit i owe you an apology thisits about your aunt and its not real easy talking about it on the phone my heart squeezed shut is she dead no oh no its justlook i hate being the one to do this to you but uncle bobbythe lieutenanthe thought you and i were well since wed been friends it would come better from me than anyone else wild thoughts of elenas somehow being responsible for the fire at the indiana arms clashed with the fear of a drunken stupor turned to disaster i sat on the piano bench and demanded to know what michael was talking about theres no easy way to say this but shes been spotted a couple of times soliciting in uptown mostly old guys but a couple of times young ones who were pretty affronted relief that it was so trivial made me laughthat and the image of elena taking on someone like vinnie the banker or furey himself i hooted so loudly that peppy came over to see what the trouble was its not as funny as all that victhe only reason she hasnt been arrested is because of the connection between your family and the police i was hoping you could go talk to her ask her to stop ill do my best i promised gasping for breath but shes never paid much attention to anything anybody said to her i couldnt help it but started laughing again if i came along he suggested tentatively uncle bobby thought it might make more of an impact if someone from the force was there to back you up tell me the truthhe was too chicken to confront her wasnt he michael hedged on that onehe wasnt about to slander his commander even if bobby was his godfather instead he asked even more hesitantly if i might be free to do it tonight i looked at my watch it was only eightthirty might as well get it over with if shes in shes probably drunk i warned him she wont be the first one ive seen ill pick you up in twenty minutes i still had on the red rayon challis skirt id worn to marissas party i changed it for jeansi didnt want furey to think i was dressing up for him when he rang the buzzer right on time i took peppy back down to mr contreras she was totally miffedno run no games and now she had to stay inside when i was setting out on an adventure that would doubtless include chasing a lot of squirrels and ducks michael had recovered a certain amount of his breeziness he greeted me jauntily asked if id gotten over the shock of identifying cerise and solicitously held the door of the corvette open for me i gathered my legs together and swung them over the side the only possible way to get into that kind of carive always wondered how magnum leapt in and out of that ferrari where does she live he asked starting the car with a great roar i told him the address of the windsor arms but left him to find his own way you never have to give a chicago policeman street directions maybe we should require a year of patrol duty for all wouldbe cabdrivers michael used police privilege to block the hydrant in front of the hotel a couple of drunks came over to inspect the corvette but slid into the night when furey casually let them see his gun when he got inside no one was at the desk i had headed toward the stairs michael behind me when a voice shouted from the lounge hey no one up those stairs but residents we turned to see a man in green work clothes push himself out of a chair and head toward us behind him some mindless sitcom was blaring from the highperched tv in his youth the man had been muscular maybe played high school football but now he was just big and sloppy his belly straining the buttons on his green work shirt michael flashed his white teeth police buddy we need to talk to one of the inmates you got some id anyone can come in here saying theyre police he might be threequarters drunk and run to seed but he had some spunk michael seemed to debate playing a police heavy but when he caught me watching him he pulled his badge from his pants pocket and showed it briefly who you after the night man demanded elena warshawski i said before michael could put out the police noneofyourbusiness line do you know if shes in she aint here how about if we go upstairs and see for ourselves michael said the man shook his head wouldnt do you any good she took off three days ago packed up all her stuff and took off into the night thursday i asked he thought for a minute counting backward yeah thatd be right she in some kind of trouble shes my aunt i said she gets lonesome and tries to find people to keep her company i want to make sure shes okay you know where she went he shook his head i was setting in there watching the two am movie and seen her sneaking down the stairs hey sis aint no law against you coming downstairs in the middle of the night you can walk upright i calls to her she gives a gasp and asks me to go outside to see if the coast is clear none of my business what business people get up to so i goes out and watches her head over to broadway no one was bothering her so i come back inside and thats the last i seen her that was an unsettling scenario something had rattled her badly enough to make her scoot from a secure bed badly enough to keep her from landing at my door can i go up and look at her room i asked abruptly maybe she left something behind some sign of why she bolted the night man scrutinized me through drinksoftened eyes after asking for a look at my drivers license he decided i passed whatever internal test he was running we went back to the stairs and followed him as he trudged heavily to the third floor michael asked me in an urgent whisper if i had any idea where she might have gone hmumh i shook my head impatiently probably the only friend she had from the indiana arms is in the hospital still and doesnt have a place to stay anyway the night man laboriously fiddled with the keys at his belt until he found one to unlock elenas room he flipped a switch that turned on the naked bulb overhead the room was bare elena had left the nylon bedding jumbled it hung over the end trailing on the floor exposing the thin pad of a mattress as a tawdry indictment of the whole room i shook out the bedding the only thing concealed in it was a bra turned gray and shapeless with age elena had emptied the plastic chest nothing remained in the box under the bed since the night man had a master key it was always possible hed been there already to clean it out but as far as i knew elena didnt have any valuables to leave the bra seemed like such a forlorn relic that i folded it and stuffed it in my shoulder bag i shook my head uselessly maybe i could talk to some of the other residents see if any of them know why she might have left the night man rubbed his big hands along the sides of his pants you can of course but when they see your boyfriend here is a cop they probably wont want to talk to you besides i dont think your aunt knew anyone here that good when she was drunk she might have said anything to anyone even people shed never seen before in her life someone shed shared a bottle with would seem like a lifelong friend i asked the night man when he came onhe would be easier to work with than the daytime chatelaine six im off tomorrow and tuesday so if i wanted to question the residents i should do it tonight my shoulders slumped dejectedly michael was watching me sympathetically look vic why dont you put together a good description ill get it out to the uniforms if were looking for her hard we have a good chance of turning her up and itll save some wear and tear on you thanks i smiled gratefully it was that kind of concerned gesture that had always been his most attractive trait we followed the night man back downstairs before we left i decided to secure elenas room for her through october the night mani finally got his namefred camerontook my money and wrote out a receipt in a large clumsy hand back in michaels corvette i gave a careful description of elena including what i could recall of her wardrobe he relayed it through the radio underscoring the urgency of finding her and asking that any sighting be reported directly to him as we turned south i asked when elena had been seen soliciting if shes been seen since thursday the places shes been spotted are probably close to where shes hanging out good point ill check the reports when i get back to the station he swooped around a car in an intersection and speeded into the southbound broadway traffic its that kind of maneuver ive always liked least in him you dont have any idea why she would have taken off like that do you he asked no something must have scared her but i dont know what she was kind of friendly with the young woman who died at the rapelec site i know she was shaken when i told her about it but she didnt take off until late the night after i told her i dont have a clue i suppose i will have to talk to some of the residents he pulled up in front of my building and gunned the engine a bit despite what that guy cameron said vic i think people will talk to me why dont you let me handle ityoure too close to the situation and that always makes for a bad interrogation i agreed readily even willingly after a pause i asked if theyd turned up anything on cerise to explain why shed chosen the rapelec site to shoot up nope we only came out because boots has some money in the project and he wanted to make sure there wasnt anything funny about a dead body there hes sensitive to scandals around election time uncle bobby was plenty mad about being dragged into it i can tell you and ernie was pissed that you came around afterwards i knowhe called and told me michael fiddled with the ignition key look vicim sorry i acted so dumb that night it was just jealousy seeing you with another guy when you told me you were too busy to go out last week he was a potential client one thing kind of led to another vinnies mazda pulled up in front of us he got out with another man a tall loosely knit fellow who seemed to be on pretty friendly terms with him well well who would have thought it i was wondering if i could come in with you sort of patch things up no i said as gently as possible weve been spinning around too much this last week michael i cant put it all back together right now so youll be off screwing this other guy this client he said bitterly none of your business michaelyou know that he slapped the steering wheel but didnt say anything ah hell vic if i make another scene now youll never give me the time of day again ill let you know when we run your aunt to earth i got out of the car id barely shut the door when he was off down racine with a great roar from the engine tearing up the ryan i slept badly my dreams again haunted by elena i was searching for her through the barren corridors of midnight chicago i could hear her whining vicki sweetie where are you when i need you but i never actually saw her michael furey stood nearby shaking his head i cant help you vic because you wouldnt let me inside i got up around seven my neck stiff from my restless sleep i moved sluggishly through my morning routine wondering if i should have invited michael up last night would he still question elenas hotel mates as thoroughly since id sent him packing should i try to do it myself did i even care where my aunt had gone let alone why even as the last bitter thought went through my head i felt ashamed who else did she have to care about her if not me maybe zerlina ramsay i considered her of course relations between the two were a bit peculiar but she might be someone elena would consider a friend i drank a second cup of coffee then took peppy on a hurried minirun to the lake by the time i showered and changed into a respectable pair of trousers a cottonramie beige sweater and a good jacket it was still just shy of nine the penalty for rising and shining early is lolling in traffic if id had a proper breakfast instead of toast while i dressed id have gotten to the hospital just as fast as it was i only met with disappointmentzerlina had checked out on friday no the hospital didnt know where shed gone and even if they did they really couldnt tell me i stomped back to the chevy in annoyance how the hell would i ever find her all i knew about her was that her granddaughters other grandmother was called maisie cerises boyfriends first name was otis that gave me a great starting pointcomb every apartment in chicago asking for otis or maisie and when people answered to those names find out if they knew someone named zerlina zerlinas knowing anything was a long shot anyway id only gone zooming down to the hospital because it was something to do otherwise i was better off leaving the search for elena to the police they had the resources michael had broadcast her description someone would find her i drove back north to the loop parking my car in the underground garage until ajax asked me to proceed i couldnt justify any further work on the indiana arms it was time to do some of my breadandbutter financial work and to send out query letters to small or midsize firms who could use my expert advice after going to my office to pick up the client letters with the names of their wouldbe executives i headed to the daley center somehow though instead of looking up john doe and jane roe i found myself checking on rosalyn fuentes and her cousin luis schmidt no one was after roz but luis had started several actions a couple of years back hed sued the city for turning down his bid to repave the parking lot at the humboldt park community service center he claimed that they had discriminated against him as a hispanic in favor of a black contractor who was a crony of the mayors that action went back to more recently in he had sued the county on similar charges this time for not getting the job to build a new court building in deerfield his partner carl martinez had been a party to both suits hed withdrawn the complaints about six months ago without a settlement that sounded as though someone had slipped him a few bucks to soothe his hurt feelings i shrugged if it had happened that way it wasnt savory but it was just too common to be the kind of dynamite that would cost roz an election if chicago has one law that everyone obeys its look out for your own still thinking back over bootss party it seemed to me it was luis who had warned roz about meit was only after hed been talking to her pointing at me that shed come back and sought me out i went upstairs to look at partnership and corporation filings roz owned a minority interest in alma mejicana her cousins contracting business but no one could conceivably imagine that as even a venial sin if ralph macdonald had been telling the truth and roz was hiding a youthful indiscretion then maybe something had happened in her mexican childhood if so i didnt give a damn and i didnt see why she would expect me to none of your business vic i said aloud remembersome people think youre a pain in the butt a man using the microfiche reader next to me looked up affronted i stared intently at the screen in front of me pursed my lips scribbled a note and pretended i hadnt heardor saidanything it really was time to get to my clients still i made a genuine note writing down schmidts name alma mejicana and the address on south ashland maybe there was a way to get a look at his sales figures or i could go over to the county side and see if any contracts had been going to schmidt recently that turned out to be a fruitless idea they did keep a list of contracts of course but i had to know the project name to find out whod gotten the bid they were not going to let me go through the myriad files looking for one contractor i sucked on my teeth now it was really time to get to work as i turned to leave the door at the end of the corridor opened and boots came in a handful of men listening as he made a forceful point he caught sight of me and gave the legendary smile and a wave on his way into his office he hadnt remembered me personally but knew he knew me it was a strange sensationagainst my volition i felt myself warmed by his recognition and smiling eagerly in return perhaps to dispel the hold his magic had on me i butted one step further into rozs business i called alma mejicana said i was with osha and wanted to know where they were pouring today the man who answered the phone speaking minimal english in a heavy accent couldnt understand my question after a few fruitless exchanges he put the phone down and went to fetch someone else id met luis schmidt only once but it seemed to me that the suspicionladen voice belonged to him just in case he had an acute aural memory i sharpened my tone to the nasality of the south side and repeated my pitch he cut me off before i could get my whole spiel out we have no problems we dont need anybody coming to watch us especially not osha spies im not suggesting you do have problems it was hard to be glib and nasal at the same time weve been told that minority contractors in chicago are allowed sloppier safety practices than whiteowned enterprises were doing a random spot check to make sure that isnt the case that is racism he said hotly i do not allow racists to look at my work period now disappear before i sue you for slander im trying to help you out i started with nasal righteousness but he hung up before i could finish the sentence okay alma mejicana didnt want osha hanging around their construction sites nothing bizarre about that a lot of businesses dont want osha crews so leave it alone vic get back to projects for people who are paying you it was that sage advice that took me over to the university of illinois library to look up alma mejicana in the computer index to the heraldstar and to my joy they had gotten part of the dan ryan reconstruction in a february story the paper listed all the minorityand womenowned businesses participating in the project the suits luis had filed must have made an impression on the feds when they handed out the ryan contracts i remembered the protest from black groups over the small number of minority contractors involved given chicagos racioethnic isolationism i didnt suppose they were appeased to see alma mejicana eating part of the pie with a certain amount of selfdeception i could make myself believe that i would pass the ryan construction anyway on my way back to the loop it wouldnt really count as an additional detour from my legitimate business to check out luis i went on down halsted to cermak then snaked around underneath the expressways legs looking for a way to get at the construction zone cars and trucks were parked near the lake shore drive access ramp i pulled the chevy off the road into the rutted ground below the main lanes of traffic and left it next to a latemodel buick once again i was badly dressed for a construction site although my linenweave slacks werent quite as inappropriate as my dress silk pants had been i picked my way through the deep holes around pieces of convulsed rebars that had fallen down past the debris of ten thousand sack lunches and hiked up the closed southbound ramp as i got close to the top the noise of machinery became appalling monsters with huge spiked arms were assaulting concrete driving cracks ten feet long in their wake behind them came an array of automated air hammers smashing the roadway to bits and in their wake rumbled trucks to haul off the remains hundreds of men and even a few women were doing other things by hand i surveyed the carnage doubtfully from the edge of the ramp wondering how i could ever get anyones attention let alone find one small contractor in the melee now that i was here i hated to just give up without trying but i should have worn work boots and earmuffs in addition to a hard hat dressed as i was i couldnt possibly climb around the machinery and the gaping holes in the expressway floor when i moved tentatively toward the lip of the ramp a small man made rotund by a layer of work clothes detached himself from the nearest crew and came over to me hardhat area miss his tone was abrupt and dismissive are you the foreman i asked he shook his head dozens of foremen around here who you looking for someone who can point out the alma mejicana crew to me i was having to cup my mouth with my hands and yell directly into his ear as it was he needed me to repeat the request twice he gave the look of pained resignation common to men when ignorant women interrupt their specialized work therere hundreds of contractors here i dont know them all thats why i want the foreman i screeched at him talk to the project manager he pointed to a semi trailer rigged with electric lines parked beyond the edge of the road and next time dont come around here without a hard hat turning on his heel he marched back to his crew before i could thank him i staggered across the exposed rebars to the verge like the area underneath the expressway this had become a quag of mud broken concrete and trash my progress to the trailer was necessarily slow and accompanied by a number of catcalls i grimaced to myself and ignored them inside the trailer i found chaos on a smaller scale phone and power lines were coiled over every inch of exposed floor the rest held tables covered with blueprints phones computer screensall the paraphernalia of a big engineering firm consolidated into a small space at least a dozen people were crammed in with the equipment talking to each other orbased on shouted snatches i caughtto the crews in the field no one paid any attention to me i waited until the man nearest me put down his phone and went up to him before he could dial again i need to find the alma mejicana crew who can tell me where theyre working he was a burly white man close to sixty with a ruddy face and small gray eyes you shouldnt be on the site without a hard hat i realize that i said if you can just tell me where theyre working ill get a hard hat before i go out to talk to them you got any special reason for wanting them his small eyes gave away nothing are you the project manager he hesitated as if debating whether to claim the title then said he was an assistant manager who are you it was my turn to hesitate if i came up with my osha story or a similar one id have to produce credentials i didnt want luis to know id been poking around his business but it couldnt be helped v i warshawski i said im a detective some questions have come up about alma mejicanas work practices he wasnt going to field that one on his own he got up from his table and threaded his way to the back of the trailer where a tiny cubicle had been partitioned off his bulky body filled the entrance i could see his shoulders move as he waved his arms beyond my field of sight eventually he returned with a slender black man im jeff collins one of the project managers what is it you want v i warshawski i shook his proffered hand and repeated my request work practices are my responsibility i havent heard anything to make me question what theyre doing you have a specific allegation i could respond to he wasnt hostile just asserting his authority since i didnt know anything about construction practices i could scarcely talk about their equipment my brain raced in search of an idea i do financial investigations i said putting it together as i spoke my client thinks almas way overleveraged that theyve taken on projects they cant handle just so they can claim theyre eating at the same table with the big boys hes worried about his investment i wanted to look at their equipment to see if they own it or lease it it wounded woefully thin to me but at least collins didnt seem to find it bizarre you cant go on the site looking for that kind of thing ive got several thousand men out there everything theyre doing is carefully coordinated i just cant allow unauthorized civilians out there i was going to argue my case but he frowned in thought chuck he said abruptly to the ruddy white man call down there and ask about their trucks give the lady the report to me he added thats the best i can do for you and its more than i should i appreciate it i said with what sincerity i could muster it actually didnt satisfy me at alli wanted to see alma at work see if anything strange jumped out at me just by looking at them but i had no choice the dan ryan construction zone was not a location i could infiltrate collins returned to his office and chuck got on the phone again after ten or fifteen minutes of shouted conversation with a variety of people he beckoned me to his table i thought they were in sector fiftynine but theyd been moved to a hunnert and twentyone i dont think you have to worry about them paying for their trucksall the stuff they have on site belongs to wunsch and grasso when i looked at him blankly he repeated the information in a louder voice i pulled myself together gave him my sweetest smile and thanked him as best i could stonewalled by the time i got back to the loop it was too late to use any of the daley center reference rooms i parked illegally in front of the pulteney so i could check my messages when i got into the elevator it took a few minutes for me to realize it wasnt moving so lost in thought was i as i climbed the four flights i kept turning it over in my mind how strange was it really for luis to be using wunsch and grasso machinery it had hit me like a bolt at the trailer but it might not mean that much luis and his partner knew ernie and ron that was clear from their close confab at bootss party if alma mejicana was struggling to find a toehold in the chicago construction business they might well lease equipment from a bigger firm mind your own business vic i chanted out loud as i unlocked my office if roz is hiding dirt from her girlhood its not your affair i turned on the lights and checked in with my answering service robin had called as had darrough graham wanting to know where in hell his report was i called graham first since he was a promptly paying customer told him id been away for a few days and that id get the job done tomorrow he wasnt happy but weve been working together a long timehe wasnt going to break up over this still i could not continue ignoring my good clients while i waited for the receptionist to hunt down robinhed asked to be interrupted for my calli pulled a pad of newsprint out from behind my filing cabinet using a thick magic marker i drew up a list with time lines of all my current assignments still propping the receiver under my ear i took the sheet and taped it to the wall facing my desk thats your work i lectured myself sternly do not do anything else until all those tasks are accomplished vic robins voice cut into my lecture are you there oh hi robin just thinking aloud when you work by yourself you cant tell the difference between speech and thought oh i wonder if isolation is too big a price for working alone we chatted for a few minutes about that and about whether id like some company for dinner when i agreed he switched to business your report came in todayyour two reports i went over them with my bosswe decided we want you to do some more checking im not questioning your assessment of the old mans character but somebody got that night watchman out of the way it was clearly someone who knew his habits so it had to be either a resident or a person in the seligman operation or an outside party who was watching him i put in yeah i suppose the trouble is the only person who really benefits from the fire is the old manor his children if he dies before we pay the claim i want to make sure seligman didnt send the guy money for the track can you give us another week i looked at my time lines if i did grahams project tomorrow morning i could stretch the rest of my work around the ajax job and still get it all done by the end of fridayas long as i didnt take any more time to worry about roz about why my call to velma had prompted her to sic ralph macdonald on me and all the rest of it you still there vic yup yeah i guess i can give you guys another week are you going to pay my current bill or do you want me to give you a new one with all my hours after i finish this next stint weve already sent that one through for payment youll get a check in ten days or so you say seligmans not losing money but hes not making much either i drew a circle on the newsprint with my magic marker i dont think he cares that much i can try to find his old books see how profits compare with fifteen or twenty years ago but he just doesnt strike me as a guy pining over his lost billions well do some more hunting see what you can find i know you wont let your bias for the guy cloud the way you look at the evidence see you at seventhirty right right it was couched as a compliment but it was really a warning impetuosity is the detectives worst enemy i added eyes and a nose to the circle and gave it some whiskers despite robins warning i couldnt believe in the old mans guilt not unless he had some personality aberration that hadnt come through the two times id spoken with him robin was right though seligman had the glaring financial motive of course his children would inherit the estate and maybe they were savvy enough to torch the building now so that they wouldnt come under suspicion when he died i gave the face a floppy suit and a hand held out asking for money someone at the indiana arms might have seen something she was too circumspect to come forward withwhen you live in the margins you learn not to make yourself conspicuous if i could locate any of these former residents maybe i could persuade them to talk to me maybe i should get photos of the younger seligmans from the old man and show thosealthough of course they could easily have hired someone to do the legwork it didnt matter that the daughter had been in brazilshe still could have engineered the fire the problem with this plan was that even if rita donnelly would give names of any of the old inhabitants it would take an army to find out where theyd moved after the fire of course i had two residentszerlina ramsay and my aunt i didnt know where either of them was but that was a trifling problem for an intelligent investigator it dawned on me that i might find zerlina through the morgue if she had collected cerises body they would have a record of her address what i needed was someone who could get that for me a police officer could do it but i could hardly call furey for help and then deny him the chance to spend personal time with me bobby would rather see me dead than help me with an investigation at least hed rather see me in jail john mcgonnigal was acting kind of aloof to me these days there was someone on bobbys staff who didnt feel particularly hostile toward me terry finchley i wouldnt say we were friends but all our interactions in the past had been pleasant and once a few years ago hed told me he liked the way i stood up for my friends it was worth a try by a miracle finchley was at the station he expressed cautious pleasure at hearing from me i need a favor i said abruptly i know that miss warshawski you wouldnt have called otherwise its not about furey is it he had a light pleasant tenor with a hint of humor in it no no i assured him of course everyone in bobbys unit would be aware of the ups and downs of michaels and my relationship i told him about cerise and my wanting to find zerlina when he answered again his voice was cold as he said he didnt think that was an appropriate use of his time it probably isnt but i think theyd respond to a query from you where they wouldnt from me ask furey or mcgonnigal he spoke with finality detective i said quickly before he could hang up i called you because i didnt feel able to call them i know i know them better than you that we dont know each other that well but i thought you wouldnt mind its not aa menial task its one the police can do and i cant i need to find mrs ramsay to see if she saw anything when he didnt respond my voice trailed away in a tangle of hopeless syntax im sorry i wont bother you another time you say you didnt feel able to call furey or mcgonnigal why i was starting to get annoyed myself its not really your business detective its totally personal and i know personal business is a happy topic for public discussion in the squad room i see he was silent for a minute thinking then he said abruptly its not because im black oh i felt my cheeks flame because mrs ramsay is no i wasnt thinking about that im sorry it didnt occur to me it would look that way i forgive you he said with a return to his easier tone this time anyway next time look before you leap and go easy on fureyhes not a bad guy just rough around the edges whats your number i gave it to him and he hung up i went to the window and watched the l cart commuters past i couldnt make up my mind whether id been out of line or whether finchley overreacted the problem was he probably got so many slights so many hours of the week that it didnt matter what my intentions werethey came out sounding like the crap he was used to hearing i looked at the pigeons checking each other for lice regardless of the color of their plumage on the surface the animal kingdom looked healthier than us humanoids but one day last summer when a gull had joined them on the ledge the pigeons had pecked and squawked at it until it left its neck bloody i went back to my desk and read the junk mail that had come in the last few days seminars on how to manage my office better seminars on improving surveillance techniques special offers on weapons and bullets i swept it all into the garbage impatiently finally irritated with myself for neglecting my business too much the last few weeks i went through my file of potential customers and started typing query letters id done three when the phone rang it wasnt finchley but someone from the morguehed asked her to call me directly cerises body had been released to otis armbruster at an address on christiana i thanked the woman and pulled out my city map sixteen hundred south christiana is not in the happiest part of town its not a great place for any woman to be alone at night especially a white one i considered putting it off until the morning then my discomfort over my talk with finchley returned if cerise or zerlina navigated those streets i could too just as i was turning out the lights furey called i tensed at first thinking finchley might have been discussing our conversation with him but he was calling about elena you havent heard from her have you he asked because we got another soliciting complaint last night from a bar in uptown thats trying to cater to yuppies and it sounded like it might have been her i rubbed the back of my neck trying to ease out some of the stiffness i havent heard from her but im leaving now to see a woman she knew pretty well at the indiana arms ill see if elenas checked in with her you want me to come along he tried unsuccessfully to cloak his eagerness no thanks shes not going to be real eager to talk to me to begin with the sight of a police officer will cause a total shutdown give me a call later okay let me know if you learn anything sure i stood up again ive got to go bye i hung up before he could ask anything more like zerlinas name and address and left quickly to avoid any more calls i took the stairs down two at a timewhen going on an unpleasant errand do it as fast as possible the chevy had a parking ticket stuck under the wipers crime does not pay in chicago especially for loop parking offenders i went down van buren took a look at the slow line of cars on the congress and elected to go by side streets wabash to twentysecond street was a good run once i was clear of the expressway interchanges the westbound traffic also moved well it was only a few minutes after six when i turned north onto christiana at this point i was about seven miles southwest of the rapelec complex on navy pier if cerise had been living here why had she gone all that way to find a quiet place to shoot up i couldnt make sense of it vacant lots interspersed with gray stone threeflats made up the street their broken or boarded windows showed the buildings tottering on the edge of collapse during the day it looked like beirut now the purple twilight softened the worst outcroppings of rubble in the lots muting the abandoned cars into soft dark shapes the only businesses seemed to be the taverns sprinkled liberally on every corner there were few cars out someone rode on my tail from cermak to seventeenth making me rather nervous but when i finally slowed and moved to the right he darted around me with a great blaring of horn it was a ghost town seemingly uninhabited except for the occasional knot of young men arguing or joking in front of the bars i pulled up across from the armbruster apartment it was another stone threeflat lights shone yellow through the sheets covering the firstand secondstory windows the third floor was boarded up as i walked up the crumbled sidewalk i could hear a radio blaring loudly inside the entryway a strong scent of pinesol showed someone making an effort to overcome the urine it was almost successful but the stench still lingered underneath turning my stomach presumably the same hand had screwed a grate over the sprung mailboxes the postman could get letters through but you had to unlock the grate to get them out the armbrusters were on the second floor no stairwell lights existed i picked my way slowly in the dark testing each stair before putting weight on it twice a major portion of the tread was missing and my heart lurched as nothing but air met my foot at the secondfloor door an infants howling mixed in with the radio i pounded on the door with the side of my closed fist on the second try a deepvoiced woman demanded to know who was there its v i warshawski i yelled ive come to see mrs ramsay the door held a peephole i positioned myself so that my clean honest face would be visible from the other side for a while nothing happened then the radio and the baby stopped almost simultaneously i could hear someone undoing a series of locks when the door opened a thin middleaged woman faced me holding a baby the childs soft cheeks were still wet with tears she turned her head away when she saw me watching her and buried her chubby hands in the thin womans tight bun something about the immovable tidiness of the womans hair and the severe ironing of her dress made me think she was responsible for the pinesol in the lobby zerlina stood behind her overshadowing her both in girth and in the rich blackness of her skin i presumed the other woman was maisie and that she held katterina how did you find me zerlina demanded the morgue gave me the address of the person who took cerises body it was just a guess that youd be here but youd talked about otis and about katterinas other grandmother so i thought you might all be together all the light was behind them i had to squint to see their faces but i thought it would be better if i waited to be invited in no one seemed in a hurry to do so you cant come around hounding people in the privacy of their homes maisie growled jiggling the baby to let her know the anger wasnt for her i rubbed my face tiredly someone burned down a big hotel two weeks ago no one died but a lot of people were hurt including mrs ramsay shes the only person i know who might be able to give me some help in finding out who did it im not the only person you know little white girl as youre well aware zerlina said ask that precious aunt of yours the last time i talked to elena i told her about cerise that scared her so much she ran away from home shes been hiding on the streets ever since i figure youre made of sterner stuff her strong face set into stubborn lines you figure what you want to between the two of you that aunt of yours and you got my daughter dead i dont have nothing more to say to you before maisie could slam the door in my face i pulled out a card and gave it to zerlina if you change your mind you can call me at that number someone takes messages twentyfour hours a day before shed bolted the first lock the radio started again the insistent beat of the rap music followed me down the stairs and into the night asleep in a basement room i spent the night at robins he was a sweet and thoughtful lover but he couldnt wipe the decay of north lawndale from my mind falling into a fitful sleep around one i was jerked awaked by a dream in which i was walking up christiana while a car trailed me i woke up just before it ran over me i fumbled around on the night table for my watch squinting in the dark i could just make out the hands fourten i lay down again and tried to go back to sleep in a strange bed though with the memory of a bad dream lingering i couldnt relax finally a little after five i gave it up and tiptoed into the bathroom with my clothes in the kitchen i found a spiral notebook next to the phone i tore out a page and scribbled a note to robin explaining why i was taking off and slipped out quietly at fivethirty the city was barely coming to life lights burned in a number of apartment windowsthis was a neighborhood of hard workers who started the day early but i was alone on the road until i hit a main artery when i got to my own place i felt tired enough to go back to bed this time i managed to sleep until eight when i got up again i felt groggy and disoriented i pulled on a sweatshirt and a pair of underpants and sat in the kitchen reading the paper and drinking coffee until past nine when furey called i thought you were going to phone me last night vic i didnt like the angry impatience in his tone i thought so too michael but it slipped my mind if id had anything to report i might have remembered but the woman wouldnt even let me in the front door why dont you give me her name and ill give it a try he dropped the anger for indulgent coaxing why dont you give it a rest furey elena isnt doing anyone any harm out there you must have a godzillian murders and rapes and stuff to keep you happy shell turn up in due course drunk and repentant and in the meantime i dont think she needs all this city money lavished on her the only reason were doing it is because uncle bobby wanted to save you the embarrassment of bailing her out of womens court he said stiffly if i had any say in the matter i wouldnt be wasting time looking for her then ill call bobby and tell him i dont care i caught sight of the clock and suddenly remembered my time lines damn it all i should have been at daley center twenty minutes ago to get a jump on darrough grahams project sorry michaelive got to run wait vic he said urgently dont tell the lieutenant hed take a stripe off my butt if he knew id been complaining to you okay i agreed irritated but in that case stop riding me the second i see her or hear from her ill let you know goodbye i slammed down the receiver and ran into my bedroom as i was zipping my jeans the phone rang again i let it go at first thinking it was probably furey then gave in to the pressure of the bell i want victoria warshawski the accented voice belonged to the man id spoken to yesterday at alma mejicana he pronounced it warchassy after saying it correctly i asked who wanted her this is luis schmidt warchassy a little bird told me you been prying into my work crew down at the ryan im calling to tell you to mind your own business i think you have the wrong number i took the phone from my ear while i pulled a yellow cotton sweater over my head theres no one here named warchassy this aint victoria warchassy the private dick he demanded angrily im a private investigator but my last name is warshawski i kept my tone affable thats what i been saying bitch im talking to you if you know whats good for you keep your damned nose out of other peoples business oh looey looey you just said the magic word i purely hate it when strange men call me a bitch you just bought yourself a whole lot of interest in what alma mejicana is doing down at the ryan im warning you warchassy to butt out of what dont concern you or you could be very very sorry the phone slammed in my ear i tied my running shoes and took the stairs two at a time behind mr contrerass door i could hear peppy whining she recognized my step and wanted to come with me it wasnt fair to make her hang out with mr contreras all dayhe couldnt run her properly but i just couldnt stop for her i felt close to screaming at the pressure of all the demands on me the dog furey elena herself graham my other clients and now my bravado to luis schmidt well damn him anyway for calling up with stupid threats if only i could get a few bucks ahead of the game id take some time off just get clean out of this town for six months i ground my teeth at the futility of the idea and savagely jerked the chevy into gear by three oclock i had finished an exhaustive search into the life and loves of grahams prospective marketing vice president in the report i included the fact that the guy had a steady girlfriend along with his wife and infant sonnot that graham would care it would make me run ten miles in the opposite direction but graham didnt think what happened below the belt had any bearing on job performance not until i had typed up the report and sent it across the loop by messenger did i break for lunch by then hunger had given me a nagging headache although i felt better mentally for being able to cross a major task off my time chart i went to a vegetarian café around the corner for soup and a bowl of yogurt that took care of the hunger but my headache grew more intense i tried ignoring it tried to make myself think about luis schmidt and his anger at my visit to the ryan construction site my head hurt too much for logic when i retrieved the chevy from the underground garage i wanted just to drive home and go back to bed but all the time id wasted lately was still haunting me i slogged north to saul seligmans house he wasnt happy to see me nor did he want to let me have pictures of his children it took every ounce of energy i had to keep being gentle and persuasive through the blinding pain thudding in front of my eyes in your place id be angry too you have a right to expect service for the premiums you pay unfortunately there are just too many dishonest people out there and the good guys get stuck as a result we went on like that for fortyfive minutes finally seligman made an angry gesture he moved to a massive secretary in one corner and opened its rollaway top a pile of papers cascaded to the floor he ignored those and pawed through a drawer behind the remaining papers until he found a couple of photos i suppose youd stay here until dawn if i didnt give you these i want a receipt then go leave me alone dont come back unless youre telling me youve cleared my name the pictures were both group shots taken at some kind of family party his daughters stood in the middle on either side of his wife while rita donnelly and two other young women flanked them those two were presumably her daughters but i didnt much care at this pointi was having too much trouble seeing i pulled a small memo pad from my bag to write out the date and a description of the pictures for seligman the letters danced around the page as i wrote i wasnt sure my note made sense seligman stuck it in the secretary rolled the top back down and hustled me out the door i drove home more by luck than skill by the time i got there i was shivering and sweating i managed somehow to make it upstairs to my bathroom before being sick i felt a little better after that but crept off to bed putting on a heavy sweatshirt and socks before crawling under the blankets as i got warm my tense neck and arm muscles relaxed and i drifted into a deep drugged sleep the ringing phone brought me slowly back to life i was buried so far down in sleep that it took some time to connect the noise with something outside me after a long spell of weaving the ringing in with my dreams my mind finally swam lazily back to consciousness i felt newly born the way you do when an intense pain has been washed out of your system but the insistent bell wouldnt let me enjoy it finally i stuck out an arm and picked up the receiver hlo my voice was thick and slurred vicki vicki is that you it was elena crying extravagantly i looked at the clock readout in resignation oneten only elena would rouse me at this godawful time yes auntie its me calm down stop crying and tell me what the trouble is ioh vicki i need you youve got to come and help me she was well and truly panicked i sat up and started pulling on the jeans id left on the foot of the bed tell me where you are and what kind of trouble youve got ioh she started sobbing heavily then her voice disappeared for a moment i thought id lost the connection but then i realized she was covering up the mouthpiece or someone else had covered it shed been running away and her pursuers had caught up with her i waited in an agony of indecision thinking i should hang up and summon furey not wanting to hang up until i was sure id lost her since i had no idea where to send police resources i waited and after a couple of heartwrenching minutes she came back i ran away she sniffed dolefully poor little elena got scared and ran so she hadnt been in mortal terror just rehearsing her act i kept my voice light with an effort i know you ran away auntie but where did you run to ive been living in one of the old buildings near the indiana arms its been abandoned for months but some of the rooms are still in real good shape you can sleep here and no one will see you but now theyve found me vicki theyll kill me youve got to come help me are you in the building now theres a phone at the corner she hiccoughed theyll kill me if they see me i couldnt go outside in the daylight youve got to come vickithey cant find me here who will kill you elena i wished i could see her face instead of just hearing herit was impossible to sort out how much truth she was spouting along with the rest of it the people whove been after me she screamed just come vicki stop asking so many goddamn questions youre like a goddamn tax collector okay okay i said in the soothing voice one uses with infants tell me where the building is and ill be there in thirty minutes just kittycorner to the indiana arms she calmed down to a quavering sob on indiana or cermak i tied my running shoes inindiana are you coming im on my way just stay where you are by the phone call if you think someone really is coming i turned on the bedside lamp dialing fureys home number i carried the phone over to my closet it rang fifteen times before i gave up and tried the station the night man said michael wasnt in neither were bobby finchley or mcgonnigal i hesitated undoing the safe in the back of my closet where i keep my smith wesson finally i explained that bobby wanted elena found and that michael had been assigned to look for her she just called me from an abandoned building on indiana she says shes in troublei dont know if she is or not but im on my way down there to get her id like furey and the lieutenant to know he promised to put out a call on the radio to michael for me with the address i set the phone on the closet floor while i checked the clip it was full and the ninth bullet was chambered i carefully made sure the safety was on put a shoulder holster over my sweatshirt and left when i got to the bottom peppy started barking anxiously behind mr contrerass door she hadnt seen me all day shed missed her run and she was determined i wasnt going to leave without her her barking followed me down the walk to the street as i was getting into the chevy vinnie stuck his head out his front window he yelled something but i was already rolling and didnt hear him i headed for lake shore drive the dan ryan would decant me closer to the site but i wasnt up to dealing with the construction and detours in the dark for the same reason i left the drive at congress and went down michigan avenue instead of negotiating the spaghetti behind mccormick place the moon was nearly full once id slid past the streetlamps onto south michigan its cold light created blackandwhite stills objects highlighted with unnatural clarity their shadows pitch black i was feeling a little weak still from being sick and from having eaten only once in the last twentyfour hours but my mind was wonderfully clear i could make out every drunk on the benches in grant park and when i turned onto cermak and up onto prairie i could even see the rats slithering through the vacant lots in the moonlight the near south side looked like postwar berlin the lifeless shells of warehouses and factories were surrounded by mountains of brickfilled rubble when i got out at twentyfirst and prairie i was shivering from the desolation of the scene i took a flashlight from the trunk and stuck it in my jacket pocket i took the smith wesson from my shoulder holster and crept along the shadows on twentyfirst holding it in my right hand the cold metal brought me little comfort i was wound up enough to take aim at a passing alley cat it snarled at me its eyes glinting in the moonlight as it passed even as my heart pounded i wondered how much of elenas panic to believe in i remembered all the times shed gotten tony out of bed with urgent alarms only to have them dissolverevealed as the phantasms of her drinking this might easily turn into another such eveningmaybe i shouldnt even have roused furey my lingering doubts didnt make me careless when i got to indiana i stayed awhile in the shadow of an abandoned auto parts dealer straining my eyes and ears for any kind of movement id worried about finding elenas hideout from her vague directions but there was only one hotel on the street besides the indiana arms the moonlight picked out the dead neon lights of the prairie shores hotel halfway down the block on my side of the road i heard a rustling across the street and knelt the gun cocked again but it was large plastic bag dragged loose from the rest of the garbage by the ubiquitous rats against my will i saw their yellow teeth tearing my exposed hands they felt tingly and uncontrolled and i hugged them under my armpits the gun digging into my left breast i gritted my teeth and headed down indiana across from me loomed the burnedout hull of the indiana arms the sharp night air carried the acrid scent of its charred beams to me and i fought back a sneeze when i got to the corner i could see the pay phone but not my aunt i prowled around the street for a few minutes tempted to return to my bed finally i squared my shoulders and went over to the prairie shores hotel its front was boarded shut i cautiously circled around to the back the door there was heavily chained but on the north side a broken window provided an easy entrance i shone my flashlight through the missing panes i was looking at part of the pantry for the old kitchen i trained the light around as much as i could see of the interior no one was there but a rustling and the sudden darkening of shadows along the top of the broken cabinets told me my yellowtoothed pals were i wished id worn a cap i tried not to think of the red eyes watching me as i climbed carefully over the bent metal frame a glass shard caught in the crotch of my jeans i stopped to loosen the fabric and listened some more before moving again still no human sounds once inside i picked my way carefully from the pantry to the kitchen the old smells of grease still hung heavily there no wonder the rats were so interested i got lost in a maze of service rooms but came at length to a door that opened on a flight of steep stairs before starting down i stopped to listen again i shone the light on each step not wanting to tumble through the rotten boards every few treads i called out softly to my aunt i couldnt hear her a hall led from the bottom of the stairs to another rabbit warren i checked each of the rooms whose door opened but saw nothing except decayed furnishings at the end of the hall another corridor led to the right when i stuck my hand out to steady myself as i peered around the corner i clawed at open air i gulped and jumped back but the light showed me nothing more menacing than a dumb waiter i called to elena again but still got no reply i turned out the light to make my ears work harder i could hear nothing except the scrabbling and squealing of the rodents tiptoeing straining my ears i moved down this side corridor a series of rooms lined it i tried each in turn shining the light around calling softly to my aunt some were empty but most were stacked with rotting refuse from the old hotelabandoned sofas with stuffing sticking out at all angles mattresses old iron springs every now and then id catch a movement but when i stopped to look all i saw was red eyes glaring back finally i reached the far end of the corridor where a lifeless phone hung it was an old black model with a dial face lined with letters not numbers when i replaced the receiver and lifted it again no dial tone came it was as dead as the building anger gripped me how dare she do this to me call me out on a bootless errand to a ratinfested shell i turned and began marching at a good clip back up the corridor suddenly i thought i heard my name i stopped in my tracks and strained to listen vic it was a hoarse whisper coming from a room on my left i thought id looked in there but i couldnt be sure flinging the door open i shone the flash around the heap of old furniture a large mass lay on a sofa wedged in the corner id missed it on my first cursory scan of the room elena i called sharply are you there i knelt next to the couch my aunt was lying on her side wrapped in a filthy blanket her duffel bag leaned against the wall the violet nightdress still poking from one side relief and anger swept through me in equal measures how could she pass out after calling for me in such a way i shook her roughly elena wake up weve got to go she didnt respond her head lolled lifelessly as i shook her my stomach churning i laid her gently down she was still breathing in short shallow snorts i felt her head along the back was a tender swollen mass a blowfrom a fall or from a person i heard someone move behind me panicking i pulled the gun from my holster again before i could get to my feet the night around me broke into a thousand points of light and i fell into blackness the ladys not for burning my headache had returned full force i tried desperately to be sick my empty stomach could produce only a little bile which left me more nauseated than ever i was so sick i didnt want to move but i knew i would feel better if i went to the kitchen and put some compresses on my aching head and drank some coke my mother had always spoonfed me coke for a stomachache it was a miracle cure i sat up and got so fierce a stab of pain that i cried out and realized beneath the pain that i wasnt home in bed i had been lying on a couch one that smelled so bad i couldnt lie back down even with my aching head i sat with my head on my knees i was on a couch with no cushions when i stuck out a gingerly hand i could feel the tufts of padding spring out my groping hand came on a leg i recoiled so fast that the lights danced in front of my eyes again and i retched when the spasm subsided i reached out tentatively and felt it again a thin bony knob of a kneecap the hem of a thin cotton housedress elena shed called me gotten me to the burnedout shell of the indiana arms and then how had i come to be unconscious it hurt my head to think i stuck up a hand and touched the locus of the pain a nice lump the consistency of raw liver and about as appealing id been hit or had i fallen i couldnt remember and it was too much work trying but elena was hurt too or maybe passed out i fumbled in the dark to find her chest i could feel her heart beneath the thin fabric it kept up a shallow irregular beat and she had a head injury shed been hit someone had called my name so id think it was she calling and all the while she was lying in here unconscious and then he she that hoarse whisper had sounded like elena had knocked me out i was so pleased with remembering the evenings events that i sat for a bit without moving my memory wasnt quite right though i hadnt come to the indiana arms but an abandoned hotel across the street from it it was only the acrid smell of smoke that made me think i was in elenas old building i leaned against the foul remains of upholstery to rest my eyes the acrid smell didnt diminish i hadnt thought the wind was so strong tonight as to blow ash across the street and anyway how intense would the fire smell be a week later something else was burning some other part of the near south side going up in smoke not my problem my problem was to feel well enough to get out of here id brought a flashlight with me pushing back my nausea i got down on my hands and knees to hunt for it crawling on the malodorous floor i stumbled against a piece of hard metal my gun i realized after a moment or two of blind groping i picked up the smith wesson in the dark my fingers automatically checked the safety before fumbling it into my shoulder holster i couldnt find the flashlight only pieces of chewedup cushion when i touched a warm little body i couldnt keep back a scream i stumbled upright my head spinning i couldnt force myself to get back down on the floor to hunt further wed have to make our way out in the dark i blundered around the room tripping on nameless forms running into some bedsprings with enough force to jolt my ribs and make tears stream down my face good thats good vi the pain in your side will keep you from harping on your stupid head its doing you no good so just disregard it better still unscrew it and leave it on the couch when i finally found the door i couldnt open it i pulled with all my might but couldnt get it to budge maybe i had it wrong maybe it opened outwards but all my shoving didnt move it i was locked inside i wanted to sit on the floor and cry in frustration but the thought of the warm little fur balls kept me on my feet its okay vic its a fixable problem youre just feeling sorry for yourself because your head hurts i pulled the smith wesson from my holster turned off the safety held it against the keyhole and fired the recoil went up my arm jarring my shoulder the sound in the small room echoed frenziedly in my sore head making spirals cartwheel in front of my closed eyes when i tried the door again it shook but didnt open come on dodo brain think i urged aloud if blowing the keyhole didnt open the door it was because it was nailed shut not locked i was too tired to figure out how to find where the nails were and shoot around them i plowed four shots into the hinges where they attached to the wall bracing myself each time for the recoil for the sound by the last shot the air was so smoky and my head ringing so badly that i had to go down on my knees i vomited more bile and rested gasping for air trying to force my vibrating head to stillness when i finally got back to my feet i pushed against the door i was so feeble at this point that i couldnt put much into my thrust but i felt the paneling give a little i tucked the gun back into my holster sucked in a deep breath and flung my right shoulder against the edge of the door something splintered on the other side i pushed again and felt the whole thing give i put out an arm to explore and found that the rotted wood had fractured leaving a large jagged opening leaning against the jamb to catch my breath and steady my head i thought the smoke seemed more intense in the hall than in the room it wasnt gun smoke but fire the reason id been smelling smoke since i came to was because the damned building was on fire not left over from the indiana arms fresh new fire created just for me the building i was in was on fire someone had knocked me out locked me in a room and set fire to the place the prairie shores hotel that was its name in my minds eye i saw the dead neon sign swaying a little in the night air thats so helpful your last thought can be congratulations on dragging the name from your slug brain instead of that maybe try to do a little work otherwise robin bessinger is going to be picking through debris for your charred bones in the morning i went back to my aunt trying to figure out a way to move her my whole head hurt from the effort of thinking i had to fight an overpowering impulse to lie back down and rest to take my chances on waking up again in time elena didnt weigh much but even if id been totally myself i couldnt have carried her far i was afraid dragging her might jar her too much in her injured state and finish her off but what other choice did i have if i left her on the mattress though it might be more awkward but the mattress would make a good barrier if we had to go through fire it had handles on the sides but not along the narrow end i took my keys from my pants pocket and made some gashes in the cover if they didnt rip off completely theyd be good enough i stumbled over to elenas duffel bag and ripped the strap free even that much effort made me pant and brought another wave of pain crashing across my brain to the front of my head i had to lean against the wall until it receded enough that i could walk i ran the strap through the gashes id made in the mattress cover before starting to haul it i knelt again to feel elenas heart it maintained its erratic beat i slipped the duffel strap over my head and shoulders and pulled the ends around my waist stooping slightly against the weight behind me i began dragging it toward the door when i got that far i put the strap down and gently maneuvered the mattress by hand out to the halli didnt want to bang elenas head into the splintered door once in the corridor i began a nightmare journey around us in the dark the rats were twittering unnerved by the fire and trying to delve deep into the bowels of the building they kept running over my feet i knew they had to be crawling around the mattress crawling on my aunts body that thought made me shudder and start to black out i leaned a hand against the wall and forced my mind to clear forced the thought of what was happening behind me out of my head forced the swells of pain to the back of my brain smoke was starting to drift toward me down the hall further fogging me i wanted to sit but was too scared of the rodents clamoring for air on the floor to be able to i was almost at the basement stairs if the smoke was getting thicker it meant the fire was at the top of the stairs and i wouldnt be able to make it through the maze to an exit my eyes were streaming my throat was raw and i could feel a searing tightness in my chest when i tried to inhale i might have been able to run up on my own with my sweatshirt around my head but if i tried it with elena wed both die so move vic dont stand there go back put your harness back on thats a good cow turn around and pull a door stood open at the bottom of the stairs i had just enough sense to heave it shut before taking up my burden again and heading back down the hall my arms were beginning to tremble from overexertion i couldnt remember any real poems so i started chanting jumpingrope rhymes to give some rhythm to my movements and take my mind from my fatigued body dance girl dance girl hop on one foot but hop to where i didnt remember any other doors in the section of basement we were trapped in then at the intersection of the two corridors i thought of the dumbwaiter id inadvertently found i stuck a hand in and explored it it was a large space originally used for hauling furnishings from the basement when the hotel had been built it stood in chicagos most exclusive neighborhood theyd needed lots of linens and things and before a widespread use of electricity this made an ideal passageway if the fire was inside the building the shaft would also be an ideal conduit for flames but if it had been started on the outside and was working inward we might have a grace period it was possible of course that rats had long since chewed through the cables anything is possible warshawski my old latin teacher used to say i want to know what is i slipped elena from the mat and hoisted her straining over one aching shoulder up we go auntie just relax and breathe normally i slid her into the box it was high enough that she could have sat up but i laid her on her side i looked at where the mattress lay travel light or keep my only tool i hoisted it up and folded it into an awkward bundle next to my aunt checking to make sure she had breathing room finally i stuck a foot into the box and hiked up to the top it was covered with greasy dust and little things that were probably rat droppings but there are no rats here auntie because theyve all been clever enough to burrow underneath the building we will rise above it all i fumbled in the dark for the cables found one and tugged it creaked ominously but the box didnt move there was tension on the line thoughit was still connected somewhere i pulled again and felt the box sway a little maybe i had the wrong cord i held on to it with my left hand and waved my right around in the dark air finally i found another rope on the other side of the shaft i shifted my weight across the box and tugged with both hands the dumbwaiter jerked underneath me and started to move it was slow tedious work the rope burned my bare palms my biceps had pretty much turned to water by now and strongly resisted the idea of more exercise youre at the wall now vicgo for the burn i mocked myself then returned to rope chants id been through my repertoire twice when we finally came to the opening onto the ground floor the door was shut when i put a hand on it it was scalding to the touch a poor exit choice i tried looking up but it was a futile exercise even adjusted to the dark my eyes could make out nothing i started hauling again sticking a hand up every few pulls to see if i was going to run into ceiling the pain in my head had passed beyond agony to some light remote feeling as though the top of my head were floating some miles from my body every time i stopped working to feel about though it came crashing down with a pounding thud was this what it was like to use heroin was this what cerise had crawled off to the rapelec site to feel her head buoyant above her body last night and the night before twentyfour robbers came knocking at my door asked them what they wanted this is what they saidthe words kept spilling out against my volition long after i couldnt stand the sound of them in the dark i was seeing pinwheels spinning through the elevator shaft flashing strobes of light from my burnedout retinas future and past disappeared into an endless present presence of rope of muscles beyond fatigue of hand over raw hand and the unbearable sound of my own voice spewing out childhood chants the rope abruptly stopped moving for a few seconds i kept tugging at it frustrated at breaking my liquid crystal movements then i realized we were at the end of the line if we couldnt get out here we werewell at the end of our rope i sat down on the box my knees were stiff from the long haul upward and gave me little protesting stabs at my abrupt bending i leaned down and felt for the dumbwaiter door it was cool to the touch i turned around climbed down the front of the box and twisted around to sit against the bulk of the mattress the door was stiff but not locked as id first feared i leaned against the mattress and pushed as hard as i could with my wobbly legs the door creaked i drew my knees to my chest ignoring their throbbing and kicked hard the door popped out of its frame i slid out and turned around for my aunt years of abusing her body had given it great resilienceshe remained unconscious but her shallow uncertain breaths still came snorting out i propped her against the wall and forced my tired legs down the hall now that we were above ground faint light from the full moon and streetlamps gave a pale glow to the walls enough that i could walk without feeling my way in the distance i could hear the deep excited honking of fire engines all i had to do was find a window where they could see me love will find a way i sang softly to myself night or day love will find a way i was skating moving so smoothly i was almost floating my cousin boomboom and i were on the forbidden frozen lagoon circling round and round until we slid dizzily onto the ice we werent supposed to be there no one knew how thick the ice was if it gave way wed drown for sure because no one would rescue us the first one to give up was a chicken and i wasnt going to be a chicken to my cousin he was a better skater than me but he wasnt tougher he was near roe someplace i knew that but i couldnt quite find him on and on i skated calling his name opening every door but not seeing him i got to a window and stared through it at a metal platform i thought boomboom was behind me but when i turned he was gone when i looked back at the window all i found was my own reflection beyond the glass lay a fire escape i struggled with the window but it was painted shut i looked around the room for a tool but it was completely bare i lifted my trembling right leg and kicked as hard as i could the ancient glass shivered and cracked i kicked again and the whole bottom pane gave way i looked down below me the building was burning steadily and fire was licking upward wed come up three stories and wed better get back down them fast the fire escape was at the back whatever firepower belonged to the distant engines was around the other side of the building i lurched back down the miles of corridors id traveled until i came to elena still snorting away under the dumbwaiter i pulled her pallet from the box and got her settled on it again at some point my body must surely give out no longer respond to the senseless commands of an imperial brain i flogged myself onward a good warhorse old and near collapse but responding to one last call to arms back at the fire escape i wrapped my sweatshirt around my right arm and knocked out the remaining shards then i slid elena to the floor moved her pallet to the fire escape and lifted her again my hamstrings and back shrieking in dismay and laid her out on the mattress youll have to wait here for me auntie ill be back just breathe deeply and dont be afraid ive got to get help i cant carry you on my own slowly each leg weighing a thousand pounds i dragged myself down the stairs down through the cloud of smoke past the point of feeling to the place where breath and sight were collapsed into one solid pinpoint of agony finding the end of the escape swinging down feeling the bottom flight fall loose and my feet dragging on the ground i rolled through the smoke and staggered around the side of the building a multitude was there firemen onlookers cops and a man in uniform who came to me and told me sternly the building was dangerous no one was allowed beyond the police barricades my aunt i gasped shes up on the fire escape around the side we were in the basement when the fire started youve got to get her he didnt understand me and i turned to a fireman helping guide a heavy hose i tugged on his sleeve until he turned in annoyance i pointed and gasped until someone understood and a little troop jogged off into the smoke doctors orders what are you doing with your clothes on lotty herschel was sharp to the point of unfriendliness im going home getting dressed with both hands taped in gauze had been a chore you know i hate hospitals its where they send people to die someone should have burned those lotty said coldly they smell so bad i can hardly stand to be in the same room with you its the blood and the smoke i explained and i guess stale sweati worked up a pretty good meltdown hoisting myself up those ropes lottys nostrils curled in distaste all the more reason to remove them dr homerin cannot possibly examine you with that stench coming from you id noticed a slender middleaged man standing patiently behind lotty and assumed he was another resident seeking education at my feet at my head actually i dont need another goddamn examination twentyfour hours here and i feel like a pot roast every housewife in chicago has taken a poke at mez homerin is a neurologist you got a nasty blow to the head i want to make sure that that thick polish skull of yours hasnt taken any irremediable harm im fine i said fiercely i dont have double vision i can tie my shoes with my eyes closed even with these baseball mitts covering my fingers and if he sticks pins in my feet ill know about it lotty came over to stand next to me her black eyes blazing victoria i dont even know why i bother this is the third time youve been hit hard enough to knock you out i dont wish to spend my old age treating you for parkinsons or alzheimerswhich is exactly where youre heading with your knowitall reckless attitude if you dont get your clothes back off this minutethis instantyou may be sure of one thingi will never treat you again do you understand her anger was so intense it made my knees wobble i sat back on the bed i was pretty angry myself enough that my bead started pounding savagely as i spoke did i send for you this is michael reese not beth israelyou came barging in without so much as a byyourleave at least not a bymyleave someone tried to murder both ray aunt and me getting out of that building was one of the most harrowing experiences of my life and you scream at me about my clothes and alzheimers disease it thats your attitude leave with my blessingi dont need your kind of medical care dr homerin coughed miss warshawski i can understand your being upsetits a natural side effect of concussion and the other experiences you went through last night but as long as im here i think i might as well examine you and it would be easier to do if you could take your clothes off and put on your hospital gown i glowered at him he turned to lotty and said apologetically dr herschel oh very well she snapped she whirled on her heel with the precision of a figure skater and swept out of the room dr homerin pulled the curtain around my bed ill wait out heregive me a call when youre ready i could go ahead and leave but it would make me feel incredibly stupid angrily i kicked my running shoes off with thick clumsy fingers i unfastened the buttons of my shirt and unzipped my jeans i took as much time as i possibly could before sullenly calling out that i was ready dr homerin sat on the chair next to the bed tell me a little about your injurywhat happened i was hit on the head i muttered churlishly he refused to acknowledge my ill humor do you know who hit you or what was used i shook my head and saw black circles swirl around no he was hiding in the room i was looking at my aunt who was drunk i frowned no i thought she was drunk but it turned out she had been coshed thats right i realized someone had hit her and that he might still be there and as i was jumping up to protect myself i got hit from behind he nodded like a professor at a promising pupil its very good that you have so much recallvery often the memory immediately before such an incident is blocked out by what we call protective amnesia i rubbed the tender spot on the back of my head what i dont remember is what happened afterwards i know i was climbing a rope in an elevator shaft but i cant remember how i got elena up with me and then we came out the fire fighters had to bring my aunt but i think i got out on my own my voice trailed off as i tried to focus the blur of memory mallory had shown up along with furey when i was in the emergency room but someone had been in the crowd around the fire who didnt belong there i remembered a faint inflection of surprise mixed in with a sense of my imminent death as the paramedics carried me through the barricades the face swam on the edge of my consciousness tears of frustration pricked my eyelids when my aching head refused to concentrate i cant remember i said helplessly do you have any idea of why this happened his gray eves looked harmlessly genial behind their thick lenses but i stiffened at once did bobbylieutenant mallorytell you to ask that thered been quite a scene in the emergency room with bobby roaring at me like a bull elephant on a rampage dominic assuevo and roland montgomery from the bomb and arson squad had joined him but it was only because i kept passing out that the resident on call finally threw them out of the examining area homerin shook his head the police havent spoken to me at all im just checking your ability to answer logical questions in the intervals between sleeping and tossing in pain id been testing that skill myself without any happy answer maybe someone arriving to torch the building had seen elena come out he followed her heard her phone me then when she went back inside he knocked her out and waited to get me too before setting the place on fire it could have happened that way but it seemed awfully elaborate why not just torch the place while she was out of the way maybe shed seen him clearly enough to recognize him again so he felt she had to die but then why go for me too my head was starting to disintegrate i couldnt figure it all out i wanted to go home and i was starting to feel too helpless even to get out of bed again seeing my fatigue and frustration homerin switched to a general interrogationdid i know who the president was the mayor people like that i wished i didnt but rattled off the names after that we went through the pinsinthefeet routine and he banged on my knees and elbows and felt my headall the usual medical stuff that lets the doctor know all your pieces are still attached to your aching body when he finished looking at my eyes and rotating my head around a few times he sat back in the visitors chair i know you want to leave miss warshawski but it would be better if you stayed another day i dont want to i was close to breaking down and sobbing you live alone dont you i just dont think youre up to looking after yourself right now theres nothing wrong with you that i can see barring the side effects of concussion they did a cat scan of your head in the emergency room wednesday morning and nothing alarming showed up but youll manage better if you let us look after you another day i hate being looked after i cant stand it i didnt want to be like tony reduced to such helplessness he couldnt even breathe on his own at the end the sound of his harsh wheezing breathing cut through my brain and against my will i found myself crying homerin waited patiently for me to dry my eyes and blow my nose he asked if there was something specific i wanted to talk about but the memories of my dying parents were too painful to mention to a stranger instead i blurted out is lotty right am i going to get alzheimers disease a smile twitched at the corner of his mouth shes worried about youthats why she dragged me down here and got the house staff to agree to let me see you im not a prophet but three blows in seven yearsits more than you need but youre not taking the regular pounding that a boxer does id worry more about feeling better now and give me a call if you have any unusual symptoms he fished a card from his wallet and handed it to me mez homerin boy neurologist with an address on north michigan and another in edgewater what kind of symptoms i asked suspiciously oh blurred vision trouble with your memory any tingling in your fingers or toes dont lie around worrying about themill be startled if you have any concentrate on getting your strength back but please call me if you want to talk about any concerns he put a gentle stress on any and i stupidly felt like crying again there is my aunt i said as assertively as i could do you know how shes doing your aunt oh the woman you rescued shed been hit on the head right do you know if shes here i didnt but he said hed find out and get a progress report for me id been planning on getting up and dressing as soon as he left but my crying bout had put the finishing touches to my fatigue i was asleep almost before his hospital coat disappeared behind the curtain we serve and protect it was saturday before the pounding in my head receded completely id gone home on friday admitting only to myselfthat mez homerin had been right i was better off for the extra day of people waiting on me as it was friday involved so many difficult encounters that by the time i went to bed i was wishing id stayed in the hospital the worst was with the policehomerin had shielded me from roland montgomery of the bomb and arson squad of course the cops were most anxious to speak with me montgomery had been in the emergency room with mallory and furey early wednesday morning and hed sent a subordinate to reese both wednesday and thursday since id slept through most of wednesday i only learned about the subordinates visit on thursday when mez left me he encountered the detective in the hall their altercation led to a big red notice on my chart proclaiming no visitors and a lot of excitement among the orderlies and nurses who reported the episode to me in dramatic detail later i took a cab from the hospital to my car which started with a reproachful groan that it kept up all the way to my apartment mr contreras saw me pull up a bit after noon while i was sponging myself off as best i could without soaking my gauze mitts he came to the door laden down with food you shoulda let me know when you was coming home doll i couldve come and got youyou shouldnt be driving with your hands all wrapped up like that i just wanted to be by myself for a while in the hospital youre a twentyfourhouraday freak show for every medical student in the city you shouldnt try to do so much on your own cookie no shame in asking for help every now and then and i know darn well you wouldnt eat nothing this afternoon if i didnt bring it to you so you want to be alone you say the word and the princess here and ill go but not till we see you eat something i gave up trying to hint him away but made him wait in the living room while i finished washing and changing peppy feeling no inhibitions stayed next to me until i was done lottyd been right about one thingmy clothes stank so badly i could scarcely stand being in the same room with them let alone the same body i didnt even want to wash them although it was my newest pair of jeans i stuffed them into a bag and put it outside my back door to cart down to the garbage finally clean from my bra to my socks i joined the old man hed prepared a special feast much more food than i could deal with in my sickly state but he was miffed that hed had to hear all my news secondhand if you was going off into danger like that you might of notified me he grumbled stead the first thing i know about it is the morning paper that oversize teenager ryerson putting in a story about chicagos most troublesome private eye and i start reading and of course there you are rescuing bodies from burning buildings hit on the head and not even a phone call to me from the hospital i says to the princess here i says you could be an orphan and youd be the last to know peppy thumped her tail to corroborate his story her liquid amber eyes gazed at me with unwavering intensity as i slowly chewed a piece of steak ever since my aunt came prancing into my life two weeks ago youve been riding me for getting you up in the middle of the night i figured if i woke you up to tell you where i was going id just get another lecture thats not fair he was hurt and astonished that i could think such a thing on top of that he was pretty darned tired of me leaving him standing on the sidelines while i went out and had all kinds of fabulous lifethreatening adventures its not the first time doll you forget how i helped you and dr lotty out that time her clinic was attacked you dont remember how i took on them guys trying to break into your place i may be seventyseven but im in good shape im still a good man in a fight it was precisely because i had remembered his assistance that i tried never to involve him in the livelier aspects of my work if i told him that though it would be just too painful for him i skated around it saying elena was so prone to drunken fables i hadnt taken her claims of endangerment seriously by the time i finished he was nodding portentously i know just what you mean doll i used to work with a guy like that of course he was a danger to the whole shop showing up drunk most days and the ones he arrived sober he didnt stay like that past lunchtime there was the day he didnt turn off the surface grinder and jakeyou remember jakelost most of the little finger on his left hand but crenshawcrenshaw was the drunk he claimed it was me using the machine when i wasnt supposed to his good humor restored mr contreras went on in this vein at some length the happy drone of his voice the weight of the meat in my stomach the warm pleasure i felt at being back in my own home sent me drowsing in my armchair i held my hand down and let the dog lick my fingers while i nodded sleepily in tune to the old mans speech the shrill burr of the phone startled me awake i stretched an arm out to the piano and picked up the receiver tried to write your obit for you warshawski but you made it through one more time how many lives you got left anyway three it was murray with more vibrant energy than my head could handle i hear you called me the most troublesome detective in chicago private eye he corrected nothing libelous in thati checked with the legal department you can sue me only if its not true what i want to know is who did it did it come out of roz fuentess camp or your dead junkie cerise ask the copsthe city pays them to investigate arson and attempted murder and youre just going to stay home and watch tv while they sort it out he guffawed between us ace investigators what were you doing down there black spots were starting to dance in front of me from the resonance of his voice i moved the earpiece away from my head performing feats of derringdo i understand it was in all the papers cmon warshawski he said trying to wheedle i do lots of stuff for you just a few little words he was rightif i wanted help from him i had to throw him the occasional quote i told him everything from the moment elena called me to my drop from the fire escape now its your turnwhat was the fire department doing there so pat mr contreras looked at me as intently as the dog miffed i was telling my tale to murray but wanting all the juice i took the phone over to the couch where id dumped my bag and pulled out my memo pad anonymous phone call i scribbled on it for mr contreras as murray boomed the news at me someone had called from a pay phone at the corner of cermak and michigan the police didnt have a clue as to who phoned except for its having been a man so you think it was someone after your aunt murray asked how is she by the way i dont think anything right now my head hurts like all the cement trucks on the ryan just ran over it and my aunt who has the system of a goat sat up and took nourishment yesterday she refused to talk to me though when i started asking her pointed questions and is acting sick enough that the docs are stonewalling the cops for her you can call reese and see if the medicine men will let her talk to you but dont set your hopes too high now you know everything i do im going to bed goodbye i hung up before he could say anything else and ignored the phone when it started ringing again mr contreras solicitously offered to fix me up with pillows and a blanket on the couch to leave me the dog to make me tea to do a thousand things that made the black spots grow into giant spirals i need to be alone in my own bed i cant take any more people now i know you mean well i know youre helping like mad but im going to faint or scream or both if you dont take the dog and leave he was a little hurt but hed seen concussion cases before he knew it took time before you really felt yourself and in the meantime the smallest things got you downsure doll sure hed leave me alone sleep was the best thing for me right now he gathered up the dishes clicking over the small amount of steak id eatengotta get your strength back up doll you look like you lost ten pounds the last few daysfinally collecting the dog and heading down the stairs i locked the triple dead bolts and stumbled to my bedroom the spirals receded back to spots as i thrashed around in an uneasy doze the image of elena her face sunk into deep canyons drips in her malnourished arms kept swarming into my half sleep she was a pain in the ass but someone had tried to kill her i couldnt just abandon her at this point id tried talking to her before i left this morning but shed pretended to sleep its no good playing possum auntieyoure going to have to talk to me sometime id warned her mez homerin interrupted my lecture to her taking me by the arm and hustling me from the room shes had a severe shock to a system that wasnt in the best shape to begin with she needs to be completely free from any kind of stress or harassment if shes to recover ive forbidden the police to question her do you want me to bar you from the room too she needs your support not your abuse bar me from her life id snapped at him keep her from calling to demand that i help her one last time write it on her hospital forms make sure she doesnt put my address in as her own or list me as the guarantor of her bill do all those things and you can keep me out of her room with all the righteousness you want homerin looked at me steadily during my outburst and then said in a gentle voice that he thought i ought to consider bringing her home to convalesce when she was a little stronger that was when id left the hospitalbefore i gave in to my urge to take his stethoscope and strangle him with it now though tossing restlessly i was tormented wondering how much i owed my aunt would my uncle peter thrash in guilt for saying no of course not i hadnt even called to ask himmy tired brain wasnt up to rebutting his smugness did i have a duty to elena that overrode all considerations of myself my work my own longing for wholeness id held glasses of water for gabriella when her arms were too weak to lift them herself emptied wheelchair pots for tony when he could no longer move from chair to toilet ive done enough i kept repeating ive done enough but i couldnt quite convince myself such unquiet sleep as i achieved was broken up for good at four when the police came represented by roland montgomery and terry finchley montgomery kept a finger on the bell until i couldnt ignore it and then said through the intercom that if i didnt let them up to talk theyd get a warrant and take me downtown it was montgomery who did all the bullying terry finchley sent by bobby to represent violent crimes was clearly unhappy with montgomerys approach but was too junior to protest very forcefully i shuffled into the living room with a blanket wrapped around me id been sweating heavily in my uneasy dozing and felt a chill run through me when i got out of bed the black spots had gone away but my head was thick as though someone had stuffed it with wool i sat on the couch with my legs curled up underneath me lets have the whole story warshawski what were you doing in that building how did it come to catch fire while you were there the force of my fiery personality i mumbled my tongue thick what was that montgomery demanded angrily finchley shook his head slightly trying to warn me without the arson expert seeing i called furey i said suddenly remembering he wanted to know where my aunt was and i left a message with the night man saying where i was going did he get it is that why he and bobby were at the fire im asking the questions montgomery snapped why did you call the station get the chip off your shoulder lieutenant and listen to me i just explained why i called the station did detective furey get my message finchley spoke swiftly before montgomery could bellow at me furey was at a poker game he left his beeper in his coat pocket and didnt get the message until he went over to get a cigar and found the thing vibrating away then he called the station got your message and went roaring down to the near south side by that time though someone had already reported the fire lieutenant mallory gave the night operator a pretty good goingover for not notifying someone else in the unit but you hadnt said anything about an emergency so furey and bobby stormed the hospital how come youre here now miss warshawski montgomery interrupted frostily detective finchley is here to help with an investigation why the department sent him is none of your business i wanted to make a grandiose statement about how the police worked for the citizens and how i was one and therefore one of montgomerys bosses but i felt too sick to fight i just wrapped the blanket closer about me and continued to shiver and when montgomery asked me i went back through all the tired old details about elena disappearing about furey coming around hunting for her her early morning phone call and on and on so why did someone want to leave the two of you there to die montgomery asked youre the bombandarson whiz lieutenant you tell me all i know is she called up scared i found her on a pallet in the basement barely breathing got knocked out myself and am lucky to be here enjoying this scintillating conversation with some shred of my wits intact finchley started a sentence then changed his mind and made an industrious note in his pocket diary in the dim lamplight his closely cut hair merged with the black smoothness of his face montgomery scowled at me but only said the prairie shores hotel is across the street from that fire you were so excited about last week i gave the thread of a smile amazing im wondering if you set the fire yourself to try to get the department to respond to your demands for an investigation into the indiana arms i felt a jolt the way you do when the earth goes on hurtling through space and you havent quite moved with it finchleys jaw dropped he clearly hadnt been privy to montgomerys theories i didnt know we were considering that possibility monty he said softly and i would never have suspected you of so extravagant an imagination i put in sounds like you read too much tom clancy on your days off finchley hid a smile so fast i wasnt sure id seen it monty what evidence do we have that points to miss warshawski montgomery ignored him you tried to waste police resources last week claiming there had been a baby in the indiana arms that was never there its one of the hallmarks of arsonists that they cant stand to have their handiwork ignored hunhunh i shook my head you go away and do some real work on this problem before you bother me again you find out about the accelerant and who had access to it and you come up with a reason for me knocking myself out and then setting the fire and then scrambling to get away then well talk some more accomplice montgomery said smugly you must have run afoul of your partner in this i leaned back in the corner of my couch and shut my eyes goodbye lieutenant the door will lock automatically behind you he started shouting at me when i didnt respond he got up and shook my shoulder until my head throbbed in earnest youre one step away from a complaint of police brutality i said coldly unless you have a warrant with my name on it you get the hell out of my place now if finchley hadnt been there i think montgomery would have slugged me but he could see whose side the detective was onhe wasnt nearly as dumb as he looked just watch your ass warshawski im going to be sticking to you like your underpants if youre up to something next time well catch you redhanded thanks for the warning lieutenant its a help to know who your enemies are before you hit the streets when the door shut behind them i did up all the bolts again and checked the back door for good measure i was too tired to think about what it all meant too tired even to call bobby and chew his ear off about it i staggered back to my bedroom and fell back into a deep unrestful sleep a few kind words from a friend robin phoned later that evening concerned that he hadnt been allowed to see me in the hospital and glad i was still in one piece he was eager to drive down for a convalescent visit i was too worn out for more company but said he could stop by on saturday if i felt better before he hung up i remembered a question by the way did ajax insure the prairie shores hotelthe place i was in no it was the first thing i looked at but of course we dont cover abandoned buildings and if its any comfort to you it wasnt owned by your pal saul seligman so its either a vendetta against that block of indiana or someone with a grudge against the warshawski family the last comment was meant as a joke but it reminded me again of elena her redveined face slack and empty i muttered something to robin about feeling too feeble for jokes and hung up i did not have to be a victorian angel and go sit with her i didnt didnt didnt i stumbled into the dining room and dug around in the cupboards hunting for stationery it had been so long since id written any personal letters that the box had landed behind the fondue set and silver salad servers left over from my brief marriage i stared at the pieces in bewilderment why had i carted those particular items all over chicago with me for the eleven years since my divorce i wasnt up to making a decision about them today i thrust them back into the cupboard and sat down with the yellowed stationery to write my uncle peter it was a difficult letteri had to overcome my dislike of him enough to plead elenas case with conviction i described the accident made much of my own decrepitude and the fact that id saved her life and concluded with a plea that he either take her in himself or put her up in a convalescent facility in the morning id express it to mission hills it was the best i could do for elena in the bathroom mirror my face looked sunken nothing left but cheekbones and eyes their gray looking almost black against the pallor of my skin no wonder mr contreras had been eager to fill me with steak i stepped on the scale my weight had fallen below a hundred and thirty pounds i couldnt afford to be that light if i wanted to have the energy to do my job i wasnt hungry but id better eat something i wandered moodily to the kitchen after all this time any resemblance between the stuff in my refrigerator and human food was purely coincidental i smelled the yogurt it was still okay but the vegetables and fruit had passed the point of no return while the orange juice smelled both rotten and fermented i took a bag of fettucini from the freezer and sawed off a hunk with my big butcher knife while it boiled i ate the yogurt directly from the carton trying to put some order into the chaos that enveloped me several people had been annoyed with me the last week or two ralph macdonald had descended from his throne to hint me away from roz fuentess affairs saul seligman was upset that ajax wouldnt honor his claim zerlina ramsay blamed me and elena for her daughters death it was quite a list but i didnt know that any of them would express their annoyance by leaving both elena and me to die by fire of course lotty was angry with me too but she preferred to do her scorching directly then there was luis schmidt hed called me a bitch on tuesday and told me not to ask any more questions about alma mejicana or hed make me sorry id flipped back some good macha retort and hed hung up on me so if i was going to go pawing around any of these people luis was the place to start the hissing of water on gas startled me back to the presentthe fettucini had boiled over extinguishing the pilot of course i couldnt find a box of matches among the jumble on the stove i started slamming doors open and shut i just couldnt take this life anymore living alone no one to pet me when i came home from the wars nothing to eat no matches no money in the bank i grabbed a handful of spoons and spatulas and flung them as hard as i could at the kitchen door when the clatter died down the grate over the door vibrated in a mournful bass for a few seconds my shoulders sagged in defeat i shuffled over to the door to collect my utensils a wooden spoon had landed on the refrigerator when i reached up for it i knocked a box of matches down okay good have fits they get results i stuffed the implements back into a drawer and relit the stove besides luis and the possible problems of alma mejicana i had to consider my aunts affairs i didnt want to think about her anymoreand not just because i didnt want victoria the victorian angel nudging me to look after her her tales of woe had sucked me into a series of hideous events lately starting with my hunt for her new home and culminating in my near death i couldnt take much more probing into her life i still wasnt hungry but i was starting to feel lightheaded from lack of food i drained the pasta and grated some rockhard cheddar onto it it was slow work with my padded hands my arm muscles were still sore enough that i gave it up panting with only a few teaspoons of cheese for my effort my right palm stung so violently i was afraid i might have rubbed the scab off through my mitt i carried the plate in my left hand into the living room after forcing several mouthfuls down i leaned back in my armchair and made myself think about my aunt elena ran away when she learned about cerises death its possible something else had frightened heri didnt know much about her daytoday life with her character she could easily have stubbed more than one toe but i had to start somewhere linking her flight to cerises death made sense it would take a strong compulsion to force her from a secure berth since losing the norwood park bungalow shed lived precariously on the small annuity scraped out of the remains of the sale even though the windsor arms was a desolate place shed had too much experience of handtomouth living to turn her back on it lightly she and cerise had been working some scam together when i told elena that cerise was dead shed been both crafty and uneasy so shed gone to their mark that made sense tootwentyfour hours had lapsed between my telling her about cerise and elenas disappearance shed had time to talk to their target and find out my thought trailed away shed found out that cerise had been murdered was that possible what else could frighten her into running away though someone saying look what we did to your friend the same thing could happen to you a quart of whiskey inside you and death by exposure on navy pier and whod be the wiser i rubbed my aching head romance victoria you need facts just say for starters that cerise and elena had a tiger by the tail to find out what it was i needed elena to start talking or zerlina ramsayit was remotely possible that cerise had confided in her mother my phone books were buried under a stack of music on the piano id been singing more recently than id been looking up numbers no armbrusters were listed on south christiana i called directory assistance to make sure so id have to make another trip to north lawndale i gritted my teeth in anticipation of this treat and after that i should find out where everyone on my list of annoyed patrons had been early wednesday morning although if ralph macdonald or rozs cousins had tried torching me theyd probably hired someone else to do it still it would be worth finding out where theyd been it wasnt exactly a job for a convalescent maybe i could wait until sunday to start working on it my eyes were too sore for television or reading my body ached too much for anything else after i forcefed myself the plateful of fettucini i went back to bed lotty capped my wonderful day by phoning at eightthirty to see if i was still alive im doing okay i said cautiously if i told her i hurt like hell id only get a lecture on my just deserts mez told me hed released you today he didnt think you were ready to go home but i assured him you had an iron constitution and would be ready to do something else lifethreatening next week thank you lotty i lay down in the dark with the phone propped on a pillow next to my mouth if i turned my back on people who came to me in need i can imagine how loudly youd cheer and if i avoided all risksstayed home watching the soaps or somethingyoud really be leading the applause meter you dont think you could find some point of balance between doing nothing and putting your head in the noose she burst out do you know how i feel every time i see your body come in on a stretcher not knowing if youre alive or dead not knowing if this time your brain is ruined your limbs paralyzed do you think you could manage your affairs so that you stopped a few feet short of the point of death maybe even ask the police to take those risks so someone elses friend or lover can do the worrying you mean i wasnt angry only very lonely it will happen inevitably lotty i wont be able to jump through hoops or climb up ropes forever someone else will have to take over but it wont be the police not when i have to fight them every inch of the way to look into arson and they still wont do it or when their only answer to my near death is to accuse me i broke off maybe cerise and elena had seen who set fire to the indiana arms and were going after him or her or them still if that was so it could be the arsonist was disposing of her by his favorite means and maybe assumed shed confided in me so i had to go too andbut had they murdered cerise the police said it was an overdose pure and simple i know i shouldnt be losing my temper with you its only my fear of losing you thats all lotty said i know i said wearily but it just puts that much more pressure on me lotty some days i have to fight a hundred people just to be able to do my job when youre the hundred and first i feel like all i want to do is lie down and die she didnt say anything for a long moment so to help you i have to support you doing things that are a torment to me ill have to think about that one victoria one thing i dont support though that you dedicate your life to your aunt mez mentioned that part of your conversation to me i suggested that if you were a man he would never even have raised the topic with you except to ask if you had a wife to do the job what did he say what could he say he hemmed and said he still thought it was a good idea but theres a limit to how much of yourself you have to immolate for people victoria you almost killed yourself for elena you dont have to sacrifice your mind as well okay doctor i muttered i blinked back tearsi was so weak that one little sentence of support made me feel like crying youre exhausted she said curtly youre in bed good get some sleep good night when she hung up i switched my phone over to the answering service i fumbled around with the switch in the dark to turn off the bell when my thick ungainly hands had managed that i finally fell into a deep clear sleep heavy flowers when i woke up on saturday it was past ninethirty id slept more than thirteen hours and for the first time in a week i felt rested for my time in bed i let myself come to slowly not wanting to bring on black spots by jerking my head in the bathroom i unwrapped my hands the palms had turned an orangeyyellow i flinched in nauseatheir swollen discoloration made a sickening wakeup call when i gently pushed the blood blisters lining my hands like railroad tracks they seemed to be healing i tried to remember that injuries always look their worst when theyre on the mend but the squishy mass still made my stomach turn i also wasnt sure i could wrap them back up again myself the hospital had given me a salve and some dressing but hadnt included a manual on how to apply them with my teeth still if i kept my hands on the edge of the tub i could take a proper bath i turned on the water threw in some milk bath and toddled off to the kitchen to make coffee since i could use only my fingertips to handle the kettle it was a slow and tiresome experience by the time i had a cup poured the bath was close to overflowing i climbed in carefully holding the coffee in my fingers when i sank down crosslegged and great wave swept over the side of the tub but my hands stayed dry i lay soaking until the water became tepid thinking of nothing at first then going back to my painful headwork of the previous night i still couldnt understand why cerises death had terrified elena into flight unless someone had pumped cerise full of heroin and left her to die i couldnt move on that idea though i didnt have any evidenceit was just the only explanation that i could come up with and how had elena known shed found it out in the twentyfour hours between my visit to her and her panicky exit in the middle of the night while she was lying mute behind a protective barricade of doctors and nurses i didnt have any way of finding out id have to drop it for now what i could do was take a look at alma mejicana i put the coffee cup on the windowsill and looked at my palms again grimacing tomorrow would be the ideal time to slide into their offices but i didnt think id be much more healed by then than i was this morning i soaped down and pulled myself cautiously from the tub drying off presented more difficulties its only when you cant use them that you realize how much you need your hands the third time i dropped the towel i left it on the floor and climbed back into bed to finish drying the front doorbell rang just as i was trying to hoist jeans over my stilldamp rump id forgotten robin was coming i slid my arms through a zipup jacket and managed to have it closed by the time he got to the thirdfloor landing vic good to see you in one piece he looked me over critically you dont seem nearly as battered as i figured from the news reports how you feeling better than i did a few days ago my heads clear thats the main thing he held out a bunch of latesummer flowers picked from his own tiny carefully tended plot i got him to carry them into the kitchen and fill a pitcher for me something about the bright gold daisies on the table suddenly gave me an enormous appetite i wanted pancakes eggs bacon a whole farmers breakfast even though hed eaten several hours ago robin obligingly agreed to go to the corner diner with me he even overcame his own nausea to dress my hands for me i thought with my palms padded i could manage a bra but the hooks still were too much for me it was one thing to get my hands dressed another to need help with a bra i put on an outsize sweatshirt and headed downstairs without one mr contreras and the dog were coming in the front door as we left he looked robin over with critical jealousy peppy jumped up on me and started licking my face i played with her ears and introduced the two of them to robin where you off to doll breakfast i havent had a proper meal since monday night i told you yesterday you was looking peaked the princess and me would have brought you breakfast if youd asked saved you a trip out i only didnt come up because i figured you was still asleep i need the exercise i said robin here will make sure i dont overdo it well you call me if you need help you be sure and give him my number doll you pass out or something in the restaurant i dont want to see it in the papers first i gave him my solemn word that he would have the honor of providing me smelling salts if needed he scowled at us but went on inside with peppy who is he robin demanded when we were out of earshot your grandfather hes just my downstairs neighbor hes retired and im his hobby whys he so rattled about you going out to eat its not breakfastits breakfast with you if he was twenty years younger hed be beating up any guy who came visiting me its tiresome but hes essentially so goodhearted i cant bring myself to punch him down the four blocks to the belmont diner wore me out ive been through convalescence before i know the early part is slow and then your strength comes back pretty fast but it still was frustrating i had to work to get the tension in my stomach to subside most of the waitresses at the diner know mei probably catch at least one meal a week there and sometimes more theyd all read about my misadventures and crowded around the table to find out how i was doing and who the talent id come in with was barbara whose section i was in shooed the others away when they started offering juice and rolls when i ordered a cheese omelet potatoes bacon toast and a side of fruit with yogurt she shook her head youre not going to eat all that vicits twice what you get when youve just run five miles i insisted but she was right i got through half the omelet and the potatoes but couldnt even make a pro forma effort with the fruit my stomach strained uncomfortably all i felt up to was napping but i forced myself to talk a little shop with robin you know anything about the fire at the prairie shores what kind of accelerant they used whether things looked the same as at the indiana arms he shook his head the indiana arms job was more sophisticated because there were people on the premises it looks as though they put a fuse in the wires in the night mans quarters when theyd gotten him off to the track they had a trailer going down to a stock of paraffin in the basement and a timer so they didnt have to be anywhere near the place the fire you were in they didnt have to be that carefulthey just dumped gasoline in the kitchen and at the doors to the basement set the thing off and took off he looked at me soberly you were lucky vi damned lucky thats what gets the job done napoleon wanted lucky generals not theoretical whizzes it gets me edgy when people lecture me on a narrow escape i had been lucky but all the luck in the world wouldnt have helped if i didnt also keep myself in top physical and mental shape why didnt my skill count for anything yeah but he was beaten in a big way in the end do you have any idea who did this to you my management is concerned that it came out of your investigation into the indiana armsthat youre sitting on information you havent shared with us i tried to keep my temper even i dont know who did it its possible its connected to your claim but the only person who can tell me is lying doggo if i had that kind of information i wouldnt be so unprofessional as to keep it to myself he hesitated toying with the salt shaker im just wonderingmy boss and i were talking yesterdaywe work with a lot of investigators maybe we should bring someone else in on the seligman case i sat stiffly in my booth i realize i dont have the results you want but ive done the financial checks and a pretty good rundown on the organization if you want someone else to talk to the night watchman or explore what seligmans children may have been doing thats your call of course its not your competence vic butwell this assault on you just has people questioning your judgment i tried to relax i went down there because i got an sos from my aunt since she has a strong proclivity for alcoholic histrionics i wanted to see her myself first rather than share that part of my family life with outsiders if id had any serious inkling of danger i would have handled things differently but i am really really fed up with being chewed out by everyone from doctors to the police to you for saving her and escaping from danger with my own life intact by the time i finished i was panting i leaned back in my chair with my eyes shut trying to head off the incipient pain in my head vic im sorry im glad youre alive youve been doing a marvelous job but we wonder whether someone else could bring a different perspective just the fact that your aunt is involved may be affecting your detachment thats your right i repeated stiffly but if you bring someone else in i will not work in a subordinate capacity to him or her ill be glad to share my notes and my ideas but i wont continue working for ajax well maybe we dont have to hire someone else at this point there is a city bomb and arson squad robin offered tentatively who wouldnt even look at the indiana arms for you dont put your faith in them just because ive gotten some licksitd take more than that to get roland montgomery to look at the case seriously hes even spinning a little story about me setting the fires myself robin looked startled youre joking when i told him about my meeting yesterday with montgomery he made a sour face what the hell is with that guy he hates outsiders horning in on arson inquiries i knowweve clashed beforebut this is outrageous even for him his mention of outsider brought the elusive memory of a face at the fire swimming back to my mind but i couldnt place it you dont know who called in the alarm do you if the fire trucks hadnt been there i dont think my aunt would have made it out robin shook his head again i have pals in the fire department who let me see everything they have on both fires but the call to was anonymous i ran my fork around in the congealed grease on my plate trying to come up with questions i should ask about the fire did the police have a list of the onlookers for example or had anything been left behind at the site that might point to the arsonist my heart wasnt in it though the questioning of my professional judgment wounded me as few other criticisms could at the same time i saw myself in a shameful light clattering off to the prairie shores hotel like a giant elephant thundering through the veldt if id called the copsof course i had called furey still a full police battalion might have saved both elena and me a knock on the head but the truth was if it happened again tonight i would do it the same way all over again i couldnt expose elena to the ribald indifference of the police i have to solve my private problems privately i dont even know if its a strength or weakness it just is i paid my bill and we set off silently for my apartment neither of us pretending the conversation hadnt occurred outside my building robin played with the bandages on my right hand choosing his words vic i think well let the seligman investigation go on the back burner for a few days well get someone to talk to the night watchman in more depth but we wont ask him to take over the case next week when youre feeling better well see what hes turned up and you can decide how you feel about going ahead with the rest of it that seemed fair to me it didnt stop me feeling depressed as i slowly hiked upstairs but it did ease the tight knot between my shoulder blades as i was unlocking my door mr contreras and the dog came bounding upstairs when they reached the second landing i could hear him scolding her gentlyhe couldnt see where he was going did she have to keep racing back and forth under his feet trip him up and then where would she be with me gone all the time i felt the knot come back to my neck and faced them without a welcoming smile mr contreras was hidden behind a giant parcel wrapped in the striped paper florists use this came while you was out doll he panted i thought i might as well accept it for you so they didnt bring it by when you was asleep or something thanks i said with what politeness i could muster i just wanted to go into my own cave and hibernate alone its okay doll im happy to help what happened to your friend he leave you high and dry he set the parcel down gently and wiped his forehead he knew i wanted to rest i said pointedly sure cookie sure i understand you want some time by yourself you need me to do anything for you i was about to utter a firm denial when i thought of the letter i wanted to express to my uncle peter i needed to sleep so badly i couldnt get to the post office before their early saturday closing mr contreras was more than pleased to mail it for me he was ecstatic that id chosen him for the errand he was so thrilled i wished id fought back my fatigue and taken the damned thing myself when he bustled off with the letterdont give me no money now doll ill settle with you lateri dragged the flowers inside it was a magnificent bouquet reds and golds and purples so exotic i hadnt seen them before they were arranged in a handsome wooden bowl lined with plastic i fished around among the foliage for a card glad youre out of the hospital ran the round unformed writing of the florist next time try to pick quieter work it was signed rm i was so tired i didnt even want to try to decide if it was a goodnatured gibe or a warning i locked all the bolts turned off both phones and stumbled into bed preparing for the high jump when i got up on sunday i knew id turned the critical corner toward recovery i wasnt back to my full strength but i felt clearheaded and energetic the lingering depression from my breakfast with robin resolved itself to a manageable problemmy ability to handle the seligman investigation was in doubt not my entire career and personality even my hands were better i didnt take off the gauze but i could do simple household chores without feeling that the skin was splitting open to the bone the early detective gets the worm although it was unlikely that anyone would come into the alma mejicana offices at all on sunday they were less likely to do so first thing in the morning before taking off i went into the living room to do a modified version of my exercisesi wasnt ready to start running yet but i needed to keep limber ralph macdonalds flowers dominated the room id forgotten them as i stretched my quads and tightened my glutes i eyed the tropical rain forest balefully whether meant as a threat or a humorous compliment they were overwhelming too big a gesture from a man who scarcely knew me when i finished my leg liftstwentyfive with each leg instead of my usual hundred left me breathlessi scrambled into my jeans and a sweatshirt straining i carried the flowers down to my car i drove over to broadway and picked up a bagel an apple and some milk at one of the delis my attempts to eat and drive at the same time showed the state of my healingtwohanded the steering wheel was manageable with one hand my palms started smarting and my wrist ached i pulled over at the corner of diversey and pine grove to eat the tropical flowers stained the car with their heavy scent making it hard to eat without queasiness i rolled the window all the way down but the smell was still heady finally i gulped down the milk and started south without finishing the bagel sunday morning is the best time to drive in chicago because there isnt any traffic out i made the nine miles to michael reese in fifteen minutes without pushing the speed limit getting the massive bouquet up to the fourth floor taxed my healing palms and shoulders almost beyond endurance when i got off the elevator a sympathetic orderly offered to take it from me these are gorgeous what room you want them in i gave him elenas room number he carried the pot as easily as if it were a footballas easily as i could have done a week ago i followed him down the hall and into elenas room a woman about my own age in a yellow nylon gown was sitting in elenas bed reading the tribune my jaw dropped slightly the way it does when youre taken unawares my aunt i said foolishly she was here on friday maybe she checked out the orderly suggested she wasnt in very good shape maybe they moved her i scurried back to the nursing station a middleaged woman was making elaborate notes in a chart i tried interrupting but she held up a warning hand and continued writing finally she looked at me yes im v l warshawski i said my aunt elena warshawski was hereshed been hit on the head and was unconscious for a day or so did they move her or what the nurse shook her head majestically she left yesterday left i echoed staggered butthey told me she was in bad shape that she ought to have a month or so of convalescent care how could they just let her go they didnt she took off on her own stole the clothes belonging to the lady she shared a room with and disappeared my head started spinning again i gripped the countertop to steady myself when did this happen why didnt someone call me the nurse disclaimed all knowledge of the particulars the hospital called whoever was listed on her forms as next of kin they may not have felt you needed to know i am her next of kin maybe shed given peters name thoughi shouldnt push my rights as her nearest and dearest too hard can you tell me when she took off she snapped her pencil down in exasperation ask the police they sent an officer over yesterday afternoon he was pretty annoyed and got all the details i was close to screaming from frustration and confusion give me the guys name and ill talk to him with pleasure she sighed audibly and went into the records room behind the counter the orderly had been standing behind me all this time holding the flowers you want to take these miss he asked while i waited oh give them to the person whos been here longest without any visitors i said shortly the nurse came back out with a file michael furey detective she read without looking up she went back to the chart shed been working on when i interrupted the interview as clearly over back in my car my arms trembledcarrying ralph macdonalds flowers in had overstrained them so elenad done another bunk should i care the police knew about it presumably theyd keep an eye out for her i had better things to do instead of driving over to the alma mejicana offices on south ashland i took the chevy back to the prairie shores hotel it started groaning again as i turned onto indiana you think you feel bad i grumbled i dont want to be here either and my hands hurt the palms were sore under my mitts they throbbed against the hard steering wheel next car i got would have power steering the prairie shores made a fitting neighbor now for the indiana arms the two blackened shells leered at each other across the street not even elena could be hiding out in one of them but there were other abandoned buildings on the blockan old warehouse a boardedup school the remains of a nursing home she could be in any of them i didnt have the energy to hunt through them all let the police do it i headed down cermak at fifty weaving in and out of traffic sliding through red lights i was just plain pissed what kind of cute little game was she playing anyway and how much time did i have to spend playing it with her shed gotten someone rattled enough to try to kill her and instead of talking to me about it she was skulking around town thinking she was a smart enough drunk to keep out of his way or her way i amended conscientiously i turned left on halsted in front of a madly honking braking semi that cooled me down pretty fast the worst thing in the world to do with a car is use it when youre angry tony had told me that as close to angry himself as he ever got when he took my keys away from me for a month id been seventeen and it was the worst punishment id ever endured it should have cured me of this kind of outburst i kept up a sober alert pace the three miles to the amphitheater alma mejicanas offices were behind it on ashland tony used to take me to horse and dog shows there but it had been a good twentyfive years since id been in that part of town id forgotten the maze of deadend streets between ashland and halsted even having to double back to thirtyninth and make my way on the main streets brought me to the contracting company in twenty minutes i drove slowly past their drab brick building the door was padlocked shut the highset dirty windows reflected the gray morning airno lights were on behind them i made a careful circuit down the alley behind the building the rear metal doors had a heavy chain slung through their handles clamped together with a businesslike american master padlock i drove on through the alley and went up ashland again to fortyfourth i left the chevy at the corner across from a handkerchief park where an old man was walking a lethargic terrier neither of them paid any attention to me i walked down the alley with my head up purposeful i belonged there when a dumpster lid clattered shut behind a nearby gate i didnt jump at least not very high with an american master you need either an acetylene torch a highquality saw or the key i didnt have any of those i studied the chain regretfully it was bigger than me too after a complete circuit of the building i didnt think i could get to the windows without a ladder that left the roof which also meant coming back and doing it at night down the alley a telephone pole stood close enough to a building that i could shinny up and make my way across to alma mejicana i stretched my arms up against it the first spikes were about four feet out of reach still some kind of footstool should make the climb possible three flattopped cubes of varying height lay between the pole and my target i paced the distance id only have to manage five feet at the widest jump even in my feeble state i ought to be able to do that in the dark i looked for a landmark that would let me know id reached alma the buildings facing the alley were lined with undifferentiated high wood fencing but a garage had been built into the wall cattycorner to the contractor i should be able to spot that with my flashlight the old man and the terrier were sitting on a bench reading the morning paper when i got back to the chevy neither of them looked up even when i slammed the car door shut i headed over to the ryan at a brisk clip the chevy started its hideous grinding when i pushed it to sixty on the expressway but quieted down at forty i made it home in time to catch the bears opening kickoff against the unbeaten bills like all good chicagoans i turned the tv sound off and caught the radio commentarywe like dick butkuss knowledge and his partisanship with the bears cruising at halftime i looked at the sunday papers i was flipping idly through the stars chicago beat section when the seligman name jumped up at me the company offices on montrose had been burgled mrs rita donnelly fiftyseven a thirtyyear employee had been killed behind me jim hart and butkus were carrying on about the fine points of dan hamptons firsthalf play i switched the radio off and read the story slowly the star had only given it five inches i went through the tribune and the suntimes and finally found enough detail to let me know the time the police thought it had happenedlate friday afternoonthe mailmans discovery of her body on saturday when he went in through the unlocked front door with a registered letter and mr seligmans shock mrs donnelly had left two daughters shannon casey thirtytwo and star wentzel twentynine both married and three grandchildren mass would be at st inannas parish tuesday afternoon visitation at the callahan funeral home monday evening in lieu of flowers money should be sent to the st inanna scholarship fund the bears and bills were stacked in a violent heap on the silent tv screenthe second half had started without me i switched off the set and went to the window to look out it could have been random violencemoney came into the office someone knew that staked it out killed her before she could get to the bank just dont forget thats possible i lectured myself out loud dont get so wound up in your favorite theories that you ignore the amount of random ugly violence in this town how could it have been random though with cerise dead the attack on elena and me the two fires it all connected someplace the murderer had ransacked the files but no money had been taken either from the office or from mrs donnellys own bag mrs donnellys death made me do something i had felt too churlish to do earliercall furey to see what he knew about elena he sounded pleased enough to hear from me although i could tell by the background noise id interrupted a party you got us all kind of worried vic you doing okay i was feeling better until i went to the hospital this morning to visit my aunt they told me youd come around to talk to her and that they gave you all the details yeah i tried calling you a few times but just got your answering service i was hoping you might have some idea where she went shes our only real lead on wednesdays fire besides me i told him about montgomerys theory oh montyhe gets a little off balance sometimes dont pay any attention to him what about your aunt i checked that hotel on kenmore but she hasnt been back there since she skipped ten days ago i suggested the abandoned buildings on the near south side and he promised to get a patrol unit to check them out the pals had all come over to watch the gamehe kind of wanted to get back to it but hed talk to me later in the week the phone rang as soon as id hung up it was my uncle peter frothing because of my letter what did i think he was some cretin that hed expose his children to someone like elena its okay petershes vanished no ones going to ask anything of you actually i was planning on calling reese tomorrow to make sure they had his name and address as elenas financial guarantor but i didnt see it would help him any to learn that this afternoon the news didnt mollify him just get this through your head vicif id wanted to stay tied to a bunch of losers i wouldnt have moved away from chicago if that offends you im sorry but i want more for my children than tony wanted for you i was about to launch a fullscale counterattack on how tony wouldnt have wanted sleaze for me but even as i started it i realized the futility of saying anything peter and i had been around this track together a good many times neither of us was going to change i hung up without saying goodbye i went back to the window and looked down at the drab bungalows facing my building maybe tony would have wanted a mansion in winnetka for me but hed only known bungalows and walkupshe wouldnt think they were any disgrace for me my fight with peter had exhausted me more than carrying around that tropical rain forest had this morning if i wanted to prance around the rooftops tonight i needed some rest i switched off the phones and fell into my bed house calls it was six when i woke up again my shoulder muscles had stiffened from the aftermath of carrying ralph macdonalds flowers up to elena i wanted to soak them under a hot shower that was impossible with my gauze mitts anyway i needed to keep my hands protected for my upcoming labors although id had a little peanut butter while watching the bears i hadnt eaten a proper meal yet today i still didnt have any real food in the house id planned to ask robin to drive me to the store yesterday but after his squib about taking me off the case it had gone out of my mind i didnt think i could do my santa claus imitation without dinner i pulled on the top to my long underwear and put a black cotton sweater on over that it might be cool on the rooftops and i didnt want anything as bulkyor as visibleas a jacket jeans and my black basketball hightops completed the ensemble that the welldressed burglar was wearing this year i also needed some kind of dark cap or scarf to keep light from reflecting from my face or hair i rummaged through my drawers and came up with a soft black linen square eileen mallory had given me last christmas i didnt think the green and blue design woven into it would show up at night if im carrying my gun i usually wear a shoulder holster since i wanted to bring a few tools with me tonight i dug out an old policestyle belt with a holster and holes for slinging handcuffs or a truncheon my best flashlight was buried in the prairie shores rubble but i had another one someplace after rooting through the diningroom cupboard and the hall closet i found it at the back of the refrigerator top although a little greasy to the touch its battery still worked i strung some twine through the hook on its end and tied it to my belt a small hammer a screwdriver and a dark hand towel completed my supplies i used to have a set of picklocks given to me by a grateful client in my pd days but the police had confiscated those several years ago i picked up my rolling footstool from behind the refrigerator and headed out i managed to slink out of the apartment without rousing mr contreras peppy or even vinnie the banker the fall twilight had set in purplygray and changing quickly to black no passerby could make out my equipment belt i stuck it in the chevys trunk with the footstool and drove the four blocks to the belmont diner for dinner after a bowl of hearty cabbage soup and a plate of roast chicken with mashed potatoes i felt too stuffed to move gluttony is a terrible enemy of the private detective id have to wait a good hour before starting my trek maybe even longer youre disgusting i admonished myself privately as i paid the bill peter wimsey and philip marlowe never had this kind of problem back in the chevy i drummed my fingers on the steering wheel if i returned to my apartment the chances were good id run into the old man if his jealous sixth sense warned him i was setting out on an adventure i might not be able to get away without him i didnt want to go to a movie i didnt want to sit in my office with a novel i put the car into gear and went north up to estes the chevy seemed to be behaving itself againmaybe id been imagining the groan in its engine it was only eight when i got to saul seligmans house not too late for visiting even an old man i could see a dim glow of light behind the heavily draped windows a latemodel chrysler stood immediately in front of the house i parked just behind it and went up the walk to ring the bell after a long wait the locks turned back seligmans elder daughter barbara feldman answered the door she was close to fifty well groomed without being fashionable her reddish hair dyed and carefully set her sweater and slacks tailored but comfortable she looked at me vaguely not remembering me from the visit id paid to her northbrook home im v i warshawski i said loudly enough to penetrate the glass the private investigator who came to see you last week about the fire at the indiana arms mrs feldman cracked the door so she could speak without shouting back at me my father isnt well this evening hes not up to seeing anyone i nodded sympathetically mrs donnellys death must have upset him terribly thats why ive come if hes really ill i wont stay long but its possible he knows something that would help me get a line on her killer she frowned the police have already been here he doesnt know anything they may not have known the right questions to ask i think i do she thought it over sucking on her upper lip then shut the door at least she didnt rebolt the myriad locks while i waited for her to come back i did some gentle quad stretches i didnt want to face a fivefoot jump and miss because i hadnt loosened up a couple passing by with a small dog on a leash eyed me curiously but didnt say anything mrs feldman came back after about five minutes my father says you cant help that all you do is bring trouble he thinks you caused auntie ritas death theres always something unsettling about a grown person using childhood names to discuss friends and relations as if the world around her is so kaleidoscoped that auntie rita or mummy or daddy means the same thing to everyone listening to her no i said patiently i didnt do that its possible though that mrs donnelly knew something the person who torched your fathers hotel didnt want disclosed she may not even have known it was a terrible secret if i talk to mr seligman maybe we can find out what theyd discussed the last time they were together that might give me a lead on why she was killed and that can help us figure out who killed her mrs donnelly had known something i was sure of that i hadnt thought it had anything to do with the arsonmore about her children it had seemed in some way that had made me wonder vaguely if mr seligman might have been their father i hadnt thought it concerned either me or ajax but now it seemed id been mistaken mrs feldman trundled back into the recesses of the house with my message i felt a little absurd communicating this way as though she were the wall and i was thisbe after a shorter wait she returned to tell me her father would see me he says youre like one of the plagues and if he doesnt talk to you now youll just hound him until he does i dont think he should but he never listens to me anyway i followed her into the stale hallway we went down to the end of the passage into the kitchen a room even more cramped and dingy than the musty living room where i had seen the old man before he was huddled at the formica table in a shabby plaid dressing gown a mug of tea in front of him under the dim ceiling bulb his skin looked like a moldy orange he kept his eyes on the tea when we came in stirring it relentlessly im sorry to bother you mr seligman i began but he interrupted me with a snarl the hell with that if you were sorry to bother me intrude on me make my life miserable why do you keep coming around he didnt lift his eyes from the mug i sat down across from him banging my shin against the refrigerator as i pulled one of the grimy chairs away from the table i suppose it does look as though im the one assaulting your life since im the only stranger you see but someone out there doesnt like seligman property management they torched the indiana arms and they killed mrs donnelly id kind of like to see they get stopped before they do anything else such as come after you i just want to stop you coming after me he muttered sullenly i held up my gauze mitts and spoke harshly someone tried to do that last tuesday tried to burn me to death so id never go after anyone again was that your idea he finally looked up at me anyone can wrap bandages around their hands the words were truculent but he couldnt hide the little hiss of breath when he saw the gauze i unwrapped the left hand without speaking now that the palm was healing it looked worse than before yellow pustules surrounding the angry red line down the middle he glanced at it then looked away scowling he couldnt keep his eyes from sliding back to it mrs feldman made an uneasy noise in the background but didnt speak finally i put the palm down on my lap after i came by here on tuesday did you see mrs donnelly or just talk to her on the phone when mr seligman hesitated his daughter answered she came by most evenings didnt she pop now that youve stopped going into the office every day so she came by after i was here and what did you talk about my business which is none of your business young lady when you told her id asked for a photograph why did it upset her i kept my body completely still my voice monotonous if you know so much about it why are you asking me he muttered the snipe to his tea mug was it your children or her children she was worried about or is that the same thing behind me mrs feldman gasped what are you trying to say whats wrong with you anyway to come around badgering him when hes had such a shock i ignored her how many daughters do you have mr seligman i was way off target i could tell by his look of outraged disgust im just glad fanny didnt have to live to hear this kind of garbage in her own kitchen so why did it bother her that you gave me the picture i dont know it was a sudden frustrated explosion she came by we talked i told her youd been around hounding me still not letting me have my money but you wanted a picture of barbara and connie then when i told her i let you have the one taken at our fortieth anniversary fannys and mine she got all excited she wanted to know which picture it was of course i only gave you one i had a copy of i dont expect someone like you to return something sentimental thats why i picked that one i told her all that and she started carrying on about how i was desecrating fannys memory letting you have something from such a personal time by the time he finished his orangey cheeks were spotted with red and he was panting now are you happy can you leave me in peace i think so probably when is the service for mrs donnelly tuesday afternoon dont you go barging in destroying her funeral i still think its all because of those questions of yours shes dead i met his angry glare sadly i had an uneasy feeling he was right i got to my feet wadding the discarded gauze from my left hand into a tight ball ill give you back your picture mr seligman but it wont be for a few more days i wont come back here again but i would like to get into your office can you arrange that for me you want the keys or you want to just break in like those hoodlums that killed rita i raised my eyebrows i didnt read about a breakin i thought the door was open for normal business and they walked in well its locked now and you cant have the keys youll just have to do your grave robbing someplace else fatigue was starting to hit me i didnt have any more energy to give to arguing with him i stuffed the wadded gauze into my jeans pocket and turned without speaking mrs feldman bustled me down the hall i hope you can leave him alone now i shouldnt have let you in in the first place but hes never listened to me if my sisterd been hereshe looks just like mother dont come back again not unless you have his check for the indiana arms its just a fire to you but it meant something special to him i started to say something about my own warm and wonderful character but broke it offshe wouldnt care id barely stepped across the threshold when she began snapping the locks shut a leap in the dark i didnt feel like an overstuffed goose anymore that was one good thing at the same time my bravado had cost me the dressing to my left hand i tested it gingerly against the steering wheel the blisters rolled and squished a bit i got out and opened the trunk and pulled out the towel id stuck in my equipment belt i wrapped it around my left hand using my teeth to hold it in place while i tucked the ends inside it made a slippery glove but i could manage driving now as i drove across touhy to the edens i was so tired and depressed that i wondered if i should abandon my project at alma mejicana often when i feel like quitting i hear my mothers voice in my head exhorting me her fierce energy was tirelessthe worst thing i could ever do in her eyes was to give up tonight though i heard no echoes in my head i was alone in the dark city with my sore palms and bruised shoulders if youre going to sink into selfpity go home to bed i scolded myself otherwise your mission is bound to fail for acrobatic derringdo you need to be at the peak of selfconfidence not down in a well i didnt want to dwell on the scene in seligmans musty kitchen but i forced myself at least to think about what hed told me rita donnelly had been sitting on something i should have probed her harder about her daughters at the time but it had seemed so purely personal if it wasnt their paternity shed been hiding what was it about them she didnt want people to know the light at mccormick stayed red so long i was only roused from my musings by the violent honking behind me startled i leapt forward through the intersection barely clearing it on the yellow and getting a finger from an irate driver accelerating past me going sixty on the edens i found managing the steering so difficult with my towelwrapped hand that i couldnt think about anything except the car and the traffic i moved into the righthand lane and slowed to fifty as i maneuvered past the construction zone at roosevelt the damned engine started grinding again i had to slow to forty before the noise subsided i drove straight to ashland without mishap and once more circled the alma mejicana building through the alley no lights showed this time i parked on fortyfifth near the mouth of the alley in case i needed to get to my car quickly i tied eileens scarf around my head and pulled the equipment belt from the trunk to strap around my waist with the weight id lost recently it hung a little low the flashlight and hammer banged unpleasantly into my thighs when i walked i hugged the footstool close to my chest it was an unpleasant sign of my weakened state that a weight i would normally find negligible slowed me down tonight even though the night air was pleasantly cool the streets were empty most of the buildings on the east side of the alley were commercial the residents behind the fence on the west side probably hung out on the street behind it was just after ninethirty when i reached the telephone pole down the alley from alma mejicana i looked up at it dubiously in the starlight behind their wrappings my palms tingled i undid the towel on my left hand and stuck it in my waistband at the small of my back on the footstool my outstretched fingertips were just shy of the first set of spikes i planted my feet firmly on the stool bent my knees and jumped the first time i was too scared about slicing open my left palm and didnt hang on the clatter i made knocking the footstool across the alley woke the neighborhood dogs i lay in the shadow of the fence rubbing my thigh where the hammer had dug in when i crashed waiting for angry householders to appear when no one came i picked up the rolling stair and carried it back to the pole the dogs were thoroughly roused now i could hear various shouts at them to shut up their unified chorus apparently made the owners think they were barking at each other back on top of my stool i took some diaphragm breaths leaning my head against the pole the pole is an extension of my arms it welcomes me as a sister it will not fight me as an intruder i repeated this litany a few times bent my knees and jumped without waiting to think it out this time i grabbed hold of the spikes and wrapped my thighs around the pole ignoring the sharp bite of the hammer and the twinge in my shoulder blades i moved fast still not thinking about my hands shinnying up the rough wood until i could reach the second row of spikes and hoist myself up standing once id done that it was easy to climb the remaining ten feet so i was level with the building top when i stepped onto the roof i felt exhilarated with my achievement so much so that pain and fatigue lay shielded behind a wall in my head i ran lightly across the rooftop judged the threefoot gap and jumped it easily the next break was wider and upward but confidence was now carrying me in an easy tide i turned off my mind and made the jump my left foot scraping the side of the wall but the right landing clear on the asphalt i went to the edge facing the alley and cautiously shone my flash my garage marker lay in front of the next building alma mejicana was the one beyond that the jump this time was the fivefooter but downward the building where i landed was close enough to my target that they almost shared a common wall i stepped across and explored the surface sure enough a trapdoor lay behind the vent pipes i pried at it gently with the claw end of the hammer as id hoped they didnt bother locking it it came up heavily i laid my towel on the asphalt behind it and hoisted it slowly open my shoulders sending out little whitehot sparks of pain that i tried to ignore i had to strain to get the door to a balance point and then drop it softly on the towel beneath i lay down next to it catching my breath and making sure no alarms sounded the moon was in its dark phase the stars were chips of cold glass in the black sky despite my exertions and my long underwear i shivered before the night demons could approach me i sat up and shone my flashlight into the building opening the trap had released a set of hanging stairs i climbed softly down in my black hightops i was in a small attic where the heating and cooling apparatus was set up some rough stairs wide enough to handle equipment led to the main part of the building even though the streets were empty i didnt want to risk rousing someone by turning on the building lights stuffing the scarf in my back pocket i started exploring the interior a frugal use of my flashlight showed that the two floors of the building had been divided into a series of offices for the most part they were bare of furniture one was set up with a metal desk and an apollo computer on the ground floor schmidt and martinez had separate offices equipped with a certain degree of luxury schmidt liked the sleek milan style while martinez favored a heavier baroque spanish look because the groundfloor rooms were windowless i could turn on their office lights and explore to my hearts content i whistled a little under my breath as i opened and shut desk drawers and filing cabinets i didnt have time to go through all their papers i just wanted some obvious clue left out on a desktop something like kill v i warshawski and her aunt elena tonight by torching the prairie shores hotel someplace they should have a big chart showing all of alma mejicanas projects even after going through the premises twice i didnt find any obvious sign of work in progress it could be that it was all stored on the apollo but that meant any time someone wanted to check their commitments to see if they could bid on a new job theyd have to crank up the machine and get a printout maybe they were such a small operation they could work on only one project at a time if that was so how had they been able to get part of the ryan contract even if they were leasing equipment from wunsch and grasso they couldnt get involved in projects that size without substantial resources i made a face and started hunting for ledgers maybe all the bookkeeping was done on the computer upstairs but they still had to have some kind of hard copy of their transactions anyway i didnt believe they used that machine the room it was in was completely empty except for the metal desk it sat onit held none of the papers and manuals you expect to find around a machine in active use it was midnight when i finally located the books in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet by then my eyelids had started to swell with fatigue one thing i hadnt thought to bring was a flask of coffee but i found an electric machine and a can of mexican coffee in the storeroom and recklessly helped myself to a pot i carried the ledgers into luiss office and sat at his glossy black desk with my coffee it was the heat more than the caffeine that kept me going the books were perfectly straightforward payments were received from various project owners such as the us government in the case of the dan ryan and payments were made for heat cement and other necessities of contracting life but the biggest consistent payees were not suppliers they were wunsch and grasso and farmworks inc i shut my swollen eyes trying to remember why i knew that name when i woke up it was three oclock my neck was stiff from where id slumped over in luiss chair and my heart raced uncomfortablyi could have slept until morning and been surprised in here by the alma mejicana employees when i glanced back down at the ledgers though i remembered farmworks inc perfectlythat was the bizarre name id seen on the time sheets at the rapelec site the night cerise was found dead there i rifled through luiss desk drawers for a pad of paper not finding any i ripped a blank sheet from the back of the ledger and jotted some of the numbers down i had an inkling of what they meant but with morning near i didnt have time to think just to copy and get going i put the ledgers back in the drawer where id found them cleaned the coffeepot and tiptoed back upstairs to shut the trapdoor to the roof pulling my towel in first the front door could be unlocked from the inside i wouldnt be able to lock it again but they would just think theyd forgotten to shut it properly on friday night even if they suspected a breakin i hadnt left any personal signs behind anyway i was far too beat to go back the way id come i undid the bolts and stepped out onto ashland i was about ten feet from the door when the alarms went id been going to circle through the alley for my footstool but this seemed like a good time to buy a new one i moved up the street at a brisk walknever let anyone see you running when an alarm sounds a car heading up ashland to fortyfifth slowed i fished in my back pocket for the scarfi should have put it on before i left the building it wasnt there i dug in my jacket pockets my waistband my belt but somewhere in the recesses of alma mejicana id lost it my hands trembled and my legs turned rubbery i made myself walk naturally if the police or luis schmidt found it who was going to know it was mine bobby mallory probably didnt keep track of the presents his wife handed out and it was most unlikely hed ever be shown this evidence reciting this highlevel logic didnt calm me but it occupied enough of the front of my mind to keep me from total panic it helped that the passing driver while still going slowly didnt stop for all i knew he wasnt concerned about the alarm but was debating whether to try to assault a woman carrying as much weaponry as i had strapped to me i kept facing straight ahead trying to make him invisible when i turned left at the corner he continued north my control broke i jogged the remaining half block to my car and headed for the ryan without waiting to see if anyone responded to the alarm dressing for work for shes a jolly good sister though her hands are a giant blister i sang in the bath it was eleven monday morning i had risen from a sleep as sound as if i were one of the just instead of a moderately successful burglar the morning papers contained no news of my breakin of course theyd probably been at the printer as i was driving home but i didnt think an alarm at a small business on the south side would get a mention when they couldnt find any signs of damage my latenight panic had vanished id left a piece of evidence behind it was true but that scarf was sold by the dozen at various irish import shops around the city each week it was only my own guilty fears that had made me think it could be traced to me the one thing i should not do was call furey or finchley or any of my other police pals to inquire about alma mejicana id unwrapped my right hand before climbing into the tub the blisters on the left had broken and reshut with a lot of oozing they stung sharply when i cautiously put my hand in the water the right protected behind its gauze shielding was starting to look like real skin nothing makes you heal faster than good genes good work vi good choice of parental chromosomes even though my shoulders were stiff and my neck sore i felt pretty happy music is the voice of love i crooned soaping my armpits i didnt know what farmworks inc was i hadnt found proof that luis schmidt had tried to murder me i wasnt any closer to knowing whether cerise had been killed or why elena had run scared but my successful burglary proved better than a tonic i bounded out of the bath did a more vigorous exercise routine than id managed yesterday and put on my jeans and a shirt to borrow the dog from the old man peppy had set up a barking when i came in last night but neither mr contreras nor vinnie the banker had popped out to see me so id hoped id gotten home free mr contrerass suspicious scrutiny when he answered my knock made me wonder but i didnt volunteer anythingwhen i was a public defender i was always having to caution my clients against boasting out of euphoria the easiest way to get caught is to pull off a slick job then feel so full of yourself that you have to brag about it then one of your pals gets pissed at you and squeals and there you are at twentysixth and california talking to the pd you musta been tired cookie to sleep this late mr contreras said severely yeah but im much better this morning im going to take her royal heinie out for a walk i showed him my healing palms and got grudging consent to take the dog it would have been cruel to turn me down considering that she was practically wriggling out of her skin in her eagerness i wasnt up to running her but i drove her over to the lake and threw sticks into the water for her a pair of winter gloves seemed to provide enough protection for my hands since golden retrievers are born knowing the backstroke my only difficulty came in persuading peppy to get back into the car when my shoulders grew too sore to throw anymore i parked the car illegally by the hydrant in front of our apartment and ran in to drop her off with mr contreras he refuses to believe that lake water wont ruin her delicate constitution but before he could get well into the body of his complaints i smiled and said goodbye youll be able to remember it all to tell me later i assured him as he glared at me in the doorway i ran upstairs to my own place and dug my hiking boots out of the hall closet i pulled my gun from the belt where id draped it on a chair early this morning and stuck it in my waistband the phone began ringing as i was shutting the front door but i let it go despite my sense of urgency i took the time to lock all three dead boltssomeone had wanted to kill me after all and there was no reason to invite an ambush i pulled my gloves back on and headed for lake shore drive although the grass in the lakefront parks was brown and sere the soft air and sparkling water eased the memory of the harsh summer as i drove south i sang were on the way to grandmas farm and other selections from childhood the underground garages were full but even having to park in one of the pricey wabash avenue lots didnt seriously dampen my spirits i whistled under my breath as i took the feeble pulteney elevator to the fourth floor our building management doesnt believe in such unnecessary expenses as hallway lights only the emergency bulbs at either end of the corridors provide a faint illumination enough to fumble your keys into your lock as i got off the elevator i could see a dim shape outlined against the wall across from my office i dont get much walkin businessmost of my corporate clients prefer that i come to them its one of the reasons i can run my business from such dismal surroundings if someone wanted to shoot me this was the perfect opportunity i thought about racing for the stairwell and fetching help but tom czarnik the building super was waiting for a chance to prove me an unfit tenant and getting the cops would take so much time that my visitor would probably be long gone before they got there and the real truth vi is that you cant stand asking people for help this cold thought came to me even as i was trotting down the hall moving from side to side and hunching my shoulders to minimize my size when i came up to the shadow figure i gave a little gasp of laughter release from my fearszerlina ramsay was waiting for me i didnt know if you was ever coming in here girl ive been here since eight this morning it was a comment more than a complaint ive been under the weather i said wrestling clumsily with the keys in my gloves hands when i finally turned the right one in the lock the door opened slowlya weeks accumulation of mail was blocking it i scooped it up and held the door open for mrs ramsay you could have called me at home if you needed me id have been happy to go see you under my office lights her skin color looked healthier than when shed been in the hospital her dour hostess apparently was looking after her well didnt want to do that i didnt know who you lived with whether theyd let you talk to me she lowered herself carefully into my utilitarian guest chair anyway i didnt want maisie to hear me on the phone to you i dumped the mail on my desk and swiveled in the desk chair to face her my desk faces the window with the guest chairs behind it so that a steel barrier wont intimidate visitors i heard on the news youd been hurt in that fire last week across from the indiana arms wasnt it she nodded to herself and i waited patiently for her to continue maisie says leave you to yourselfyou got cerise in trouble leastways your aunt did let you get yourself out by yourself i didnt feel responsible for cerises death but i also didnt see what purpose arguing about it with her would serve anyway she could well be right about elena at least partially right it seemed to me the two of them had some scheme going i ventured i thought maybe they wanted to pretend katterina had died so they could collect a big award from the insurance company you could be right she sighed unhappily you could be right blaming you doesnt take away the pain of having a child like that one that uses heroin and crack and god knows whatall else and steals and lies its just easier to blame you than lie in bed asking myself what i should of done different elenas no prize either i offered but my dad was her brother and they didnt make em any better than him yeah but you didnt bring her up if i hadnt a had to work so hard be gone all the time she broke herself off no use talking about it now its not why i came up here took me three buses too after a brooding silence in which her full lips disappeared into a narrow slit in her face she said its no news to you that that aunt of yours that elena likes to tell a story or two she waited for my agreement before continuing so she claims she saw someone talking to jim tancredi a few weeks before the fire and then she came over to my room the night the place burned down telling me hed been there again she smiled in embarrassment you gotta understand the kind of life we lead any new face is excitement maybe you wouldnt of been interested but i was and that was when she saw i had my little granddaughter with me cerise and otis dropped her off you know and she gets real righteous about how no children can be in the building and shell talk to tancredi about it so i give her the price of a bottle and she goes off but i figure id better get our little princess over to maisie with an alkie like elena you cant trust her to keep her mouth shut just because she says she will when she looked at me defensively i grunted agreementknew that chapter and verse on elena too well to argue the point what did she say about the man shed seen black white young old she shook her head regretfully he was white im pretty sure of that even though she didnt say it in so many words but she said he had the most gorgeous eyes that was her expression and i cant see her using it about a black man that was really helpfulelena thought every man under eightyfive had the most gorgeous eyes still shed used it in my hearing the night of the fire vinnie the banker he came to chew me out and she told me not to upset a boy with such gorgeous eyes that memory brought the elusive face in the crowd at the prairie shores to the forefront of my mind vinnie vinnie who shouldnt have been within fifteen miles of the near south side id opened my eyes as the paramedics were carrying me through the crowd and seen him looking down at me it was a slide shown so briefly on my retina that i only now remembered opening my eyes for that brief flash i came slowly back to the room at first i thought id have to revise my agenda for the day and go racing off to see him but as the rushing in my head subsided and reason returned i remembered i didnt know which bank he worked for you okay zerlina asked anxiously im fine i think its just possible i may know who she was talking about although would elena have hidden the fact that shed seen vinnie before wouldnt it be more in keeping with her to issue sly hints there hadnt been time thoughwed been fighting about whether she could stay that could have driven vinnie from her mind and then that night she and cerise showed up together they started with a story about katterina but after they were in bed together elena suggested blackmailing vinnie as a better idea at that point of course she wouldnt say anything about him to me elenas disappeared again i said abruptly took off from her hospital bed saturday morning shed taken a pretty good blow to the head and shouldnt have been walking let alone running they didnt say nothing about her on tv just you on account of you being a detective and that youd rescued your aunt which i was pretty sure had to be elena i didnt come here today because of her but im sorry for her shes not an evil person you know nor cerise wasnt either just weak both of them she brooded over it in silence for a bit when it was clear there wasnt anything else she wanted to say i asked if i could give her a lift umunh i show up in some white girls car everyone on the streets going to be up telling maisie about it no ill just go back the way i came it doesnt matter taking three buses you knowi dont have anything else to do with my time these days the rush of excitement id felt over remembering seeing vinnie at the fire died away after zerlina left and with it much of my earlier euphoria it was hard to think about her life and that of elena and maintain a great flow of good cheer then too the more i considered vinnie as an arsonist the less sense it made maybe he was a pyromaniac sociopath but it seemed too incredible a coincidence that he would move in below me and then turn out to be torching my aunts building of course even sociopaths have to live someplace and he couldnt have known that my aunt lived in one of his target buildings and that might explain his being awake and irritable so soon after the fire my mind kept churning futilely finally i willed myself to turn it off i flipped quickly through the mail two checks goodie and a handful of getwell cards from corporate clients the obvious junk mail i pitched the bills could certainly wait but the incoming money would defray my expenses this afternoon i stopped at a cash machine to deposit the money and withdraw a couple of hundred armed with that i walked west on van buren hunting for a place that carried work clothes the systematic mowing down of the loop to make room for glitzy high rises has driven most of the lowrent business away van buren used to be jammed with army surplus outlets hardware shops and the like but only the peep shows and liquor stores have kept a tenacious hold on the area they would probably go last i had to walk the better part of a mile before i found what i was looking for i bought a hard hat and a heavy set of coveralls and work gloves at fiveeight im tall for a woman but i still fit easily into a mans small everything looked too new to convince anyone i was a seasoned construction worker back in my office i laid the coveralls on the floor and scooted across them in my desk chair several times now they looked new but covered with grease i keep a set of tools in my filing cabinet to work on the womens toilet which goes out an average of twice a month since tom czarnik would like to get rid of all women tenants not just me ive learned to do plumbing basics over the years i took out the wrench and pounded my hard hat a few times it still looked too new but i was able to add a few artistic dents and scratches to it it would have to do i pulled the coveralls on over my jeans moving the gun to one of the deep side pockets and added my small supply of office tools to the others useless on the ryan but i thought they gave me a touch of authenticity i emptied the contents of my handbag into various other pockets and shut off the office lights id left my hiking boots in the car i wouldnt put them on until i got to the ryanthey were too hard to drive in tucking the hard hat under my arm i took off again this time it was my office phone that i ignored as i locked the dead bolt the elevator which had been running with great difficulty when i got back with my work clothes had given out completely i squared my shoulders and headed for the stairs heat from the top i laced up my boots and hiked up the broken on ramp id slid across in my street shoes last week a good set of boots with treads made a big difference i moved at a good clip to the top in my hard hat and coveralls i fit in well enough that no one spared me a glance as i tramped along the shoulder i realized i shouldnt have worried about how new my clothes looked concrete dust soon enveloped them i pulled my sunglasses out of one of the front pockets to protect my eyes but i didnt have any way to keep the dust out of my lungs still my hacking cough gave me an added touch of authenticity the only thing i lacked was a bandanna at the throatin red or yellow it could be pulled up over the mouth when one was actually bent over an air hammer actually i was missing something elsea union card even if id wanted to risk recognition by the men in the trailer i couldnt go asking for the alma mejicana site without showing i belonged to the fraternity i kept trudging along looking for the bright red and green wunsch and grasso logo i was stronger than id been two days ago but the longer the hike became the less enthusiasm i felt for my project i realized too that the compleat construction worker ought to have strapped a water jar to her belt loops it was cooler today than it had been for a while but walking along in heavy overalls lugging my wrenches breathing the dust turned my face hot and my throat scratchy my shoulders sent up sympathetic warning shouts earplugs would have been a help toothe noise was staggering air hammers giant earth movers cement trucks bulldozerlike things with evillooking spikes attached to a front claw combined with the shouting of several thousand men to raise a discordant chorus few of the genuine workers wore earplugsits better to go deaf than display an unmanly weakness i was walking south along the west side of the road to my untutored eye this was the most complex part of the project since they were adding a whole new lane for traffic merging south from the eisenhower i scanned that part of the construction then strained to see around the traffic using the middle four lanes to make sure i didnt miss the wunsch and grasso logo on the northbound side i was almost at the i turnoff before i found their equipment mercifully on my side of the expressway i hoisted myself up onto the guardrail to wait for my second wind while i surveyed the territory the alma mejicana part of the operation involved about a halfdozen machines and perhaps twenty or thirty men their contingent wasnt pouring concrete instead as nearly as i could figure out they were readying the roadbed using giant rollers to mash rock into tiny pieces then coming along after with another machine to smooth it down the men not operating the machines were walking alongside them with picks and shovels correcting flaws at the edges several stood by surveying the work it was a busy industrious scene and despite the modern machinery one that harked to an earlier era none of the crew was black and as far as i could tell none of them was hispanic either most of their hard hats were decorated with the wunsch and grasso logo its one thing to borrow someones equipment but even a small firm ought to be able to spring for their own hard hats i hopped down from the fence and went up to one of the men surveying the work close to the rock crushers the noise was so intense that it took some effort to get the surveyors attention when he finally looked up at me i bawled in his ear luis schmidt here today who he bellowed back luis schmidt dont know him he turned back to the road signaling to one of the men i thought he was going to pass my inquiry on but instead he wanted to point out something that had to be done to the roadbed i tapped his arm he jerked around impatiently you still here is this the alma mejicana site he rolled his eyesdumb broad he pointed at the machine nearest him what do you think i think youre with alma mejicana and leasing equipment from wunsch and grasso he was beginning a scathing putdown when another one of the surveyors came over whats going on here he demanded silencing the first man with a commanding arm wave im looking for the alma mejicana crew i bawled i was told they were using wunsch and grasso equipment the second man dragged the first off to the side they had an animated conversation that i couldnt hear but it involved a lot of gesturingat the roadbed and at me finally the first man went on down the road another ten yards while the second came back to me rudys new on the site the crew are am men but the foremen and the equipment are all from grasso he didnt know that what do you need here he thrust his weatherbeaten face close to mine so i could hear him maybe i was being fanciful but behind the film of white dust his expression seemed cold almost menacing im looking for luis schmidt it was the only line i had so i stuck to it hes not on the site ill take a message for him i shook my head i dont mind waiting he wont be here today lady or tomorrow so if you have a message let me have it if you dont get off the site he looked at a couple of men with picks and jerked his head when they ambled over he said lady got on the site by mistake you want to see she gets off and stays off i held up my hands placatingly its okay big guyi can find my own way out anyway i got what i came for i trotted northward at a good clip the pick bearers trotted along next to me keeping up a line of small talk that i fortunately couldnt make out no one could possibly attack me right here on the dan ryan with two thousand men to witness it assuming my screams penetrated the sound of the machinery or they didnt think i was a scab and join in mauling what was left of my body about a half mile up the road when i thought i might throw up from exertion they decided theyd fulfilled their mission one of them poked me playfully in the side with his pick the other told me he guessed id learned my lesson but they could really make it stickha haif i came back i nodded without speaking and staggered clear of the roadbed to collapse on the slope rising up on its west side i lay there for half an hour sucking in great mouthfuls of chalky air they couldnt have known who i was if there was some red alert out on me they could easily have knocked me accidentally under one of the rock crushers but they must have some general cautionary warning against anyone prying around about alma mejicana what if id been with the feds would the second foreman still have behaved so precipitously massive bribetaking doesnt seem to have penetrated federal bureaucrats yet but maybe rozthrough bootshad some other source of protection for her cousins firm from where i was lying the sears tower dominated the near horizon the sun was low enough in the sky to turn its windows a fiery copper it was too late for me to go to the daley center to look for any background on farmworks inc i lay there watching the fire on the tower mute into soft oranges then darken finally i got to my feet and began the long trek back to my car my legs were a bit wobblytoo much exertion too soon i told myself sternly nothing to do with the surge of fear over the guys with the pickaxes day crews were starting to pack it in night shifts hadnt started yet there was a lull in the noise and a general relaxation in the work frenzy the machines were still moving doggedly but the ground crews were standing around laughing drinking longnecks that they somehow spirited onto the site it took over half an hour to move the mile to my car by then most of the other vehicles parked around it had left alone among the detritus under the giant stilts of the expressway i shivered when i got in the car i carefully locked the doors before starting it was after fivethirty i turned up halsted instead of joining the packed throngs on the expressway or the drive no one on the site knew who i was but i didnt take the hard hat off until i was north of congress when i got home i dumped the overalls and the hard hat in the hall closet and headed straight for the tub i longed for sleep but i still had several errands to run i tried to convince my wobbly legs and sore shoulders that a long bath would do them as much good as twelve hours of sleep more good it might have worked when i was twenty but when youre closer to forty than thirty there are some myths the body wont believe carbohydrate packing was my next great idea although there was no fruit or meat in the house i still had onions garlic and frozen pasta just the kind of dish my mother thought adequate for a saturday dinner while my father who could never bring himself to criticize her longed privately for chicken and dumplings i found a can of tomatoes in the back of my cupboard i couldnt remember buying this brand and studied the label dubiously trying to figure out if they were still any good i opened the can and sniffed how do you tell if something is full of botulism i shrugged and dumped them in with the onions it would be fairly entertaining if i escaped the ravages of mad killers only to die of food poisoning in my own kitchen if the tomatoes were poisoned they didnt affect me immediately in fact the bath and the dinner did make me feel betternot as good as if id had my sleep but good enough to go on for a bit i was even whistling a little under my breath when i went into the bedroom to change my only lightweight black dress has big silver buttons down the front with black stockings and pumps i looked more as though i were on my way to the theater than a funeral but i thought white stockings wouldnt be much of an improvement it would have to do while i was looking up the callahan funeral home the phone rang it was terry finchley from the violent climes unit miss warshawski ive been trying to reach you the last few days did you get my message i thought of all the ringing phones id let go lately and realized i hadnt checked in with my answering service for some time sorry detective whats up any new evidence linking me to the prairie shores or indiana arms fires i thought i heard him sigh dont make my life harder than it is vic okay okay terry i agreed meekly to what do i owe the pleasure of hearing from you iuhdiscussed our interview with the lieutenant you know the talk lieutenant montgomery and i yes i remember that particular conversation i had sat on the piano bench with the phone book in my lap but i stopped searching the callahans he the lieutenant lieutenant mallory i mean was uhquite astonished that montgomery would suggest such a thinglinking you with the arson you knowand he went and had a talk with him i just thought youd like to know that you probably wont be hearing from him again thank you i was pleased and surprised both at bobbys going to bat for me and at finchleys taking the time to phone me about it that took a little extra courage well check in with your service in the futuredont leave me sweating it out for three days see you saturday saturday oh right bobbys sixtieth birthday yet another item on my burgeoning todo lista present for him i rubbed my tired eyes and forced myself back to the phone book the callahan funeral home was on north harlem i dug around in the accumulated papers on the coffee table for my city map the address put it just north of the expressway there it should be a pretty easy run across town i was packing up my good handbag when the phone rang again i was going to let it go but it might be someone else whod been leaving messages for three days miss warshawski glad i caught you in mr macdonald i sat back down on the piano bench in astonishment what a surprise im sorry i havent sent you a note yet for the flowersim moving a little slowly with my convalescence thats not what i hear young ladyi hear you barely rose from your sickbed before you started prancing around town prying into business thats no concern of yours and what business is that old man i just cannot stand being called young lady i thought we had an agreement that youd leave roz fuentes alone i put the receiver in my lap and stared at it hard it could only be my invasion of alma mejicana that he was referring to but he couldnt know about thatmy only link to them was a scarf that could scarcely be traced to meno one had ever seen me wear it because i never did so it was my trip to the construction site but what was his connection with alma mejicana that hed know about that so fast are you there his voice came scratchily from my lap i put the receiver back to my face yeah im here but im not with you i dont know what ive done that you think is harassing roz and i dont know why youre so protective of her anyway he laughed a little come come young lamiss warshawski you cant go blundering all over the ryan without people hearing about it constructions a small communityword gets around fast roz is hurt that youre looking at her cousins business behind her back she mentioned it to bootshe asked me to take the time to give you a call so all this stuff is going on at bootss command you work for him or something ralph somehow i thought he and the whole county were in your back pocket all what stuff young lady he demanded sharply i waved a vague hand oh arson murder attempted murder that kind of thing boots saysgo git me a dead alkie and you say yessir chairman meagher and you find you someone to do it is that whats been going on around town lately that would be offensive if it werent so ludicrous boots and i go way back were involved in a lot of projects together over the years the press has decided on a prolonged smear campaign about our relationship and business methods that you apparently have bought into im disappointed in you vicyou seemed like a sharp young lady to me gosh thanks ralph and did you mastermind the fire that almost killed me last week was that how you and boots decided to respond to rozs hurt feelings his breath came in a little hiss in my ear for your information not that i owe you a damned thing the report in the star was the first i knew about that fire and id go on oath with that but if youve been treating other people around town the way youve been behaving toward roz it wouldnt surprise me that one of them tried to put you out that sounds strangely like a threat to me ralph youre sure youre absolutely positive that you didnt order that arson last week i said on oath he snapped but if i were you id watch my step young ladyyou were lucky to get out of that alive werent you no i wasnt old goat i yelled fear disguising itself as anger i was skilled so go tell roz or boots or whoever is yanking your chain that i rely on my wits not my luck and that im still trucking bulldozing would be a better word youngmiss warshawski you dont know what youre doing and youre liable to cause a major mess if you dont stop blundering around in the middle of things that dont concern you he spoke in a crisp nononsense tone that no doubt ended debate with subordinates is that supposed to make me snap a salute and shriek yessir mr m im going to the papers with what ive learned so far if i dont know what im doing theyve got the resources to look into it in a lot more detail i wasnt going to tell him id noticed a striking absence of any minority workers at the alma sitethey could ship in a few dozen before murray showed up with a photographer macdonald thought this one over for a few minutes it obviously hadnt been in the script when he called maybe we can change your mind on that one what would it take not money i can assure you or a new car despite the ominous noises the chevy was making but a complete story on alma and roz and what you all are so jumpy about could persuade me that youre rightthat i dont know what im doing there there was another long pause then macdonald said slowly we might be able to arrange that just dont go to the papers until weve talked again i ground my teeth ill give you a day ralph after that all bets are off i dont like threats any better than you do he gave a humorless chuckle and im not scampering around to meet your timetable youll wait until i have something to say and like it and if you think you can go off to your friends at the star or the tribune in righteous indignation just remember that both publishers are personal friends its time someone in this town had the guts to stand up to you and youre just the man to tame the wild mare ralph maybe its time someone taught you that playing monopoly on michigan avenue doesnt mean you own the world i slammed the receiver down hard enough to make my palm tingle daughters in mourning one good thing about macdonalds callgetting angry had given me an adrenaline rush i felt charged with energy as i drove up the street to belmont it was past eight now the september sky was completely dark and in the dark chilly i should have picked up a jacket on my way out but id been too annoyed to think properly should have brought my gun too although i didnt think vinnie would follow me around hoping to ambush me i made it to the funeral home by a quarter to the hour it was a small building with a discreet sign identifying it as a chapel a few cars still dotted the parking lot when i pulled in i jogged to the front entrance in my pumps in case they were going to shut down the viewing at nine sharp the door shut with a faint whoosh beyond a small vestibule with a place for coats and umbrellas lay a larger reception area paved in thick lilac pile dark paneled walls hung with a few pious prints created an atmosphere of heavy victorian mourning i found myself walking on tiptoe even though my shoes made no sound on the dense lilac no one came out to greet me but they couldnt have heard me come in a small square card behind a glass at the end of the reception room told me that the donnelly visitation was in chapel c a hall to the right led to a series of rooms i didnt check their labels but went to the door where light was showing a handful of women were sitting on folding chairs near the door talking but softly out of deference to the open coffin along the far wall they looked at me decided they didnt know me and went back to their conversation i recognized mrs donnellys daughters from the picture mr seligman had given me although i didnt know which was shannon and which star a man materialized from one of the corners are you here for the donnelly viewing miss he was short and his plump bald head made him look about fifty close up though i saw he must be younger than i i nodded and he took me over to look at rita donnelly they had put her in a twopiece dress white with a tasteful pattern of blues and greens on it and her face was as carefully made up as shed done it herself the times id spoken with her dressing the dead for burial from brassiere to panty hose robs them of dignity the makeup including shadow and eyeliner on her closed lids made it impossible for me to think of her as anything but a china doll on display i shook my head which the young man took as a sign of respect he led me back to the front of the room and asked me to sign the guest register at this point one of mrs donnellys daughters detached herself from the chatting group and came over to shake my hand did you know my mother she spoke softly but her voice had the unmistakable nasality of chicagos neighborhoods we were business acquaintances she talked a great deal about you and your sistershe was very proud of you of course i know barbara feldman oh uncle sauls daughter her blue eyes slightly protuberant like her mothers looked at me with greater interest she was too much older than us to play with when we were little we knew connie better her sister seeing us talking at some length got up to join us even with them standing side by side i couldnt tell which was the elderat thirty a year or two either way doesnt show the way it does when youre three i held out my hand im vi warshawski a business friend of your mothers she shook my hand without volunteering her name the boorish manners of the younger generation she knows uncle saul too star that solved the name problemid been talking to the elder shannon i know your mother hoped to get you involved in mr seligmans business do you think you might want to now that shesgone id started to say dead the real word but remembered in time that most people dont like to use it the two sisters exchanged glances that were part amused part conspiratorial uncle sauls been very good to us shannon said but his business is really too small these days mother only stayed on there out of affection for him there really wasnt even enough for her to do i wasnt sure what i was after but something had made mrs donnelly not want me to show pictures of her daughters to anyone connected with the indiana arms arson i couldnt ask them outright if they knew vinnie bottone or if they were involved with arson for hire i tried a delicate probe but she got you interested in real estate i understand are you a buyer shannon asked is that how you knew mother really more of a seller i said do you work for a firm that might be interested in buying i dont but star might star blinked her blue eyes rapidly i dont really work for a real estate firm shannon you know that its just a holding company farmworks inc i asked casually star stared openmouthed at me mother must have really liked you if she told you that but i dont remember ever hearing her mention your name word gets around i said vaguely was it through you that farmworks hooked up with seligman i dont think its respectful to discuss business here at mothers viewing star looked pointedly at mrs donnellys open casket you can come by the office if you want but i dont think we do anything that youd be interested in thanks very much i shook hands with both sisters im sorry about your mothers death call me if i can do something to help i turned around as i left the chapel hoping for signs of consternation but the two had rejoined their small circle of friends as i was wading through the lilac pile the bald young man caught up with me you didnt sign the register missthe family would appreciate knowing who was here i took the proffered pen in a spirit of malice i signed v bottone in a large dark hand the young man thanked me in a soft sober voice i left him standing under a print of a pietà it was ten by the time i got back to my own building the chevy behaved itself as long as i kept below fifty maybe nothing major was wrong it was kind of late for neighborly visits but the lights were still on in vinnies living room i ran up the stairs two at a time changing quickly into jeans before racing back down again on my way out i thought of my gun if vinnie really was a pyromaniac it might be a good idea not to talk to him unarmed i dashed back in stuck it in my waistband and took off again i was panting by the time i got to the bottom but fortunately it took vinnie several minutes to answer my knocking i was on my way to the lobby to ring his bell when i finally heard the lock turning back he was in sandals and jeans with a grateful dead tshirti hadnt known he could dress for comfort when he saw me his round smooth face puckered up in a frown i might have known it could only be you disturbing me this late in the evening if youre trying to sell some coke or crack or whatever you deal in im not interested im buying not selling i stuck my right leg between the jamb and the door in time to keep him from slamming it shut and youd better have something very good to give me or the next people here will be police detectives i dont know what youre talking about he said angrily from the living room behind him a man called out asking who was at the door if you dont want your friend to listen to our conversation you can come up to my place i offered but were going to keep talking until you explain why you were at the prairie shores hotel last wednesday he tried shoving the door against my leg i pushed back and slid into the vestibule he glared at me his brown eyes tiny specks of fury get out of my apartment before i call the cops he hissed at me a tail young man came out of the living room to stand behind vinnie topping him by a good four or five inches it was the same guy id seen getting out of the rx with vinnie a week or so ago im v i warshawski i said holding out my hand i live upstairs but i havent had a chance to get to know mr bottone very wellwe keep pretty different hours dont talk to her rick vinnie said she pushed her way in and i want her to leave shes the one wethe one who conducts her business in the stairwells at three in the morning rick looked at me interestedly oh shes the one we vinnie cut him off i dont know what shes doing butting in here but if she doesnt leave in ten seconds i want you to call the cops do that i urged with savage cordiality only make it the central district not the local station i want some of the guys who were at the prairie shores fire last week to come by and make an id your friend vinnie was there and i bet someone will recognize him youre making this up vinnie snapped i knew i was right thoughthe anger had gone out of his face and he was looking worried i pushed my advantage in fact i bet they could match his voice with the one on the tape calling the fire into youre lying he blurted they dont make tapes of those calls sure they do vinnie you gotta learn a few police procedures if you want a life of crime what did you do force elena to phone me then knock her out and wait for me in the dark you call my name when i didnt see her right off no dont lie to me vinniei can put you at that fire the police have got you on tape and elena recognized you shes run away again but she described you to a friend when she saw you hanging out at the indiana arms i dont know who this elena is he bellowed you know vinnie i think you ought to tell her what happened rick looked at me vinnie thinks youve been harassing him if you two are going to be neighbors the best thing you can do is clear the air between you whose side are you on anyway vinnie muttered but he didnt offer any resistance when his friend took his arm and gently propelled him back to the living room i followed his apartment was pretty much a copy of mine in terms of layout but his styleand budgetwere way out of my league the living room was done in textured contrasting whites the long wall backing onto the stairwell was covered by an abstract oil in different blues and greens that was the only color in the roomthe bookshelves and coffee table were a clear glass or acrylic or something i lowered myself carefully into one of the lowslung nubby armchairs hoping that my jeans wouldnt leave any telltale dirt streak behind vinnie sat as far from me as he could get in a matching chair near the front window while rick leaned against the wall near him so tell me what happened i invited when vinnie didnt show any inclination to answer rick spoke for him this was a week ago tomorrow night right we were asleep he broke off to look at me guardedly to see if i was going to scream and yell at this revelation when he saw i wasnt reacting he went on the dog was barking her head offthat woke us up the bedroom is next to the hall you know in my place it was on the outside and the kitchen was next to the hall but they were reversed on the first floor because of the way the back stairs came downi knew from all the times id been in mr contreras kitchen picking up the dog we got up and saw you leaving and vinnie said it was the last time youd wake him up in the middle of the night he said you did something illegal and had the cops paid off but he was going to track you down catch you in the act and go to the police with hard evidence that would make them arrest you he cocked his head on one side just out of curiosity what is it you do you dont look like a dealer or a hooker i couldnt help smiling im a private investigator but that doesnt have anything to do with why ive been waking him up actually its an aunt of mineshe got burned out of her home and came to me for latenight assistance a few times but vinnie reacted so violently i couldnt bring myself to confide in him so what did you do when you saw me leave we got in the mazda and followed you rick had a cool poise that made me wonder what he saw in vinnie still it wasnt the first illmatched couple id ever met i thought back to my cautious approach down indiana to the prairie shores i didnt think id been followed we waited on cermak rick explained neither of us was paying any attention to vinnie who sat hunched inside his dead tshirt if you were really meeting a drug dealer i didnt want to be caught in the middle and that was the eeriest street ive ever seen we drove up and down cermak a few times we saw you come down indiana and disappear behind that building the one that burned so we turned up the street and watched and after about twenty minutes we saw the place start up in flames and some guy running off that really freaked us but we thought wed better call is it true that they tape the calls i nodded abstractedly of course this could be a romance cooked up to appease me but it had the ring of truth to it vinnie looked too sulky for one thing and the bit about not wanting to leave cermak road sounded authentic could you describe the man you saw running away from the building rick shook his head it was dark and he was dressed in dark clothes i think he had a leather jacket on but i was too nervous to pay much attention im pretty sure he was white i think i saw the lamplight reflect off his cheekbones but im not sure if i really remember that then you stayed around to see if someone came to put out the fire he looked a little ashamed i know we should have rushed into the burning building to save you but we didnt know what youd been up towhether youd set the fire yourself maybe youd gotten out however you came in and the fire got going fast because of the accelerant i said absently but elena told mrstold someone that shed seen the man who torched the indiana arms and that he had the most gorgeous eyes and thats what she said when she saw vinnie the first night she woke him up so i thought maybe shed recognized him and had been blackmailing him my voice trailed off as rick began to laugh this is pure restoration vinnie come on lighten up you think shes running a crack house upstairs all the time shes tracking you down as a pyromaniac i want you two to shake hands and have a drink together vinnie didnt want to and i wasnt much in the humor for it either but rick went off to the kitchen and came back with a bottle of georges goulet it seemed churlish not to have a least one glass in the end rick and i drank that bottle and part of another one while vinnie stomped angrily off to bed treasure hunt i didnt have a clear memory of getting back to my own apartment ten hours later i wished i didnt have a clear sense of waking up either someone was running an artificial surf machine inside my head it swooshed and swirled when i tried standing even if i hadnt drunk the champagne i would have felt awfulmy hike around the ryan had stiffened up my legs my shoulders felt as though id spent the night on a circular saw with the better part of a bottle swelling my cytoplasm i wished i could spend the next twelve hours unconscious instead i staggered into the kitchen looking for orange juice the maid or wife or whoever looked after these things hadnt been to the store yet i thought about going out myself but the idea of being in direct sunlight made me feel so ill that i had to sit down when the spasm passed i went into the bathroom located the tylenol and took four extrastrength with a couple of glasses of cold water after a long soak in the tub with the water as hot as i could tolerate i shuffled back to bed when i woke up again it was past noon i didnt feel like running a mile but i thought i could manage getting dressed and going to the grocery when you feel really lousy puppy therapy is indicated i stopped at mr contrerass to pick up peppy you look terrible doll you doing okay he was wearing a red shirt so brilliant it hurt my eyes i feel like death but im going to get better i just want to borrow the dog for a while his faded brown eyes were bright with worry you sure you even oughta be dressed why dont you go back to bed and ill fix you something to eat you shouldnt of got out of the hospital so soon i dont know what dr lotty would say if she could see you i swayed slightly and caught hold of the doorjamb peppy came over to lick my hands shed say i got what was coming to me this is just cork fluit doesnt have anything to do with my injuries or at least not much cork flu he cocked his head to one side oh you been drinking too much dont do that doll its no way to solve your problems no of course it isnt who should know that better than you ill bring peppy back later i wobbled off with the dog while he was squawking righteously about how knocking back a few with the boys was not the same as me drowning my sorrows in whiskey i should know by now it was bad for my system peppy was totally uninterested in these fine points of ethics or the different morality prevailing for men who drink than for women she was staggered that we werent going running she kept looking up at me to see if i was watching her then looking very pointedly to the east to say we should be going that way when she saw it wasnt going to happen she took it like a lady waiting sedately outside the grocery on diversey and staying fairly close going home shed run a half a block ahead of me come back to see if i was still there tree a squirrel a few yards back then move ahead again back at my apartment she placed herself on the kitchen floor between the stove and table in my stupefied condition i kept stepping on her tail but she didnt movewhat if some food fellshe wanted to be able to get to it before i tripped on it thats what a guard dog is for i squeezed some orange juice and fried hamburgers for the two of us hers without rye or lettuce the hamburger raised my blood sugar to the point that i thought i might even manage to live another few days id intended to go back to the recorder of deeds office to look up farmworks if it wasnt a partnership id have to drive to springfield to see whether theyd been incorporated halfway through the second bottle last night though as rick described in hilarious detail the collapse of a set hed designed for the la brea tarpit wars id remembered the lexis system if you had a pal who subscribed to it you could find out who the officers of a closely held company were as long as it had filed to do business in illinois i wasnt up to taking the first step visiting the recorders office in the old county building but i went to the living room to call freeman carter hes my attorney not exactly a pal and he wouldnt get me the information for nothing but it still beat driving to springfield freeman expressed himself pleased at hearing from mehis secretary had brought in the news clips about my near death hed been waiting for me to feel better before seeing if i wanted to start a civil action against anyone you mean the way you have to do if the klan murders your kid i asked what is it you dosue for being deprived of your civil right to life something like that he laughed how are you feeling im coming along but i was too ambitious yesterday im not going out today i was wondering if youd do something for me maybe if it relates to my proper professional role in your life and if it is very clearly marked legal when have i ever asked you to do something illegal i demanded stung he responded more promptly than i really enjoyed there was the time you asked me to give you financial details on one of crawford meades other clients thats not only illegal but highly unethical then when you wanted me to get a restraining order against dick you could hardly stand it when i turned you down then ten or twelve months ago okay okay i interrupted hastily but those were all things i would have done myself if id been able to name something illegal i wouldnt do myself i dont have that much imagination and anyway you wouldnt give away confidential client records to anyone probably not even to me still want to ask me something just for some information out of lexis peppy giving up on the idea of more hamburger started exploring the room to see who had been there since her last visit you still dont have a computer christ vic when are you going to join the eighties soon i promised very soon as soon as i get four thousand dollars that isnt marked rent or mortgage or insurance or something also i need a new car the chevy has ninetyfive thousand miles on it and is starting to make horrible grinding noises at high speeds dont drive it so fast he advised unkindly what do you need off lexis just the officers of a corporation spell it out for me okayone word right works not capitalized one of the paralegals will call you back this afternoon or tomorrow morning drink some chicken soup and get a good sleep the sleep idea sounded inviting but first i checked in with my answering service to see how many people id kept hanging since saturday lotty had phoned once as had furey robin bessinger had called a couple of times maybe michael had some word on my aunt i tried both the station and his house and left a message on his machine after hanging up i went to the window to stare down at the chevy the real reason id been skipping my calls was my aunt her condition had been pretty marginal when she left the hospital every time the phone rang i was afraid it was someone with bad news about her if she did turn up alive shed probably need some nursing care maybe i could get peter to shell out for it but history didnt make me want to bet on it youd better not be blowing your transmission or anything really irreplaceable like that i warned the car cause its you and me babe for the foreseeable future at least i could call robin it might be that wed killed the personal side of our life together but i ought to be friendlyif i could only play the corporate politics right i could turn ajax into a major account robin was in a meeting with her usual bouncy good cheer the receptionist promised to give him my message i fiddled with the cord to the blinds what i really ought to do was call murray and talk to him about the lack of any hispanic or black workers at the alma work site even though theyd won part of the ryan contract because they were a minority contractor but macdonald had promised me more details about alma and roz and i thought i should give him another day before going public waiting wasnt my style though why was i being so patient now youre getting old vic i told my wavery reflection in the window people didnt used to scare you so easily was it his phone call last night or my being trapped in the prairie shores last week it had to be the phone call i didnt have any reason to connect him with my near death except of course for the note hed sent with his greenhouse behind me peppy was whimpering in frustration i pulled on the cord to the blinds impatiently then flicked them shut and looked to see whether she needed to go out she came over to me pawed my leg then went back to the sofa got down on her forepaws and whimpered again her tail waving gently whatcha got there girl i asked tennis ball i lay down on my stomach and peered underneath but couldnt see anything she refused to give up despite all my assurances that nothing was there she continued her impatient mewing once she got going on something like that she could easily keep it up for an hour i bowed to her superior concentration and hunted for my flashlight when i finally remembered dropping it with my other tools on the floor of the hall closet sunday night peppy was still trying to burrow her way under the couch i hoped she hadnt found a dead rat or worse yet a live one with some foreboding i got back down on my belly to peer underneath peppy was crowding me so closely i couldnt see anything at first but at least no red eyes stared back at me finally i saw light glinting off metal whatever it was lay out of the reach of my arm naturally youve seen something that involves moving the couch i grumbled to the dog when i pulled it away from the wall she danced hurriedly around to the back tail wagging vigorously she raced in front of me when the object came into view sniffed at it picked it up and laid it at my feet thank you i praised her rubbing her head i hope you think it was worth all that effort it was a gold link bracelet a heavy piece big enough to be a mans i pushed the couch back against the wall and sat down to examine the trophy two amethysts were set among the links i turned them over but the backs of the stones hadnt been inscribed i tossed it from one hand to the other it looked vaguely familiar but i couldnt think of any recent male guests who might have lost it what men had visited me lately robin had come over on saturday but he hadnt gone near the couch terry finchley and roland montgomery had sat there when they came to accuse me of torching the prairie shores hotel on saturday but it was hard to imagine how they could have dropped it so it fell underneath it would be so much more likely for something someone dropped to land in the cushions if one of them had lost it still it wouldnt hurt to ask finchley the only way i could really see it getting down underneath like that was if someone had been sleeping on the sofa bedwhen it was pulled out there was a gap between the end of the springs and the floor guests of mine had occasionally forgotten a watch or a ring that theyd absently laid on the floor after going to sleep cerise and elena had been my only recent overnight guests i thought id know if elena had been carting around such a valuable knickknack but maybe not she could have stolen it after all hoping to trade it for liquor maybe it had belonged to cerises boyfriend and she wore it the way girls did when they went steady in my high school maybe i should drive down to lawndale and show it to zerlina since it was much likelier that cerise had owned it than terry finchley but would zerlina know and if maisie was standing militantly in front of her would she even say i was feeling better but not well enough to deal with maisie anyway the bracelet was scarcely the most urgent item on the agenda i stuffed it in my jeans pocket and looked down at peppys expectant face youve been treated badly the last few days by the people who ought to be worshiping you youd like to go to the lake wouldnt you she thumped her tail happily hunting for rabbits i walked along the beach peppy dancing around me dropping sticks for me to throw it was almost october the water had grown too cool for me but she could swim happily for another month if we didnt get any heavy storms i ambled along to the rocky promontory jutting east into the water when i sat to stare at the water peppy jumped down the rocks to explore for rabbits it was a pretty steep drop but she occasional found them burrowing in the boulders along the shore the water had a flat silvery sheen a flinty shade that you dont see in summer you can tell the seasons by the color of the lake even if nothing else in the landscape changes when its calm the water seems infinitely enticing offering to hold you to caress you until you sleep as though there were no cold depths no sudden furies that could dash you helpless against the rocks it was helplessness i feared a life like elenas bobbing along without any channel markers to guide it or my own the last few days nibbling circumspectly at the edge of the dam but not daring to dive clean in letting myself wait on ralph macdonald for instance i didnt even know if it was out of fear of him fear of his veiled threats id been doing so maybe i was just too worn by my aunts recent escapades to have energy left for taking charge of my own affairs it was an egosalvaging theory at any rate i should overcome my repugnance and pay some attention to elenas problems though it wasnt fair to her or to furey to just hand her affairs over to him at least i could hunt out zerlina to ask again if she knew anyone who would shelter elena my shoulders drooped at the prospect i could stop by the central district to see if finchley recognized the braceletand to check on whether furey had turned up anything on elena if he hadnt id organize my own search in the morning maybe call in the streeter brothers to help out and i could go see rozit was time i went on the offensive with ralph macdonald whether he was connected personally with the fire or not he had something on his mind id stood passively by far too long i stood up abruptly and called to the dog peppy gained the top in three easy jumps and danced around eagerly when she saw we were getting in the car instead of returning to the beach her tail sagged between her legs and she slowed to a painful crawl the chevy was crawling pretty painfully too id put in more transmission fluid checked the oil looked with a semblance of intelligence at the plugs and the alternator tomorrow id have to make the time to bring it to a garage and make the money for paying a mechanic and hiring a rental car in the interim keep moving i ordered the engine the top speed it allowed me this afternoon was thirtyfive i had to stick to side streets irritating the traffic behind me by keeping below twenty it took over a half an hour to get to the central district im stopping here first because finchley will be gone later i explained to peppy in case she was accusing me of cowardice im still planning on finding roz i went in through the entrance to police headquarters on state street if i used the station door around the corner id have to explain my business to the watch commander of course theres a guard at state street but he didnt take as much persuading as a desk sergeant would especially since he recognized my last name hed known my dad years ago and chatted with me about him for a bit i was just a rookie then but tony took an interest in the young men on the force ive always remembered that and try to do the same for the new guys coming up and gals of course oh well you want to go up to the lieutenant not stand around reminiscing you know where his office is dont you yes ive been there hundreds of times you dont need to call up bobbys unit shared quarters on the third floor at the south end of the building the detectives had desks jammed behind waisthigh room dividers lining the fringe of the room while the uniformed officers shared desks in an open space up front bobby held the reins of command in a miniscule office in the southeast corner terry finchley was finishing a report banging on a typewriter almost as ancient as my own mary louise neely a uniformed officer who worked with the unit was sitting on the edge of his desk talking while he typed the typewriter was so noisy they didnt hear me come in most of the desks were empty the shift changes at four so roll call and assignments had long been disposed of five is a slow time in the crime world the cops take it easy then too getting dinner or waiting for witnesses to come home from work or whatever else you do when you have a little breather on the job the door to bobbys office was shut i hoped that meant hed gone home i went over to finchleys cubicle interrupting officer neely as she was describing the interior of an xjs shed chased down last night i didnt know if it was the black leather seats or the three kilos of coke shed found underneath them that impressed her more usually ramrod stiff she was gesturing and laughing a tinge of color in her pale face hi guys i said sorry to butt in finchley stopped his onehanded banging on the machine hi vic you looking for mickey hes not in right now officer neely retreated behind her colorless facade murmuring something about putting it in writing she marched stiffly off to the desks in front only partlyto see if hed turned up anything on my aunt shes been missing four days now you know i found something at my place this afternoon and stopped by to see if you might have dropped it i didnt know your aunt was missing the lieutenant must have given mickey the assignment on the side finchley gestured hospitably to the metal chair by his desk take a pew want some coffee i shuddered my stomach isnt strong enough for the stuff you guys drink i sat down i never saw officer neely look so human i kind of wish i hadnt interrupted the police woman was sitting at a typewriter clattering away with flawless precision her back straight enough to satisfy a west point inspection shes the first female in the unit finchley explained you know how that goes ms w maybe shes afraid you see her acting natural youll squeal to the lieutenant me i was outraged finchley grinned okay maybe shes afraid if she acts friendly around you the lieutenant will think youve corrupted her you like that better much i said emphatically i pulled the bracelet from my pocket and showed it to finchley i found it under my couch i explained you and montgomery are the only men whove been sitting there lately i wondered if youd dropped it finchley looked at it briefly aint mine thats pimp jewelryi hate that kind of stuff and give monty his due its not exactly his style either he scanned my face ill ask him for you if you like i hesitated i hated to admit i couldnt stomach facing the arson lieutenant on the other hand how many difficult confrontations did i need to prove i wasnt a chicken i accepted ruefully finchley was sliding the chain through his fingers you know this really looks more like he bit himself off ill ask around can you just do it with a description the other person it might have belonged to is the dead girlthe young woman whose family you helped me locate last week i want to take it down to show her mother in the morning conscientious little thing arent you you ever think of hiring someone to do some of your legwork for you every day i gestured toward officer neelys stiff back maybe i should talk to her the pay isnt that great but itd make a change from typing reports on cokeheads hey if you dont have to type reports start with me finchley protested he made a careful note of the number of amethysts in the chain and handed it back to me ill ask monty andand give you a call tomorrow if i can his phone started ringing take it easy vic thanks terry can i use a phone before i leave he picked up his own receiver and gestured to the desk behind him i went around the divider and called my answering service lucy mott had phoned from my lawyers office with in formation on farmworks inc she hadnt left details with the answering service lotty had called so had robin i tried my lawyer first lucy mott was gone for the day but freeman carter was still there in conference with a client the man answering the phone offered to take a message but when i explained i was at police headquarters and couldnt ask for a callback he went to get carter freeman thought id been arrested of course and wasnt too thrilled to learn i was just borrowing a phone its that kind of tactic that burns your name around town vi he grumbled but since youve taken me out of my meeting ill show you how much better my manners are than yours and dig the stuff out now instead of making you wait i know youve got better manners than me freeman thats why i always stand quiet and serious at your side when i have to go before a judge he left me dangling for five minutes or so a few more detectives wandered in people i didnt know who stopped to talk to finchley and eye me curiously just as freeman got back on the line sergeant mcgonnigal walked in when he saw me his eyebrows shot up in surprise he didnt wave or detour to see me but kept on his way to mallorys door where he knocked and stuck his head inside i turned my attention to freeman farmworks inc was an amazing companyit existed without officers the only name associated with it on the lexis system was the registered agent august cray at a loop address freeman hung up on my thanks i sat with the receiver in my hand until the police operator came on asking if i needed assistance i hung up abstractedly i knew that name id heard it fairly recently i just couldnt place it it was too late to go traipsing over to the lasalle street address freeman had given me anyway i was too tired tonight to undertake many more errands and i kind of wanted to go see roz id get over to the north loop in the morning when i saw cray id probably remember why i knew his name can i help you find something vic thats my desk youre burrowing in mcgonnigals voice at my elbow made me jump he was trying for a light note but his voice held a brittle undercurrent i held up a hand pax sergeant i wasnt delving into your deepest secrets i came by on a errand and detective finchley told me i could use this phone cant we go back to being friends or at least nonenemies whatever it was we used to be he ignored the bulk of my comment and asked what kind of errand i had i rolled my eyes in disgust but pulled the bracelet out of my pocket and went through my saga mcgonnigal picked it up then flung it to the desk we can go back to being friends or at least nonenemies when you stop playing little games warshawski now get lost ive got work to do i stood up slowly and looked at him stonily im not playing games mcgonnigal but you sure are you little boys give me a call if you ever decide to let me in on the rules officer neely had stopped typing to watch us you get tired of the boy scouts come see me i said as i passed her maybe we can work something out she flushed to the roots of her fine sandy hair and resumed typing at a furious rate running into a campaign when i got into the chevy peppy looked at me expectantly id forgotten i had her it wasnt fair to make her sit while i tried to track down roz but i was afraid if i took her home i wouldnt be able to goad myself back into action sorry girl i said turning on the ignition terry and john both know who owns that bracelet wouldnt you say so why wont they tell me peppy looked at me anxiouslyshe didnt know either a small procession of cars was moving north up state street i waited for them to pass so i could make a u the tail of the procession was michaels silver corvette i tried honking and waving but he either didnt see me in the fading light or chose to act as though he hadnt i could try to catch up with him to ask him about elena but i didnt feel like running into mcgonnigal again tonight i drove north to congress the potholes and derelict buildings gradually melted into the convention hotels fringing the south rim of the loop after i turned west on the congress and speeded up the chevy gave an ominous whine my stomach jolted again not at thirty i lectured the car you gotta get me around town a few more years a few more days anyway the car paid no heed to me but increased its nervewrenching noise as i took it up to forty when i brought it back down to twentyfive the engine quieted some but i really couldnt drive it on the ryan i left the congress at halsted and plodded my way north and west to logan square roz fuentess campaign headquarters were in her old community organization offices on california avenue the front window held flags of mexico the us and puerto rico with the mexicans on the left and the us in the middle underneath the mexican flag hung a huge portrait of roz beaming her twohundredwatt smile with the slogan in spanish and english roz fuentes for chicago not original but serviceable the office was still brightly lighted we were five weeks from election and people would be working into the dawn at different headquarters all over the county on top of that roz was still functioning as a conduit for community problems with the city on housing and crime according to the papers that was a thorn for the aldermana gent of the old macho schoolbut roz was too popular in the neighborhood for him to try going headtohead with her beyond the plateglass window people were working with the noisy camaraderie a successful campaign brings in its wake a dozen or so men and women sat at desks in the big front room talking answering the wildly ringing phones shouting questions at each other in spanish or english no one paid any attention to me so i wandered past the campaign workers to the back where roz used to have a small private office another small knot of people was sitting in there now a nice landscape of rozs multiracial appeal a white man of about thirty and two hispanic womenone plump and fiftyish the other not long out of high schoolwere deep in conversation with a wiry black woman in hornrims i didnt recognize the white man but i knew the woman in the hornrimsit was velma riter the four of them fell silent when i came in velma who was seated behind the beatenup desk in rozs swivel chair looked up at me fiercely to call her expression hostile was about as descriptive as calling niagara falls wet it didnt begin to convey the intensity she was putting out after a puzzled glance from velma to me the fiftyish woman asked can we help you miss she wasnt unfriendly just briskthey were conducting business and needed to get back to it im v i warshawski i said i was hoping to find roz the plump woman held out a palm toward the high school grad without speaking the young woman handed over her typed sheet of paper she scanned it and said right now shes finishing a community meeting on gangs in pilsen after that shes going to schaumburg for a fundraising dinner if you tell me what you need i can help youim her chief assistant youre not content with trying to stab roz in the backyoure coming in here to put poison in her coffee is that it vic velma spoke up venomously the young woman looked flustered at velmas open anger she stood up hurriedly and picked up a stack of papers murmuring something about getting them typed before she went home she excused herself are these people so close to you that you want me to talk in front of them i asked velma they know youve been trying to smear roz i leaned against the door my shoulders too tired to keep me upright without a prop have you seen some kind of smear story in the papers or on tv that you can trace to me people are talking velma held herself rigidly everyone on the street knows you want to stab her in the back that wouldnt be because you told them that would it velma i couldnt bear to look at her angry face i turned my gaze to a peeling poster on the wall showcasing a quote from simón bolívar that proclaimed liberty for all peoples why dont you tell us why youve come ms warshawski were all close to roz we dont have any secrets from each other rozs chief assistant said i moved uninvited onto the metal folding chair the young woman had vacated maybe first you can tell me your names im camellia maldonado and this is loren richter hes managing the finances for rozs campaign richter flashed a perfect ipana smile and i can assure you theres nothing amiss with them splendid i put my arms on the desk and propped my chin on my hands im really exhausted if velmas told you all about me you know i almost died in a fire in an abandoned hotel last week im still not quite over it so im not going to make any effort to be subtle two weeks ago at a fundraiser out at bootss place roz made a special point of taking me to one side and asking me not to sandbag her campaign since that was the farthest thing from my mind i was irked to say the least and it made me think she must be hiding some secret if it was secret then it was none of your business warshawski velma interjected i sat up at that she made it my business sheor anyway marissa duncangot me to put my name to a public roster announcing my support and i backed it up with more money than i gave to all other political candidates this year if roz was pulling off something illegal or unethical behind my name i damned well did have a right to know about it i was panting by the time i finished i took a minute to calm myself and focus my thoughts camellia and loren were sitting stiffly willing to hear me out but ready to slam the door on me as soon as id finished when i started asking questions a long list of people began telling me i was a pain in the ass and to mind my own business the first of course was velma here followed by roz and then interestingly enough ralph macdonald the big guy himselfbootss pal you knowwarned me off a little more subtly than velma and roz but a warning nonetheless and after the fire he warned me again this time not nearly as subtly ralphs name took them all by surprise if boots had told roz he was siccing macdonald on me shed kept it to herself well when i was at rozs fundraiser she had her cousin with herluis schmidtand carl martinez his partner in alma mejicana and it seemed to me that it was they who pointed me out to her suggesting i was up to no good i stopped something in that picture the scene of wunsch and grasso huddled with furey and the two men from alma mejicana was tugging at my brain if i wasnt so tired if velma wasnt so hostile id get it it was because hed been talking to wunsch and grasso that schmidt warned roz they were all connected wunsch and grasso alma farmworks and farmworks was connected to seligman through rita donnellys daughter star did that mean that wunsch and grasso were connected to the arson my brain spun around were waiting vic velmas cold voice interrupted my flurried thoughts or are you trying to embellish your story to make it more credible i gave her a bitter smile ill wrap it up fast and believe it or not as you please but worse is going to follow soon alma mejicana was on the fringes of the construction business up until two years ago they had a couple of suits against the county claiming discrimination in the matter of bids but they were strictly small potatoesparking lots a few sidewalks that kind of thing they really werent big enough for the projects they were bidding on run the cameras forward suddenly theyve dropped their suits and by a remarkable coincidence they pick up a piece of the dan ryan action youve got to be a heavy roller to play at that table where did they come up with the equipment and the expertise now roz is a partner in alma mejicana im just guessing this part i ignored an explosive interruption from velma i dont know whether she went to boots or he came to her but his support has eroded badly in the hispanic wards theyve been backing solomon hayes to oust meagher as board chairman as long as theyre going with hayes and the blacks have a different candidate meagher can scrape by but lately its been sounding like the old washington coalition is perking up again and if the hispanics got together with the black coalitions and united on a black candidate boots could kiss his forty years of power and patronage goodbye velma was muttering to my right but camellia maldonado sat with a look of glassy composure much as an edwardian lady might have watched a drunk in her living room loren richter was tapping his pencil rapidly against the chair leg thats not news its not even a crime of course not i agreed coalitions changing loyalties thats the name of the game but boots isnt ready to turn in his chips yet so say he went to roz if he put her on the ticket shed bring in humboldt park and pilsen for himshes gold here in return hed see that alma got a big piece of county action they drop their discrimination suits tie in with a dummy corporation the work will really go to wunsch and grasso who will share out the profits and everybodys happy alma doesnt do a lick of work on the ryanive been there and seen it they got the bid they pay everything out to a dummy corporation and let wunsch and grasso supply the equipment and the personnel you dont have any proof of this none at all its a total fabrication camellia maldonado said hotly whatever velma said of you youre ten times worse i got up im not going to stay to fight it im beat i just wanted to give roz a chance to answer before i go to the papers theres one more thing i dont understand though one velma spat out just one i thought you understood the whole universe warshawski i ignored her i dont know why roz thought a story like this would hurt her chances on the ticket its just business as usual in this old town when the story finally breaks the good old boys will breathe a collective sigh that shes not a flaming radical that shes one of them after all i turned on my heel not listening to the three of them shouting at me camellia ran to the door on pencilheels and grabbed my arm you must tell us what proof you have of this terrible allegation you cant come in here and drop such a bomb and then just walk off i rubbed my eyes tiredly its all there you just have to go to the ryan and look at their part of the zone although maybe now they know ive been there theyll bring in a few minority or women workers for the photographers but the real kicker is to visit their offices theyre a sham therere only three desks occupied in the whole place you dont run a big business out of a cubbyhole at least not a contracting business camellia looked at me with such anger that it made my knees feel wobbly ive worked for rozs success for a long time she hissed youre not going to be able to ruin her with your lies great i said then you dont have anything to worry about i glanced back at velma sitting in the swivel chair she didnt say anything but dropped her gaze to the desktop camellia followed me to the big front room she was too savvy a campaigner to let the hired hands see a crisis was in the works she shook hands formally with me at the door gave me a big smile and said shed be sure to let roz know wed spoken death rattle when i got back to the chevy i was exhausted past the point of feeling or thinking in some recess of my mind i knew i needed to see august cray to try to understand the connection that apparently lay between farmworks and seligman even if it hadnt been too late to visit his loop address i couldnt have gonei just didnt have the stamina left to talk to anyone else today all i wanted was to get home to a bath and my bed peppy curled in the front seat gave me a look of disgust when i got in she didnt deign to lift her head after three hours in the car she didnt think i was good for much sorry girl i apologized well go home now general motors willing the chevy was grinding horribly even at twentyfive i forced it forward like a knight with a battleshy horse it went about as happily with the car whining and screaming i couldnt follow the frantic line of thought id started at rozs any further aside from the noise i was too nervous that the car might stop altogether to be able to think about anything else when i turned onto racine it went on me going from a brainshattering whine to a lurching rattle to a final dead silence i turned the ignition key the engine ground horribly but wouldnt catch behind me cars were honking furiouslyits well known that the best cure for a stalled engine is for a hundred thousand drivers to blow their horns in unison i was less than three blocks from home if i could push the chevy to the curb i could leave it there for a tow truck and walk home with peppy peppy had other ideas when i opened the door she bounded across the set divider and outside so fast i was just able to grab a hind leg before she hurled herself in front of a delivery van i wrestled her to the ground and dragged her back into the front seat you gotta wait five more minutes i told her she wasnt buying it usually the most docile of dogs she snarled at me now and i had to wrap her leash around the seat divider to keep her in the car she stood on the passenger seat barking at me furiously my legs had cramped up from tensing them so hard while i drove when i stood up i almost fell over i steadied myself against the car door neither of us is in good shape are we i murmured to the chevy i promise i wont sell you for scrap if youll do the same for me cars were moving around me now that they saw i was stalled but the ones farther back kept up their honking i was too tired to react to the insistent blare with one hand on the steering wheel and the other on the doorframe i tried pushing the car to the curb too much strain in the last few days had left my shoulders so weak that i couldnt urge the extra force into them to muscle the car forward i leaned my forehead against the roof someone across the street was adding to the cacophony on racine i ignored him along with the rest until finally over the din of the traffic i heard my name vic vic you need some help it was rick york vinnies friend at the wheel of a vw i darted across the traffic to explain my plight to him vinnie was sitting in the passenger seat with his head pointedly turned awayhe clearly didnt think rick should have tried so hard to get my attention do you think you could push me up the street if i can get it back to our place i can leave it for a tow in the morning sure just let me turn around rick said in the same breath that vinnie announced they were going to be late if they waited around any longer aw dont be a turdhead vinnie thisll take us five minutes i sprinted back to the chevy feeling refreshed just by an offer of help and waited for rick to come up behind me peppy didnt like this new development at all she left off barking to leap into the backseat and whimper then plunged back into the front seat i undid her collar to keep her from choking but she jumped around so much that i had a hard time keeping an eye on traffic at the intersections i coasted into an empty patch across from my building rick honked twice and took off without waiting for my thanks in the morning id find out where he lived and order a bottle of champagne for him his kindness took the edge off my fatigue enough so that i was able to give peppy her due and walk her over to the inner harbor and back when i finally returned her to mr contreras it was past eight he was beside himself let alone i dont know if youre alive or dead i dont even know where youve gone to come bail you out and dont tell me you dont need my help where would you of been last year if i hadnt known where to come hunting for you even if you dont want me you might spare a little thought for the princess here and then people come calling on you what am i supposed to tell them i ignored the bulk of his diatribe just say im a secretive bitch who doesnt give you a printout of my agenda every day who came calling couple of guys they didnt leave their namesjust said theyd be back later his disclaimers to the contrary my neighbor could identify any man whod come to visit me in the past three years if he didnt know these guys they were strangers probably jehovahs witnesses howd you come to let them in they ring your bell yeah they said they got the floor wrong and the side of the building i asked affably did they leave or are they still upstairs his tirade changed rapidly to remorse my god doll no wonder you dont want to trust me with any of your secrets here i am falling for the oldest game in the world they left but what if someone else let them back in that vinnie guy across the hall or miss gabrielsen upstairs berit gabrielsen who lived across the hall from me was still at the cottage in northern michigan where she spent her summers mr contreras refused to listen to this idea but insisted on bustling me into his living room while he went up with the dog to check out my apartment he wanted my keys but i resisted youll be able to tell if the locks have been tampered with theyre more likely waiting outside the door if theyre there at all and if they are i dont want you waltzing into their armsi dont have the energy to carry you to the hospital besides my car is broken he was too agitated to pay any attention to me if id thought there was really any danger i would have gone with him but if my visitors had been sent by ralph macdonald they wouldnt come back when they knew theyd be idd i let mr contreras usher me into his badly sprung mustard armchair i leaned back in the soft musty cushions my mind drifting on the verge of sleep my neighbors living room wasnt that different from saul seligmansthe same soft overstuffed furniture the same relics of their dead wives filling every available inch and except for seligmans fire irons the relics were also remarkably similar down to the studio photos of their weddings i felt a tender kind of pity for the two of them each struggling in his own way to maintain the intimacy their wives deaths had stripped them of seligman had accused me of being like everyone else wanting him to sell his heart for a dollar but i i sat up in the mustard chair but i hadnt been paying proper attention to him that was my problem someone had been trying to get him to sell the building i hadnt heard that id just been letting his plaints flow over me mrs donnelly knew though because it was farmworks that wanted to buy it her daughter worked there to help boost her career shed let them know the building might be for sale or shed given them access to mr seligman at any rate something about the sale or at least about the fire had brought that little smirk to her face because it reminded her of some special benefit to her daughter star but when she went to the man woman she knew at farmworks worried because i had a picture of star he she had killed mrs donnelly and torn up the place to find any documents relating to their sale offer i got up and started pacing around the room knocking my shins into a shrouded birdcage swearing briefly i ran into the curio case mr contreras kept in the middle of the room under an old bedspread saul seligman didnt have anything to do with the property management company anymore he told people he went in most afternoons but he didnt really leave his home to do much of anything id never seen him with shoes on only his worn bedroom slippers still he hadnt given mrs donnelly a powder of attorney or anything she would have needed his agreement to sell whoever killed her had left him alone because everyone knew he wouldnt be able to make the necessary connections he didnt have any documentsthose had all gone to rita donnelly she might even have portrayed him as mentally incompetent to her principals but why had they wanted the indiana arms what was it about that building that someone cared so much about i was just a derelict property in the decayed triangle between mccormick plance and the ryan of course that was where macdonald and meagher wanted to put their stadium if they got the bid the value of any property there would skyrocket i came to a stop in front of the birdcage before i could bang into it again i couldnt believe it i couldnt believe i could have been so dense for so long old macdonald had a farm of course he had damned near every other piece of land in chicago why not a farm too hed have a little holding company that could do deals on the side without drawing the public scrutiny that macdonald development inevitably attracted and why not call it farmworks just the name for someone with a macabre sense of humor and if the indiana arms was the last or one of the last bits of property standing in the way of his development then just burn that sucker down wunsch and grasso they did a lot of business for the county ernies daddy had grown up in norwood park alongside boots and the two of them had just naturally kept in touch ernie and ron had started out doing favors for the demsin chicago that could mean anything from hustling votes to breaking legs of tavern owners who didnt pay off the right people so when they took over ernies daddys business it expanded along with bootss career so if boots and his pal ralph wanted them to supply alma mejicana with trucks and compressors and manpower for the ryan project theyd be happy to help out whats wrong with you doll mr contrerass severe voice behind me made me jump you know i aint had a bird in there in ten years i only keep it because clara loved canaries you thinking of getting a bird dont you may not think they need a lot of looking after like the princess here but you cant be gone all the time and have any kind of animal i wasnt planning on a canary i said meekly anybody upstairs we went up outside your kitchen besides going up inside here in case you wondered what kept us nobody there seemed to me someone might have been trying to get past those locks of yours but they held okay maybe you should spend the night down here though im not going to be real happy wondering whats happening to you ill be fine upstairs i assured him they know you saw them they wont come back even if they could field a different crew theyd be too worried that the cops would trace them through you ill lock all the bolts and tie a rope across the upstairs landing okay he didnt like it and went on at some length to explain why i couldnt tell if he was genuinely worried or if he just wanted a bigger role in my affairs whichever it was i preferred the possibility of a breakin to spending a night on his sagging couch under the empty birdcage im sleeping in here then cookie the princessll bark if anyone comes in and well be upstairs in a wink i wondered briefly if theyd have a jolly confrontation with rick and vinnie in the middle of the night it might be worth getting out of bed for i thanked him gravely for his concern and made good my escape scared out of house and home i turned on the bath when i got into my own place but my mind was racing too hard for me to relax i got out of the tub and tried murray he wasnt in either at the news office or his home i thought about calling bobby but i could just imagine his reaction accusations against the chairman of the county board and his wealthy sidekick much worse than stirring up the officers of his regiment just not done vic old thingif you had a touch of class youd understand i went to look out the window despite my brave words to mr contreras i felt lonely and vulnerable by myself i wondered if the two men whod come calling had indeed meant to waylay me or if they were in fact a harmless duo of salesmen were they the answer ralph macdonald had promised to give me within twentyfour hours was that man idling across the street really waiting on his dog or waiting for me to come out i dropped the blind and went back to the phone to call lotty vic ive started to become quite worried not hearing from you for so many days how are you im not sure ive got a tiger by the tail and i dont think im quite strong enough to wrassle with it what kind of tiger lotty asked i told her where my thinking had been leading me im just a little scared lotty and i keep worrying about my aunt i think she must have seen whoever they hired to set the fire she probably tried a little genteel blackmail she and cerise between them and now shes hiding out someplace not very safe i dont know how to find her the cops are helping at least a cop is helping i amended remembering that finchley hadnt even known elenad skipped again and now my car is dead so i cant my thought died and my voice with it a cop knew elena had done a bunk because hed gone to michael reese specifically to see her just as hed gotten me to reveal her address two weeks ago so he could go see her then the police didnt give two hoots if an aging drunk on her uppers tried to pick up young men in uptown michael did mcgonnigals reaction to that gold bracelet came tumbling through my head and i saw it laid out for me in such complete detail that i thought my whole insides would come up through my mouth i remembered now where id seen it before the time hed worn it last february when id gone to a birthday party the pals had put on for him mcgonnigal thought id brought the bracelet around to flaunt my longcooled affair with micheal thats why he hadnt told me it was fureys only furey hadnt left it at my apartment elena and cerise had the night they slept there theyd laid it on the floor under the mattress the way people do and in the morning when cerise was so sick theyd forgotten it vicwhats gone wrong you havent fainted have you lotty spoke sharply i realized i was standing like an idiot with the mouthpiece in my hand no no i just suddenly am seeing something that ought to have hit me long ago what you need most right now is a hot meal and a nights sleep why dont i come for youyou can have some soup and sleep in my guest room then tomorrow youll have the strength to think of an advanced design in tiger traps it was so enticing an offer i couldnt turn it down even as my mind was churning over michael i pulled my jeans on again and flung a few things into my backpack including an extra clip for the smith wesson the night elena brought cerise to my apartment was the night of bootss barbecue michael had driven back to my place and was waiting for me there when i pulled up hed had a police emergency and couldnt stay that was what hed said a triple homicide i could check that sometime if i lived past tonight but i doubted it had ever occurred nohed gone into the lobby and found elena and cerise sitting there on elenas duffel bag theyd come with their tale of cerises baby hoping they could use me to screw a little money from the insurance company then theyd seen michael put some heat on him theyd seen him hanging around the indiana arms before the fire had to be he had the connection to roland montgomery hed be the one the pals would turn to when they wanted a building torched why the pals were involved i couldnt say except that they did favors for boots in exchange for contracts and michael did favors for the pals because they were all good old boys from the neighborhood so elena recognized him when he came into the lobby after bootss party she told him she loved boys with gorgeous eyes and she wouldnt tell anyone shed recognized him if hed just help her out give her a little something so she could buy a drink he gave them the bracelet that was the payoff but the next day he hunted out cerise and took her to the rapelec site got her shot full of heroin left her to die no that wasnt quite it hed gotten the heroin to someone maybe to the pals or to their night manager august cray the registered agent for farmworks was also the night manager at the rapelec site anyway michael thought he could get the bracelet back but cerise didnt have it that was why bobbys unit was there so fast once the night watchman had spotted herhe had to be the first person to see her another police officer might be able to identify the bracelet if she had it on her but then it didnt explain everything but it made a certain amount of horrible sense he needed to find elena to get her quiet too but shed skipped when i told her about cerise shed hunted him out someplace and hed said enough to make her know hed killed cerise shed run for cover so his whole story about her trying to turn tricks in uptown that was made up bobby never asked him to find her that was why furey had made such a big deal out of my not calling to ask him my legs were cotton they kept bending when i tried walking on them i had to get to the streeter brothers fasti couldnt leave elena out on the loose for furey to find and pick off at will i forced myself to wobble over to the phone when i dialed their number i reached their answering machine i left a message trying to sound urgent without being hysterical and gave them lottys number to use in the morning when i hung up i tried murray again he was still out prowling someplace i checked the street from my window the man with the dog had disappeared a few other people were strolling along the block coming back from their workouts or heading for dinner i didnt believe any of them were emissaries of ralph macdonald with orders to garrote me on sight but i still waited behind the blinds until i saw lottys new camry screech to a halt in front of my building before going downstairs i called mr contreras to let him know his vigilance wouldnt be required he was a tad miffed that i would sleep at lottys but not with him anyway just because youre not home dont mean someone wont try to sneak in to hit you on the head when you get back i think me and princessll keep up our patrol anyway calling to tell him my plans was the farthest i could stretch my humanitarian impulsesi couldnt summon the courtesy to thank him for immolating himself so unnecessarily its true hed saved my life last winter but it didnt make me any more eager to include him in my work i trotted downstairs waved cursorily at the dog and mr contreras when they popped their heads into the hall and got quickly into the car i hate feeling scaredit makes me run when id much rather be walking so youve ruined that chevy of yours with your reckless driving was lottys greeting i opened my mouth to retort then shut it as lotty made a rakish u in front of a suntimes delivery van the driver braked so hard that a bundle of papers flew onto the sidewalk lotty ignored his mad honking and cursing with an imperiousness worthy of her ancestorsshe once told me theyd been advisers to the hapsburgs lotty drives as if she were responsible for an ambulance during the blitzshe sees the roads filled with enemy aircraft that shes either dodging or beating to a likely target she insists on buying standard transmissions because thats what she grew up with but strips the gears so mercilessly that this was her third car in eight years like all rotten drivers she thinks shes the only person who has a legitimate right to the road by the time wed gone the two miles to her apartment i was thinking i should have stayed home and taken my chances with ralph macdonald when we stopped the camry hiccoughed softlyit knew better than to complain too loudly to her i followed her meekly into her building up to the second floor where a brilliant display of color always knocks me back on my heels when i havent been there for a time lotty dresses in severely tailored clothesdark skirts crisp white shirts or sober black knits its in her home that her intense personality emerges in rich reds and oranges even though ive stayed there a number of times lotty always treats me as a real guest taking my bag offering me a drink from her limited repertoire she almost never uses alcohol herself and keeps brandy on hand only for medical emergencies i turned it down tonight my stomach still had a strong memory of the bottle of georges goulet id put away last evening lotty had a stew simmering on the back of the stove some kind of viennese dish reconstructed from her childhood memories hearty and simple it brought back the comforts of my own childhood you must have known id be coming when you made this i said gratefully cleaning the last carrot from my plate just what the doctor ordered thank you my dear lotty leaned over to kiss me now a bath for you and bed you have black circles the size of craters around your eyes before i went to bed she checked my hands the blisters were a bit tender from my gripping the chevys steering wheel too hard but they continued to heal she put more salve on them and tucked me into her cool scented sheets my last thought was that the smell of lavender was the smell of home when i woke up again it was past ten the sun stuck little fingers of light around the edges of the heavy crimson curtains striating the walls and floor in the empty apartment all i could hear was the hum of the bedside clock an oddly comforting noise i pulled on my sweatshirt and padded into the kitchen lotty had left a glass of orange juice for me and a note to help myself to food my long sleep had left me with an enormous appetite i boiled a couple of eggs and ate them with a great stack of toast while i was eating i tried to come up with a design for a perfect tiger trap but as soon as i started thinking about ralph macdonald and furey and the rest of the gang i got too nervous for logic or design i wished i had the beginning of an idea of where to look for elena maybe she did have some cronies who she could turn to when she hit the bottom of her considerable depths if she had been in any of the other abandoned buildings on the near south side furey would have found her by now i got up abruptly maybe he had me could have put a bullet through her or strangled herher body wouldnt be found until the wrecking crews came through a year or more from now i went into the living room to use the phone and tried the streeter brothers again the streeter brotherstim and jimoperate a security firm called all nightall right ive used them in the past when i had surveillance work too big for me to handle alone tim and jim operate the firm as a collective with a handful of other guys all big all with beards they move furniture as a sideline and most if not all of them spend their spare time reading kierkegaard and heidegger they do a respectable job but they also make me nostalgic for the dear dead days of yesteryear i got bob kovacki whom i knew pretty well and explained my situation to him i need to find her before this mad police sergeant does but right now ive got a sickening idea he may have flushed her in one of the old buildings on the near south side and left her body there id like you guys to look down there first then we can go over some of her old hangouts god vic were pretty booked now i could hear him drumming his fingers on the desktop ill talk to jim see if we can shift the schedule any you going to be around this afternoon i may be doing errands but ill call my answering service every hour lookiwell i dont have to spell it out for you this is urgent i know youll do the best you can though once id arranged a tow for the chevy id rent a car and go to the near south side myself i called my garage and described what had happened luke edwards my mechanic tisked lugubriously doesnt sound good vic you shoulda called me when it first started making that grinding noise you probably drove the transmission dry ill send jerry over with the truck in an hour or so but dont hope for too much i made a face at the phone dont be so cheerful lukeyoull build up your endorphins too big and your brainll blow you saw what i see every day and youd be sober too luke always makes his garage sound like the county morgue i gave it up and told him id be waiting for jerry with the car keys i quickly washed the dishes and made up the bed leaving an effusive note for lotty i hiked to my own home unlit fireworks i felt honorbound to stop at mr contrerass and inquire into any dark doings in the night he was intensely disappointednothing had happened peppy had wakened him around three barking her head off but it turned out to be just a couple of guys climbing into a car across the street i finished the conversation as quickly as i tactfully could and went up to the third floor no one was lurking there i called a small local rental company to arrange for a car they had an tempo no power steering fifty thousand miles it sounded like a clunker but it was only twenty dollars a day including taxes usage fees franchise charges and all the other items the big chains stiff you for i told them id be by around one my long deep sleep had worked wonders on my sore shoulders they were stiff but the needles of pain had gone while waiting for jerry i got out my small hand weights and did a light set of exercises to loosen them further the bright yellow tow truck finally honked in front of my building a little before onei should have remembered the laws of relativity that apply to garage time and multiplied lukes estimate of an hour by three i couldnt find my car keys finally i remembered stuffing them into the backpack where theyd clattered against the smith wesson i picked up the whole pack and fished the keys out on my way down the stairs mr contreras stuck his head out the door just turning my car over to the tow service i said brightly waving goodbye sometimes it was easier to tell him everything than to fight him jerry was a small wiry guy in his late twenties he owned a towing service but had a contract with luke and did most of the garages work in his spare time he raced slot cars we chatted a few minutes about an amazing race hed won in milwaukee the previous weekend let me see if shell turn over this morning vic save you the price of a tow the cars dead jerry i had to push it the final three blocks home last night why cant a car jock admit that a woman might at least know whether her own automobile starts or not well maybe we can jump it then just open the hood a minute okay vic oh all right i stomped ungraciously across the street and undid the hood release it was already loose which seemed odd i wondered if i might have pulled it by mistake while i was fumbling around trying to push the car last night jerry turned his truck around and backed up parallel with the chevy whistling between his teeth he pulled a set of cables from the back of the truck and came over to join me it was the looseness of the catch that made me look inside the engine before he hooked up the cables still whistling jerry was moving to attach one of them to the battery when i yanked his arm down get that thing away from the engine vicwhat he broke off when he saw the twin explosive sticks laid near the coil vic lets get the fuck out of here he spoke with a casualness belied by his white face he grabbed my arm and shoved me into the truck before id shut the door he was at the corner of belmont i was trembling so violently im not sure i could have moved without his pulling me i tried to stop my teeth chattering long enough to tell him to get the police on his truck radio we cant leave that bomb there for any passerby to touch i said through clenched jaws weve got to get the cops his face was still so white that his brown eyes looked black but he coasted to a stop in an empty loading zone near a hardware store i dont want to go near that thing again dynamite scares the shit out of me who you get so pissed off at you warshawski while he dialed i opened the truck door and threw up my eggs and toast in a neat little heap on the curb it was threethirty by the time i finished with the cops after a squad car duo had taken a quick fearful look at the bomb roland montgomery showed up with young firehorse whiskey whom id seen briefly in his office two weeks ago as the day wore on i never did get the young mans real name montgomery sent for a bombremoval team they arrived after half an hour or so in something that looked like a moon mobile in the meantime a half dozen more squad cars roared in to seal off the area for a few hours the street had more excitement than it usually gets in a year what with police cordons and lots of guys in space suits moving in on my car the networks all sent their vans and children who should have been in school appeared miraculously to wave at their playmates on the four oclock news when he saw the tv crews pull up montgomery got out of the car where hed been questioning jerry and me and went over to talk to them i ambled over to join in he liked that so little that he tried grabbing the mike away from me when i started to explain how jerry and i found the bomb we dont have anything to report to the media yet on this device the lieutenant said roughly you may noti smiled limpidly for the camera crewsbut im the owner of the car and i have a lot to say about it i think my downstairs neighbor heard them putting the bomb in around three this morning of course they lapped that up and wanted more there wasnt anything montgomery could do about it it was the dog who really heard them i said she probably saw them at my carthats why she started barking you can ask him all about it i gestured broadly at mr contreras who was standing on the periphery of the crowd with peppy peppy bounded over to me while mr contreras made his way to the eager reporters montgomery backed away from the dog and demanded i get rid of her dont shoot her lieutenant i said itll be on three networks all over the country dogs make a welcome addition to any picture especially a golden retriever as beautiful and heroic as peppy while montgomery frowned horribly i told the reporters her name and got her to shake paws with a couple of them they were naturally enchanted i fondled the dogs ears and listened to mr contreras explain at excruciating length exactly what it was hed heard and seen he also told them how the dog had saved my life last winter when she found me bound and gagged in the middle of a swamp i was glad i wasnt the one whod have to listen to it all in order to find one usable comment once the experts had removed the dynamite from the car and whisked it away in a special sealed container the tv crews departed too montgomerys demeanor changed immediately he sent jerry off and informed me we were going downtown for a real talk a trace of sadism in his expression as he took my arm roughly made my stomach churn mr contreras pawed anxiously at him demanding to know what they were doing with me montgomery brushed the old man back so roughly i was afraid he might knock him over take it easy lieutenant hes seventyeight you dont need to prove youre bigger and more powerful bobby mallory puts up with a lot of shit from you i dont have to take warshawski you button up now and speak when youre spoken to or ill have you in on an assault charge fast enough to make your smug little head spin whew lieutenant you been watching too many dirty harry movies he yanked my arm hard enough to jar the shoulder socket and hustled me to the car as he was pushing me inside i turned to scream at mr contreras to call lotty and get my lawyers name from her down at eleventh street montgomery took me to a small interrogation room and began demanding to know how id gotten hold of a supply of dynamite when it dawned on me that he was trying to accuse me of rigging my own car i was so furious that the room swam in front of my eyes get a witness in here lieutenant i managed to get out in a voice below a scream get a witness in here to what youre saying he swallowed a triumphant smile so fast i almost missed it weve got a pretty good case warshawski youve been involved in two suspicious fires in the last month we figure you for a sensationalist when you couldnt get the kind of attention you wanted out of those fires you rigged a bomb up in your car all i want to know is where you got the dynamite i wanted to jump up from behind the table and seize his long stork neck and pound his head against the wall but i had just enough reason left to know he was hoping to goad me over the brink i shut my eyes panting trying to force my temper downthe first time i let it go hed have me in the lockup for assaulting an officer youve been hiding behind bobby mallory for years warshawski its time you learned to fight on your own i felt him moving toward me just in time to back my chair away the blow hed aimed for my head got me on the diaphragm i presume this room is wired please let the record show that lieutenant montgomery just hit a witness in a bombing case i shouted he aimed another fist at me i slid from my chair under the legs of the table montgomery got down on his hands and knees to pull me out shouting abuse at me calling me names out of porn flicks i scooted away from him he went flat on his abdomen and grabbed my left ankle i twisted away and got to my feet on the other side of the table just as i staggered upright officer neely walked in her professional mask cracked at the sight of a lieutenant on his belly scrabbling around under an interrogation table he lost a contact i said helpfully weve both been down there looking but he started confusing my ankle with his eyeballs so i thought id get out of the way neely didnt say anything by the time montgomery had climbed awkwardly back to his feet she had her face composed in its usual rigid lines she spoke in a monotone lieutenant mallory heard you were questioning this witness and wanted to talk to her for a few minutes montgomery glared at her furious at being caught looking like a fool i felt sorry for her her career buffeted by being the wrong person to show up at a bad moment i dont think the lieutenant here has anything else useful to say to me hes got his facts without asking a single question lets go officer unfortunately i didnt feel sorry enough to keep my mouth shut i opened the door to the interrogation room and headed down the hall not waiting to see what officer neely would do she caught up with me on the stairs i wanted to say something helpful and sisterly to her in support of her lawenforcement career but i was too badly rattled to think of anything very chipper she was looking rigidly ahead making it impossible to know if she was embarrassed disgusted or just not very responsive on the third floor we silently crossed the violent crimes area to bobbys tiny office along the far wall officer neely knocked and opened the door miss warshawski sir did you want me to take notes bobby was on the phone he shook his head and motioned me to a chair officer neely shut the door behind her with a sharp snap bobbys desk and walls were crammed with photographspictures of yellow birds in flight gaptoothed children grinning as they sported his dress uniform cap eileen hand in hand with her eldest daughter as a bride he liked to shift them around every so often so he could see them with a fresh eye ordinarily i hunt for the shots of tony or gabriellaor even the one of me at five sitting on tonys lap today i didnt really care i sat gripping my hands on the side of the metal chair waiting for him to finish his conversation next to montgomery bobby was the last person i wanted to see today okay vicki tell me whats going on and make it fast i had a call from your lawyer which is how i knew you were down here but it doesnt make me happy to run interference for you with another man on the force i took a deep breath and came out with a tolerably coherent version of the days events bobby grunted and asked a few questions like how come i knew it was a bomb and how long it had taken monty to get there after jerry called in the report on his car radio when i got to the end bobby made a face youre in an awkward spot vicki i keep telling you not to play around in police business and this just proves my point you came to me to get you out of hot water you boiled up yourself what do you mean i was so furious my head seemed to rise a foot from my body i did not repeat not put that bomb in my car engine someone did but instead of trying to get a description of the men who did itwho may have done itfrom a pretty good witness the police are trying to charge me with attempted suicide im not saying you planted that device vicki i know you well enough to realize youre not that unbalanced but if you hadnt been playing around with arson and a whole lot of things i told you to stay out of you wouldnt be in this mess at all he looked at me sternly daddy to naughty child now im going to use a few chips on your behalf vicki with a guy whos not too easy to work with in return i want you to promise me that you are not going to touch this business any further let alone the trouble youve got yourself into since you started in on that fire three weeks ago youve got my whole unit stirred up you were in last night with some damned piece of jewelry that has the boys in an uproar now i just cant have it do you understand i pressed my lips together i brought in a mans bracelet i found under my couch because i though finchley might have dropped it when he and montgomery were in last week mcgonnigal flipped out when he saw it because he knew it was fureys and thought i was flaunting it at him it was only late last night that i realized it belonged to furey and came to see what it was doing in my apartment hed given it to elena bobby to elena and the dead junkie you went to see at the rapelec site two weeks ago it was just a little extortion something to keep them from reporting that theyd seen him bobby slammed his palm hard on the desk one of the pictures teetered and fell over the side ive had enough out of you he roared thats a loathsome suggestion youve been treated too easy for too long thats your problem so when things dont go your way you manufacture conspiracy theories you ought to know better than that than to come in here and try to lay that kind of shsomething like that on me now get out and go home i told you two weeks ago to stop stirring up my department and i meant it this had better be the last time i see you around here i got up and looked steadily at him you dont want to know what ive learned if im right montgomery and furey could be involved in one of the ugliest little scandals to hit this department in a long time bobby scowled ferociously spare me i hear enough trash in here every day without listening to you fling garbage around about one of my own men ive told you dozens of times that youre in a line of work thats bad for you and this is perfect proof of it you dont know how to reason how to follow a chain of evidence to a conclusion so you start making up paranoid fantasies if i tell you i think you need a good man and a family you get on your high horse but women your age who dont marry start getting strange ideas i dont want to see you ending up like that crazy aunt of yours propositioning young men for the price of a bottle i stared down at him not knowing whether to scream or laugh bobby that psychology was old before you were born the old repressedspinster routine and even if it were true it sure wouldnt apply to me i just hope you arent laying that line on officer neely or about the time i hit west madison youre going to be facing a harassment suit so big itll make your head spin anyway if you have to think of me as a crackpot virgin to keep your faith in the department intact remember when the pieces come breaking around you that i tried to warn you bobby was on his feet now too panting his face red get out of my office and dont come back here your parents were two of my best friends but id have broken every bone in your body if you talked to me the way you spoke to them and look where its ledhow dare you talk to me like this get out the last few words were on a crescendo so loud that they must have heard them on the street let alone in the adjacent room i managed to keep my head up and my steps steady and even to shut the door gently behind me everyone in the room turned to stare as i made the long walk from his office to the unitroom exit its okay boys and girls the lieutenant got a little excited but i dont think therell be any more fireworks this afternoon mourning becomes electra i walked slowly up state street anger dragged at my steps anger and depression both someone laid a bomb in my engine and no one in the police department had tried to get a word from mr contreras about the men hed seen instead roland montgomery assaulted me physically while bobby did it mentally break every bone in my body oh yeah thats how you get people to stop asking questions and do as you say you break every bone in their bodies i was angry with myself tooi hadnt meant to talk to bobby about furey until i had some proof of course bobby wouldnt listen to me spreading stories about his fairhaired boy it would be hard enough to get him to listen when i could really back them up and even though i was furious right now with bobby i didnt look forward to bringing him that much pain maybe id feel better for food it had been six hours since id eaten and id thrown that up i wandered into the first coffee shop i came to they had a variety of salads on the menu but i ordered a blt with fries grease is so much more comforting than greens anyway my weight was still downi needed to pack a few carbs to build myself back up because id come during offhours they made up the fries fresh just for me i ate them first while they were still hot and crisp halfway through the fries i remembered i was supposed to check in with my answering service every hour to see if the streeter brothers could fit me into their schedule soon i carried the last handful of potatoes to the pay phone at the front of the coffee shop i got tim streeter this time we can start for you first thing in the morning vic but well need you to brief the boys give them a description and maybe show them the kind of place your aunt would likely pick my stomach fell morning seemed an awfully long time away just now i couldnt protest thoughthey were doing me a mighty big favor i told tim id meet him at the corner of indiana and cermak at eight and hung up maybe it would still be light enough for me to do some hunting on my own tonight i could stop at august crays office and then head home to pick up the tempo i called my neighborhood car rental they closed at six but said theyd leave the tempo out front for me with the keys taped underneath the front bumper if someone stole it before i got there they werent going to be out much i paid my billunder ten dollars even though i was perilously close to the upscale part of the south loop and took the sandwich to eat on my way to crays office the address freeman carter had given me for farmworks was on north lasalle i took a bus up to van buren and then got on the dan ryan lit would take me around the loop faster than any taxi this time of day it was just on fourthirty when i got off at clark and walked the three blocks to crays building i hoped someone was still in the office even if cray himself wasnt i was going against the tide of homebound workers inside the lobby i had to move to the wall and scoot crablike around the outgoing throng to the elevators i rode in splendid isolation to the twentyeighty floor and made my way on soft gray carpeting to suite its solid wood door was labeled simply property management they probably ran so many different little firms out of there that they couldnt list all their names on the door the knob didnt turn under my hand so i tried a buzzer discreetly imbedded to the right of the panel after a long pause a tinny voice asked who was there im interested in investing in farmworks i said id like to talk to august cray the door clicked i walked into a narrow reception area a holding pen really with a couple of stiff chairs but no table or magazinesor even a window for waiting customers to gaze through a sliding glass window in the left wall allowed the inmates to look at visitors without exposing their whole bodies this was shut when i came in i looked around and saw a little television camera in a corner of the ceiling i smiled at it and waved and a few seconds later star wentzel opened a door next to the glass panel her blond hair was combed back and gathered into a jeweled white clip she wore a long narrow skirt that highlighted her gaunt pelvic bones she looked like a high school student from the fifties not a participant in a development scam what are you doing here she demanded i smiled i might ask you the same question i came here to find august crayfarmworkss agent of record and here you are mourning your mother but putting a brave front on it by coming into the office i cant bring mother back to life by staying home she said pettishly i dont need you to tell me how to behave of course you dont star can we go inside id still like to talk to august cray hes not here why dont you tell me what you want this was clearly a rote lineshe rattled it off without the hostility of her earlier remarks i smiled i came to invest in farmworks its such an upandcoming company i hear theyre going to get a huge piece of the new stadium projecti want to be a millionaire just like boots and ralph she smoothed a hand over a jutting hipbone i dont know what youre talking about then ill explain it to you lets go sit downthis will take awhileyour feet are going to start hurting in those spiky heels if we talk out here i opened the door and shepherded star into the inner office it was a small room with a blond wood desk about the color of her hair a couple of portables covered the topone seemed identical to the apollo id noticed in the alma mejicana offices on sunday wood filing cabinets filled the windowless walls and spilled over into the narrow hallway it was a working persons office all right i dumped a stack of prospectuses from a chair in the hall and moved it into the office while star sat in her padded swivel chair behind the desk her mouth was set in a mulish line i expect i looked about the same she lifted a thin wrist to examine a weighty gold timepiece i dont have much time so make your spiel and let me get home my sister and i have to entertain some of mothers church friends tonight its partly about your mother that i came to see you i said you claimed to be a friend of hers but no one at the church had ever heard of you she said sharply thats because i only knew her in the narrow context of her work at seligman since the fire at the indiana armsim sure you know about that dont youid been talking to her hoping to get some idea about who might have set it she obviously was sitting on some kind of secret and that secret had to do with you or your sister after i talked to you at the funeral home on monday i was pretty sure that you working here was what she was so pleased aboutand so eager to withhold and thats what i want you to tell mewhy she couldnt tell people where you worked a ghost of her mothers smug look flitted across her face thats none of your business is it she said it in a saucy little singsong the way young children do it got under my skin goading me to act like a child myself i put both hands on the desk and leaned forward between the two computers star sugar i want you to be real brave about this but you should know your boss killed your mother little red spots burned in her cheeks thats a lie mother was killed by some awful mugger who thought the office was empty and and broke in and stole only the documents relating to farmworkss offer to buy the indiana arms i cut in come off it star ralph and boots are spinning you a line your mother learned id gotten hold of a picture of you and she was afraid youd get linked to the fire when i started showing it around she went to ralph and told him she was going to have to tell me all about his offer to purchaseshe didnt want you taking the fall in case someone could connect you with that arson and he killed her or he got someone to kill her how bad do you want to protect those cretins bad enough to let them get away with your mamas death youre making this up ralph and gus told me you might be around to harass me he told me what you might insinuate you think youre so smart but hes smarter than you gus i started to ask then realized she must mean august one things for damn surehes smarter than you dont you realize that i didnt know macdonald was involved in farmworks until you told me just now it was a guess but it sure was right on target shall i guess everything else that happened and you let me know if im right or wrong or do you want to tell me yourself she pulled herself up in her swivel chair youd better get out of here before i call the police youre harassing me in a private office and thats against the law let me make another guess i pulled her rolodex toward me and started flipping through it youll call roland montgomerys private number and hell send some uniforms hopping to drag me away and star what a coincidence here it is i uh she started a sentence several times but didnt finish it you dont have any proof no i had to admit its just another guess but he or at least farmworksis at the center of a whole lot of different action that hed just as soon the fbi didnt see theyre going to though star because the heralds going to print the whole story and then the feds will come subpoena your files and theyll charge you with conspiring to commit fraud and arson and murder and then you wont just be a poor little orphan youll be a poor little orphan in jail only if a jury hears how you let your own mother take the fall for you theyre not going to treat you like a helpless waif just because my employer tried to buy a building belonging to mothers employer does not mean he killed her her voice was scornful ralph and boots really wanted the indiana arms didnt they really badly i know about their stadium bidthats not a secret and it wont take too much work to do a proper title search for the stuff back there so you might as well tell me she thought it over carefully then finally conceded that farmworks had been buying up property in the triangle behind mccormick place and the dan ryan for several years now positioning themselves for a bid on the stadium the indiana arms was one of the few occupied buildings they hadnt been able to acquire star had been keeping seligmans books for him at the timeshe was a cpa she thought he was foolish not to sell and tried to pressure him he acted like that place meant more to him than his own children star said resentfully youd think hed of been glad to get what they were offeringit would have been so much better for barbara and connie than inheriting that rundown junk heap even afterafter things started going really wrong like when the elevators broke down and no one would come fix them he couldnt see it was a losing proposition it had some sentimental meaning for him so what happened next you went to august cray and ralph and said if theyd hire you youd keep up the pressure on seligman through your mom she tossed her golden hair scornfully they made me an offer they could see i was good that i was wasted in that nickelanddime place what were you supposed to do forge a title transfer were you good enough to do that or just get your mother to keep the heat on the old man to sell she smiled at me coldly youll never know will you but then rita learned that mr seligman had given me a photo that had you and shannon in it along with his own daughters and she came to you panicked she was afraid if i started showing it to someone who had lived or worked at the indiana arms that they would recognize you what had you been doing down there sabotaging the elevators yourself or just guaranteeing that no repair company would come fix them so you told ralph your mom was getting cold feet and he did the only decent thinghe got someone to kill her she sucked on her lower lip but she didnt shake that easily youre in here with guesses and stories if thats your idea of fun im not going to stop you yeah theyre guesses and stories but theyre pretty volatile a more innocent woman might be hollering for cops or lawyers or witnesses or something but youre taking it all in to see how much i know arent you well boots may have the local cops in his hip pocket but i dont think he owns the fbi yet i got up to go star had a strange little smile on her face of course you have to talk to them first dont you and even if boots doesnt have much influence with the fbi he can make sure they dont listen to you my stomach jolted a bit but i said calmly oh did ralph and boots tell you about their joke on my ignition i found it and ill be extra careful looking for others i remember leann wunsch telling me what a kidder boots was im only just beginning to really appreciate it she barely waited for me to leave before she picked up her phone i didnt shut the door all the way and stood with my ear against it she asked for ralph and said it was urgent and that shed wait at her desk until he called back i guess her mothers church friends werent that important the eye of the hurricane i stood in the middle of lasalle street trying to quell a rising tide of panic i needed some allies and i needed them fast it was luck pure and simple that had kept me from disintegrating into my component parts today if i had roland montgomery would have closed the investigation for lack of leadsor painted me as a bizarre suicidal maniac id miraculously sidestepped my fate but it wouldnt be ralph macdonalds last effort to present me with his side of the story as hed put it on monday maybe i was jumping to conclusions in putting ralph behind the dynamite in my car perhaps it was roland montgomeryhe had ready access to all kinds of incendiary stuff or michael getting it from wunsch or grasso michael my stomach twisted some more he couldnt have tried to blow me up wed never been in love but wed been lovers for a brief sweet time can you want to think of a body youve caressed torn into jagged chunks of bleeding bones or did my rebuff make him want to see me so i shook my head impatient with myself this was hardly the time or place to sink into a melancholy reverie i needed to get myself organized the smith wesson was in my backpack that was one good thing of course i couldnt very well pull it out in the middle of lasalle street but i didnt think anyone was likely to try to shoot me during the evening rush hour i was just lucky that montgomery had been so hot to get me in the interrogation room and break my jaw that he hadnt bothered with the usual formalities at the police station no one had searched me i hadnt had to surrender the gun and go through the tedious process of producing my permit and getting permission to pick it up again i needed to get to a phone but i was too scared of what direction macdonaldor montgomeryor michael might next attack from to go to my office that was an easy place to lay a trap for the same reason i didnt want to go homeor to lottys if macdonalds mind was running to dynamite i didnt want him to kill peppy or lotty in the effort to destroy me i finally flagged a cab to ride the nine blocks to the golden glow sal would let me use her phone and i wouldnt mind a little black label to settle down some of the more extreme lurches my stomach was giving as the taxi wove recklessly through the end of the rushhour congestion it occurred to me that ralph probably hadnt ordered the dynamite in my car most likely it had happened just like beckethim running his fingers through his wellcut silver hair and asking tragically if no one would rid him of this meddlesome priestess its always that way i thought bitterly from henry ii to reaganyour barons or oliver north or whoever does the dirty work and you wrap yourself in a mantle of bewilderment and lawyers i never knew about it they misinterpreted my instructions you say something miss the cabbie asked i hadnt realized id been angry enough to mutter aloud no keep the change murray ryerson was sitting at the mahogany horseshoe bar drinking holstein and talking to sal about the upcoming college basketball season neither of them broke off a spirited debate about the ncaa sanctions on the ku jayhawks when i climbed onto a stool next to murray but sal reached behind her for the black label and poured me a glass sals cousin was taking care of customers at the tables i sipped my whiskey without offering any opinion on larry browns perfidies of milt newmans abilities now that danny manning wasnt leading the squad anymore when sal and murray had run out of ideas on the subject murray casually asked me what was new i swallowed the rest of my drink and accepted another from sal you almost got your wish to write my obituary today big guysomeone laid a bomb across my ignition coil at first murray thought i was joking that so how come youre here to tell about it really happened when i got to the part where the head of the bomb and arson squad refused to conduct a proper investigation he shut me up and went to his car for a tape recorder he was somewhat aggrieved at missing the story hed been at a conference out at the airport all day so he hadnt seen any of the wires or the sensational reports the networks were trumpeting i told him everything i knew from saul seligman and the indiana arms to the little scam among farmworks alma mejicana and wunsch and grasso to roland montgomerys strange theory of me setting fire to the indiana arms and then blowing myself up in remorse when i finished murray put an arm around me and gave me a sloppy kiss youre wonderful vic i forgive you for holding out on me last winter this is a great story all it needs is a little proof you dont call a hunk of dynamite proof sal snapped a bottle of holsteins down in front of murray her dead body would impress you more it shows someone wanted to kill her but not who murray drank directly from the bottle you didnt copy any of the stuff you found at almas offices or at farmworks did you i took notes at almas offices but i didnt see any of the books at farmworks but cant you track some of this stuff down through lexis and the office of contracts and so on and get someone in the county to tell you what roland montgomery owes boots that scares me more than anythingyou get a big cop dogging you and he can kill you or frame you or any damned thing he wants im shaving my head and growing a beard until this sucker blows up big enough that im not the only figure tapdancing in the spotlight sal offered me the bottle again but i turned it down i couldnt spend the night at the golden glow and i wouldnt survive if i left here too drunk to notice who was walking up behind me murray went into sals private office to make some phone calls it was too late in the day to look up any records in the county building but he was going to initiate a more thorough search through the lexis network than freeman carter had done for menow that we were looking for a tiein between macdonald or meagher and alma mejicana murray could ask the system to pull together combinations of names that hadnt occurred to me earlier so what do you do now sal asked lay low until the storm passes i think i go home i interrupted her voluble protest i know i came in scared crying for help im still scared but i broke off trying to think my inchoate feelings into a semblance of logic its like this now murray has the storyhe can get enough going by tomorrow even maybe to print something friday or saturdayif the star isnt too scared of boots and ralph so as soon as boots and macdonald see things are coming into the open theyll be shredding documents like mad be covering their tracks on the ryan theyre probably rounding up a truckload of hispanic and black workers right now with documents proving theyve been working there since the first of march if they think its still just me on my own maybe theyll try to come get me and then at least we can nail a few of them in the act you and murray sal pursed up her face in high disdain ill do the storymurrayll make the pictures i said with a lightness i was far from feeling no i think ill be okay at home i was panicking earlier wondering if ralph might dynamite the whole building just to get me but really hes much more likely to wait until im on my own and try something different my old guy downstairs has been on all the stations talking about the men he saw yesterdaythe pair who came calling on me in person and the pair who probably put the bomb in the car so i cant believe theyll risk anything there again at least not so soon i hoped a couple of guys in business suits came in and sat up at the mahogany bar on the opposite side from me sal went over to fill their orders i played moodily with my whiskey tumbler the one name i hadnt given murray was michael fureys it wasnt that i wanted to protect furey but i didnt have proofjust a string of guesses supported only by logic his name hadnt even been in stars rolodex before i started my own offensive i wanted to know how deep fureys involvement went with his neighborhood palswhether hed just put some of his daddys life insurance money into farmworks when they gave him the opportunityor done more like maybe borrowed heroin from the police evidence stores so cerise could kill herself if hed done something like thati couldnt imagine trying to break the news to bobby id tried today without evidence if proof came ini shuddered it just better not be me that lets bobby know about it that was all when murray came out of sals office i went in to call lotty to let her know what i was doing shed heard the story of my bomb from her clinic nurse whod called after watching the six oclock news and was well and truly alarmed she wanted me to come stay with her wait in seclusion until the police caught my assailant but when she heard what response they were giving me she reluctantly agreed i was making the right decision only vicbe careful all right i couldnt bear it if you got killed will you think of me before you stick your head in front of a gun christ lotty ill think of me before i do that dont dont think im that careless of my life im more frightened now than i can remember being in a good long while if bobby mallory were paying the least attention to me i wouldnt touch this business with a barge pole we talked a little longer by the time we hung up i was close to crying i got up slowly from sals desk and went back through the mahogany door to the bar my palms were tingling with nervousness but a warm afterglow from the whiskey kept my stomach in place the bar had cleared out sal was washing the empties as her cousin brought them in from the tables she finished sticking a row of glasses in their slots above the bar and came over to me you sure you want to take off now girl yup i stuck my hands deep in my pockets my right fingers ran into metal i pulled out the cavalier keysid forgotten putting them there the sight of my chevy logo stamped into their heads increased my nervousness sal isnt given to demonstrativeness but she came around the front of the bar to hug me tightly you be careful vic i dont like this at all its a far better thing that i do now than i have ever done i recited in attempted bravado if you die youre not going to land in a better place than youve ever been so just watch yourself you hear do my best sal murray offered me a lift north then maybe ill just cruise around the block every now and then to see whether youre still alive shut up ryerson sal said roughly gallows humor isnt going down well tonight we stood awkwardly silent for a few minutes a late customer came in breaking the spell murray and i left while sal stirred a martini for him murray and i have a style of banter together that somehow precludes true intimacy tonight i was too nervous to respond in kind to his jokes too nervous to respond at all i kept rubbing my palms dry against my jean legs and trying not to imagine what macdonald might do next an old friend catches up murray dropped me at the neighborhood car rental he waited while i checked the enginewhether out of courtesy or because he was hoping for another dynamite story since hed missed the first i didnt ask no one could have known id called bad wheels for a car it was just my jangling nerves that made me look the tempos engine ignited with a lurching rumble but no flames shot out from under the hood when murray saw i wasnt going up in smoke he tore off in his battered fiero leaving me drumming my fingers on the wheel in indecision the sun had set it would be light for another half hour or so not really long enough for me to go hunting elena with any confidence if michael had found and killed her would it matter that her body lay waiting for me until morning of course she wouldnt be alone exactlythere were all those rats id seen last week it made my palms and feet tremble when i remembered the little ball of fur id encountered groping for my flashlight in the dark i drove home parking on nelson west of racine and going down the alley to the back of my building peppy set up a terrific barking when i came in the back gate mr contreras appeared at the kitchen door holding her on a short leash with his left hand and carrying a pipe wrench in his right oh its you doll gave me a start i thought maybe someone was sneaking up on you thank you i said meekly i was just creeping up on myself i didnt want to be ambushed in the stairwell no need to worry about that her highness and i are keeping a sharp eye out he let go of the leashthe dog was whimpering in her eagerness to greet me her tail was whipping up a great circlenot the portrait of a fierce guard dog i kissed her and fondled her ears she danced with me back to the stairs and clattered up with me convinced this was the prelude to a major run mr contreras trudged up behind us as fast as his stiff knees would allow what are you doing now doll he asked sharply when hed invited himself into my apartment im trying to remember where i left my flashlight i called from the bedroom it had rolled under the bed i finally saw peppy helped me lie flat to pull it out she ate a kleenex she found underneath and started to work on an old running sock half buried under the bedclothes yummy is it i pulled it away from her and went back to the kitchen i mean where are you going the old man demanded severely when he saw me checking the clip to my gun just to see if i can locate my aunt im worried that she might be dead and lying in one of those vacant buildings behind mccormick place come to that shed left the hospital in bad shapeshe could be dead without anyone lifting a finger to make it happen or lying there unconscious im coming with youme and the princess here his jaw set in a stubborn line i opened my mouth to argue with him then shut it again here was a perfect errand to restore his good humor with mehe could see the action without causing any major havoc not only that peppy could kill the rats i accepted his escort graciously and was rewarded with a big smile and a resounding slap on my stillweak shoulders just dont swing that pipe wrench around i warned him locking the grate across the kitchen door youre under a peace bond because of that thing remember he slung it decorously through one of his trouser loops and headed happily up the alley to the car with me all the way to lake shore drive and the mccormick place exit he kept up a happy flow of talk you know your chevys still out front with the hood up didnt no one want to touch it i tried getting that young fellow the one with the tow truck to take if off but he was too chicken i said let me do it ill hook it up and drive it to the garage for you youre too yellow to do it but he just took off like a bat outta hell if you know what i mean i know just what you mean besides having steering as stiff as an oldfashioned shirt collar the tempo roared rather loudly bad wheels didnt pay much attention to exhaust systemsdrive em till they drop was their motto the noise spared me most of mr contrerass conversation until i parked on prairie peppy was thrilled to be part of the expedition she strained at her leash sniffing every pile of rubble investigating trash heaps with the solemnity of heinrich schliemann mr contreras was only a hair less enthusiastic in commenting on the general decay around us been a lot of fires down here yep i said shortly elena being a creature of rather tiresome habit she would most likely select a place close to the indiana arms as she had when shed chosen the prairie shores i was going to look at only one or two of these in the fastfading light the rest could wait until morning we went first into the warehouse two doors down from the shell of the old hotel mr contrerass pipe wrench came in handy knocking out the boarding around the entranceannoying since it would make it impossible to get him to leave it at home in the future once inside we let peppy take the lead she had a field day chasing rats i kept my gun out in case one of them turned on her but there were enough escape routes to keep them from becoming bellicose after five or ten minutes of sport i called her off and kept her close to me while i explored what was left of the premises the interior walls had crumbled making it easy to go from room to room without hunting for doors chunks of plaster lay everywhere wires dangled from the exposed ceiling studs when i ran into one i let out a muffled shriek it felt so much like a hand trailing through my hair mr contreras came stumbling through the rotted flooring to see what was wrong a giant tractor tire propped against one wall was the only sign that humans had ever been around i guess it didnt even prove thatonly that tractors had been around when we got outside it was dark too dark to make hunting in rotting buildings very smart and it was too evocative of my near baking at the prairie shores for my tastemy clothes were wet with sweat my hands grimy from touching the decayed walls i was glad id had the dogs support in the warehouse even mr contreras had been subdued by the expedition he put up a token protest that we shouldnt leave now just when we were getting our bearings when i said it was too dark to look farther he agreed readily volunteering to return in the morning with the streeter brothers sure i said heartily theyll love the help i returned the gun to the back waistband of my jeans and bundled him into the car with peppy on the way home he kept shaking his head and muttering comments that drifted to me only sporadically over the roar of the enginehe hoped elenaroar roarnot a place for a roaryou really should do something doll i gave the car more gas to drown out what it was i should do i found a parking place on wellington and left the tempo there i didnt want to make it too easy for anyone watching me to connect me with the car i turned down the old mans invitation to dinner and headed up the stairs shining my flashlight on the tread above me furey was waiting at the top of the third flight i dropped the flashlight and fumbled for my gun when he launched himself down the stairs at me i turned to race back down fatigue and injuries slowed me he got my feet and grabbed my head in a brutal armlock youre coming with me vic youre going to kiss your aunt goodbye and then have a farewell party yourself he was sitting on my back i tried twisting underneath him biting into his leg he yelped in pain but grabbed my hands and cuffed them together seizing the handcuffs he started pulling me down the stairs i let out a great cry that brought mr contreras and the dog to the door of their apartment im going to shoot both of them vic furey hissed at me interfering with the police in the performance of their duties you want to watch or stop fighting and come along with me i gulped in air trying to quiet my heart enough to talk go in i quavered at mr contreras hell shoot peppy when the old man came into the hall anyway brandishing his pipe wrench furey fired at him the wrench flew to the floor as the old man crumbled as we left i saw peppy race over to lick mr contrerass face i was choking on my tears but i thought i saw him put up an arm to pet her a walk on the wild side fureys car was parked halfway up the block he jerked the drivers door open and shoved me across the gear box into the passenger seat i flung up my cuffed hands to protect my face as i fell against the door my left leg was tangled in the gear stick i was twisted at an awkward angle unable to kick at michael when he thrust my leg onto the passenger side at least he hadnt bothered to pat me down maybe he didnt know i sometimes carry a gun if i kept my wits i might still be able to use it a handful of people were out on the street but they turned studiously the other way when they saw me struggling against himno one wants to be involved in domestic quarrels i kept biting off the cry to call the cops after all michael was the cops what would the patrol units do when they showed up and michael told them i was a violent prisoner im not taking any chances with you vicernie and ron were right about you all along youre not interested in the things a normal girl isyou just play the odds and wait your chance to jump on a guys balls i leaned back in the leather seat youre so brave furey shooting a man old enough to be your grandfather they have special sessions on that at the police academy shut up vic he took a hand from the wheel and slapped my face gosh michael now i am scared you and your friends really know how to keep your women in shape how about fastening my seat belt so i dont have to go headfirst through the windshieldyoud have a hard time explaining it to bobby he ignored my request and took off with such a burst that i was flung against the leather i squirmed awkwardly to fish the seat belt from where it was wedged against the door they kept laughing at me all the kowtowing i did to youernie said leann talked back to him that way just once and he taught her who was boss thats what i should have done with you from the start out at bootss barbecue they warned me you were acting sweet just so you could nose your way into our business carl and luis took them seriouslybut me i just couldnt listen he pounded the steering wheel his voice rising and cracking i finally managed to snap the metal tongue into its holder three weeks ago when you told me elena had been seen soliciting in uptown that was a lie wasnt it thats why you were so insistent i not call bobby to talk to him about it he turned onto diversey and moved into the oncoming traffic lane to swoop around the traffic backed up from the light at southport youre so sharp vic thats what always attracted me to you why couldnt you be smart and sweet at the same time just luck of the draw i guess i tried to brace myself against his sudden braking as he cut back into the right lane you said you had my aunt where did you find her down in one of those abandoned buildings on cermak he laughed she was right under my nose can you beat that right around the corner in my own neighborhood eileen had seen her and told my mother and mother mentioned it to me at supper last night shed gone to hide out with one of her old cronies but her thirst got to her she just had to go get herself a bottle i knew sooner or later if she wasnt dead she wouldnt be able to put up with that thirst anymore i just didnt expect it to be around the corner from me so i hung out all afternoon and sure enough round eight oclock there she came i just helped her into the car she tried sweettalking me it was loathsome he did sixty through the park to lake shore drive i suppose the beat cops knew his license plate or at least called it in and saw it belonged to a detective the local traffic didnt have that inside track and honked ferociously as they had to swerve out of his way was she loathsome because of her age or her drinking or both i asked women who think theyve got sexual powers that they dont are disgusting she appeals to some guys just because shes not your type doesnt mean everyone finds her repulsive he turned onto lake shore drive so fast i was flung against him when i was upright again i said conversationally touching you seems loathsome to me but im sure some women would disagree he didnt say anything just took the corvette up to ninety diving in and out of lanes around the other cars making them seem to stand still in a blur of light i was afraid i was going to throw up when he braked into the curve at the michigan avenue exit he slowed down thenthe traffic was too thick for him to keep up so mad a pace youre cracking michael youre leaving a trail a mile wide even if roland montgomerys your clout in the department he cant protect you from the mayhem youre manufacturing tonight in the streetlamps along the drive i could see sweat beaded on his forehead he made a violent gesture with his right hand but the car swerved he fishtailed and got us back in our lane by a miracle what is it that roland owes boots i kept my tone level and why did he get you to set the firewhy couldnt he do it himself furey bared his teeth at me youre not that fucking smart vic i went to montgomery i found him for boots all he had to do was get me the accelerant and make sure no one investigated too closely what a good boy i said marveling is that when they gave you the corvette you dont understand anything do you i was preparedi was willingyou could have lived like leann and clarahad whatever you wantedbut you i have what i want michael my independence and my privacy youve just never understood it have you that all those things those diamonds and stuff just dont turn me on he got off at the grand avenue exit and whipped around the curves to the rapelec complex he parked the corvette well away from the street behind one of the wooden walls blocking the site he jumped out and came around to the passenger door i had thought i might be able to kick him as i got out of the car but hed handled a lot of rough arrests in his timehe stood well away from the frame and waited for me to wrestle with the seat belt and get my legs out myself he put an arm around me in a savage mockery of chivalry and hustled me into the building i shivered involuntarily when we moved into the inky corridors we were on the plankcovered ramp id walked three weeks earlier up to the management offices beyond the naked bulbs lay the gaping hole of the complex i wondered where my aunt was if she was still alive what tragic end was destined for us furey hadnt said a word since wed gotten to the site i began to feel boxed in by the silence as much as by my cuffs to regain my composure i said conversationally was it because mcgonnigal told you i had the bracelet is that why you came to get me tonight he bared his teeth again in a violent parody of a smile you left your scarf at the alma offices vic i saw you unwrap it when eileen gave it to you the day we met you dont remember it but i do because i thought you were the hottest little number id ever laid eyes on i do want my bracelet back but im not in any hurry thats good i said calmly even though my cheeks burned at the idea of being a hot number i left it in my apartment youre going to need a wrecking crew to get in there you dont get it do you not even being a cop can cover your tracks for you when youve created this much carnage not even bobby will do it itll break his heart but hell let you go michael hit me across my mouth with the back of his hand you need to learn a few lessons vic and one of them is to shut up when i tell you to it stung a little but didnt hurt i dont have a long enough lifeline right now to learn new tricks mickey and even if i did yours just purely make me throw up michael stopped in the middle of the gangway and shoved me against the wall i told you to shut up vic do you want me to break your jaw to make you do it i looked at him steadily marveling that id ever found those dark angry eyes engaging of course i dont michael but i have to wonder if beating me while im defenseless would make you feel powerful or ashamed he held my shoulder with his left hand and tried to slam his right into my face as he came forward i kicked him as hard as i could in the kneecap hard enough to break it he gave a sharp cry and dropped my shoulder i ran down the ramp terribly hampered by my bound hands above me i heard furey crying out and then ernie wunsch calling down asking what the fuck was going on i darted into the shadowy interior tumbling over boards in the dark i was making too big a racketno one would have any trouble finding me i stopped running and moved cautiously forward until i came to a big pillar steel with concrete poured around it i sidled around behind it and stood there trying not to breathe out loud scrabbling behind me trying to reach my gun my arms were crossed in their cuffs though and i couldnt reach far enough around a powerful flashlight stuck fingers out on the floor around me i didnt move lets not play hideandseek here all night ernie said go get the aunt shell flush her out i still didnt move a couple of minutes later i could hear elenas breathless voice squeaky with fear what are you doing youre hurting me theres no need to hold me so hard i dont know how you were brought up but in my day a true gentleman did not squeeze a ladys arm hard enough to bruise it good old elena maybe id find a happy death laughing at her incongruous scolding we have your aunt here warshawski it was ron grasso speaking now call out to your niece auntie he did something to make her scream i flinched at the noise louder auntie she screamed again a cry of genuine pain vicki theyre hurting me we just broke a finger warshawski well break her bones one by one until you decide youve had enough i swallowed bile and stepped out from behind my pillar okay hemen ive had enough thats a good girl vic ernie said moving toward me i always told mickey there was a way to manage you if he just looked for it keep the light on her ronnie little bitch maybe broke mickeys knee i dont want her clawing at me he came up to me and took my arm now dont you try anything vic because ron there will just start breaking your aunties fingers again if you do vicki elena quavered youre not mad at poor old elena are you i held out my cuffed hands to her of course im not mad at you sweetie you did the best you could you were very smart and brave to hide so long what good would it have done to chew her out for not sharing the whole story with me from the beginningor at least from her bed at michael reese they hurt me vicki they broke my little finger i didnt mean to scream and make them find you but i couldnt help it her face was in shadow but i sensed the tears beginning to fall no no sweetie i know you couldnt i patted the thin bones in her hands they were fragile exposed as easy to break as sticks of china behind ron and elena stood august cray the night project manager what happened to your security guard he not in on the kill i asked and i dont see dear little star either she and i had such a nice chat this afternoon nobody answered me were just going to go for a ride vic ron said you take it easy there are three of us here and we can make it mighty unpleasant for both of you if you try any of your cute tricks on us just three of you what happened to furey did i really get his kneecap a shot like that takes a lot of practice i was amazed to hear myself sounding as chipper as a cheerleader you know if hes gone to the hospital youve got a little problemif my bodys discovered with his handcuffs on i meanits going to be awkward for the poor boy to explain that one away youre not the only one around here with a brain warshawski so dont get your underwear in a bundle over that one ernies sharper voice came from behind me mickey wont leave us holding the bag thats right i said approvingly youre all pals and pals gotta stick together even unto death at least the death of a whole lot of innocent bystanders youre no little innocent vic so dont get me shedding tears for you we got to the hoist and they bundled us in cray operated the controls while ron and ernie hovered close to elena and me i wished futilely that id learned enough polish to do more than greet my grandmother warshawski at christmas i could have told elena about the gun and gotten her to slip it out of my back before ron or ernie found it but if i muttered the news to her theyd hear me and disarm me as we rode slowly up my terror and helplessness increased i could imagine our end tipped over the side of the building the accidental death of an unstable wino and her eager but unhelpful niece i stopped trying to goad the boys with my bright chatter and slumped down on my heels against the elevator wall my head in my hands whats she up to ron demanded im sick i groaned im going to throw up be my guest ernie said sardonically i made retching noises and collapsed on the floor of the hoist clutched my stomach with my cuffed hands elena fluttered down next to me oh my poor baby what would gabriella say if she could see you shed never forgive me i hope i dont go to heaven when i die i couldnt bear to see the look on her face for knowing i got you into trouble like this come to elena baby come here vicki just lean your head against old drunk elena and maybe youll feel a little better i sat up and leaned my head against her shoulder with my voice muffled against her scrawny neck i told her about the gun wait until were out of here and in the dark then pull it out and hand it to me fear had sharpened her wits she didnt give a sign of having understood me oh vicki yes whatever you say baby just dont cry thats a good girl maybe she hadnt understood me i wondered if i should try to repeat the message but the hoist had slid to a stop and ernie was urging me to my feet still clutching my stomach and moaning i lurched on the way out and stumbled against the concrete we were on the open deck at the top of the building around us steel beams sent blacker fingers against the dark sky we were up twentyfive or thirty stories a stiff wind made the girders sway and froze my marrow the sight of open air in all directions brought on a genuine attack of nausea i fell down almost swooning elena was on me like a shot weeping over her poor little vicki while ron tried to wrestle her away her bony hands felt behind me for my gun he pulled her up but she had the smith wesson loose and dropped it in front of me the sharp sound of metal on concrete echoed a thousandfold in my ears ernie and ron didnt immediately realize what had happened the only light came from the hoist i could just make out the glint of the metal and scrabbled madly for the gun i reached it just as ernie yanked me to my feet fumbling it into my right hand i slid the safety off with my thumb i wrenched myself from ernie and turned and shot him cray was still standing in the hoist when he heard the shot and saw ernie fall he closed the doors and started back down ron started dragging elena toward the edge of the platform i couldnt make him out except as a bundle of darkness moving along the paler sheen of the concrete i forced myself to follow him to fight down the spinning in my head to place the muzzle in his back and pull the trigger a yard from the edge ron collapsed falling on top of elena i had never killed a man before but i knew from the way his body lay crumpled as a dark blob on the concrete deck that he was dead i couldnt bring myself to walk close enough to checkbut what would i have done even if he had been alive my hands were still cuffed and the hoist was somewhere below us my aunt began thrashing about trying to move away from him that finally brought me over to the body even a yard from the edge of the deck my head swam i shut my eyes and managed to roll ron from my aunts torso i brought her with me to the center of the platform behind us the crane loomed up the pale light of the midnight sky glinted from its long swaying arm i thought of the hole underneath going down thirty stories to the bottom of the elevator shaft and shuddered ernie was still alive id shattered his shoulder he was losing enough blood to want to get help but he told me there wasnt any way to bring the hoist up myself ernie wasnt inclined to talk much i tried asking him about his relations with boots and macdonald and why he and ron did so much for them but he told me i was a nosy interfering bitch and to mind my own business before it was too late at the same time he was peeved with me for not climbing down to the groundhe told me they nailed ladders into the openings where fire stairs would eventually be poured you could at least try to get some help he complained you shot meyou owe me something ernie sweetie i shot you because you were going to throw me over the side of the building im not climbing down thirty stories of ladders in the dark specially not with my hands not working at that wunsch cursed some more this time at his partners it seems furey had given cray the key to my handcuffshed been supposed to undo me right before i went overthey didnt want to run the risk of not getting to me before some passerby did now look at that jerk takes off and leaves us alone up here to die i thought you were a real macho kind of guy i said disapprovingly john wayne would never have lain around pissing at how rotten his pals were just because hed taken a bullet ernie swore at me then asked me to take off my sweatshirt to wrap him up he was getting so cold with blood loss ernie i cant get it over my hands remember theyre locked together anyway i dont want to hang around up here all night with nothing but a bra between me and the cold cruel wind ernie flung a few more unimaginative epithets at me then lapsed into silence i wished elena would too playing a heroines role for once in her life my aunt grew loquacious she went on as though shot full of pentobarbital talking about her childhood her quarrels with her mother what tonymy fathersaid when he cut all the hair off her dolls when she was eight after a while i thought i might scream at the emotional inconsequential torrent ernie found it so intolerable he demanded i shut her up shes driving me round the bend with that drivel he announced in his own living room this probably got instant results i could picture leann giggling and saying youre so cute ernie but taking her offending friends or children or mother off to the kitchen i wondered what leann and clara would do now shes not doing anything to you ernie listen to her itll take your mind off your troubles i asked elena to repeat a particularly tangled narrative involving my uncle peter a dog and the neighbors flower garden i dont know how much time passed that way when i heard the hoist returning it cant have been long but in the dark surrounded by the wounded and the babbling it felt like hours i persuaded elena to stop talking and move with me behind one of the girders just be quiet auntie they may have come back to shoot us and we dont want to give them any help finding us sure vicki you know what youre doing whatever you say i was never so scared in my life as i was when that boy with the gorgeous eyes picked me up at the liquor store i put a hand over her mouth shut up darling for now you can tell me about it later the hoist groaned to a stop my hands were thick with cold i was having trouble remembering which was the right hand and which the left i counted painfully in my head trying to figure out how many shots were in the clip i tried to subdue the tremor in my right hand so i could make all of them count i waited for the noise of doors opening or feet on concrete when a minute had gone by with no sound i peered around the edge of the pillar i couldnt see the boxlike car inside the frame over the wind in the girders and elenas nervous whispers i strained to hear finally i moved away from her in the dark ignoring her piteous cry to my left i suddenly saw a bobbing point of light i moved toward it cautiously keeping my weight on my back foot with each step until i was certain i hadnt come to some unexpected hole the light flickered again and went out ernie had mentioned a ladder in the stairwell opening this must be cray or some other confederate hoping to climb up and surprise us from behind my eyes were so accustomed to the dark that i saw the stairwell opening loom in front of me as a darker patch in the black night i lay on my stomach and watched until the black changed again a blob crawling up the side to the top when a hand emerged on the deck i smashed the butt of the smith wesson into it with all my strength cray cried out but leaned against the ladder and brought his other hand up and fired the bullet went wide in the night but i slid back away from the opening as he hoisted himself onehanded to the deck i aimed at the dark shape in front of me and fired lying awkwardly as i was the recoil wrenched my right shoulder i fell over but managed to hang on to the gun light shone on me blinding me and i rolled instinctively as he shot somehow i managed to get to my feet and around behind one of the girders cray kept the light on for a moment but realized when i fired again that it made him as much a target as it did me when the light went out i dropped to my knees and elbows and scooted to the next girder i stopped there and listened elena had started talking again in an undertone the sound just audible above the wind you can get the old woman cray ernie called in the thread of a voice shes jabbering away over here you can find her by the babble elena whimpered but couldnt make herself shut up you still there wunsch cray shouted back keep the faithill have you down in no time cray started circling around behind me in the dark i couldnt keep track of where he was i was tired and disoriented and i clung to my girder without trying to figure out his next move suddenly he gave a cry a scream of such panic that my heart thudded violently what happened where are you ernie called out from the middle of the deck i could hear cray screaming his voice muffled coming from a distance he had fallen down the opening for the crane but the safety nets around it had saved him on the scales of justice i have a hard time remembering what remained of the night i managed somehow to climb down the slats connecting the deck to the floor below my arms trembled so violently that i dont know how i made itmore by will than by muscle and i got the hoist up after a painful round of trial and error it wasnt easy to run at the best of times with one hand it was pure bloody hell and i got elena and ernie into the cage and lowered us down to the ground furey was waiting there but hed been joined by some uniformed cops a passing blueandwhite had heard the gunshots and swung over to the site they were keeping furey company until the hoist came down i spent a good chunk of what was left of the night in a lockup at eleventh streeti was in cuffs and furey persuaded the uniformed boys that id resisted arrest furey went off to the hospital to get his knee attended to he had bravely stayed at the construction site in excruciating pain waiting for his pals to come downit was just his bad luck that the patrol car had shown up first i couldnt get the cops who were holding me to understand that another man was on top of the building in the nets around the crane and that he had the key to my handcuffs after a while i gave up trying i didnt say anything at all except to tell them my name when they shut the lockup on me i lay on the floor and went to sleep oblivious to the clamor of the drunks around me they got me up about a couple of hours later i was so sleepy and disoriented i didnt even try to ask where we were goingi assumed it was for early morning court calls instead they hustled me to the third floor to the violent crimes area to the corner office where bobby mallory was sitting behind his desk his eyes were red from lack of sleep but hed shaved and his tie was neatly knotted is there some reason shes still in cuffs bobby asked the men whod escorted me didnt know anything about it they said theyd been told i was dangerous and to leave me locked up well get them off before i make a report to your commander he didnt speak again until theyd found a key that would work on those cuffs when i was free rubbing my sore arms he laced into me with a scorching bitterness he went on and on about me playing at police ruining his best men screwing up his department until nobody knew what he was supposed to be doing i let it wash over me too tired in too much pain too overwhelmed by his fury to try to form a response when hed finally exhausted himself he sat still tears coursing down his ruddy face may i go now i asked in a thread of a voice or am i still facing charges go go the word was a hoarse squawk he covered his face with his right hand and shoved the left in the air as if to drive me from the room the boys here wouldnt listen to me but theres a man named cray trapped at the top of the rapelec building he fell into the nets around the crane i stood up can you tell me where my aunt is leave vicki i cant stand the sound of your voice tonight when i left his office and got to the eleventh street entrance lotty was waiting for me i fell into her arms beyond surprise or question in lottys nest lotty took the day off on thursday to look after me she wouldnt let anyone near me not murray nor the networks not even the federal district attorney good republican appointee that he was he was slobbering at the possibility of bringing down the democratic county chairman with her characteristic flair for detail lotty called my answering service and told them to switch calls for me through to herbut she wouldnt let me take any when i woke up finally around five i remembered mr contreras lotty bundled me into some blankets on the daybed in her living room and insisted i eat some soup before she told me her end of the adventure the shot and our scuffle had brought vinnie and rick york to the hall theyd been busy in the back bedroom or they might have arrived soon enough to help outor maybe to get shot themselves anyway mr contreras had taken the bullet in his shoulder and was able to give rick lottys number hes all right lotty assured me it would take more than a broken shoulder to stop himas soon as we got someone to patch him together he had to be sedated to keep from racing off to hunt for you how did you find me i asked from my nest on the daybed i called lieutenant mallory your tiresome neighbor knew who had shot himi gather he monitors all your male visitors she flashed a wicked grin a fulltime job for him my dean anyway the lieutenant was not at all disposed to intervene but he could scarcely ignore the evidence of a man whod been shot he finally agreed to call me when theyd located you i was afraid he wasnt going to push hard enoughyou had me very frightened my dear she compressed her lips and turned her head away to regain her composure i was damned scared myself i said frankly i just didnt understand how desperate those boys were getting at any rate i had done a difficult delivery for the chief assistant federal prosecutor or whatever her title was so i rang her up and told her what i knew i think she organized some resources to look for you but by then youd surfaced at police headquarters what a loathsome place i tried hard to get in to fetch you my dear but they were quitequite physical in keeping me out i got out of my nest to hug her lotty has an antigen against police stationsthey played too terrifying a role in her early childhoodso it made her effort doubly precious to me i asked her about elena my aunt had been treated for exhaustion and had her broken finger set but the hospital released her around noon after telling me about elena lotty tried to get me to think of other things like the possibility of a vacation she pulled out a giant folder of travel brochurestrips to caribbean islands to the costa bravavarious warm and friendly climates that would make me forget the chicago winter closing in on us on friday lotty finally let the rest of the world loose on me she laid down the law with all her imperial force anyone who wanted to see me had to do so on sheffield avenue unfortunately there were any number of people eager enough to talk to me to meet that condition first in line was alison winstein the deputy prosecutor whose life lotty had saved last year she took me through what i knew and what i surmised like all prosecutors she didnt feel like giving much back but she did let me know that they had obtained warrants for alma and farmworks they had wanted to subpoena the county contract files but boots was a pretty wily fighterneither he nor ralph would turn over records without a pretty good battle after ms winstein left i went through the account of my escapade in the papers murray had put together a pretty strong story without talking to mehed gotten an exclusive with mr contreras and managed to track elena down before the hospital released her i grinned to myself over the interview with my neighbor of all the men i know murray is the one mr contreras likes leastthinks of him as a snothead and a hot dog murray earned his byline on that one when id finished with the papers i called robin bessinger at ajax hed seen the stories and was in a chastened frame of mind im sorry we questioned your judgment vic you were the pro on this one icould we have dinner again i dont know i said slowly ill have to think about that but you could do one thing for mecut a check for saul seligman ill take it over to him in the morning wed kind of like to subrogate against macdonald and meagher robin said be my guest but dont keep the old guy hanging hes had a rough three weeks with his favorite old building going and his chief lieutenant getting murdered i know you can grease those bureaucratic wheels drop it off for me on your way home and ill take it to him tomorrow robin agreed somewhat unwillingly it was perhaps the hope of dinneret ceterawith me that made him agree at all i was going to have to build up my strength and get over a lot of wounds before i was in the humor for much et cetera lotty had gone to beth israel to see her more pressing patients but she came back at lunch to heat some homemade chicken soup for me youre too thin liebchen i want to see those purple circles disappear from your eyes i obediently ate two large helpings and a few slices of toast while i was finishing the toast murray showed up i didnt much feel like talking to him but the sooner i did it the faster it would be behind me and when id done i was glad because he knew what had happened to furey suspended without pay out on bond for felonious assault on me elena and mr contreras theyre never going to prove a case against him with that young girlwhat was her name cerise sergeant mcgonnigal did tell me off the record that theyre missing some heroin theyd copped in a drug raid a month or so ago he also figures the departments going to sit on that one what about boots i asked how do things look for the election next month murray made a face this is chicago sweetheart not minneapolishe got a standing ovation at last nights meeting of the county board and the campaign funds are still coming intoo many of those contractors owe the old guy too much theyre not going to jump ship unless he falls below the waterline has he backed away from roz same storyshes just too popular in the hispanic wards boots lets her go he can kiss the humboldt parklogan square vote goodbye and dont forget theres a sizable mexican population out in the mount prospect areaher support isnt all in the city so why did she bother i burst out why did she care what i did or who i talked to thats what burns me the way people were carrying on i thought she was sitting on bigamy or illegitimate children tucked in an orphanage turns out it was just business as usual in this town im sick to death of it but its so goddamn usual why did she think it would matter murray shrugged his massive shoulders maybe she felt vulnerable first woman boots has backed in a big way first hispanic maybe she was afraid the rules would be different for her you of all people ought to be able to figure that one out yeah maybe suddenly i was very tired so tired that i started drifting off to sleep while murray asked me something about elena i tried to answer coherently but he saw i was struggling you go back to bed kid once more wonder woman saves the city go to sleep he patted me on the shoulder and took off magnanimous because id let him garner so much glory it was late in the afternoon after id slept a while that velma riter dropped in when lotty told me who had come i wanted to dive back under the covers instead i staggered to the living room on woolly legs and braced myself for her onslaught she stood in the middle of the room twisting a copy of the star around and around in her hands quite a story you were digging up she finally said in a voice like dry soil i looked at her warily it doesnt seem to be hurting roz much of course theres still a month till the election i dont know who im madder withroz for doing all this or you for turning on a sister and making it all public i rubbed my face with the heels of my hands i dont have a pat answer for that velma does being a feminist mean you have to support everything your sisters do even if you think theyre abusing you but talk to her in private couldnt you do that she wouldnt let me i tried she just wants those golden apples too bad velma im sure shell do a good job shell be better than most i expect but she isnt enough of a risktaker to try for the apples without getting some worms to help her velma flung up her arms its too much too much for me anyway i should have stayed with photographyits safer i looked at her directly velmayour pictures are honestand they involve a lot of riskemotional risk id think youd want that in a woman you came out in public for well i do and i wont take it to be spun aroundby anyone and especially not by someone like roz trading on old loyalties and asking us to countenancewell worms she didnt do it for the money you know velma said i made an impatient gesture i knowshe did it for her cousin family loyalty wanting hispanics to have a bigger piece of county action just because her motives were so damned wonderful doesnt make me like it any better velma stared at me unblinkingly for a minute well anyone looking at your body knows you take risks warshawski ill give you that i did resign from her staff today sheshe the wide generous mouth crumpled she talked to me so sweet youd think that voice was every mother in the world singing a lullaby that hurt i had to quit i looked at her and nodded without speaking she winked back her tears and left abruptly the birthday party on saturday before i took old mr seligman his check i stopped at a pontiac dealership on western and bought myself a bright red trans am ive never owned a new car before especially not one with twin exhausts and horsepower i didnt know what i was going to do for money to pay for it but when it moved up to fifty with just a whisper of gas it seemed like the car id been waiting for all my life after that i took my time going north and west to norwood park eileen had decided to go ahead with the party for bobby so much planning had gone into it involving so much of the neighborhood that she didnt feel she could turn it off now the people on either side were lending their yards so thered be a place for a refreshment tent and for some pipers id called eileen to tell her i wasnt up to seeing bobby but shed begged me to come vicki try to understand michael is his godson he was like a seventh child to bobby and his great hope in the department he was only yelling at you out of his hurt for michael it doesnt work for me eileen michael wanted to kill me and he damned near did it by the time bobby finished with me i felt he wished it had happened no no dont ever think such a thing her warm rich voice cracked in distress tonys child gabriellas it was himself he wanted to attack for letting himself be so betrayed hebobbys a good man vicki a good cop too you know that tony would never have taken him up if he wasnt buthes not good at thinking through these things figuring out why he lashed out at you the way he did he has other strengths but not that one im asking youbegging youto understand and be better than him it would mean so much not just to him but to me so if you cant do it for him will you do it for me and so i found myself ducking under a billboard of boots meagher at the corner of naglea smiling yearround fixture proclaiming that boots is chicagoand crossing into bobbys neighborhood bobbys neighborhood michaels neighborhood where my father and uncles and aunt elena grew up where boots and ernie and ron came from where they all grew up together and helped each other out because the one thing you must never forget in chicago is to look out for your own usually when i cross the invisible line into norwood park i feel as though ive gone into munchkin land a place of tidy tiny bungalows on minuscule welltended lots its a mirage of a neighborhoodit seems to have nothing to do with the sprawling graffitiladen garbageridden city to the southeast today though it seemed dead the october air was gray and the houses looked drab and colorless even the bursts of fall flowers in the tidy yards seemed drained of vividness the bronze mums looking brown the gold ones merely sickly i wished i was anywhere in the world but here i pulled my new toy into a line with other cars blocking the street no one would be out ticketing today i dragged myself slowly up the short drive laughter and the sound of bagpipes were coming from the back a few knots of people had spilled over into the front yard they smiled and waved at me in the happy camaraderie of a big party and i dutifully waved back when i got to the back the crowd was packed into every inch of turf not just in eileens yard by the two adjacent a canopy with bobbys name done up in lights stood in the middle i couldnt see the pipes or anyone i knew i stood awkwardly on the fringe until eileen suddenly came from nowhere and pulled me to her large soft breasts oh vicki oh its so good to see you thank you so much for coming i was afraid anyway bobbys over here hell be so pleasedhe hasnt saidbut you know tears sparkled on her long black lashes she took my hand and made her way through the throng to the densest part where bobby stood beyond him a piper was playing and the crowd was urging bobby to dance eileen waited until the howl of the reel had ended before thrusting me forward bobby look whos come when bobby saw me the smile died from his face he looked at me with some combination of embarrassment and rigidness you guys gotta excuse me he said abruptly to the group around him i need to see this young lady for a few minutes he took me into the house a slow procession through the jam of happy neighbors fellow copsi even saw officer neely looking flushed and relaxed in a bright fuchsia dressand screaming grandchildren inside the house two of bobbys daughters were constructing a giant cake they squealed when they saw him daddy you know youre not supposed to come in here its okay girlsi aint seen nothin im just going down to the family room with vicki for a few minutes you keep everyone out okay sure daddy but go on before you see something they shooed us down the steps bobby had finished the basement himself installing a bathroom real floors and walls building in bunk beds for his two sons when thered been six children in seven rooms upstairs only two of their daughters were still at home but hed left the beds for his grandchildren to sleep inhe loved having them stay over he turned on a lamp and sat on the red plaid couch next to the bunk beds i sat in the shabby armchair facing him next to the fake fireplace he moved his big hands uncomfortably trying to think of something to say i didnt help him i didnt expect to see you here he said at last i didnt want to come eileen talked me into it he looked at the floor and muttered i said a lot of things i shouldnt have last week im sorry you hurt my feelings bobby i couldnt keep my voice from cracking your golden boy damned near killed me and you talked to me like i was some kind of street scum he rubbed his face ivicki i talked to eileen about it she tried to make sense out of it for me i dont know why i did it thats gods truth dr herschel called me thats how i knew you were in trouble you know about that part dont you i nodded without speaking i knew by then it was mickey well youd tried to tell me but it wasnt until she told me hed shot the old man that idont look at me like that vicki youre making it hard to say this and its hard enough to start with i turned my head toward the cowboy coverlets on the bunk beds i called john and the finch they werent as upset as i wasthey knew mickeyd been acting queer since the day before when you brought that damned bracelet of his in and theyd wondered about some other things of course theyd never told mei was the lieutenant and he was my fairhaired boy he gave a harsh laugh what was the story with the bracelet why did it send him into orbit i explained i tried to tell you wednesday i didnt know what it wasi dont think hed worn it around me more than once or twice he thoughtyou know as long as elena was alive she could link it to him well not just that she could tie him to the fire at the indiana arms he was the person too who knocked us both out and tried to burn us at the other place i started shivering as the memories hit me i tried to push them aside but i couldnt bobby grunted and stood up to reach for one of the cowboy coverlets he tossed it to me and i wrapped myself in it after a bit my shivering stopped but both of us sat lost in our own reveries at least my last visitor yesterday was benignzerlina again taking three buses wanted to know how her daughter came to die she shared a coke and more of lottys chicken soup and wept with me she shook her head in amazement when she learned elena had saved my life thought shed pickled her brain too good years ago to come up with something like that but the lord provides when you least expect it as if following my thoughts bobby asked abruptly about my aunt its like it all never happened i stopped by the windsor armsthe hotel where shes living nowlast night she was out front with a bottle and a crowd of greasy old men showing her little finger in a splint and bragging over her heroics some people even a whirlwind wont change i guess i laughed mirthlessly bobby nodded a couple of times to himself i want you to understand something vicki try to anyway tony your daddy took me under his wing when i joined the force he must have been a good thirteen fourteen years older than me a lot of guys were coming back from the war then they didnt make it easy on us rookies tony looked out for me from day one i thought i could do the same for mickey and it hurts me hurts my pride eileen tells me it is that i could be so wrong i keep thinking to myself what would tony think he saw me making such a colossal mistake he didnt seem to want an answer but i gave him one anyway you know what hed say bobby that anyone can make a mess but only a fool wallows in it bobby smiled painfully yeah well maybe yeah probably but heres what you gotta understand vicki i thought the best thing i could do to pay tony back for all he did for me was look out for you i never could understand the way tony and gabriella brought you up not making you mind the way my own girls did and you just didnt seem like a real girl to me the things you wanted and wanted to do im not even sure i like you all that well i just thought i owed it to tony to look after you i thought hed finished but he only stopped to crack his knuckles get himself over the hump so youre not like other girls eileeneileen never minded a minute she always loved you like you were her own daughter but i just couldnt deal with it and then when you exposed mickeyhe was like my son and you were like an alien monster but if hed had your guts and your honesty hed never of gone along with those buddies of his to begin with never dug himself that kind of hole so ive had to think about it think about you i mean start from the beginning i love my girls i dont want them any different from how they are but youre the daughter of the two people i loved best next to eileen and you cant do things different than you do shouldnt do them different not with gabriella and tony bringing you up do you understand the door at the top of the stairs opened and bobbys daughter marianna called down daddy people are waiting for you be up in a jiffy sugar he yelled back dont let them start without me he got up okay is that enough i stood up too yeah i think thats enough i fished in my pocket and handed him a small parcel i brought that along for you just in case you knowjust in case i felt like giving you a present he undid the paper and opened the little box when he looked inside and saw tonys shield lying in the cotton he didnt say anything but for the second time that week i saw him cry sara paretsky
