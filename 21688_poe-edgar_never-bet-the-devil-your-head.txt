never bet the devil your head by edgar allan poe con tal que las costumbres de un autor says don thomas de las torres in the preface to his amatory poems sean puras y castas importa muy poco que no sean igualmente severas sus obrasmeaning in plain english that provided the morals of an author are pure personally it signifies nothing what are the morals of his books we presume that don thomas is now in purgatory for the assertion it would be a clever thing too in the way of poetical justice to keep him there until his amatory poems get out of print or are laid definitely upon the shelf through lack of readers every fiction should have a moral and what is more to the purpose the critics have discovered that every fiction has philip melanchthon some time ago wrote a commentary upon the batrachomyomachia and proved that the poets object was to excite a distaste for sedition pierre la seine going a step farther shows that the intention was to recommend to young men temperance in eating and drinking just so too jacobus hugo has satisfied himself that by euenis homer meant to insinuate john calvin by antinous martin luther by the lotophagi protestants in general and by the harpies the dutch our more modern scholiasts are equally acute these fellows demonstrate a hidden meaning in the antediluvians a parable in powhatan new views in cock robin and transcendentalism in hop o my thumb in short it has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound design thus to authors in general much trouble is spared a novelist for example need have no care of his moral it is therethat is to say it is somewhereand the moral and the critics can take care of themselves when the proper time arrives all that the gentleman intended and all that he did not intend will be brought to light in the dial or the downeaster together with all that he ought to have intended and the rest that he clearly meant to intendso that it will all come very straight in the end there is no just ground therefore for the charge brought against me by certain ignoramusesthat i have never written a moral tale or in more precise words a tale with a moral they are not the critics predestined to bring me out and develop my moralsthat is the secret by and by the north american quarterly humdrum will make them ashamed of their stupidity in the meantime by way of staying executionby way of mitigating the accusations against mei offer the sad history appendeda history about whose obvious moral there can be no question whatever since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form the title of the tale i should have credit for this arrangementa far wiser one than that of la fontaine and others who reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment and thus sneak it in at the fag end of their fables defuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables and de mortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunctioneven if the dead in question be nothing but dead small beer it is not my design therefore to vituperate my deceased friend toby dammit he was a sad dog it is true and a dogs death it was that he died but he himself was not to blame for his vices they grew out of a personal defect in his mother she did her best in the way of flogging him while an infantfor duties to her wellregulated mind were always pleasures and babies like tough steaks or the modern greek olive trees are invariably the better for beatingbut poor woman she had the misfortune to be lefthanded and a child flogged lefthandedly had better be left unflogged the world revolves from right to left it will not do to whip a baby from left to right if each blow in the proper direction drives an evil propensity out it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks its quota of wickedness in i was often present at tobys chastisements and even by the way in which he kicked i could perceive that he was getting worse and worse every day at last i saw through the tears in my eyes that there was no hope of the villain at all and one day when he had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have mistaken him for a little african and no effect had been produced beyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit i could stand it no longer but went down upon my knees forthwith and uplifting my voice made prophecy of his ruin the fact is that his precocity in vice was awful at five months of age he used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate at six months i caught him gnawing a pack of cards at seven months he was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies at eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the temperance pledge thus he went on increasing in iniquity month after month until at the close of the first year he not only insisted upon wearing moustaches but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing and for backing his assertions by bets through this latter most ungentlemanly practice the ruin which i had predicted to toby dammit overtook him at last the fashion had grown with his growth and strengthened with his strength so that when he came to be a man he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with a proposition to gamble not that he actually laid wagersno i will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs with him the thing was a mere formula nothing more his expressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever they were simple if not altogether innocent expletivesimaginative phrases wherewith to round off a sentence when he said ill bet you so and so nobody ever thought of taking him up but still i could not help thinking it my duty to put him down the habit was an immoral one and so i told him it was a vulgar onethis i begged him to believe it was discountenanced by societyhere i said nothing but the truth it was forbidden by act of congresshere i had not the slightest intention of telling a lie i remonstratedbut to no purpose i demonstratedin vain i entreatedhe smiled i imploredhe laughed i preachedhe sneered i threatenedhe swore i kicked himhe called for the police i pulled his nosehe blew it and offered to bet the devil his head that i would not venture to try that experiment again poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of dammits mother had entailed upon her son he was detestably poor and this was the reason no doubt that his expletive expressions about betting seldom took a pecuniary turn i will not be bound to say that i ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as ill bet you a dollar it was usually ill bet you what you please or ill bet you what you dare or ill bet you a trifle or else more significantly still ill bet the devil my head this latter form seemed to please him bestperhaps because it involved the least risk for dammit had become excessively parsimonious had any one taken him up his head was small and thus his loss would have been small too but these are my own reflections and i am by no means sure that i am right in attributing them to him at all events the phrase in question grew daily in favor notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a man betting his brains like banknotesbut this was a point which my friends perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend in the end he abandoned all other forms of wager and gave himself up to ill bet the devil my head with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me i am always displeased by circumstances for which i cannot account mysteries force a man to think and so injure his health the truth is there was something in the air with which mr dammit was wont to give utterance to his offensive expressionsomething in his manner of enunciationwhich at first interested and afterwards made me very uneasysomething which for want of a more definite term at present i must be permitted to call queer but which mr coleridge would have called mystical mr kant pantheistical mr carlyle twistical and mr emerson hyperquizzitistical i began not to like it at all mr dammits soul was in a perilous state i resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it i vowed to serve him as st patrick in the irish chronicle is said to have served the toad that is to say awaken him to a sense of his situation i addressed myself to the task forthwith once more i betook myself to remonstrance again i collected my energies for a final attempt at expostulation when i had made an end of my lecture mr dammit indulged himself in some very equivocal behavior for some moments he remained silent merely looking me inquisitively in the face but presently he threw his head to one side and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent then he spread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders then he winked with the right eye then he repeated the operation with the left then he shut them both up very tight then he opened them both so very wide that i became seriously alarmed for the consequences then applying his thumb to his nose he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of his fingers finally setting his arms akimbo he condescended to reply i can call to mind only the beads of his discourse he would be obliged to me if i would hold my tongue he wished none of my advice he despised all my insinuations he was old enough to take care of himself did i still think him baby dammit did i mean to say any thing against his character did i intend to insult him was i a fool was my maternal parent aware in a word of my absence from the domiciliary residence he would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity and he would bind himself to abide by my reply once more he would demand explicitly if my mother knew that i was out my confusion he said betrayed me and he would be willing to bet the devil his head that she did not mr dammit did not pause for my rejoinder turning upon his heel he left my presence with undignified precipitation it was well for him that he did so my feelings had been wounded even my anger had been aroused for once i would have taken him up upon his insulting wager i would have won for the archenemy mr dammits little head for the fact is my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home but khoda shefa midehedheaven gives reliefas the mussulmans say when you tread upon their toes it was in pursuance of my duty that i had been insulted and i bore the insult like a man it now seemed to me however that i had done all that could be required of me in the case of this miserable individual and i resolved to trouble him no longer with my counsel but to leave him to his conscience and himself but although i forebore to intrude with my advice i could not bring myself to give up his society altogether i even went so far as to humor some of his less reprehensible propensities and there were times when i found myself lauding his wicked jokes as epicures do mustard with tears in my eyesso profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk one fine day having strolled out together arm in arm our route led us in the direction of a river there was a bridge and we resolved to cross it it was roofed over by way of protection from the weather and the archway having but few windows was thus very uncomfortably dark as we entered the passage the contrast between the external glare and the interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits not so upon those of the unhappy dammit who offered to bet the devil his head that i was hipped he seemed to be in an unusual good humor he was excessively livelyso much so that i entertained i know not what of uneasy suspicion it is not impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals i am not well enough versed however in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with decision upon the point and unhappily there were none of my friends of the dial present i suggest the idea nevertheless because of a certain species of austere merryandrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend and caused him to make quite a tomfool of himself nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came in his way now shouting out and now lisping out all manner of odd little and big words yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the time i really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him at length having passed nearly across the bridge we approached the termination of the footway when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height through this i made my way quietly pushing it around as usual but this turn would not serve the turn of mr dammit he insisted upon leaping the stile and said he could cut a pigeonwing over it in the air now this conscientiously speaking i did not think he could do the best pigeonwinger over all kinds of style was my friend mr carlyle and as i knew he could not do it i would not believe that it could be done by toby dammit i therefore told him in so many words that he was a braggadocio and could not do what he said for this i had reason to be sorry afterwardfor he straightway offered to bet the devil his head that he could i was about to reply notwithstanding my previous resolutions with some remonstrance against his impiety when i heard close at my elbow a slight cough which sounded very much like the ejaculation ahem i started and looked about me in surprise my glance at length fell into a nook of the framework of the bridge and upon the figure of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect nothing could be more reverend than his whole appearance for he not only had on a full suit of black but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down over a white cravat while his hair was parted in front like a girls his hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach and his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head upon observing him more closely i perceived that he wore a black silk apron over his smallclothes and this was a thing which i thought very odd before i had time to make any remark however upon so singular a circumstance he interrupted me with a second ahem to this observation i was not immediately prepared to reply the fact is remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable i have known a quarterly review nonplussed by the word fudge i am not ashamed to say therefore that i turned to mr dammit for assistance dammit said i what are you about dont you hearthe gentleman says ahem i looked sternly at my friend while i thus addressed him for to say the truth i felt particularly puzzled and when a man is particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage or else he is pretty sure to look like a fool dammit observed ialthough this sounded very much like an oath than which nothing was further from my thoughtsdammit i suggestedthe gentleman says ahem i do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity i did not think it profound myself but i have noticed that the effect of our speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own eyes and if i had shot mr d through and through with a paixhan bomb or knocked him in the head with the poets and poetry of america he could hardly have been more discomfited than when i addressed him with those simple words dammit what are you about dont you hearthe gentleman says ahem you dont say so gasped he at length after turning more colors than a pirate runs up one after the other when chased by a manofwar are you quite sure he said that well at all events i am in for it now and may as well put a bold face upon the matter here goes thenahem at this the little old gentleman seemed pleasedgod only knows why he left his station at the nook of the bridge limped forward with a gracious air took dammit by the hand and shook it cordially looking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine i am quite sure you will win it dammit said he with the frankest of all smiles but we are obliged to have a trial you know for the sake of mere form ahem replied my friend taking off his coat with a deep sigh tying a pockethandkerchief around his waist and producing an unaccountable alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down the corners of his mouthahem and ahem said he again after a pause and not another word more than ahem did i ever know him to say after that aha thought i without expressing myself aloudthis is quite a remarkable silence on the part of toby dammit and is no doubt a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion one extreme induces another i wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when i gave him my last lecture at all events he is cured of the transcendentals ahem here replied toby just as if he had been reading my thoughts and looking like a very old sheep in a revery the old gentleman now took him by the arm and led him more into the shade of the bridgea few paces back from the turnstile my good fellow said he i make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run wait here till i take my place by the stile so that i may see whether you go over it handsomely and transcendentally and dont omit any flourishes of the pigeonwing a mere form you know i will say one two three and away mind you start at the word away here he took his position by the stile paused a moment as if in profound reflection then looked up and i thought smiled very slightly then tightened the strings of his apron then took a long look at dammit and finally gave the word as agreed upon onetwothreeandaway punctually at the word away my poor friend set off in a strong gallop the stile was not very high like mr lordsnor yet very low like that of mr lords reviewers but upon the whole i made sure that he would clear it and then what if he did notah that was the questionwhat if he did not what right said i had the old gentleman to make any other gentleman jump the little old dotandcarryone who is he if he asks me to jump i wont do it thats flat and i dont care who the devil he is the bridge as i say was arched and covered in in a very ridiculous manner and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all timesan echo which i never before so particularly observed as when i uttered the four last words of my remark but what i said or what i thought or what i heard occupied only an instant in less than five seconds from his starting my poor toby had taken the leap i saw him run nimbly and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up i saw him high in the air pigeonwinging it to admiration just over the top of the stile and of course i thought it an unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over but the whole leap was the affair of a moment and before i had a chance to make any profound reflections down came mr dammit on the flat of his back on the same side of the stile from which he had started at the same instant i saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed having caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile at all this i was much astonished but i had no leisure to think for dammit lay particularly still and i concluded that his feelings had been hurt and that he stood in need of my assistance i hurried up to him and found that he had received what might be termed a serious injury the truth is he had been deprived of his head which after a close search i could not find anywhere so i determined to take him home and send for the homoeopathists in the meantime a thought struck me and i threw open an adjacent window of the bridge when the sad truth flashed upon me at once about five feet just above the top of the turnstile and crossing the arch of the footpath so as to constitute a brace there extended a flat iron bar lying with its breadth horizontally and forming one of a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent with the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact he did not long survive his terrible loss the homoeopathists did not give him little enough physic and what little they did give him he hesitated to take so in the end he grew worse and at length died a lesson to all riotous livers i bedewed his grave with my tears worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon and for the general expenses of his funeral sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists the scoundrels refused to pay it so i had mr dammit dug up at once and sold him for dogs meat
