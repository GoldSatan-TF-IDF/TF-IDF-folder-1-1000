paper money ken follett introduction this book was written in immediately before eye of the needle and i think it is the best of my unsuccessful books it was published under the pseudonym zachary stone as was the modigliani scandal because the books are similar they lack a central character but feature several groups of characters whose stories are linked and share a common climax in paper money the links are less fortuitous for the book is supposed to show how crime high finance and journalism are corruptly interconnected the ending is rather somber by comparison with the modigliani scandalin fact it is almost a tragedy however it is the differences and similarities between paper money and eye of the needle that are most instructive readers who want the cake not the recipe should skip this and go straight to chapter the plot of paper money is the cleverest i have ever devised and the small sales of the book convinced me that clever plots satisfy authors more than readers the plot of eye of the needle is of course very simplein fact it can be written down in three paragraphs as indeed i did write it when i first thought of it eye of the needle has only three or four main characters whereas paper money has a dozen or so yet with its complex plot and large cast paper money is only half the length of eye of the needle as a writer i have always had to struggle against a tendency to underwrite and in paper money you see me struggling in vain consequently the many characters are painted in brisk bold brushstrokes and the book lacks the feeling of detailed personal involvement with the private lives of the characters that readers demand of a bestseller one of the strengths of the book is its form the action takes place during a single day in the life of a london evening newspaper i worked for such a newspaper in and and each chapter chronicles one hour of that day in three or four scenes describing both what happens at the news desk and what happens in the stories the paper is covering or missing eye of the needle has an even more rigid structure although nobody to my knowledge has ever noticed it there are six parts each with six chapters except for the last part which has seven the first chapter in each part dealing with the spy the second with the spy catchers and so on until the sixth which always tells of the international military consequences of what has gone before readers do not notice such thingsand why should theybut still i suspect that regularity and even symmetry contribute to what they perceive as a welltold story the other feature paper money shares with eye of the needle is a wealth of good minor characterstarts thieves halfwitted children workingclass wives and lonely old men in subsequent books i have not done this for it only diverts from the main characters and their story yet i often wonder whether i am being too clever today i am not as sure as i was in of the links between crime high finance and journalism but i think this book is true to life in another way it presents a detailed picture of the london that i knew in the seventies with its policemen and crooks bankers and call girls reporters and politicians its shops and slums its roads and its river i loved it and i hope you will too six am it was the luckiest night of tim fitzpetersons life he thought this the moment he opened his eyes and saw the girl in bed beside him still sleeping he did not move for fear of waking her but he looked at her almost furtively in the cold light of the london dawn she slept flat on her back with the absolute relaxation of small children tim was reminded of his own adrienne when she was little he put the unwelcome thought out of his mind the girl beside him had red hair fitting her small head like a cap showing her tiny ears all her features were small nose chin cheekbones dainty teeth once in the night he had covered her face with his broad clumsy hands pressing his fingers gently into the hollows of her eyes and her cheeks opening her soft lips with his thumbs as if his skin could feel her beauty like the heat from a fire her left arm lay limply outside the coverlet which was pushed down to reveal narrow delicate shoulders and one shallow breast its nipple soft in slumber they lay apart not quite touching although he could feel the warmth of her thigh close to his he looked away from her up at the ceiling and for a moment he let the sheer joy of remembered fornication wash over him like a physical thrill then he got up he stood beside the bed and looked back at her she was undisturbed the candid morning light made her no less lovely despite tousled hair and the untidy remains of what had been elaborate makeup daybreak was less kind to tim fitzpeterson he knew that was why he tried not to wake her he wanted to look in a mirror before she saw him he went naked padding across the dull green livingroom carpet to the bathroom in the space of a few moments he saw the place as if for the first time and found it hopelessly unexciting the carpet was matched by an even duller green sofa with fading flowered cushions there were a plain wooden desk of the kind to be found in a million offices an elderly blackandwhite television set a filing cabinet and a bookshelf of legal and economic textbooks plus several volumes of hansard he had once thought it so dashing to have a london piedaterre the bathroom had a fulllength mirrorbought not by tim but by his wife in the days before she had totally retired from town life he looked in it while he waited for the bath to fill wondering what there was about this middleaged body that could drive a beautiful girl ofwhat twentyfiveinto a frenzy of lust he was healthy but not fit not in the sense with which that word is used to describe men who do exercises and visit gymnasia he was short and his naturally broad frame was thickened by a little superfluous fat particularly on the chest waist and buttocks his physique was okay for a man of fortyone but it was nothing to excite even the most physical of women the mirror became obscured by steam and tim got into the bath he rested his head and closed his eyes it occurred to him that he had had less than two hours of sleep yet he felt quite fresh his upbringing would have him believe that pain and discomfort if not actual illness were the consequences of late nights dancing adultery and strong drink all those sins together ought to bring down the wrath of god no the wages of sin were sheer delight he began to soap himself languidly it had started at one of those appalling dinners grapefruit cocktail overdone steak and bombe no surprise for three hundred members of a useless organization tims speech had been just another exposition of the governments current strategy emotionally weighted to appeal to the particular sympathies of the audience afterwards he had agreed to go somewhere else for a drink with one of his colleaguesa brilliant young economistand two faintly interesting people from the audience the venue turned out to be a nightclub which would normally have been beyond tims means but someone else had paid the entrance once inside he began to enjoy himself so much so that he bought a bottle of champagne with his credit card more people had joined their group a film company executive tim had vaguely heard of a playwright he hadnt a leftwing economist who shook hands with a wry smile and avoided shoptalk and the girls the champagne and the floor show inflamed him slightly in the old days he would at this point have taken julia home and made love to her roughlyshe liked that just occasionally but now she no longer came to town and he no longer went to nightclubs not normally the girls had not been introduced tim started to talk to the nearest a flatchested redhead in a long dress of some pale color she looked like a model and said she was an actress he expected that he would find her boring and that she would reciprocate that was when he got the first intimation that tonight would be special she seemed to find him fascinating their close conversation gradually isolated them from the rest of the party until someone suggested another club tim immediately said he would go home the redhead caught his arm and asked him not to and tim who was being gallant to a beautiful woman for the first time in twenty years instantly agreed to go along he wondered as he got out of the bath what they had talked about for so long the work of a junior minister in the department of energy was hardly cocktailparty conversation when it was not technical it was highly confidential perhaps they had discussed politics had he told wry anecdotes about senior politicians in the deadpan tone which was his only way of being humorous he could not remember all he could recall was the way she had sat with every part of her body angled devotedly toward him head shoulders knees feeta physical attitude that was at once intimate and teasing he wiped steam off the shaving mirror and rubbed his chin speculatively sizing up the task he had very dark hair and his beard if he were to grow it would be thick the rest of his face was to say the least ordinary the chin was receding the nose sharply pointed with twin white marks either side of the bridge where spectacles had rested for thirtyfive years the mouth not small but a little grim the ears too large the forehead intellectually high no character could be read there it was a face trained to conceal thoughts instead of displaying emotion he switched on the shaver and grimaced to bring all of his left cheek into view he was not even ugly some girls had a thing about ugly men he had heardhe was in no position to verify such generalizations about womenbut tim fitzpeterson did not even fit into that dubiously fortunate category but perhaps it was time to think again about the categories he fitted into the second club they had visited had been the kind of place he would never knowingly have entered he was no music lover and if he had liked it his taste would not have included the blaring insistent row which drowned conversation in the black hole nevertheless he had danced to itthe jerky exhibitionist dancing that seemed to be de rigueur there he enjoyed it and thought he acquitted himself well enough there were no amused glances from the other patrons as he feared there might be perhaps that was because many of them were his age the disc jockey a bearded young man in a tshirt improbably printed with the words harvard business school capriciously played a slow ballad sung by an american with a heavy cold they were on the small dance floor at the time the girl came close to him and wound her arms around him then he knew she meant it and he had to decide whether he was equally serious with her hot lithe body clinging to him as closely as a wet towel he made up his mind very quickly he bent his headshe was slightly shorter than heand murmured into her ear come and have a drink at my flat he kissed her in the taxithere was something he had not done for many years the kiss was so luscious like a kiss in a dream that he touched her breasts wonderfully small and hard under the loose gown and after that they found it difficult to restrain themselves until they reached home the token drink was forgotten we must have got into bed in less than a minute tim thought smugly he finished shaving and looked around for cologne there was an old bottle in the wall cabinet he went back to the bedroom she was still asleep he found his dressing gown and cigarettes and sat in the upright chair by the window i was pretty terrific in bed he thought he knew he was kidding himself she had been the activist the creative one on her initiative they had done things which tim could not suggest to julia after fifteen years in the same bed yes julia he gazed unseeing from the firstfloor window across the narrow street to the redbrick victorian school its meager playground painted with the fading yellow lines of a netball court he still felt the same about julia if he had loved her before he loved her now this girl was different but wasnt that what fools always told themselves before embarking on an affair lets not be hasty he told himself for her this might be a onenight stand he could not assume she would want to see him again yet he wanted to decide where his aims lay before asking her what the options were government had taught him to brief himself before meetings he had a formula for the approach to complex issues first what have i got to lose julia again plump intelligent contented her horizons contracting inexorably with every year of motherhood there had been a time when he lived for her he bought the clothes she liked he read novels because she was interested in novels and his political successes pleased him all the more because they pleased her but the center of gravity of his life had shifted now julia held sway only over trivia she wanted to live in hampshire and it did not matter to him so they lived there she wanted him to wear check jackets but westminster chic demanded sober suits so he wore dark faintly patterned grays and navy blues when he analyzed his feelings he found there was not a lot to tie him to julia a little sentiment perhapsa nostalgic picture of her with her hair in a ponytail doing the jive in a tapered skirt was that love or something he doubted it the girls that was something else katie penny and adrienne only katie was old enough to understand love and marriage they did not see much of him but he took the view that a little fatherlove goes a long way and is a great deal better than no father at all there was no room for debate there his opinion was fixed and there was his career a divorce might not harm a junior minister but it could ruin a man higher up there had never been a divorced prime minister tim fitzpeterson wanted that job so there was a lot to losein fact all he held dear he turned his gaze from the window to the bed the girl had rolled onto her side facing away she was right to have her hair shortit emphasized the slender neck and pretty shoulders her back tapered sharply to a small waist then disappeared beneath a crumpled sheet her skin was faintly tanned there was so much to gain joy was a word tim had little use for but it entered his thoughts now if he had known joy before he could not remember when satisfaction yes in the writing of a sound comprehensive report in the winning of one of those countless small battles in committees and in the house of commons in a book that was correct or a wine that was right but the savagely chemical pleasure he had with this girl was new there those were the pros and cons the formula said now add them up and see which is greater but this time the formula would not work tim had acquaintances who said it never did perhaps they were right it might be a mistake to think that reasons could be counted like pound notes he was reminded curiously of a phrase from a college philosophy lecture the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language which is longeran airplane or a oneact play which do i prefersatisfaction or joy his thinking was getting woolly he made a disgusted noise then looked quickly at the bed to see whether he had disturbed her she slept on good out in the street a gray rollsroyce pulled up at the curb a hundred yards away nobody got out tim looked more closely and saw the driver open a newspaper a chauffeur perhaps picking someone up at six thirty a businessman who had traveled overnight and arrived too early tim could not read the license plate but he could see that the driver was a big man big enough to make the interior of the car seem as cramped as a mini he turned his mind back to his dilemma what do we do in politics he thought when we face two forceful but conflicting demands the answer came immediately we choose a course of action which really or apparently meets both needs the parallel was obvious he would stay married to julia and have an affair with this girl it seemed a very political solution and it pleased him he lit another cigarette and thought about the future it was a pleasant pastime there would be many more nights here at the flat the occasional weekend in a small hotel in the country perhaps even a fortnight in the sun on some discreet little beach in north africa or the west indies she would be sensational in a bikini other hopes paled beside these he was tempted by the thought that his early life had been wasted but he knew the idea to be extravagant not wasted then but it was as if he had spent his youth working out longdivision sums and never discovered differential calculus he decided to talk to her about the problem and his solution she would say it could not be done and he would tell her that making compromises work was his special talent how should he begin darling i want to do this again often that seemed all right what would she say so would i or call me at this number or sorry timmy im a onenight girl no not thatit wasnt possible last night had been good for her too he was special for her she had said so he stood up and put out his cigarette ill go over to the bed he thought and ill pull the blankets off her gently and look at her nakedness for a few moments then ill lie beside her and kiss her belly and her thighs and her breasts until she wakes and then ill make love to her again he looked away from her and out of the window savoring the anticipation the rolls was still there like a gray slug in the gutter for some reason it bothered him he put it out of his mind and went over to wake the girl felix laski did not have much money despite the fact that he was very rich his wealth took the form of shares land buildings and occasionally more nebulous assets like half a film script or one third of an invention for making instant potato chips newspapers were fond of saying that if all his riches were turned into cash he would have so many millions of pounds and laski was equally fond of pointing out that to turn his riches into cash would be close to impossible he walked from waterloo railway station to the city because he believed that laziness caused heart attacks in men of his age this concern with his health was foolish for he was as fit a fiftyyearold as could be found within the square mile just short of six feet tall with a chest like the stern of a battleship he was about as vulnerable to cardiac arrest as a young ox he cut a striking figure walking across blackfriars bridge in the brittle sunshine of the early morning his clothes were expensive from the blue silk shirt to the handmade shoes by city standards he was a dandy this was because every man in the village where laski had been born wore cotton dungarees and a cloth cap now good clothes gave him a buzz by reminding him of what he had left behind the clothes were part of his image which was that of a buccaneer his deals usually involved risk or opportunism or both and he took care that from the outside they looked sharper than they were a reputation for having the magic touch was worth more than a merchant bank it was the image that had seduced peters laski thought about peters as he walked briskly past st pauls cathedral toward their rendezvous a small narrowminded man his expertise was in the movement of cash not credit but physical funds paper money he worked for the bank of england the ultimate source of legal tender his job was to arrange for the creation and destruction of notes and coins he did not make policythat was done at a higher level perhaps in the cabinetbut he knew how many fivers barclays bank needed before they did laski had first met him at the cocktailparty opening of an office block built by a discount house laski went to such affairs for no reason other than to meet people like peters who might one day come in useful five years later peters became useful laski phoned him at the bank and asked him to recommend a numismatist to advise on a fictitious purchase of old coins peters announced that he was a collector in a small way and that he would look at them himself if laski wished splendid laski said and rushed out to get the coins peters advised him to buy suddenly they were friends the purchase became the foundation of a collection which was now worth double what laski had paid for it that was incidental to his purpose but he was inordinately proud of it it turned out that peters was an early riser partly because he liked it but also because money was moved around in the mornings and so the bulk of his work needed to be done before nine oclock laski learned that it was peterss custom to drink coffee in a particular cafe at around six thirty each day and he began to join him at first occasionally and then regularly laski pretended to be an early riser himself and joined in peterss praise of the quiet streets and the crisp morning air in truth he liked to get up late but he was prepared to make a lot of sacrifices if there was half a chance of this farfetched scheme coming off he turned in to the cafe breathing hard at his age even a fit man was entitled to blow after a long walk the place smelled of coffee and fresh bread the walls were hung with plastic tomatoes and watercolors of the proprietors hometown in italy behind the counter a woman in overalls and a longhaired youth were making mountains of sandwiches ready for the hundreds of people who would snatch a bite at their desks this lunchtime a radio was on somewhere but it was not loud peters was already there at a window seat laski bought coffee and a leberwurst sandwich and sat down opposite peters who was eating doughnutshe seemed to be one of those people who never put on weight laski said its going to be a fine day his voice was deep and resonant like an actors with just a trace of some east european accent peters said beautiful and i shall be in my garden by four thirty laski sipped coffee and looked at the other man peters had very short hair and a small mustache and his face looked pinched he had not yet started work and he was already looking forward to going home laski thought that tragic he felt a momentary pang of compassion for peters and all other little men for whom work was a means instead of an end i like my work peters said as if reading laskis mind laski covered his surprise but you like your garden better in this weather yes do you have a garden felix my housekeeper tends the window boxes im not a man of hobbies laski reflected on peterss hesitant use of his christian name the man was slightly awestruck he decided good no time i suppose you must work very hard so people tell me its just that i prefer to spend the hours between six pm and midnight making fifty thousand dollars than watching actors pretend to kill each other on television peters laughed the most imaginative brain in the city turns out to have no imagination i dont follow that you dont read novels or go to the cinema either do you no you see youve got a blind spotyou cant empathize with fiction its true of many of the most enterprising businessmen the incapacity seems to go with heightened acumen like a blind mans hypersensitive hearing laski frowned being analyzed put him at a disadvantage maybe he said peters seemed to sense his discomfort im fascinated by the careers of great entrepreneurs he said so am i laski said im all in favor of pinching other peoples brain waves what was your first coup felix laski relaxed this was more familiar territory i suppose it was woolwich chemicals he said that was a small pharmaceuticals manufacturer after the war they set up a small chain of high street chemists shops with the object of guaranteeing their markets the trouble was they knew all about chemistry and nothing about retailing and the shops ate up most of the profits made by the factory i was working for a stockbroker at the time and id made a little money playing the market i went to my boss and offered him a halfshare in the profits if he would finance the deal we bought the company and immediately sold the factory to ici for almost as much as we paid for the shares then we closed the shops and sold them one by onethey were all in prime sites ill never understand this sort of thing peters said if the factory and the shops were worth so much why were the shares cheap because the enterprise was losing money they hadnt paid a dividend for years the management didnt have the guts to cash in their chips so to speak we did everything in business is courage he started to eat his sandwich its fascinating peters said he looked at his watch i must go big day laski said lightly todays one of the daysand that always means headaches did you solve that problem which routes laski lowered his voice a fraction your security people wanted you to send the convoy a different way each time no peters was embarrassed it had been indiscreet of him to tell laski about that dilemma there is really only one sensible way to get there however he stood up laski smiled and kept his voice casual so todays big shipment goes by the old direct route peters put a finger to his lips security he said sure peters picked up his raincoat goodbye ill see you tomorrow laski said smiling broadly arthur cole climbed the steps from the station his breath rattling unhealthily in his chest a gust of warm air came up from the bowels of the underground wrapped itself snugly around him and blew away he shivered slightly as he emerged into the street the sunshine took him by surpriseit had hardly been dawn when he boarded the train the air was chilled and sweet later it would become poisonous enough to knock out a policeman on point duty cole remembered the first time that had happened the story had been an evening post exclusive he walked slowly until his breathing eased twentyfive years in newspapers have ruined my health he thought in truth any industry would have done the same for he was prone to worry and to drink and his chest was weak but it comforted him to blame his profession anyway he had given up smoking he had been a nonsmoker forhe looked at his watchone hundred and twentyeight minutes unless he counted the night in which case it was eight hours he had already passed several moments of risk immediately after the alarm clock went off at four thirty he usually smoked one on the wc driving away from his house at the moment when he got into top gear and turned on the radio ready for the five oclock news accelerating down the first fast stretch of the a as his large ford hit its stride and waiting on a cold openair tube station in east london for the earliest train of the day the bbcs five oclock bulletin had not cheered him it had had all his attention as he drove for the route was so familiar that he negotiated the bends and roundabouts automatically from memory the lead story came from westminster the latest industrial relations bill had been passed by parliament but the majority had been narrow cole had caught the story the previous night on television that meant the morning papers would certainly have it which in turn meant that the post could do nothing with it unless there were developments later in the day there was a story about the retail price index the source would be official government statistics which would have been embargoed until midnight again the mornings would have it it was no surprise to learn that the car workers strike was still onit would hardly have been settled overnight test cricket in australia solved the sports editors problem but the score was not sufficiently sensational for the front page cole began to worry he entered the evening post building and took the elevator the newsroom occupied the entire first floor it was a huge ishaped openplan office cole entered at the foot of the i to his left were the typewriters and telephones of the copytakers who would type out stories dictated over the phone to the right the filing cabinets and bookshelves of specialist writerspolitical industrial crime defense and more cole walked up the stem of the i through rows of desks belonging to ordinary common or garden reporters to the long news desk which divided the room in two behind it was the ushaped subeditors table and beyond that in the crosspiece of the i was the sports departmenta semiindependent kingdom with its own editor reporters and subs cole occasionally showed curious relatives around the place he always told them its supposed to work like a production line usually its more like a bun fight it was an exaggeration but it always got a laugh the room was brightly lit and empty as deputy news editor cole had a section of the news desk to himself he opened a drawer and took out a coin then walked to the vending machine in sport and punched buttons for instant tea with milk and sugar a teleprinter chattered to life breaking the silence as cole walked back to his desk with his paper cup the far door bumped open a short grayhaired figure came in wearing a bulky parka and cycle clips cole waved and called morning george hello arthur cold enough for you george began to take off his coat the body inside it was small and thin despite his age george held the title head lad he was chief of the offices team of messengers he lived in potters bar and cycled to work arthur thought that an astonishing feat arthur put down his tea shrugged out of his raincoat turned on the radio and sat down the radio began to murmur he sipped tea and gazed straight ahead the newsroom was scruffychairs were scattered randomly newspapers and sheets of copy paper littered the desks and redecoration had been postponed in last years economy drivebut the scene was too familiar to register coles mind was on the first edition which would be on the streets in three hours todays paper would have sixteen pages fourteen of the first editions pages already existed as semicylindrical metal plates on the press downstairs they contained advertising features television programs and news written in such a way that its age wouldit was hopedbe overlooked by the reader that left the back page for the sports editor and the front page for arthur cole parliament a strike and inflationthey were all yesterday stories there was not much he could do with them any of them could be dressed up with a today intro like cabinet ministers today held an inquest on the governments narrow escape there was one of those for every situation yesterdays disaster became todays news story with dawn today revealed the full horror yesterdays murder benefited from detectives today searched london for the man who arthurs problem had given birth to scores of cliches in a civilized society he thought when there was no news there would be no newspapers it was an old thought and he brushed it out of his mind impatiently everyone accepted that the first edition was rubbish three days out of six but that gave no comfort because it was the reason arthur cole had the job of producing that edition he had been deputy news editor for five years twice during that period the news editors chair had fallen vacant and both times a younger man than cole had been promoted someone had decided that the numbertwo job was the limit of his capabilities he disagreed the only way he could demonstrate his talent was by turning out an excellent first edition unfortunately how good the edition was depended largely upon luck coles strategy was to aim for a paper which was consistently slightly better than the oppositions first edition he thought he was succeeding whether anyone upstairs had noticed he had no idea and he would not let himself worry about it george came up behind him and dumped a pile of newspapers on his desk young stephens reported sick again he grumbled arthur smiled what is ita hangover or a runny nose remember what they used to tell us if you can walk you can work not this lot arthur nodded am i right george said youre right the two of them had been lads together on the post arthur had got his nuj card after the war george who had not been called up had remained a messenger george said we were keen we wanted to work arthur picked up the top newspaper from the pile this was not the first time george had complained about his staff nor the first time arthur had commiserated with him but arthur knew what was wrong with the lads of today thirty years ago a smart lad could become a reporter nowadays that road was closed the new system had a double impact bright youngsters stayed at school instead of becoming messengers and those who did become messengers knew they had no prospects so they did as little work as they could get away with but arthur could not say this to george because it would call attention to the fact that arthur had done so much better than his old colleague so he agreed that the youth of today were rotten george seemed disposed to persist with his grouse arthur cut him off by saying anything on the overnight wire ill get it only ive got to do all the papers myself id better see the wire copy first arthur turned away he hated to pull rank he had never learned to do it naturally perhaps because he took no pleasure in it he looked at the morning star they had led with the industry bill it was unlikely that there would be any national news on the teletype yet it was too early but foreign news came in sporadically during the night and more often than not it included one story which could be the splash in a pinch most nights there was a major fire a multiple murder a riot or a coup somewhere in the world the post was a london paper and did not like to lead with foreign news unless it was sensational but it might be better than cabinet ministers today held an inquest george dumped a sheet of paper several feet long on his desk not cutting the sheet into individual stories was his way of showing displeasure he probably wanted arthur to complain so that he could point out how much work there was for him to do with the early lad off sick arthur fumbled in his desk for scissors and began to read he went through a political story from washington a test match report and a middle east roundup he was halfway through a minor hollywood divorce when the phone rang he picked it up and said news desk ive got an item for your gossip column it was a mans voice with a broad cockney accent cole was instantly skeptical this was not the voice of a man who would have inside information on the love lives of the aristocracy he said good would you like to tell me your name never mind about that do you know who tim fitzpeterson is of course well hes making a fool of himself with a redhead she must be twenty years younger than him do you want his phone number please cole wrote it down he was interested now if a ministers marriage had broken up it would make a good story not just a gossip item whos the girl he said calls herself an actress truth is shes a brass just give him a ring right away and ask him about dizi disney the line went dead cole frowned this was a little odd most tipsters wanted money especially for news of this kind he shrugged it was worth checking out he would give it to a reporter later on then he changed his mind innumerable stories had been lost forever by being put aside for a few minutes fitzpeterson might leave for the house or his whitehall office and the informant had said give him a ring right away cole read the number off his notebook and dialed seven am have you ever watched yourself doing it in the mirror she had asked and when tim admitted he had not she insisted they try it they were standing in front of the fulllength glass in the bathroom when the phone rang the noise made tim jump and she said ouch careful he wanted to ignore it but the intrusion of the outside world took away his desire he left her and went into the bedroom the phone was on a chair underneath a pile of her clothes he found it and lifted the receiver yes mr fitzpeterson it was the voice of a middleaged man with a london accent he sounded slightly asthmatic yes who is that evening post sir im sorry to call you so early i have to ask you whether its true youre getting divorced tim sat down heavily for a moment he was unable to speak are you there sir who the devil told you that the informant mentioned a woman called dizi disney do you know her ive never heard of her tim was regaining his composure dont wake me up in the morning with idle rumors he put the phone down the girl came into the bedroom you look quite white she said who was it whats your name he snapped dizi disney jesus christ his hands were trembling he clenched his fists and stood up the papers have got hold of a whisper that im getting divorced they must hear that sort of thing about famous people all the time they mentioned your name he slammed one fist into the palm of his other hand how could they find out so quickly what am i going to do she turned her back on him and put her panties on he stared out of the window the gray rolls was still there but now it was empty he wondered where the driver had gone the stray thought annoyed him he tried to assess the situation coolly someone had seen him leave a club with the girl and phoned the information to a reporter the informant had built the incident up for dramatic effect but tim was sure no one had seen them enter the flat together listen he said last night you said you werent feeling well i took you out of the club and got a taxi the cab dropped me off then took you home all right whatever you say she said uninterestedly her attitude infuriated him for gods sake this involves you i think my part in it is over what does that mean there was a knock at the door tim said oh jesus no the girl zipped up her dress ill go dont be such a damn fool he grabbed her arm you mustnt be seen here dont you understand stay here in the bedroom ill open the door if i have to ask them in just keep quiet until they go he put on his underwear shorts and struggled into his dressing gown as he crossed the living room there was a tiny hall and a front door with a peephole tim swung the flap aside and put an eye to the glass the man outside looked vaguely familiar he had the face of a boxer broadshouldered and well built he would have been a heavyweight he wore a gray coat with a velvet collar tim put his age at late twenties he did not look like a newspaper reporter tim unbolted the door and opened it what is it he said without speaking the man pushed tim aside stepped in and closed the door behind him he walked into the living room tim took a deep breath and tried not to panic he followed the man im going to call the police he said the man sat down he called are you in there dizi the girl came to the bedroom door the man said make us a cup of tea girl do you know him tim asked her incredulously she ignored him and went into the kitchen the man laughed know me she works for me tim sat down what is this all about he said weakly all in good time the man looked around i cant say youve got a nice place here because you havent i expected you to have something a bit flashknow what i mean by the way in case you havent recognized me im tony cox he stuck out his hand tim ignored it cox said please yourself tim was rememberingthe face and the name were familiar he thought cox was a fairly wealthy businessman but he could not recall what his business was he thought he had seen the mans picture in a newspapersomething to do with raising money for boys clubs in the east end cox jerked his head toward the kitchen did you enjoy her for gods sake tim said the girl came in carrying two mugs on a tray cox asked her did he enjoy it what do you think she said sourly cox took out his wallet and counted out some bills here you are he said to her you done a good job now you can fuck off she took the money and put it in a handbag she said you know tone i think the thing i like most about you is your beautiful manners she went out without looking at tim tim thought ive made the biggest mistake of my life as the girl left the door slammed cox winked shes a good girl shes the lowest form of human life tim spat now dont be like that shes just a good actress she might have got into films if i hadnt of found her first i presume youre a ponce anger flashed in coxs eyes but he controlled it youll regret that little joke he said mildly all you need to know about me and dizi is that she does what i tell her to if i say keep your mouth shut she does and if i say tell the nice man from the news of the world how mr fitzpeterson seduced you she will know what i mean tim said i suppose it was you who contacted the evening post dont worry without confirmation they cant do a thing and only three people can confirm the story you dizi and me youre not going to say anything dizis got no will of her own and i can keep a secret tim lit a cigarette he was finding his confidence again cox was just a workingclass hoodlum despite his velvet collar and his gray rollsroyce tim had the feeling he could handle the man he said if this is blackmail youre on to a loser i havent any money quite warm in here isnt it cox stood up and took his coat off well he resumed if you havent got money well have to think of something else you can give me tim frowned he was lost again cox continued in the last few months half a dozen or so companies have put in bids for drilling rights in a new oil field called shield right tim was astonished surely this crook could not be connected with any of those respectable companies he said yes but its too late for me to influence the resultthe decision has been made it will be announced this afternoon dont jump to conclusions i know its too late to change it but you can tell me whos won the license tim stared was that all he wanted it was too good to be true he said what possible use could you have for that sort of information none really im going to trade it for another piece of information ive got a deal going with this gent see he doesnt know how i get my inside dope and he doesnt know what i do with the stuff he tells me that way he keeps his nose clean know what i mean now then who gets the license it was so easy tim thought two words and the nightmare would be over a breach of confidence like this could ruin his career but then if he did not do it his career was finished anyway cox said if youre not sure what to do just think of the headlines the minister and the actress he wouldnt make an honest woman of me showgirl weeps remember poor old tony lambton shut up tim said its hamilton holdings cox smiled my friend will be pleased he said wheres the phone tim jerked a thumb bedroom he said wearily cox went into the room and tim closed his eyes how naive he had been to think that a young girl like dizi could fall head over heels in love with someone like him he was a patsy in some elaborate scheme which was much bigger than petty blackmail he could hear cox speaking laski its me hamilton holdings you got that announcement this afternoon now what about your end there was a pause today terrific youve made my day pal and the route another pause what do you mean you think its the usual youre supposedokay okay so long tim knew of laskihe was an aging city whiz kidbut he was emotionally too exhausted to feel appropriately astonished he could believe anything of anyone now cox came back in tim stood up cox said well a successful little morning one way and another and dont feel too bad about it after all it was the best nights nooky youll ever have are you going to leave now please tim said well there is one more little matter to discuss give us your dressing gown why ill show you come on tim was too battered to argue he slipped the robe off his shoulders and handed it over he stood in his shorts waiting cox threw the garment to one side i want you to remember that word ponce he said then he punched tim in the stomach tim turned away and doubled over in agony cox reached out grabbed his genitals in one huge hand and squeezed tim tried to scream but he had no breath his mouth gaped in a soundless howl as he tried desperately to suck air cox let go and kicked him tim toppled to the floor he curled up there and his eyes flooded with tears he had no pride no dignity left he said please dont hurt me anymore tony cox smiled and put his coat on not just yet he said then he went away the hon derek hamilton woke up with a pain he lay in bed with his eyes shut while he traced the discomfort to his abdomen examined it and graded it bad but not incapacitating then he recalled last nights dinner asparagus mousse was harmless he had refused seafood pancakes his steak had been well done he had taken cheese in preference to apple tart a light white wine coffee with cream brandybrandy damn he should stick to port he knew how the day would go he would do without breakfast and by midmorning the hunger would be as bad as the ulcer pain so he would eat something by lunchtime the hunger would be back and the ulcer would be worse during the afternoon some trivial thing would irritate him beyond all reason he would yell at his staff and his stomach would ball into a knot of pain which made him incapable of thinking at all he would go home and take too many painkillers he would sleep wake with a headache eat dinner take sleeping pills and go to bed at least he could look forward to bedtime he rolled over yanked open the drawer of the bedside table found a tablet and put it in his mouth then he sat up and picked up his cup of tea he sipped swallowed and said good morning dear morning ellen hamilton sat on the edge of the twin bed wearing a silk robe perching her cup on one slender knee she had brushed her hair already her nightwear was as elegant as the rest of her large wardrobe despite the fact that only he ever saw it and he was not interested that did not matter he surmised it was not that she wanted men to desire heronly that she should be able to think of herself as desirable he finished his tea and swung his legs to the floor his ulcer protested at the sudden movement and he winced with pain ellen said again he nodded brandy last night ought to know better her face was expressionless i suppose it has nothing to do with yesterdays halfyear results he heaved himself to his feet and walked slowly across the expanse of oystercolored carpet to the bathroom the face he saw in the mirror was round and red balding with rolls of fat under the jaw he examined his morning beard pulling the loose skin this way and that to make the bristles stand up he began to shave he had done this every day for the last forty years and still he found it tiresome yes the halfyear results were bad hamilton holdings was in trouble when he had inherited hamilton printing from his father it had been efficient successful and profitable jasper hamilton had been a printerfascinated by typefaces keen on the new technology loving the oily smell of the presses his son was a businessman he had taken the flow of profits from the works and diverted it into more businesseswine importing retailing publishing paper mills commercial radio this had achieved its primary purpose of turning income into wealth and thereby avoiding tax instead of bibles and paperbacks and posters he had concerned himself with liquidity and yields he had bought up companies and started new enterprises building an empire the continuing success of the original business disguised the flimsiness of the superstructure for a long time but when the printing complex weakened hamilton discovered that most of his other businesses were marginal that he had underestimated the capital investment needed to nurse them to maturity and that some of them were very longterm indeed he sold fortynine percent of his equity in each of the companies then transferred his stock to a holding company and sold fortynine percent of that he raised more money and negotiated an overdraft running into seven figures the borrowing kept the organization alive but the interestrising fast through the decadeate up what little profit there was meanwhile derek hamilton cultivated an ulcer the rescue program had been inaugurated almost a year ago credit had been tightened in an attempt to reduce the overdraft costs had been cut by every means possible from cancellation of advertising campaigns to utilization of printroll offcuts for stationery hamilton was running a tight ship now but inflation and the economic slump ran faster the sixmonth results had been expected to show the world that hamilton holdings had turned the corner instead they demonstrated further decline he patted his face dry with a warm towel splashed on cologne and returned to the bedroom ellen was dressed sitting in front of the mirror making up her face she always managed to dress and undress while her husband was out of the bedroom it occurred to him that he had not seen her naked for years he wondered why had she run to seed the fiftyfiveyearold skin wrinkling and the oncefirm flesh sagging would nakedness destroy the illusion of desirability perhaps but he suspected something more complex it was obscurely connected with the way his own body had aged he thought as he climbed into his cavernous underpants she was always decently clad therefore he never lusted after her therefore she never had to reveal how undesirable she found him such a combination of deviousness and sensitivity would be characteristic she said what are you going to do the question caught him off balance he thought at first that she must know what he was thinking and be referring to that then he realized she was continuing the conversation about the business he fastened his suspenders wondering what to tell her im not sure he said eventually she peered closely into the mirror doing something to her eyelashes sometimes i wonder what you want out of life he stared at her her upbringing had taught her to be indirect and never to ask personal questions for seriousness and emotion spoiled parties and caused ladies to faint it would have cost her considerable effort to inquire about the purpose of someones existence he sat on the edge of his bed and spoke to her back i must cut out brandy thats all im sure you know it has nothing to do with what you eat and drink she applied lipstick contorting her mouth to spread it evenly it began nine years ago and your father died ten years ago ive got printing ink in my blood the response came formally like a catechism the conversation would have seemed dislocated to an eavesdropper but they knew its logic there was a code the death of his father meant his assumption of control of the business his ulcer meant his business problems she said you havent got ink in your veins your father had but you cant stand the smell of the old works i inherited a strong business and i want to bequeath to my sons an even stronger one isnt that what people of our class are supposed to do with their lives our sons arent interested in what we leave them michael is building his own business from scratch and all andrew wants to do is vaccinate the whole of the african continent against chicken pox he could not tell how serious she was now the things she was doing to her face made her expession unreadable no doubt it was deliberate almost everything she did was deliberate he said i have a duty i employ more than two thousand people and many more jobs are directly dependent upon the health of my companies i think youve done your duty you kept the firm going during a time of crisisnot everyone managed that youve sacrificed your health to it and youve given it ten years of your life and god knows what else her voice dropped on the final phrase as if at the last minute she regretted saying it should i give it my pride as well he said he carried on dressing tying a tight little knot in his necktie ive turned a jobbing printers into one of the thousand biggest companies in the country my business is worth five times what my fathers was i put it together and i have to make it work you have to do better than your father is that such a poor ambition yes her sudden vehemence was a shock you should want good health and long life andand my happiness if the company was prosperous perhaps i could sell it as things are i wouldnt get its asset value he looked at his watch i must go down he descended the broad staircase a portrait of his father dominated the hall people often thought it was derek at fifty in fact it was jasper at sixtyfive the phone on the hall stand shrilled as he passed he ignored it he did not take calls in the morning he went into the small dining roomthe large one was reserved for parties which were rare these days the circular table was laid with silver cutlery an elderly woman in an apron brought in half a grapefruit in a bone china dish not today mrs tremlett he told her just a cup of tea please he picked up the financial times the woman hesitated then put the dish down in ellens place hamilton glanced up just take it away will you he said irritably serve mrs hamiltons breakfast when mrs hamilton comes down and not before please very good mrs tremlett murmured she took the grapefruit away when ellen came in she picked up the argument where they had left it i dont think it matters whether you get five million or five hundred thousand for the company either way wed be better off than we are now since we dont live comfortably i fail to see the point of being comfortably off he put down the paper and looked at her she was wearing an original tailored suit in a creamcolored fabric with a printed silk blouse and handmade shoes he said you have a pleasant home with a small staff youve friends here and a social life in town when you care to take advantage of it this morning youre wearing several hundred pounds worth of clothes and youll probably go no farther than the village sometimes i wonder what you want out of life she blusheda rare event ill tell you she began there was a knock at the door and a goodlooking man came in wearing an overcoat and carrying a cap good morning sir madam he said if were to catch the seven fortyfive sir hamilton said all right pritchard just wait in the hall very good sir may i ask if youll be using the car today madam hamilton looked at ellen she kept her eyes on her dish as she said i expect so yes pritchard nodded and went out hamilton said you were about to tell me what you want out of life i dont think its a breakfasttable subject especially when youre rushing to catch a train very well he stood up enjoy your drive dont go too fast what drive carefully oh oh pritchard drives me he bent to kiss her cheek but she turned her face to him and kissed his lips when he pulled away her face was flushed she held his arm and said i want you derek he stared at her i want us to spend a long contented retirement together she went on speaking hurriedly i want you to relax and eat the right food and grow healthy and slim again i want the man who came courting in an opentop riley and the man who came back from the war with medals and married me and the man who held my hand when i bore my children i want to love you he stood nonplussed she had never been like this with him never he felt hopelessly incapable of dealing with it he did not know what to say what to do where to look he said i must catch the train she regained her composure quickly yes you must hurry he looked at her a moment longer but she would not meet his eyes he said um goodbye she nodded dumbly he went out he put on his hat in the hall then let pritchard open the front door for him the dark blue mercedes stood on the gravel drive gleaming in the sunshine pritchard must wash it every morning before i get up hamilton thought the conversation with ellen had been most peculiar he decided as they drove to the railway station through the window he watched the play of sunlight on the alreadybrowning leaves and ran over the key scenes in his mind i want to love you she had said with the emphasis on you talking of the things he had sacrificed for the business she had said and god knows what else i want to love you not someone else was that what she meant had he lost the fidelity of his wife as well as his health perhaps she simply wanted him to think she might be having an affair that was more like ellen she dealt in subtleties cries for help were not her style after the sixmonth results he needed domestic problems like a creditors meeting there was something else she had blushed when pritchard asked if she would be using the car then hastily she had said pritchard drives me hamilton said where do you take mrs hamilton pritchard she drives herself sir i make myself useful around the housetheres always plenty yes all right hamilton interrupted this isnt a timeandmotion study i was only curious sir his ulcer stabbed him tea he thought i should drink milk in the morning herbert chieseman switched on the light silenced the alarm clock turned up the volume of the radio which had been playing all night and pressed the rewind button of the reeltoreel tape recorder then he got out of bed he put the kettle on and stared out of the studio apartment window while he waited for the sevenhour tape to return to the start the morning was clear and bright the sun would be strong later but now it was chilly he put on trousers and a sweater over the underwear he had worn in bed and stepped into carpet slippers his home was a single large room in a north london victorian house which was past its best the furniture the ascot heater and the old gas cooker belonged to the landlord the radio was herberts his rent included the use of a communal bathroom andmost importantexclusive use of the attic the radio dominated the room it was a powerful vhf receiver made from parts he had carefully selected in half a dozen shops along tottenham court road the aerial was in the roof loft the tape deck was also homemade he poured tea into a cup added condensed milk from a tin and sat at his worktable apart from the electronic equipment the table bore only a telephone a ruled exercise book and a ballpoint pen he opened the book at a clean page and wrote the date at the top in a large cursive script then he reduced the volume of the radio and began to play the nights tape at high speed each time a highpitched squeal indicated that there was speech on the recording he slowed the reel with his finger until he could distinguish the words car proceed to holloway road the bottom end to assist pc ludlow road west five a mrs shaftesburysounds like a domestic twentyone inspector says if that chinese is still open hell have chicken fried rice with chips holloway road get a move onthat pcs in trouble herbert stopped the tape and made a note reported burglary of a housethats near wimbledon common jack eighteen do you read any cars lee area free to assist fire brigade at twentytwo feather street herbert made another note eighteen do you read i dont know give her an aspirin assault with a knife not serious where the hell have you been eighteen herberts attention strayed to the photograph on the mantelpiece above the boardedin fireplace the picture was flattering herbert had known this twenty years ago when she had given it to him but now he had forgotten oddly he did not think of her as she really had been anymore when he remembered her he visualized a woman with flawless skin and handtinted cheeks posing before a faded panorama in a photographers studio theft of one color television and damage to a plateglass window he had been the first among his circle of friends to lose the wife as they would put it two or three of them had suffered the tragedy since one had become a cheerful drunkard another had married a widow herbert had buried his head in his hobby radio he began listening to police broadcasts during the day when he did not feel well enough to go to work which was quite often grey avenue golders green reported assault one day after hearing the police talk about a bank raid he had telephoned the evening post a reporter had thanked him for the information and taken his name and address the raid had been a big onea quarter of a million poundsand the story was on the front page of the post that evening herbert had been proud to have given them the tipoff and told the story in three pubs that night then he forgot about it three months later he got a check for fifty pounds from the newspaper with the check was a statement which read two shot in raid and gave the date of the robbery leave it out charlie if she wont make a complaint forget it the following day herbert had stayed at home and phoned the post every time he picked something up on the police wavelength that afternoon he got a call from a man who said he was deputy news editor who explained just what the paper wanted from people like herbert he was told not to report an assault unless a gun was used or someone was killed not to bother with burglaries unless the address was in belgravia chelsea or kensington not to report robberies except when weapons were used or very large amounts of cash stolen proceed to twentythree narrow road and wait he got the idea quickly because he was not stupid and the posts news values were far from subtle soon he realized he was earning slightly more on his sick days than when he went to work what was more he preferred listening to the radio to making boxes for cameras so he gave in his notice and became what the newspaper called an earwig better give me that description now after he had been working fulltime on the radio for a few weeks the deputy news editor came to his houseit was before he moved to the studio apartmentto talk to him the newspaperman said herberts work was very useful to the paper and how would he like to work for them exclusively that would mean herbert would phone tips only to the post and not to other papers but he would get a weekly retainer to make up for the loss of income herbert did not say that he never had phoned any other papers he accepted the offer graciously sit tight and well get you some assistance in a few minutes over the years he had improved both his equipment and his understanding of what the newspaper wanted he learned that they were grateful for more or less anything early in the morning but as the day wore on they became more choosy until by about three pm nothing less than murder in the street or largescale robbery with violence interested them he also discovered that the paper like the police was a lot less interested in a crime done to a colored man in a colored area herbert thought this quite reasonable since he as an evening post reader was not much interested in what the wogs did to each other in their own parts of london and he surmised correctly that the reason the post was not interested was simply that people like herbert who bought the post werent interested and he learned to read between the lines of police jargon knew when an assault was trivial or a complaint domestic heard the note of urgency in the operationsroom sergeants voice when a call for assistance was desperate discovered how to switch his mind off when they decided to read out great lists of stolencar numbers over the air the speededup sound of his own alarm clock came out of the big speaker and he turned the deck off he increased the volume on the radio then dialed the posts number he sipped his tea while he waited for an answer post gmorning it was a mans voice copytakers please herbert said there was another pause copy hello chieseman here timing at oh seven fiftynine there was a clatter of typewriters in the background hello bertie anything doing seems to have been a quiet night herbert said eight am tony cox stood in a phone booth on the corner of quill street bethnal green with the receiver to his ear he was perspiring inside the warm coat with the velvet collar in his hand he held the end of a chain which was attached to the collar of the dog outside the dog was sweating too the phone at the other end of the line was answered and tony pressed a coin into the slot a voice said yes in the tone of one who is not really accustomed to these newfangled telephones tony spoke curtly its today get it together he hung up without giving his name or waiting for an answer he strode off along the narrow pavement pulling the dog behind him it was a pedigreed boxer with a trim powerful body and tony had continually to yank at the chain to make it keep pace the dog was strong but its master was a great deal stronger the doors of the old terraced houses gave directly on to the street tony stopped at the one outside which was parked the gray rollsroyce he pushed the house door open it was never locked for the occupants had no fear of thieves there was a smell of cooking in the little house pulling the dog behind him tony went into the kitchen and sat on a chair he unhooked the chain from the dogs collar and sent it away with a hefty slap on the rump he stood up and took off his coat a kettle was warming on the gas cooker and there was sliced bacon on a piece of greaseproof paper tony opened a drawer and took out a kitchen knife with a teninch blade he tested the ledge with his thumb decided it needed sharpening and went out into the yard there was an old grinding wheel in the leanto shed tony sat beside it on a wooden stool and worked the treadle the way he had seen the old man do it years ago it made tony feel good to do things the way his father had he pictured him a tall man and handsome with wavy hair and glittering eyes making sparks with the grinder while his children shrieked with laughter he had been a stallholder in a street market selling china and saucepans calling his wares in that strong carrying voice he used to make a performance of pretending to needle the grocer next to him shouting there yare i just sold a pot for half a nicker how many spuds dyou sell afore you take ten bob he could spot a strange woman yards away and would use his good looks shamelessly i tell you what darlingthis to a middleaged woman in a hairnetwe dont get many beautiful young girls down this end of the market so im going to sell you this at a loss and hope youll come back look at itsolid copper bottom if youll pardon the word and its my last one ive made my profit on the rest so you can have it for two quid half what i paid for it just because you made an old mans heart beat faster and take it quick afore i change my mind tony had been shocked by the speed at which the old man changed after the one lung went his hair turned white the cheeks sank between the bones and the fine voice went high and whining the stall was rightfully tonys but by then he had his own sources of income so he had let it go to young harry his dumb brother who had married a beautiful whitechapel girl with the patience to learn how to talk with her hands it took guts for a dumb man to run a market stall writing on a blackboard when he needed to speak to the customers and keeping in his pocket a plain postcard bearing the word thanks in capital letters to flash when a sale was made but he ran it well and tony lent him the money to move into a proper shop and hire a manager and he made a success of that too gutsthey ran in the family the kitchen knife was sharp enough he tested it and cut his thumb holding it to his lips he went into the kitchen his mother was there lillian cox was short and a little overweighther son had inherited the tendency to plumpness without the shortnessand she had much more energy than the average sixtythreeyearold she said im doing you a bit of fried bread lovely he put the knife down and found a bandage take care with that knifei done it a bit too sharp she fussed over his cut then making him hold it under the cold tap and count to one hundred then putting on antiseptic cream and gauze and finally a roll of bandage held with a safety pin he stood still and let her do what she wished she said ah but youre a good boy to sharpen the knives for me where you been so early anyhow took the dog up the park and i had to ring someone up she made a disgusted noise i dont know whats wrong with the phone in the parlor im sure he leaned over the cooker to sniff the frying bacon you know how it is mum the old bill listen to that one she put a teapot in his hand go in there and pour the tea out then he took the pot into the living room and put it down on a mat the square table was laid with an embroidered cloth cutlery for two salt and pepper and sauce bottles tony sat nearest the fireplace where the old man used to sit from there he reached into the sideboard and took out two cups and two saucers he pictured the old man again overseeing mealtimes with the back of his hand and a good deal of rhyming slang get your chalks off the cain he would bark if they put their arms on the table the only thing tony held against him was the way he treated mum being so handsome and that he had a few women on the side and at times he would spend his money buying them gin instead of bringing it home those times tony and his brother would go up the smithfield market stealing scraps from under the tables to sell to the soap factory for a few coppers and he never went in the armybut then a lot of wise boys went on the trot in wartime what are you going to dogo back to sleep or pour that tea out lillian put a plate in front of tony and sat down opposite him never mind ill do it now tony picked up his cutlery holding his knife like a pencil and began to eat there were sausages two fried eggs a mess of canned tomatoes and several slices of fried bread he took a mouthful before reaching for the brown sauce he was hungry after his mornings exertions his mother passed him his tea she said i dont know we was never afraid to use the phone when your father was alive god rest his soul he was careful to stay out of the way of the old bill tony thought they had had no phone in his fathers day but he let that pass he said yeah he was so careful he died a pauper but an honest one was he you know bloody well he was and never let me hear you say no different i dont like you to swear mum you shouldnt provoke me tony ate silently and finished quickly he emptied his teacup and began to unwrap a cigar his mother picked up his cup more tea he looked at his watch no thanks ive got a couple of things to do he set fire to the cigar and stood up thats set me up lovely that breakfast she narrowed her eyes are you having a tickle this annoyed him he blew smoke into the air who needs to know its your life go on then ill see you later mind you look after yourself he looked at her a moment longer although she gave in to him she was a strong woman she had led the family since the old man went mending marriages borrowing from one son to lend to another giving advice using her disapproval as a powerful sanction she had resisted all efforts to move her from quill street to a nice little bungalow in bournemouth suspectingrightlythat the old house and its memories were a potent symbol of her authority once there had been queenly arrogance in her highbridged nose and pointed chin now she was regal but resigned like an abdicated monarch knowing she was wise to release the reins of power but regretting it all the same tony realized that this was why she needed him he was king now and having him to live with her kept her close to the throne he loved her for needing him no one else needed him she stood up well are you going yes he realized he had been lost in thought he put an arm around her shoulders and squeezed briefly he never kissed her tata mum he picked up his coat patted the dog and went out the interior of the rolls was hot he pressed the button that lowered the window before settling himself in the leather seat and pulling away he took pleasure in the car as he threaded it through the narrow east end streets its shameless luxury in contrast with the mean streets and undignified old houses told the story of tony coxs life people looked at the carhousewives paperboys workingmen villainsand said to each other theres tony cox he did well he flicked cigar ash through the open window he had done well he had bought his first car for six pounds when he was sixteen years old the blank ministry of transport certificate had cost him thirty shillings on the black market he filled in the blanks and resold the car for eighty pounds before long he had a used car lot which he gradually turned into a legitimate business then he sold it with the stock for five thousand pounds and went into the longfirm racket he used the five thousand to open a bank account giving as a reference the name of the man who had bought the car lot he told the bank manager his real name but gave a false addressthe same false address he had given the purchaser of the car business he took a lease on a warehouse paying three months rent in advance he bought small quantities of radio television and hifi equipment from manufacturers and resold it to shops in london he paid suppliers on the dot and his bank account was busy within a couple of months he was making a small loss and had a reputation for creditworthiness at that point he made a series of very large orders small manufacturers to whom he had promptly paid a couple of bills of five hundred pounds each were glad to supply him with three or four thousand pounds worth of goods on the same credit terms he looked like he was becoming a good customer with a warehouse full of expensive electronic gadgetry for which he had paid nothing he held a sale record players color television sets digital clocks tape decks amplifiers and radios went for knockdown prices sometimes as little as half their retail value in two days the warehouse was empty and tony cox had three thousand pounds in cash in two suitcases he locked the warehouse and went home he shivered in the front seat of the warm car as he remembered he would never take risks like those again suppose one of the suppliers had got wind of the sale suppose the bank manager had seen tony in a pub a few days later he still did the occasional long firm but these days he used front men who took long holidays in spain as soon as the ax fell and nobody saw tonys face however his business interests had diversified he owned property in central london which he let to young ladies at extremely high rents he ran nightclubs he even managed a couple of pop groups some of his projects were legitimate some criminal some were a mixture and others were on the nebulous borderline between the two where the law is unsure of itself but respectable businessmen with reputations to worry about fear to tread the old bill knew about him of course there were so many grasses about nowadays that nobody could become a respected villain without his name going into a file at scotland yard but getting evidence was the problem especially with a few detectives around who were prepared to warn tony in advance of a raid the money he spent in that direction was never skimped every august there were three or four police families in benidorm on tonys money not that he trusted them they were useful but they were all telling themselves that one day they would repay their debt of loyalty by turning him in a bent copper was still ultimately a copper so all transactions were cash no books were kept except in tonys head all jobs were done by his cronies on verbal instructions increasingly he played even safer by simply acting as a banker a draftsman would get some inside information and dream up a plan then he would recruit a villain to organize the equipment and manpower the two of them would then come to tony and tell him the plan if he liked it he would lend them the money for bribes guns motorcars explosives and anything else they needed when they had done the job they would repay the loan five or six times over out of the proceeds todays job was not so simple he was draftsman as well as banker for this one it meant he had to be extra careful he stopped the car in a backstreet and got out here the houses were largerthey had been built for foremen and craftsmen rather than dockers and laborersbut they were no more sound than the hovels of quill street the concrete facings were cracking the wooden window frames were rotten and the front gardens were smaller than the trunk of tonys car only about half of them were lived in the rest were warehouses offices or shops the door tony knocked on bore the sign billiards and snooker with most of the and missing it was opened immediately and he stepped inside he shook hands with walter burden then followed him upstairs a road accident had left walter with a limp and a stammer depriving him of his job as a docker tony had given him the managership of the billiards hall knowing that the gesturewhich cost tony nothingwould be rewarded by increased respect among east enders and undying loyalty on walters part walter said want a cup of tea tony no thanks walter i just had my breakfast he looked around the firstfloor hall with a proprietorial air the tables were covered the linoleum floor swept the cues racked neatly you keep the place nice only doing my job tone you looked after me see yeah cox went to the window and looked down on the street a blue morris was parked a few yards away on the opposite side of the road there were two people in it tony felt curiously satisfied he had been right to take precaution wheres the phone walter in the office walter opened a door ushered tony in and closed it staying outside the office was tidy and clean tony sat at the desk and dialed a number a voice said yeah pick me up tony said five minutes tony hung up his cigar had gone out when things made him nervous he let his smoke go out he relit it with a gold dunhill then went out he showed himself at the window again all right mate im off he said to walter if one of the young detectiveconstables in the blue car takes it into his head to knock on the door dont answer it ill be about half an hour dont wworry you can rely on me you know that walter nodded his head like a bird yeah i know tony touched the old mans shoulder briefly then went to the back of the hall he opened the door and trotted rapidly down the fire escape he picked his way around a rusting baby carriage a sodden mattress and threefifths of an old car weeds sprouted stubbornly in the cracked concrete of the yard a grubby cat scampered out of his way his italian shoes got dirty a gate led from the yard to a narrow lane tony walked to the end of the lane as he got there a small red fiat with three men in it drew up at the curb tony got in and sat in the empty seat in the back the car pulled away immediately the driver was jacko tonys first lieutenant beside jacko was deaf willie who knew more about explosives now than he had twenty years ago when he lost his left eardrum in the back with tony was peter jesse james whose two obsessions were firearms and girls with fat bottoms they were good men all permanent members of tonys firm tony said hows the boy willie deaf willie turned his good ear toward tony what i said hows young billy eighteen today willie said hes the same tone hell never be able to look after hisself the social worker told us to think about putting him in a home tony tutted sympathetically he went out of his way to be kind to deaf willies halfwitted son mental illness frightened him you dont want to do that willie said i said to the wife what does a social worker know this ones a girl of about twenty been to college still she dont push herself jacko broke in impatiently were all set tony the lads are there the motors are ready good tony looked at jesse james shooters got a couple of shotguns and an uzi a what jesse grinned proudly its a ninemillimeter machine pistol israeli stroll on tony muttered jacko said here we are tony took a cloth cap from his pocket and fixed it on his head youve put the lads indoors have you yes jacko said i dont mind them knowing its a tony cox job but i dont want them to be able to say they saw me i know the car pulled into a scrap yard it was a remarkably tidy yard the shells of cars were piled three high in orderly lines and component parts were stacked neatly round about pillars of tires a pyramid of rear axles a cube of cylinder blocks near the gateway were a crane and a long car transporter farther in a plain blue ford van with double rear wheels stood next to the yards heavyduty oxyacetylene cutting gear the car stopped and tony got out he was pleased he liked things neat the other three stood around waiting for him to do something jacko lit a cigarette tony said did you fix the owner of the yard jacko nodded he made sure the crane the transporter and the cutting gear were here but he doesnt know what theyre for and weve tied him up just for the sake of appearances he started to cough tony took the cigarette out of jackos mouth and dropped it in the mud those things make you cough he said he took a cigar from his pocket smoke this and die old tony walked back toward the yard gate the three men followed tony trod gingerly around potholes and swampy patches past a stack of thousands of leadacid accumulators between mounds of drive shafts and gearboxes to the crane it was a smallish model on caterpillar tracks capable of lifting a car a van or a light truck he unbuttoned his overcoat and climbed the ladder to the high cab he sat in the operators seat the allround windows enabled him to see the whole of the yard it was triangular in plan one side was a railway viaduct its brick arches filled in by storerooms a high wall on the adjacent side separated the yard from a playground and a bomb site the road ran along the front of the yard curving slightly as it followed the bend of the river a few yards beyond it was a wide road but little used in the lee of the viaduct was a hut made of old wooden doors supporting a tarpaper roof the men would be in there huddled around an electric fire drinking tea and smoking nervously everything was right tony felt elation rise in his belly as instinct told him it would work he climbed out of the crane he deliberately kept his voice low steady and casual this van doesnt always go the same route there are lots of ways from the city to loughton but this place is on most of the routes right they got to pass here unless they want to go via birmingham or watford now they do go daft ways occasionally today might be one of those days so if it doesnt come off just give the lads a bonus and send them home until next time jacko said they all know the score good anything else the three men were silent tony gave his final instructions everybody wears a mask everybody wears gloves nobody speaks he looked to each man in turn for acknowledgment then he said okay take me back there was no conversation as the red fiat wound its way through the little streets to the lane behind the billiard hall tony got out then leaned on the front passenger door and spoke through the open window its a good plan and if you do right it will work theres a couple of wrinkles you dont know aboutsafeguards inside men keep calm do good and well have it away he paused and dont shoot nobody with that bleeding tommy gun for fucks sake he walked up the lane and entered the billiard hall by the back door walter was playing billiards at one of the tables he straightened up when he heard the door all right tone tony went to the window did pally stay put he could see the blue morris in the same place yes theyve been smoking theirself to death it was fortunate tony thought that the law did not have enough manpower to watch him at night as well as in the day the ninetofive surveillance was quite useful for it permitted him to establish alibis without seriously restricting his activities one of these days they would start following him twentyfour hours a day but he would have plenty of advance notice of that walter jerked a thumb at the table fancy a break no tony left the window i got a busy day he went down the stairs and walter hobbled after him tata walter he said as he went out into the street so long tony walter said god bless you boy the newsroom came to life suddenly at eight oclock it had been as still as a morgue the quietness broken only by inanimate sounds like the stuttering of the teleprinter and the rustle of the newspapers cole was reading now three copytakers were pounding the keys a lad was whistling a pop song and a photographer in a leather coat was arguing with a subeditor about a football match the reporters were drifting in most of them had an earlymorning routine cole had observed one bought tea another lit a cigarette another turned to page three of the sun to look at the nude each using an habitual crutch to help him start the day cole believed in letting people sit down for a few minutes before setting them to work it made for an atmosphere of order and coolheadedness his news editor cliff poulson had a different approach poulson with his froglike green eyes and yorkshire accent liked to say dont take your coat off lad his delight in snap decisions his perpetual hurry and his brittle air of bonhomie created a frenetic atmosphere poulson was a speed freak cole did not reckon a story had ever missed an edition because someone took a minute out to think about it kevin hart had been here for five minutes now he was reading the mirror with one hip perched on the edge of a desk the trousers of his striped suit falling gracefully cole called out to him give the yard a ring please kevin the young man picked up a telephone the bertie chieseman tips were on his desk a thick wad of copy cole looked around most of the reporters were in it was time to get them working he sorted through the tips impaling some on a sharp metal spike handing others to reporters with brief instructions anna a pc got into trouble in the holloway roadring the nearest nick and find out what it was all about if its drunks forget it joe this fire in the east endcheck with the brigade a burglary in chelsea phillip look up the address in kellys directory in case anyone famous lives there barneypolice pursued and arrested an irishman after calling at a house in queenstown street camden ring the yard and ask them if its anything to do with the ira an internal phone beeped and he lifted it arthur cole what have you got for me arthur cole recognized the voice of the picture editor he said at the moment it looks as though the splash will be last nights vote in the commons but that was on the television yesterday did you call to ask me things or tell me things i suppose id better have somebody at downing street for a today picture of the prime minister anything else nothing that isnt in the morning papers thank you arthur cole hung up it was poor to be leading on a yesterday story he was doing his best to update ittwo reporters were ringing around for reactions they were getting backbench mps to shoot off their mouths but no ministers a middleaged reporter with a pipe called out mrs poulson just rang cliff wont be in today hes got delhi belly cole groaned how did he catch that in orpington curry supper okay that was clever cole thought it looked like being the dullest day for news in the month and poulson was off sick with the assistant news editor on holiday cole was on his own kevin hart approached the desk nothing from the yard he said its been quiet all night cole looked up hart was about twentythree and very tall with curly fair hair which he wore long cole suppressed a spasm of irritation that is ridiculous he said scotland yard never has a completely quiet night whats the matter with that press bureau we ought to do a storylondons first crimefree night for a thousand years hart said with a grin his levity annoyed cole never be satisfied with that kind of reply from the yard he said coldly hart flushed it embarrassed him to be lectured like a cub reporter ill ring them back shall i no said cole seeing that he had made his point i want you to do a story you know this new oil field in the north sea hart nodded its called shield yes later on the energy minister is going to announce who has got the license to develop it do a holding piece to run until we get the announcement background what the license will mean to the people who are bidding how the minister makes up his mind this afternoon we can sling your piece out and leave a hole in the paper for the real news okay hart turned away and made for the library he knew he was being given a dumb job as a kind of punishment but he took his medicine gracefully cole thought he stared at the boys back for a moment he got on coles nerves with his long hair and his suits he had rather too much selfconfidencebut then reporters needed a lot of cheek cole stood up and went to the subeditors table the deputy chief sub had in front of him the wire service story about the passing of the industry bill and the new stuff coles reporters had come up with cole looked over his shoulder on a scratch pad he had written rebel mps told join the libs the man scratched his beard and looked up what do you think it looks like a story about womens lib cole said i hate it so do i the sub tore the sheet off the pad crumpled it and tossed it in a metal bin what else is new nothing ive only just given out the tips the bearded man nodded and glanced reflexively at the clock hanging from the ceiling in front lets hope we get something decent for the second cole leaned over him and wrote on the pad rebel mps told join liberals he said it makes more sense but its the same count the sub grinned want a job cole went back to his desk annela sims came up and said the holloway road incident came to nothing a bunch of rowdies no arrests cole said okay joe barnard put down the phone and called theres not a lot to this fire arthur nobody hurt how many people living there cole said automatically two adults three children so its a family of five escaped death write it phillip jones said the burgled flat seems to belong to nicholas crost quite a wellknown violinist good cole said ring chelsea nick and find out what was taken i did already phillip grinned theres a stradivarius missing cole smiled good boy write it then get down there and see if you can interview the heartbroken maestro the phone rang and cole picked it up although he would not have admitted it he was thoroughly enjoying himself nine am tim fitzpeterson was dry of tears but the weeping had not helped he lay on the bed his face buried in the damp pillow to move was agony he tried not to think at all his mind turning away thoughts like an innkeeper with a full house at one point his brain switched off completely and he dozed for a few moments but the escape from pain and despair was brief and he woke up again he did not rise from the bed because there was nothing he wanted to do nowhere he could go nobody he felt he could face all he could do was think about the promise of joy that had been so false cox had been right when he said so coarsely it was the best nights nooky youll ever have tim could not quite banish the flashing memories of her slim writhing body but now they had a dreadfully bitter taste she had shown him paradise then slammed the door she of course had been faking ecstasy but there had been nothing simulated about tims own pleasure a few hours ago he had been contemplating a new life enhanced by the kind of sexual love he had forgotten existed now it was hard to see any point at all in tomorrow he could hear the noise of the children in the playground outside shouting and shrieking and quarreling and he envied them the utter triviality of their lives he pictured himself as a schoolboy in a black blazer and short gray trousers walking three miles of dorset country lanes to get to the oneclass primary school he was the brightest pupil they had ever had which was not saying much but they taught him arithmetic and got him a place at the grammar school and that was all he needed he had flourished in the grammar school he remembered he had been the leader of the gang the one who organized playground games and classroom rebellions until he got his glasses there he had been trying to remember when in his life he had felt despair like this and now he knew it had been the first day he wore his glasses to school the members of his gang had been at first dismayed then amused then scornful by playtime he was being followed by a crowd chanting foureyes after lunch he tried to organize a football match but john willcott said its not your game tim put his spectacles in their case and punched willcotts head but willcott was big and tim who normally dominated by force of personality was no fighter tim ended up stanching a bloody nose in the cloakroom while willcott picked teams he tried to make a comeback during history by flicking inky paper pellets at willcott under the nose of miss percival known as old percy but the normally indulgent percy decided to have a clampdown that day and tim was sent to the headmaster for six of the best on the way home he had another fight lost again and tore his blazer his mother took the money for a new one out of the nest egg tim was saving to buy a crystal radio kit setting him back six months it was the blackest day of young tims life and his leadership qualities remained stifled until he went to college and joined the party a lost fight a torn blazer and six of the best he could wish for problems like that now a whistle blew in the playground outside the flat and the noise of the children ceased abruptly i could end my troubles that quickly tim thought and the idea appealed what was i living for yesterday he wondered good work my reputation a successful government none of these things seemed to matter today the school whistle meant it was past nine oclock tim should have been chairing a committee meeting to discuss the productivity of different kinds of power stations how could i ever have been interested in anything so meaningless he thought of his pet project a forecast of the energy needs of british industry through to the year he could summon no enthusiasm for it he thought of his daughters and dreaded the idea of facing them everything turned to ashes in his mouth what did it matter who would win the next election britains fortunes were determined by forces outside its leaders control he had always known it was a game but he no longer wanted the prizes there was nobody he could talk to nobody he imagined the conversation with his wife darling ive been foolish and disloyal i was seduced by a whore a beautiful supple girl and blackmailed julia would freeze on him he could see her face taking on a rigid look of distaste as she withdrew from emotional contact he would reach out to her with his hand and she would say dont touch me no he could not tell julia not until he was sure his own wounds had healedand he did not think he could survive that long anyone else cabinet colleagues would say good god tim old chapim terribly sorry and immediately begin to map out a fallback position for the time when it got out they would take care not to be associated with anything he sponsored not to be seen with him too often might even make a morality speech to establish puritan credentials he did not hate them for what he knew they would do his prognosis was based on what he would do in that situation his agent had come close to being a friend once or twice but the man was young he could not know how much depended upon fidelity in a twentyyearold marriage he would cynically recommend a thorough coverup and overlook the damage already done to a mans soul his sister then an ordinary woman married to a carpenter she had always envied tim a little she would wallow in it tim could not contemplate that his father was dead his mother senile was he that short of friends what had he done with his life to be left with no one who would love him right or wrong perhaps it was that that kind of commitment was twoway and he had been careful to see that there was nobody he wouldnt be able to abandon if they became a liability there was no support to be had only his own resources were available what do we do he thought wearily when we lose the election by a landslide regroup draw up the scenario for the years of opposition start hacking away at the foundations use our anger and our disappointment as fuel for the fight he looked inside himself for courage and hatred and bitterness to enable him to deny the victory to tony cox and found only cowardice and spite at other times he had lost battles and suffered humiliation but he was a man and men had the strength to struggle on didnt they his strength had always come from a certain image of himself a civilized man steadfast trustworthy loyal and courageous able to win with pride and lose with grace tony cox had shown him a new picture naive enough to be seduced by an emptyheaded girl weak enough to betray his trust at the first threat of blackmail frightened enough to crawl on the floor and beg for mercy he screwed up his eyes tightly but still the image invaded his mind it would be with him for the rest of his life but that need not be long at last he moved he sat on the edge of the bed then stood up there was blood his blood on the sheet a disgraceful reminder the sun had moved around the sky and now shone brightly through the window tim would have liked to close the window but the effort was too much he hobbled out of the bedroom and went through the living room into the kitchen the kettle and the teapot were where she had left them after making tea she had spilled a few leaves carelessly over the formica worktop and she had not bothered to put the bottle of milk back into the little fridge the firstaid kit was in a high locked cupboard where small children could not reach tim pulled a stool across the marleytiled floor and stood on it the key was on top of the cupboard he unlocked the door and took down an old biscuit tin with a picture of durham cathedral on the lid he got off the stool and put the tin down inside he found bandages a roll of gauze scissors antiseptic cream gripe water for babies a displaced tube of ambre solaire and a large full bottle of sleeping tablets he took out the tablets and replaced the lid then he found a glass in another cupboard he kept not doing things not putting the milk away not clearing up the spilled tea leaves not replacing the firstaid tin not closing the door of the crockery cupboard there was no need he had to keep reminding himself he took the glass and the tablets into the living room and put them on his desk the desk was bare except for a telephone he always cleared it when he finished working he opened the cupboard beneath the television set here was the drink he had planned to offer her there was whiskey gin dry sherry a good brandy and an untouched bottle of eau de vie prunes that someone had brought back from the dordogne tim chose the gin although he did not like it he poured some into the glass on the desk then sat down in the upright chair he did not have the will to wait perhaps years for the revenge which would restore his selfrespect however right now he could not harm cox without doing worse damage to himself exposing cox would expose tim but the dead feel no pain he could destroy cox and then die in the circumstances it seemed the only thing to do derek hamilton was met at waterloo station by another chauffeur this time in a jaguar the chairmans rollsroyce had gone in the economy drive sadly the unions had not appreciated the gesture the chauffeur touched his cap and held the door and hamilton got in without speaking as the car pulled away he made a decision he would not go straight to the office he said take me to nathaniel fettdo you know where it is the chauffeur said yes sir they crossed waterloo bridge and turned into the aldwych heading for the city hamilton and fett had both gone to westminster school nathaniel fett senior had known that his son would not suffer for his jewishness there and lord hamilton had believed that the school would not turn his son into an upperclass twithis lordships phrase the two boys had superficially similar backgrounds both had wealthy dynamic fathers and beautiful mothers both were from intellectual households where politicians came to dinner both grew up surrounded by good paintings and unlimited books yet as the friendship grew and the two young men went to oxfordfett to balliol hamilton to magdalenthe hamilton house had suffered by the comparison derek came to see his own fathers intellect as shallow old man fett would tolerantly discuss abstract painting communism and bebop jazz then tear them to pieces with surgical accuracy lord hamilton held the same conservative views but expressed them in the thundering cliches of a house of lords speech derek smiled to himself in the back of the car he had been too hard on his father perhaps sons always were few men had known more about political skirmishing the old mans cleverness had given him real power whereas nathaniels father had been too wise ever to wield real influence in affairs of state nathaniel had inherited that wisdom and made a career of it the stockbroking firm which had been owned by six generations of firstborn sons named nathaniel fett had been changed by the seventh into a merchant bank people had always gone to nathaniel for advice even at school now he advised on mergers share issues and takeovers the car pulled up hamilton said wait for me please the offices of nathaniel fett were not impressivethe firm had no need to prove itself rich there was a small nameplate outside a street door near the bank of england the entrance was flanked by a sandwich shop on one side and a tobacconists on the other a casual observer might have taken it for a small and nonetooprosperous insurance or shipping company but he would not have known how far the premises to either side were occupied by the one firm the inside was comfortable rather than opulent with airconditioning concealed lighting and carpets which had aged well and stopped short of the walls the same casual observer might have thought that the paintings hanging on the walls were expensive he would have been right and wrong they were expensive but they were not hanging on the walls they were set into the brickwork behind armored glassonly the false frames actually hung on top of the wallpaper hamilton was shown straight in to fetts groundfloor office nathaniel was sitting in a club chair reading the financial times he stood up to shake hands hamilton said ive never seen you sitting at that desk is it just for decoration sit down derek tea coffee sherry a glass of milk please if you would valerie fett nodded to his secretary and she went out the deskno i never use it everything i write is dictated nothing i read is too heavy to hold in my hands why should i sit at a desk like a clerk in dickens so it is for decoration its been here longer than i too big to get out through the door and too valuable to chop up i think they built the place around it hamilton smiled valerie brought in his milk and went out again he sipped and studied his friend fett and his office matched both were small but not dwarfish dark but not gloomy relaxed without being frivolous the man had heavyrimmed glasses and brilliantined hair he wore a club tie a mark of social acceptability it was the only jewish thing about him hamilton thought wryly he put his glass down and said were you reading about me just skimming a predictable reaction ten years ago results like that from a company like hamilton would have made waves from audio shares to zinc prices today its just another conglomerate in trouble theres a word for it recession hamilton sighed why do we do it nathaniel i beg your pardon fett was startled he shrugged why do we overwork lose sleep risk fortunes and get ulcers fett smiled but a subtle change had come over his demeanor his eyes narrowed behind the pebblelensed spectacles and he smoothed the bristly hair at the back of his head in a gesture hamilton recognized to be defensive fett was retreating into his role as a careful advisor a friendly counsel with an objective viewpoint but his reply was measuredly casual to make money what else hamilton shook his head his friend always had to be beckoned twice before stepping into deeper water sixthform economics he said derisively i would have made more profit if id sold my inheritance and put it into the post office most people who own large businesses could live very comfortably for the rest of their lives by doing that why do we conserve our fortunes and try to enlarge them is it greed or power or adventure are we all compulsive gamblers fett said i suppose ellen has been saying this kind of thing to you hamilton laughed youre right but it pains me that you think im incapable of such ponderings on my own oh i dont doubt you mean it its just that ellen has a way of saying what you are thinking all the same you wouldnt be repeating these things to me if they hadnt struck a chord he paused derek be careful not to lose ellen they stared at one another for a moment then they both looked away there was silence they had reached the limit of intimacy permitted by their friendship eventually fett said we might get a cheeky bid in the next few days hamilton was surprised why someone might think he can pick you up at a bargain price while youre depressed and panicked by the interim results what would your advice be then hamilton asked thoughtfully it depends on the offer but id probably say wait we should know today whether youve won the oil field license shield yes win that and your shares will strengthen were still a poor prospect for profits but ideal material for an asset stripper interesting hamilton mused a gambler would make the bid today before the ministers announcement an opportunist would do it tomorrow if we win the license a genuine investor would wait until next week and a wise man would say no to all of them hamilton smiled money isnt everything nathaniel good lord is that so heretical not at all fett was amused and his eyes sparkled behind the spectacles ive known it for years what surprises me is that you should say it it surprises me too hamilton paused a matter of curiosity do you think well get the license cant say suddenly the brokers face was unreadable again depends whether the minister believes it should go to an alreadyprofitable company as a bonus or to an ailing one as a life belt hm neither i suspect remember we only head the syndicate its the total package that counts the hamilton section in control provides city contacts and management expertise well raise the development money rather than supply it out of our own pocket others in the team offer engineering skills oil experience marketing facilities and so on so youve a good chance hamilton smiled again socrates why he always made people answer their own questions hamilton lifted his heavy frame out of the chair i must go fett walked to the door with him derek about elleni hope you dont mind my saying no they shook hands i value your judgment fett nodded and opened the door whatever you do dont panic okeydokey as he went out hamilton realized that he had not used that expression for thirty years two motorcycle police parked their machines on either side of the rear entrance to the bank one of them produced an identity card and held it flat against the small window beside the door the man inside read the card carefully then picked up a red telephone and spoke into it a black van without markings drove between the motorcycles and stopped with its nose to the door the side windows of its cab were fitted with wire mesh internally and the two men inside wore policetype uniforms with crash helmets and transparent visors the body of the van had no windows despite the fact that there was a third man in there two more police bikes drew up behind the van completing the convoy the steel door to the building lifted smoothly and noiselessly and the van pulled in it was in a short tunnel brightly lit by fluorescent tubes its way was blocked by another door identical with the first the van stopped and the door behind closed the police motorcyclists remained in the street the van driver wound his window down and spoke through the wire mesh into a microphone on a stand morning he said cheerfully there was a large plateglass window in one wall of the tunnel behind the window which was bulletproof a brighteyed man in shirtsleeves spoke into another microphone his amplified words resonated in the confined space code word please the driver whose name was ron biggins said obadiah the controller who had set up todays run was a deacon in a baptist church the shirtsleeved man pressed a large red button in the whitepainted wall behind him and the second steel door slid upward ron biggins muttered miserable sod and eased the van forward again the steel door closed behind it it was now in a windowless room in the bowels of the building most of the floor space was occupied by a turntable the room was otherwise empty ron steered carefully onto the marked tracks and switched off his engine the turntable jerked and the van moved slowly through degrees then stopped the rear doors were now opposite the elevator in the far wall as ron watched in his wing mirror the elevator doors parted and a bespectacled man in a black jacket and striped trousers emerged he carried a key holding it out in front of him as if it were a torch or a gun he unlocked the vans rear doors then they were opened from the inside the third guard got out two more men came out of the elevator carrying between them a formidable metal box the size of a suitcase they loaded it into the van and went back for more ron looked around the room was bare apart from its two entrances three parallel lines of fluorescent lights and a vent for the airconditioning it was small and not quite rectangular ron guessed that few of the people who worked at the bank would know it was there at all the elevator presumably went only to the vault and the steel door to the street had no apparent connection with the main entrance around the corner the guard who had been inside stephen younger came around to the lefthand side of the van and rons codriver max fitch lowered his window stephen said big one today makes no difference to us ron said sourly he looked back at his mirror the loading was finished stephen said to max the gaffer here likes westerns yeah max was interested he had not been here before and the clerk in striped trousers did not look like a john wayne fan how do you know he asked watch here he comes the clerk came to rons window and said move em out max spluttered and tried to cover his laughter stephen went around to the back of the van and got in the clerk locked him in the three bank employees disappeared into the elevator nothing happened for two or three minutes then the steel door lifted ron fired the engine and drove into the tunnel they waited for the inner door to close and the outer one to open just before they pulled away max said into the microphone so long laughing boy the van emerged into the street the motorcycle escort was ready they took up their positions two in front and two behind and the convoy headed east at a large road junction in east london the van turned onto the a it was watched by a large man in a gray coat with a velvet collar who immediately went into a phone booth max fitch said guess who i just saw no idea tony cox rons expression was blank whos he when hes at home used to be a boxer good he was i saw him knock out kid vittorio at bethnal green baths it must be ten year ago hell of a boy max really wanted to be a detective but he had failed the police force intelligence test and gone into security he read a great deal of crime fiction and consequently labored under the delusion that the cids most potent weapon was logical deduction at home he did things like finding a lipsticksmeared cigarette butt in the ashtray and announcing grandly that he had reason to believe that mrs ashford from next door had been in the house he shifted restlessly in his seat them cases are what they keep old notes in arent they yes ron said so we must be going to the destruction plant in essex max said proudly right ron ron was staring at the outriders in front of the van and frowning as the senior member of the team he was the only one who got told where they were going but he was not thinking of the route or the job or even tony cox the exboxer he was trying to figure out why his eldest daughter had fallen in love with a hippie felix laskis office in poultry did not display his name anywhere it was an old building standing shouldertoshoulder with two others of different design had he been able to get planning permission to knock it down and build a skyscraper he could have made millions instead it stood as an example of the way his wealth was locked up but he reckoned that in the long term sheer pressure would blow the lid off planning restrictions and he was a patient man where business was concerned almost all of the building was sublet most of the tenants were minor foreign banks who needed an address near threadneedle street and their names were well displayed people tended to assume that laski had interests in the banks and he encouraged this error in every way short of outright lying besides he did own one of the banks the furnishings inside were adequate but cheap solid old typewriters shopsoiled filing cabinets secondhand desks and the threadbare minimum of carpet like every successful man in middle age laski liked to explain his achievement in aphorisms a favorite was i never spend money i invest it was truer than most dicta of its kind his one home a small mansion in kent had been rising in value since he bought it shortly after the war his meals were often expenseaccount affairs with business prospects and even the paintings he ownedkept in a safe not hung on wallshad been bought because his art dealer said they would appreciate to him money was like the toy banknotes in monopoly he wanted it not for what it could buy but because it was needed to play the game still his lifestyle was not uncomfortable a primaryschool teacher or the wife of an agricultural laborer would have thought he lived in unpardonable luxury the room he used as his own office was small there was a desk bearing three telephones a swivel chair behind it two more chairs for callers and a long upholstered couch against the wall the bookshelf beside the wall safe held scores of weighty volumes on taxation and company law it was a room without a personality no photographs of loved ones on the desk no pictures on the walls no foolish plastic penholder given by a wellmeaning grandchild no ashtray brought home from clovelly or stolen from the hilton laskis secretary was an efficient overweight girl who wore her skirts too short he often told people when they were giving out sex appeal carol was elsewhere getting extra rations of brains that was a good joke an english joke the kind directors told each other in the executive canteen carol had arrived at nine twentyfive to find her bosss out tray full of work which had not been there last night laski liked to do things like that it impressed the staff and helped to counteract envy carol had not touched the papers until she had made him coffee he liked that too he was sitting on the couch hidden behind the times with the coffee near him on the arm of the chair when ellen hamilton came in she closed the door silently and tiptoed across the carpet so that he did not see her until she pushed the newspaper down and looked at him over it the sudden rustle made him jump with shock she said mr laski he said mrs hamilton she lifted her skirt to her waist and said kiss me good morning under the skirt she wore oldfashioned stockings with no panties laski leaned forward and rubbed his face in the crisp sweetsmelling pubic hair his heart beat a little faster and he felt delightfully wicked the way he had the first time he kissed a womans vulva he sat back and looked up at her what i like about you is the way you manage to make sex seem dirty he said he folded the newspaper and dropped it to the floor she lowered her skirt and said sometimes i just get the hots he smiled knowingly and let his eyes roam her body she was about fifty and very slender with small pointed breasts her aging complexion was saved by a deep suntan which she nourished all winter under an ultraviolet lamp her hair was black straight and well cut and the gray hairs which appeared from time to time were swiftly obliterated in an expensive knightsbridge salon she wore a creamcolored outfit very elegant very expensive and very english he ran his hand up the inside of her thigh under the perfectly tailored skirt with intimate insolence his fingers probed between her buttocks he wondered whether anyone would believe that the demure wife of the hon derek hamilton went around with no panties on just so that felix laski could feel her arse anytime he wanted to she wriggled pleasurably then moved slightly away and sat down beside him on the couch where during the last few months she had fulfilled some of his weirdest sexual fantasies he had intended mrs hamilton to be a minor character in his grand scenario but she had turned out to be a very enjoyable bonus he had met her at a garden party the hosts were friends of the hamiltons not of his but he got an invitation by pretending a financial fancy for the hosts company a lightengineering group it was a hot day in july the women wore summer dresses and the men linen jackets laski had a white suit with his tall distinguished figure and faintly foreign looks he cut quite a dash and he knew it there was croquet for the older guests tennis for the young people and a pool for the children the hosts provided endless champagne and strawberries with cream laski had done his homework on the hosteven his pretenses were thoroughand he knew they could hardly afford it yet he had been invited reluctantly and only because he had more or less asked why should a couple who were short of money give a pointless party for people they did not need english society baffled him oh he knew its rules and understood their logic but he would never know why people played the game the psychology of middleaged women was something he understood much more profoundly he took ellen hamiltons hand with just a hint of a bow and saw a twinkle in her eye that and the fact that her husband was gross while she remained beautiful was enough to tell him that she would respond to flirtation a woman like her was sure to spend a great deal of time wondering whether she could still excite a mans lust she might also be wondering whether she would ever know sexual pleasure again laski proceeded to play the european charmer like an outrageous old ham he fetched chairs for her summoned waiters to top up her glass and touched her discreetly but frequently her hand her arm her shoulders her hip there was no point in subtlety he felt if she wanted to be seduced he might as well give the message of his availability as clearly as possible and if she did not want to be seduced nothing he could do would change her mind when she had finished her strawberrieshe ate none to refuse mouthwatering food was a mark of classhe began to guide her away from the house they moved from group to group lingering where the conversation interested them passing on quickly from social gossip she introduced him to several people and he was able to introduce her to two stockbrokers he knew slightly they watched the children splashing around and laski said in her ear did you bring your bikini she giggled they sat in the shade of a mature oak and looked at the tennis players who were boringly professional they walked along a gravel path which wound through a small landscaped wood and when they were out of sight he took her face in his hands and kissed her she opened her mouth to him and ran her hands up inside his jacket and dug her fingers into his chest with a force that surprised him then she pulled away and looked furtively up and down the path quickly he said have dinner with me soon soon she said then they walked back to the party and split up she left without saying goodbye to him the next day he took a suite at a hotel in park lane and there he gave her dinner and champagne then he took her to bed it was in the bedroom that he discovered how wrong he had been about her he expected her to be hungry but easily satisfied instead he found that her sexual tastes were at least as bizarre as his own over the next few weeks they did everything that two people can do to one another and when they ran out of ideas laski made a phone call and another woman arrived to open up a whole new series of permutations ellen did everything with the delighted thoroughness of a child in a fairground where all the rides are suddenly free he looked at her sitting beside him on the couch in his office as he remembered and he felt suffused with a sentiment which he thought people would probably call love he said to her what do you like about me what an egocentric question i told you what i like about you come on satisfy my ego what is it she looked down at his lap i give you three guesses he laughed would you like coffee no thank you im going shopping i just came in for a quick feel youre a shameless old baggage what a funny thing to say how is derek another funny thing to say hes depressed why do you ask laski shrugged the man interests me how could he possess a prize like ellen hamilton then let her slip through his fingers she looked away talk about something else all right are you happy she smiled again yes i only hope it will last why shouldnt it he said lightly i dont know i meet you and i fuck like like like a bunny what fuck like a bunny this is the correct english expression she opened her mouth and laughed you old fool i love you when youre being all prussian and correct i know you only do it to amuse me so we meet and we fuck like bunnies and you dont think it can last you cant deny the whole thing has an air of impermanence would you have it otherwise he asked carefully i dont know it was the only answer she could give he realized she added would you he chose his words this is the first time i have had occasion to reflect upon the permanence or otherwise of our relationship stop talking like the chairmans annual report if you will stop talking like the heroine of a romantic novelette speaking of chairmens reports i suppose that is what derek is depressed about yes he thinks its his ulcer that makes him feel bad but i know better would he sell the company do you think i wish he would she looked at laski sharply would you buy it i might she stared at him for a long moment he knew that she was evaluating what he had said weighing possibilities considering his motives she was a clever woman she decided to let it pass i must go she said i want to be home for lunch they stood up he kissed her mouth and ran his hands all over her body with sensual familiarity she put a finger into his mouth and he sucked it goodbye she said ill call you laski told her then she was gone laski went to the bookcase and stared unseeingly at the spine of the directory of directors she had said i only hope it can last and he needed to think about that she had a way of saying things that made him think she was a subtle woman what did she want thenmarriage she had said she did not know what she wanted and although she could hardly have said anything else he had a feeling she was sincere so what do i want he thought do i want to marry her he sat down behind his desk he had a lot to do he pressed the intercom and spoke to carol ring the department of energy for me and find out exactly wheni mean what timethey plan to announce the name of the company that won the license for the shield oil field certainly she said then ring fett and co for me i want nathaniel fett the boss right he flipped the switch up he thought again do i want to marry ellen hamilton suddenly he knew the answer and it astonished him ten am the editor of the evening post was under the illusion that he belonged to the ruling class the son of a railway clerk he had climbed the social ladder very fast in the twenty years since he left school when he needed reassurance he would remind himself that he was a director of evening post ltd and an opinion former and that his income placed him in the top nine percent of heads of households it did not occur to him that he would never have become an opinion former were it not that his opinions coincided exactly with those of the newspapers proprietor nor that his directorship was in the proprietors gift nor that the ruling class is defined by wealth rather than income and he had no idea that his readytowear suit by cardin his shaky pluminthemouth accent and his fourbedroom executive home in chislehurst marked him plainly in the jaundiced eyes of cynics like arthur cole as a poor boy made good more plainly than if he had worn a cloth cap and cycle clips cole arrived in the editors office on the dot of ten oclock with his tie straightened his thoughts marshaled and his list typed out he realized instantly that that was an error he should have burst in two minutes late in his shirtsleeves to give the impression he had reluctantly torn himself away from the hot seat in the newsroom powerhouse for the purpose of giving less essential personnel a quick rundown on what was going on in really important departments but then he always thought of these things too late he was no good at office politics it would be interesting to watch how other executives made their entrance into the morning conference the editors office was trendy the desk was white and the easy chairs came from habitat vertical venetian blinds shaded the blue carpet from sunlight and the aluminumandmelamine bookcases had smokedglass doors on a side table were copies of all the morning papers and a pile of yesterdays editions of the evening post he sat behind the white desk smoking a thin cigar and reading the mirror the sight made cole yearn for a cigarette he popped a peppermint into his mouth as a substitute the others came in in a bunch the picture editor in a tightfitting shirt with shoulderlength hair many women would envy the sports editor in a tweed jacket and lilac shirt the features editor with a pipe and a permanent slight grin and the circulation manager a young man in an immaculate gray suit who had started out selling encyclopedias and risen to this lofty height in only five years the dramatic lastminute entrance was made by the chief subeditor the papers designer a short man with closecropped hair wearing suspenders there was a pencil behind his ear when they were all seated the editor tossed the mirror onto the side table and pulled his chair closer to his desk he said no first edition yet no the chief sub looked at his watch we lost eight minutes because of a web break the editor switched his gaze to the circulation manager how does that affect you he too was looking at his watch if its only eight minutes and if you can catch up by the next edition we can wear it the editor said we seem to have a web break every bloody day its this bogpaper were printing on the chief sub said well we have to live with it until we start to make a profit again the editor picked up the list of news stories cole had put on his desk theres nothing here to start a circulation boom arthur its a quiet morning with luck well have a cabinet crisis by midday and theyre twoapenny with this bloody government the editor continued to read the list i like this stradivarius story cole ran down the list speaking briefly about each item when he had finished the editor said and not a splash among em i dont like to lead all day on politics were supposed to cover every facet of the londoners day to quote our own advertising i dont suppose we can make this strad a millionpound violin its a nice idea cole said but i dont suppose its worth that much still well try it on the chief sub said if it wont work in sterling try the milliondollar violin better still the milliondollar fiddle good thinking the editor said lets have a library picture of a similar fiddle and interviews with three top violinists about how they would feel if they lost their favorite instrument he paused i want to go big on the oil field license too people are interested in this north sea oilits supposed to be our economic salvation cole said the announcement is due at twelve thirty were getting a holding piece meanwhile careful what you say our own parent company is one of the contenders in case you didnt know remember that an oil well isnt instant richesit means several years of heavy investment first sure cole nodded the circulation manager turned to the chief sub lets have street placards on the violin story and this fire in the east end the door opened noisily and the circulation manager stopped speaking they all looked up to see kevin hart standing in the doorway looking flushed and excited cole groaned inwardly hart said im sorry to interrupt but i think this is the big one what is it the editor said mildly i just took a phone call from timothy fitzpeterson a junior minister in the i know who he is the editor said what did he say he claims hes being blackmailed by two people called laski and cox he sounded pretty far gone he the editor interrupted again do you know his voice the young reporter looked flustered he had obviously been expecting instant panic not a crossexamination ive never spoken to fitzpeterson before he said cole put in i had a fairly nasty anonymous tip about him this morning i checked it outhe denied it the editor grimaced it stinks he said the chief sub nodded agreement hart looked crestfallen cole said all right kevin well discuss it when i come out hart went out and closed the door excitable fellow the editor commented cole said hes not stupid but hes got a lot to learn so teach him the editor said now whats lined up on the picture desk ron biggins was thinking about his daughter in this he was at fault he should have been thinking about the van he was driving and its cargo of several hundred thousand pounds worth of paper moneysoiled torn folded scribbledon and fit only for the bank of englands destruction plant in loughton essex but perhaps his distraction was forgivable for a mans daughter is more important than paper money and when she is his only daughter she is a queen and when she is his only child well she just about fills his life after all ron thought a man spends his life bringing her up in the hope that when she comes of age he can hand her over to a steady reliable type who will look after her the way her father did not some drunken dirty longhaired potsmoking unemployed fucking layaboutwhat said max fitch ron snapped back into the present did i speak you were muttering max told him you got something on your mind i just might have son ron said i just might have murder on my mind he thought but he knew he did not mean it he accelerated slightly to keep the regulation distance between the van and the motorcyclists he had nearly taken the young swine by the throat though when he had said me and judy thought we might live together like for a whilesee how it goes see it had been as casual as if he were proposing to take her to a matinee the man was twentytwo years of age five years older than judythank god she was still a minor obliged to obey her father the boyfriendhis name was louhad sat in the parlor looking nervous in a nondescript shirt grubby jeans held up with an elaborate leather belt like some medieval instrument of torture and open sandals which showed his filthy dirty feet when ron asked what he did for a living he said he was an unemployed poet and ron suspected the lad was taking the mickey after the remark about living together ron threw him out the rows had been going on ever since first he had explained to judy that she must not live with lou because she ought to save herself for her husband whereupon she laughed in his face and said she had already slept with him at least a dozen times when she was supposed to be spending the night with a girlfriend in finchley he said he supposed she was going to say she was in the pudding club and she said he should not be so stupidshe had been on the pill since her sixteenth birthday when her mother had taken her up to the family planning clinic that was when ron came near to hitting his wife for the first time in twenty years of marriage ron got a pal in the police force to check out louis thurley aged twentytwo unemployed of barracks road harringey the criminal records office had turned up two convictions one for possession of cannabis resin at the reading pop festival and one for stealing food from tescos in muswell hill that information should have finished it it did convince rons wife but judy just said that she knew all about both incidents pot shouldnt be an offense she declared and as far as the theft was concerned ron and his friends had simply sat on the supermarket floor eating pork pies off the shelf until they got arrested they had done it because they believed food should be free and because they were hungry and broke she seemed to think their attitude was totally reasonable unable to make her see sense ron had finally forbidden her to go out in the evening she had taken it calmly she would do as he said and in four months time when she was eighteen she would move into lous studio apartment with his three mates and the girl they all shared ron was defeated he had been obsessed by the problem for eight days and still he could see no way to rescue his daughter from a life of miseryfor that was what it meant without a shadow of doubt ron had seen it happen a young girl marries a wrong un she goes out to work while he sits at home watching the racing on television he does a bit of villainy from time to time to keep himself in beer and smokes she has a few babies he gets nicked and goes inside for a stretch and suddenly the poor girl is trying to bring up a family on the assistance with no husband he would give his life for judyhe had given her eighteen years of itand all she wanted to do was throw away everything ron stood for and spit in his eye he would have wept if he could remember how he could not get it out of his mind so he was still thinking about it at am this day that was why he did not notice the ambush sooner but his lack of concentration made little difference to what happened in the next few seconds he turned under a railway arch into a long curving road which had the river on its lefthand side and a scrap yard on the right it was a mild clear day and so as he followed the gentle bend he had no difficulty in seeing the large car transporter piled high with battered and crushed vehicles reversing with difficulty into the scrap yard gate at first it looked as though the truck would be out of the way by the time the convoy reached it but the driver obviously did not have the angle of approach quite right for he pulled forward again completely blocking the road the two motorcycles in front braked to a halt and ron drew the van up behind them one cyclist heaved his machine onto its stand and jumped up on the footplate of the cab to shout at the driver the trucks engine was revving noisily and black smoke poured from its exhaust in clouds report an unscheduled stop ron said lets work the routine like the book says max picked up the radio microphone mobile to obadiah control ron was looking at the truck it carried an odd assortment of vehicles there was an elderly green van with coopers family butcher painted on the side a crumpled ford anglia with no wheels two volkswagen beetles piled one on top of the other and on the upper rack a large white australian ford with a coachline and a newlooking triumph the whole thing looked a bit unsteady especially the two beetles in a rusty embrace like a pair of copulating insects ron looked back at the cab the motorcyclist was making signs at the driver to get out of the convoys way max repeated mobile to obadiah control come in please we must be quite low ron thought this close to the river maybe reception is bad he looked again at the cars on the transporter and realized that they were not roped down that really was dangerous how far had the transporter traveled with its load of unsecured scrap suddenly he understood give the mayday he yelled max stared at him what something hit the roof of the van with a clang the truck driver jumped out of his cab onto the motorcyclist several men in stocking masks swarmed over the scrap yard wall ron glanced in his wing mirror and saw the two motorcyclists behind the van being knocked from their machines the van lurched and then incomprehensibly seemed to rise in the air ron looked to his right and saw the arm of a crane reaching over the wall to his roof he snatched the microphone from a bemused max as one of the masked men ran toward the van the man lobbed something small and black like a cricket ball at the windshield the next second passed slowly in a series of pictures like a film seen frame by frozen frame a crash helmet flying through the air a wooden club landing on someones head max grabbing the gear stick as the van tilted rons own thumb pressing the talk button on the microphone as he said obadiah mayd the small bomb that looked like a cricket ball hitting the windshield and exploding sending toughened glass fragments into the air in a shower and then the physical blow as the shock wave hit and the quiet darkness of unconsciousness sergeant wilkinson heard the call sign obadiah from the currency shipment but he ignored it it had been a busy morning with three major traffic holdups a crosslondon chase after a hitandrun driver two serious accidents a warehouse fire and an impromptu demonstration in downing street by a group of anarchists when the call came in he was taking a cup of instant coffee and a ham roll from a young west indian girl and saying what does your husband think about you coming to work with no bra the girl who had a large bust said he doesnt notice and giggled constable jones on the other side of the console said there you are dave take the hint wilkinson said what are you doing tonight she laughed knowing he was not serious working she said the radio said mobile to obadiah control come in please wilkinson said another job what im a gogo dancer in a pub topless youll have to come along and see wont you the girl said and she pushed her trolley on the radio said mayd then there was a muffled bang like a burst of static or an explosion the grin faded rapidly from wilkinsons young face he flicked a switch and spoke into the microphone obadiah control come in mobile there was no reply wilkinson called to his supervisor putting a note of urgency into his voice guvnor inspector harry harrison came across to wilkinsons position a tall man he had been running his hands through his thinning hair and now he looked more distraught than he was he said everything under control sergeant i think i caught a mayday from obadiah guv harrison snapped what do you mean think wilkinson had not made sergeant by admitting his mistakes he said distorted message sir harrison picked up the mike obadiah control to mobile do you read over he waited then repeated the message there was no reply he said to wilkinson a distorted message then they go off the air weve got to treat it as a hijack thats all i need he had the air of a man to whom fate has been not merely unjust but positively vindictive wilkinson said i didnt get a location they both turned to look at the giant map of london on the wall wilkinson said they took the river route last time they checked in was at aldgate traffics normal so they must be somewhere like say dagenham great harrison said sarcastically he thought for a moment put out an allcars alert then detach three from east london patrols and send them on a search alert essex and make sure those idle sods know how much bloody money is in that van all right on your bike wilkinson began to make the calls harrison stood behind him for a few moments deep in thought we should get a call before too longsomeone must have seen it happen he muttered he thought a bit more but then if chummy is clever enough to knock the radio out before the boys can call in hes clever enough to do the job somewhere quiet there was a longer pause finally harrison said personally i dont think we stand a sodding chance it was going like a dream jacko thought the currency van had been hoisted over the wall and gently set down beside the cutting gear the four police motorcycles had been tossed aboard the transporter which had then reversed into the yard the riders now lay in a neat line each of them handcuffed hand and foot and the yard gates were shut two of the boys wearing goggles over their stocking masks made a mansized hole in the side of the currency van while another plain blue van was backed up a large rectangle of steel fell away and a uniformed guard jumped out with his hands above his head jesse handcuffed him and made him lie down beside the police escort the cutting gear was wheeled away rapidly and two more men got into the currency van and began to pass the chests out they were put straight into the second van jacko cast an eye over the prisoners they had all been bashed about a bit but not seriously all were conscious jacko was perspiring under the mask but he dared not take it off there was a shout from the cabin of the crane where one of the boys was keeping watch jacko looked up at the same time he heard the sound of a siren he looked around it couldnt be true the whole idea was that they should knock the guards out before they had time to radio for help he cursed the men were looking to him for guidance the transporter had backed behind a pile of a tires so the white motorcycles could not be seen the two vans and the crane looked innocent enough jacko shouted everybody get under cover then he remembered the prisoners no time to drag them out of the way his eye lit upon a tarpaulin he pulled it over the five bodies then dived behind a skip the siren came nearer the car was traveling very fast he heard the squeal of tires as it swung under the railway arch then the scream of the engine as the car touched seventy in third before changing up the sound got louder then suddenly the pitch of the siren dropped and the noise began to recede jacko breathed a sigh of relief then heard the second siren he yelled stay down the second car passed and he heard a third there was the same squeal under the arch the same thirdgear burst after the cornerbut this time the car slowed outside the gate everything seemed very quiet jackos face was unbearably hot under the nylon he felt he was going to suffocate he heard a sound like policemans boots scraping on the gate one of them must be climbing up to have a look over suddenly jacko remembered that there were two more guards in the cab of the van he hoped to christ they didnt come round just now what was the copper up to he hadnt climbed right over but he hadnt fallen back either if they came in for a good look it would all be up no dont panic he thought ten of us can see to a carful of wollies but it would take time and they might have left one in the car who could radio for reinforcementsjacko could almost feel all that money slipping through his fingers he wanted to risk a peep around the side of the skip but he told himself there was no point he would know when they left by the sound of the car what were they doing he looked again at the currency van jesus one of the blokes was moving jacko hefted his shotgun it was going to come to a fight he whispered oh bollocks there was a noise from the vana hoarse yell jacko scrambled to his feet and stepped around the skip with his gun ready there was nobody there then he heard the car pull away with a screech of tires its siren started up again and faded into the distance deaf willie emerged from behind the rusty shell of a mercedes taxi together they went toward the van willie said jolly good fun aint it yes jacko said sourly better than watching the bloody television they looked inside the van the driver was groaning but he did not look badly hurt out you come grandad jacko said through the broken window tea breaks over the voice had a calming effect on ron biggins until then he had been dazed and panicky he did not seem to be hearing properly there was a pain in his head and when he put his hand up to his face he touched something sticky the sight of a man in a stocking mask was curiously bracing it was all very clear an extremely efficient raidin fact ron was somewhat awed by the smoothness of the operation they had known the route and the timing of the currency vans trip he began to feel angry no doubt a percentage of the haul would find its way into the secret bank account of a corrupt detective like most police and security workers he hated bent coppers even more than villains the man who had called him grandad opened the door reaching through the shattered glass of the side window to operate the internal lock ron got out the movement hurt him the man was youngron could distinguish long hair underneath the stocking he wore jeans and carried a shotgun he gave ron a contemptuous push and said hands out neatly together pop you can go to hospital in a minute the pain in rons head seemed to grow with his anger he fought down an urge to kick out at something and made himself remember how he was supposed to behave during a raid dont resist cooperate with them give them the money were insured for it your own life is more valuable to us dont be a hero he began to breathe hard in his concussed mind he confused the young man holding the shotgun with the corrupt detective and with lou thurley panting and groaning on top of innocent virginal judy in some verminous bed at a dingy studio apartment and suddenly he realized that it was this man who had messed up his rons life and that maybe a hero was what he needed to be to win back the respect of his only child and that nogoods like this corrupt detective wearing a stocking mask in bed with judy and carrying a shotgun was the kind who always messed it up for good people like ron biggins so he took two steps forward and punched the astonished young mans nose and the man stumbled and pulled both triggers of his gun shooting not ron but another masked man beside him who screamed blood and fell down and ron stared horrified at the blood until the first man hit him over the head very hard with the metal barrel of the gun and ron passed out again jacko knelt beside deaf willie and pulled the shreds of stocking away from the older mans face willies face was a dreadful mess and jacko went pale jacko and his like usually inflicted wounds upon their victims and one another with blunt instruments consequently jacko had never seen gunshot wounds before and since inhouse training in first aid was not one of the perks in tony coxs management training scheme jacko did not really know what to do but he was capable of quick thinking he looked up the others were standing around staring jacko yelled get on with it you dozy bastards they jumped he bent closer to willie and said can you hear me mate willies face twisted but he was unable to speak jesse knelt on willies other side we got to get him to hospital he said jacko was ahead of him i need a hot car he said he pointed to a blue volvo parked nearby whose is that it belongs to the owner of the yard jesse said perfect help me get willie in there jacko took his shoulders and jesse his legs they carried him to the car whimpering and put him on the backseat the keys were in the ignition one of the men called from the currency truck all done jacko jacko would have struck the man for using his name but he was preoccupied he said to jesse know where youre going yes but youre supposed to come with me never mind ill get willie to hospital somehow and meet you at the farm tell tony what happened now drive slow dont shoot the lights pull up at zebra crossings do it like it was a bleeding driving test okay yes jesse said he ran back to the getaway van and tested the rear doors they were locked he stripped the brown paper off the license platesits purpose had been to stop the guards getting the number tony cox thought of everythingand got behind the wheel jacko started the volvo someone opened the yard gate the rest of the men were already getting into their own cars and peeling off their gloves and masks jesse pulled out in the van and turned right jacko followed him out and went the opposite way as he accelerated down the street he glanced at his watch ten twentyseven the whole thing had taken eleven minutes tony was right he had said they would be away and clear in the time it takes a squad car to get from vine street nick to the isle of dogs it had been a beautiful job except for poor deaf willie jacko hoped he would live to spend his share he was approaching the hospital he had figured out the way he would play it but he needed willie to be out of sight he said will can you get on the floor there was no response jacko glanced back willies eyes were such a mess that words like open and shut no longer applied but the poor sod must be unconscious jacko reached behind and pulled the body off the seat onto the floor it fell with a painful bump he steered into the hospital grounds and parked in the car park he got out of the car and followed signs for casualty just inside the entrance he found a pay phone he opened the directory and found the number of the hospital he dialed thumbed a coin into the slot and asked for casualty a phone on a desk near where he stood buzzed twice and the sister picked it up she said one moment please and laid the receiver on the desk she was a plump woman in her forties wearing a crisply starched uniform and a harassed air she wrote a few words in a book then picked the phone up again casualty can i help you jacko spoke quietly watching the sisters face there is a man with shotgun wounds in the back of a blue volvo car in your car park the portly nurse paled you mean here jacko was angry yes you dozy old cow in your own hospital now get off your bum and go and get him he was tempted to slam the phone down but he stopped himself and pressed the cradle instead if he could see the sister then she could see him he held the dead phone to his ear while she put hers down got to her feet summoned a nurse and went out into the car park jacko went farther into the hospital and left by another exit he looked across from the main gate and saw a stretcher being carried across the car park he had done all he could for willie now he needed another car felix laski liked the office of nathaniel fett it was a comfortable room with unobtrusive decor a good place in which to do business it had none of the gimmicks laski used in his own office to give him advantage like a desk by the window so that his own face was in shadow or the low unsteady visitors chairs or the priceless bone china coffee cups which people were terrified of dropping fetts office had the atmosphere of a club for company chairmen no doubt it was deliberate laski noticed two things as he shook fetts long narrow hand first that there was a large apparently littleused desk and second that fett wore a club tie the tie was a curious choice for a jew he reflected then on second thought he decided it was not curious at all fett wore it for the same reason laski wore a beautifully tailored savile row pinstriped suit as a badge which said i too am an englishman so laski thought even after six generations of banking fetts nathaniel is still a little insecure it was a piece of information which could be used fett said sit down laski would you like coffee i drink coffee all day its bad for the heart no thank you a drink laski shook his head refusing hospitality was one of his ways of putting a host at a disadvantage he said i knew your father quite well until he retired his death was a loss this is said of so many people but in his case it is true thank you fett sat back in a club chair opposite laski and crossed his legs his eyes were inscrutable behind the thick glasses it was ten years ago he added so long he was much older than i of course but he knew that like his ancestors i came from warsaw fett nodded the first nathaniel fett crossed europe with a bag of gold and a donkey i did the same journey on a stolen nazi motorcycle and a suitcase full of worthless reichsmarks yet your rise was so much more meteoric it was a putdown laski realized fett was saying we may be jumpedup polish jews but were not half as jumpedup as you the stockbroker was laskis match at this game and with those spectacles to hide his expression he did not need the light behind him laski smiled youre like your father one never knew what he was thinking you havent yet given me anything to think about ah so the small talk is over laski thought im sorry my phone call was a little mysterious it was good of you to see me at short notice you said you had a sevenfigure proposal to put to one of my clients how could i not see you would you like a cigar fett got up and proffered a box from a side table laski said thank you he lingered a little too long over his choice then as his hand descended to take a cigar he said i want to buy hamilton holdings from derek hamilton the timing was perfect but fett showed no flicker of surprise laski had hoped he might drop the box but of course fett had known laski would choose that moment to drop the bombshell had created the moment for just that purpose he closed the box and gave laski a light without speaking he sat down again and crossed his legs hamilton holdings for seven figures exactly one million pounds when a man sells his lifes work he is entitled to a nice round figure oh i see the psychology of your approach fett said lightly this is not entirely unexpected what i dont mean we expected you we expected somebody the time is ripe the bid is substantially more than the value of the shares at current prices the margin is about right fett said laski spread his hands palms upward in a gesture of appeal lets not fence he said its a high offer but less than what the shares will be worth if dereks syndicate gets the oil well which brings me to my only condition the offer depends upon the deal being done this morning fett looked at his watch its almost eleven do you really think this could be doneeven assuming dereks interestedin one hour laski tapped his briefcase i have all the necessary documents drawn up we could hardly read them i also have a letter of intent containing heads of agreement that will satisfy me i should have guessed you would be prepared fett considered for a moment of course if derek doesnt get the oil well the shares will probably go down a bit i am a gambler laski smiled fett continued in which case you will sell off the companys assets and close down the unprofitable branches not at all laski lied i think it could be profitable in its present form with new top management youre probably right well its a sensible offer one that im obliged to put to the client dont play hard to get think of the commission on a million pounds yes fett said coldly ill ring derek he picked up a phone from a coffee table and said derek hamilton please laski puffed at his cigar and concealed his anxiety derek its nathaniel ive got felix laski with me hes made an offer there was a pause yes we did didnt we one million in round figures you would all right well be here what ah i see he gave a faintly embarrassed laugh ten minutes he put the phone down well laski hes coming over lets read those documents of yours while were waiting laski could not resist saying hes interested then he could be he said something else didnt he fett gave the embarrassed little laugh again i suppose theres no harm in telling you he said that if he gives you the company by midday he wants the money in his hand by noon eleven am kevin hart found the address the news desk had given him and parked on a yellow line his car was a twoyearold rover with a v engine for he was a bachelor and the evening post paid fleet street salaries so he was a good deal wealthier than most men aged twentytwo he knew this and he took pleasure in it and he was not old enough to discreetly conceal that pleasure which was why men like arthur cole disliked him arthur had been very ratty when he came out of the editors conference he had sat behind the news desk given out a batch of assignments in the usual way then called kevin and told him to come around to his side of the desk and sit down a sure sign that he was about to be given what the reporters called a bollocking arthur had surprised him by talking not about the way he had barged into the conference but about the story he had asked what was the voice like kevin said middleaged man home counties accent he was choosing his words maybe too carefullyhe might have been drunk or distressed thats not the voice i heard this morning arthur mused mine was younger and cockney what did yours say kevin read from his shorthand i am tim fitzpeterson and i am being blackmailed by two people called laski and cox i want you to crucify the bastards when im gone arthur shook his head in disbelief that all well i asked what they were blackmailing him with and he said god youre all the same and put the phone down on me kevin paused expecting a rebuke was that the wrong question arthur shrugged it was but i cant think of a right one he picked up the phone and dialed then handed the receiver to kevin ask him if hes phoned us in the last half hour kevin listened for a moment then cradled the handset busy signal no help arthur patted his pockets looking for cigarettes youre giving it up said kevin recognizing the symptoms so i am arthur began to chew his nails you see the blackmailers biggest hold over a politician is the threat to go to the newspapers therefore the blackmailers wouldnt ring us and give us the story that would be throwing away their trump card by the same token since the papers are what the victim fears he wouldnt ring us and say he was being blackmailed with the air of one who comes to a final conclusion he finished thats why i think the whole thing is a hoax kevin took it for a dismissal he stood up ill get back to the oil story no arthur said weve got to check it out youd better go round there and knock on his door oh good but next time you think of interrupting an editors conference sit down and count to one hundred first kevin could not suppress a grin sure but the more he thought about it the less chance he gave the story of standing up in the car he had tried to recall what he knew of tim fitzpeterson the man was a lowprofile moderate he had a degree in economics and was reputed to be clever but he just did not seem to be sufficiently lively or imaginative a person to provide blackmailers with any raw material kevin recalled a photograph of fitzpeterson and familya plain wife and three awkward girlson a spanish beach the politician had worn a dreadful pair of khaki shorts at first sight the building outside which kevin now stood seemed an unlikely love nest it was a dirty gray thirties block in a westminster backstreet had it not been so close to parliament it would have become a slum by now as he entered kevin saw that the landlords had upgraded the place with an elevator and a hall porter no doubt they called the flats luxury service apartments it would be impossible he thought to keep a wife and three children here or at least a man like fitzpeterson would think it impossible it followed that the flat was a piedaterre so fitzpeterson might have homosexual orgies or pot parties here after all stop speculating he told himself youll know in a minute there was no avoiding the hall porter his cubbyhole faced the single elevator across a narrow lobby a cadaverous man with a sunken white face he looked for all the world as if he were chained to the desk and never allowed to see the light of day as kevin approached the man put down a book called how to make your second million and removed his glasses kevin pointed to the book id like to know how to make my first nine said the porter in a patiently bored voice what youre the ninth person to say that oh sorry then you ask why im reading it and i say a resident lent it to me and you say youd like to make friends with that resident now that weve got all that out of the way what can i do for you kevin knew how to deal with smart alecks pander pander he told himself aloud he said what numbers mr fitzpeterson in ill ring him for you the porter reached for the house phone just a minute kevin brought out his wallet and selected two notes id like to surprise him he winked and laid the money on the counter the man took the money and said loudly certainly sir as youre his brother five c thanks kevin crossed to the elevator and pressed the button the conspiratorial wink had done the trick more than the bribe he guessed he got into the elevator pressed the button for the fifth floor then held the doors open the porter was reaching for the house phone kevin said a surprise remember the porter picked up his book without replying the elevator creaked upward kevin felt a familiar physical sensation of anticipation he always did just before knocking on a door for a story the feeling was not unpleasant but it was invariably mixed with a trace of worry that he might not score the topfloor landing was graced with a token square of thin nylon carpet and a few fading watercolors tasteless but inoffensive there were four flats each with a bell a letter box and a peephole kevin found c took a deep breath and rang the bell there was no answer after a while he rang again then put his ear to the door to listen he could hear nothing the tension drained out of him leaving him a little depressed wondering what to do he walked across the landing to the tiny window and looked out there was a school across the road a class of girls played netball in the playground from where he was kevin could not tell whether they were old enough for him to lust after he went back to fitzpetersons door and leaned on the bell the noise of the elevator arriving startled him if it was a neighbor maybe he could askthe sight of a tall young policeman emerging from the elevator shocked him he felt guilty but to his surprise the constable saluted him you must be the gentlemans brother the policeman said kevin thought fast who told you that he said the porter kevin came at him fast with another question and why are you here just checking hes all right he didnt turn up for a meeting this morning and his phones off the hook they ought to have bodyguards you know but they wont these ministers he looked at the door no answer no any reason you know of he might have been well ill upset called away kevin said well he rang me up this morning and sounded distressed thats why i came it was a very dangerous game he was playing he knew but he had not lied yet and anyway it was too late to back out the policeman said perhaps we should get the key from the porter kevin did not want that he said i wonder if we should break the door down my god if hes ill in there the policeman was young and inexperienced and the prospect of breaking a door down seemed to appeal to him he said it could be as bad as that you think who knows for the sake of a door the fitzpetersons are not a poor family no sir he needed no more encouragement he put his shoulder to the door experimentally one good shove kevin stood close to him and the two men hit the door simultaneously they made more noise than impact kevin said its not like this in the movies then bit his tonguethe remark was inappropriately flippant the policeman seemed not to notice he said once more this time they both put all their weight into it the doorpost splintered and the female half of the lock came free falling to the floor as the door flew open kevin let the policeman go in first as he followed him into the hall the man said no smell of gas allelectric flats kevin said guessing there were three doors off the tiny hall the first led into a small bathroom where kevin glimpsed a row of toothbrushes and a fulllength mirror the second stood open revealing a kitchen which looked as if it might have been searched recently they went through the third door and saw fitzpeterson immediately he sat in an upright chair at his desk his head in his arms as if he had fallen asleep over his work but there was no work on his desk just the phone a glass and an empty bottle the bottle was small and made of brown glass with a white cap and a white label bearing handwritingthe kind of bottle chemists use to dispense sleeping pills for all his youth the policeman acted commendably fast he said mr fitzpeterson sir very loudly and without pause crossed the room and thrust his hand inside the dressing gown to feel the prone mans heart kevin stood very still for a moment at last the policeman said still alive the young constable seemed to take command he waved kevin toward fitzpeterson talk to him he said then he took a radio from his breast pocket and spoke into it kevin took the politicians shoulder the body felt curiously dead under the dressing gown wake up wake up he said the policeman finished on the radio and joined him ambulance any minute he said lets walk him they took an arm each and tried to make the unconscious man walk kevin said is this what youre supposed to do i bloody well hope so wish id paid attention at my firstaid classes you and me both kevin was itching to get to a phone he could see the headline i save ministers life he was not a callous young man but he had long known that the story which made his name would probably be a tragedy for someone else now that it had happened he wanted to use it before it slipped through his fingers he wished the ambulance would hurry there was no reaction from fitzpeterson to the walking treatment the policeman said talk to him tell him who you are this was getting a bit near the bone kevin swallowed hard and said tim tim its me tell him your name kevin was saved by an ambulance in the street he shouted over the noise of the siren lets get him onto the landing ready they dragged the limp body out through the door as they waited by the elevator the policeman felt fitzpetersons heart again struth i cant feel nothing he said the elevator arrived and two ambulance men emerged the elder took a quick look and said overdose yes the policeman said no stretcher then bill keep him standing the policeman said to kevin do you want to go with him it was the last thing kevin wanted to do i should stay here and use the phone he said the ambulance men were in the elevator supporting fitzpeterson between them were off the elder said and pressed the button the policeman got out his radio again and kevin went back into the flat the phone was on the desk but he did not want the copper listening in maybe there was an extension in the bedroom he went through there was a gray trimphone on a little chipboard bedside unit he dialed the post copy please kevin hart here government minister tim fitzpeterson was rushed to hospital today after attempting to commit suicide point paragraph i discovered the comatose body of the energy ministrys oil supremo after he had told me comma in a hysterical phone call comma that he was being blackmailed point par the minister kevin tailed off you still there the copytaker demanded kevin was silent he had just noticed the blood on the crumpled sheets beside him and he felt ill what do i get out of my work derek hamilton had been asking himself this question all morning while the drugs wore off and the pain of his ulcer became sharper and more frequent like the pain the question surfaced at moments of stress hamilton had begun badly in a meeting with a finance director who had proposed a schedule of expenditure cuts amounting to a fiftypercent shutdown of the entire operation the plan was no goodit would have helped cash flow and destroyed profitabilitybut hamilton could see no alternatives and the dilemma had made him angry he had yelled at the accountant i ask you for solutions and you tell me to close up the bloody shop such behavior toward senior management was quite intolerable he knew the man would certainly resign and might not be dissuaded then his secretary an elegant unflappable married woman who spoke three languages had bothered him with a list of trivia and he had shouted at her too being what she was she probably thought it part of her job to take that kind of maltreatment but that was no excuse he thought and each time he cursed himself and his staff and his ulcer he found himself wondering what am i doing here he ran over possible answers as the car took him the short distance between his office and nathaniel fetts money as an incentive could not be dismissed quite as easily as he sometimes pretended it was true that he and ellen could live comfortably on his capital or even the interest on his capital but his dreams went beyond a comfortable life real success in business would mean a millionpound yacht and a villa in cannes and a grouse moor of his own and the chance to buy the picassos he liked instead of just looking at reproductions in glossy books such were his dreams or such they had beenit was now probably too late hamilton holdings would not make sensational profits in his lifetime as a young man he had wanted power and prestige he supposed in that he had failed there was no prestige in being chairman of an ailing company no matter how big and his power was rendered worthless by the strictures of the accountants he was not sure what people meant when they talked about job satisfaction it was an odd expression calling to mind a picture of a craftsman making a table from a piece of wood or a farmer leading a herd of plump lambs to market business was not like that even if one were moderately successful there would always be new frustrations and for hamilton there was nothing other than business even if he had wanted to he had not the ability to make tables or breed sheep write textbooks or design office blocks he thought again about his sons ellen had been right neither of them was counting on the inheritance if asked for their counsel they would certainly say its yoursspend it nevertheless it went against his instincts to dispose of the business which had made his family rich perhaps he thought i should disobey my instinctfollowing it has not made me happy for the first time he wondered what he would do if he did not have to go to the office he had no interest in village life walking to the pub with a dog on a lead like his neighbor colonel quinton would bore hamilton newspapers would hold no interesthe only read the business pages now and if he had no business even they would be dull he was fond of his garden but he could not see himself spending all day digging weeds and forking in fertilizer what were the things we used to do when we were young it seemed in retrospect that ellen and he had spent an awful lot of time doing absolutely nothing they had gone for long drives in his twoseater sometimes meeting friends for a picnic why why get in a car go a long way eat sandwiches and come back they had gone to shows and to restaurants but that was in the evening yet there had always seemed to be too few free days for them to spend together well it might be time for him and ellen to start rediscovering each other and a million pounds would buy some of his dreams they could have a villaperhaps not in cannes but somewhere in the sud he could buy a yacht big enough for the mediterranean and small enough for him to drive himself the grouse moor was out of the question but there might be enough left for one or two decent paintings this laski fellow was buying a headache however headaches seemed to be his speciality hamilton knew a little about him the man had no background no education no family but he had brains and cash and in hard times those things counted for more than good breeding perhaps laski and hamilton holdings deserved each other it was an odd thing hamilton had said to nathaniel fett tell laski that if i sell him my company by midday i want the money in my hand by noon how eccentric to ask for cash on the nail like the proprietor of a glasgow liquor store but he knew why he had done it the effect had been to take the decision out of his hands if laski could produce the money the deal would be done if not not incapable of making up his mind hamilton had tossed a hapenny suddenly he hoped fervently that laski would be able to raise the cash derek hamilton wanted never to go back to the office the car drew up outside fetts place and he got out the beauty of being an earwig bertie chieseman had found was that you could do almost anything while you were listening to the police radio and the tragedy of it from his point of view was that there was nothing much he wanted to do already this morning he had swept the carpeta process of raising dust only for it to fall again soon afterwardwhile the airwaves were filled with uninteresting messages about traffic in the old kent road he had also shaved at the sink in the corner using a safety razor and hot water from the ascot and fried a single rasher of bacon on the cooker in the same room for his breakfast he ate very little he had called the evening post only once since his first report at eight oclock to tip them off about an ambulance call to a block of flats in westminster the name of the patient had not been mentioned over the air but bertie had surmised from the address that it might just possibly be someone important it was up to the news desk to phone ambulance headquarters and ask the name and if headquarters had been told they would pass the information on often the ambulance men did not make their report until the patient was in the hospital bertie occasionally talked to reporters and he always asked them questions about how they used the information he gave them and turned it into stories he was quite well informed about the mechanics of journalism apart from that and the traffic there had been only shoplifting petty vandalism a couple of accidents a small demonstration on downing street and one mystery the mystery was in east london but that was about all bertie knew he had heard an allcars alert but the subsequent message had been uninformative the cars were asked to look out for a plain blue van with a certain registration number it might simply have been hijacked with a cargo of cigarettes or it might be driven by someone the police wanted to question or it might have been in a robbery the word obadiah had been used bertie did not know why immediately after the alert three cars had been detached from regular patrol to search for the van that meant very little the fuss might be over nothing at allperhaps even some flying squad inspectors runaway wife bertie had known it to happen on the other hand it could be big he was waiting for more information the landlady came up while he was cleaning his frying pan with warm water and a rag he dried his hands on his sweater and got out the rent book mrs keeney in an apron and curlers stared in awe at the radio equipment although she saw it every week bertie gave her the money and she signed the book then she handed him a letter i dont know why you dont have some nice music on she said he smiled he had not told her what he used the radio for as it was against the law to listen to police radio im not very musical he said she shook her head resignedly and went out bertie opened the letter it was his monthly check from the evening post he had had a good spell the check was for five hundred pounds bertie paid no tax he found it difficult to spend all his money the job compelled him to live fairly simply he spent every evening in pubs and on sundays he went out in the car his one luxury a bright new ford capri he went to all sorts of places like a tourist he had been to canterbury cathedral windsor castle beaulieu st albans bath oxford he visited safari parks stately homes ancient monuments historic towns racetracks and funfairs with equal enjoyment he had never had so much money in his life there was enough to buy everything he wanted and a little left over to save he put the check in a drawer and finished cleaning the frying pan as he was putting it away the radio crackled and a sixth sense told him to listen carefully thats right blue bedford sixwheeler alpha charlie london two oh three mother has it what distinguishing marks yes if you look inside youll notice it has a most unusual featuresix large boxes of used notes bertie frowned the radio operator at headquarters was being funny obviously but what he said implied that the missing van was carrying a large sum of money that sort of van did not go missing accidentally it must have been hijacked bertie sat down at his table and picked up the phone felix laski and nathaniel fett stood up when derek hamilton entered the room laski the wouldbe buyer and hamilton the vendor shook hands briefly like boxers before a fight laski realized with a shock that he and hamilton were wearing identical suits dark blue with a pinstripe they even had the same sixbutton doublebreasted jacket without vents but hamiltons gross body took away any elegance the style had on him the most beautiful suit would look like a length of cloth wrapped around a jelly laski knew without looking in a mirror that his own suit appeared to be much more expensive he told himself not to feel superior the wrong attitude could ruin a negotiation he said nice to see you again hamilton hamilton nodded how do you do mr laski the chair squeaked as he sat down the use of mr did not escape laski hamilton would only employ the unadorned surname with his equals laski crossed his legs and waited for fett the broker to open the proceedings he studied hamilton out of the corner of his eye the man might have been handsome in his youth he decided he had a high forehead a straight nose and bright blue eyes right now he looked relaxed with his hands folded in his lap laski thought he has made up his mind already fett said for the record derek owns five hundred and ten thousand shares in hamilton holdings limited a public company another four hundred and ninety thousand are owned by various parties and there are no unissued shares mr laski you offer to buy those five hundred and ten thousand shares for the sum of one million pounds on condition the deed of sale is dated today and signed at twelve noon or that a letter to that intent is so dated and signed quite so laski tuned out as fett continued to enunciate formalities in a dry monotone he was thinking that hamilton probably deserved to lose his wife a woman as vivacious and highly sexed as ellen was entitled to a fullblooded love life her husband had no right to let himself run to seed here i am he thought stealing the mans wife and taking away his lifes work and still he can make me squirm by calling me mister as i see it fett was concluding the deal can be done just as mr laski has outlined it the documents are satisfactory there remains only the larger question of whether and under what conditions derek will sell he sat back with the air of one who has completed a ritual hamilton looked at laski what are your plans for the group he asked laski suppressed a sigh there was no point to any kind of crossexamination he was quite free to tell hamilton a pack of lies he did just that the first step would be a large capital injection he said then an improvement in management services a shakeout at top level in the operating companies and some streamlining in lowperformance sectors nothing could have been farther from the truth but if hamilton wanted to read the script from the top laski was happy to go along with it youve chosen a crucial moment at which to make your offer not really laski said the oil well if it happens will be a bonus what im buying is a fundamentally sound group which is going through a bad patch i shall make it profitable without meddling with its infrastructure that happens to be my particular talent he smiled selfconsciously despite my reputation im interested in running real industries not trading in equities he caught a hostile glance from fett the broker knew he was lying so why the twelve oclock deadline i think the price of hamilton shares will go up unreasonably if you get the license this could be my last chance for some time of buying at a sensible price fair enough hamilton said taking the initiative away from fett but i too have set a deadline how do you feel about that quite happy laski lied in truth he was desperately worried hamiltons wish to see the money in his hand at the time the deal was signed was unexpected laski had planned to pay a deposit today and the balance when final contracts were exchanged but although hamiltons stipulation was eccentric it was perfectly reasonable once the letter had been signed laski was able to trade in the shares either selling them or using them to raise a loan what he planned was to use the sharesat their oilinflated priceto raise the money to pay for the original purchase but he had fallen into the pit he had dug he had tempted hamilton with a fast deal and the old man had gone for it too well laski did not know what he was going to do for he did not have a million poundshe would have been scraping the barrel for the onehundredthousand deposit but he did know what he was not going to do he would not let this deal slip through his fingers quite happy he repeated fett said derek perhaps now is the time you and i should have a few minutes together i dont think so hamilton interrupted unless you plan to tell me that this deal is riddled with pitfalls not at all in that casehamilton turned to laskii accept laski stood up and shook hamiltons hand the fat man was mildly embarrassed by the gesture but it was one laski believed in men like hamilton could always find escape clauses in a contract but they could not bear to renege on a handshake laski said the funds are in the cotton bank of jamaicalondon branch of course i imagine this presents no problem he drew a checkbook from his pocket fett frowned it was a very small bank but perfectly respectable he would have preferred a check drawn on a clearing bank but he could hardly object at this stage without seeming obstructive laski knew he would feel like this laski wrote the check and handed it to hamilton its not often a man pockets a million pounds he said hamilton seemed to become jovial he smiled its not often a man spends it laski said when i was ten years old our rooster died and i went with my father to market to buy a new one it cost the equivalent of oh three pounds but my family had saved for a year to accumulate that money more heart searching went into the purchase of that rooster than any financial deal i have ever done this one included he smiled knowing they were uneasy to hear this story and not caring a million pounds is nothing but a rooster can save a whole family from starvation hamilton mumbled very true laski reverted to his normal image let me call the bank to warn them that this check is on its way surely fett took him to the door and pointed that room is empty valerie will give you a line thank you when i return we can sign the letters laski went into the little room and picked up the phone when he heard the dial tone he looked out of the room to make sure valerie was not listening she was at the filing cabinet laski dialed cotton bank of jamaica laski here give me jones there was a pause good morning mr laski jones ive just signed a check for a million pounds at first there was no reply then jones said jesus you havent got it all the same you will clear the check but what about threadneedle street the bankers voice was rising in pitch we dont have enough cash on deposit at the bank well cross that bridge when we come to it mr laski this bank cannot authorize one million pounds to be transferred from its account at the bank of england to another account at the bank of england because this bank does not have one million pounds on deposit at the bank of england i dont think i can make the situation plainer jones who owns the cotton bank of jamaica jones drew in his breath loudly you do sir quite laski put the phone down twelve noon peter jesse james was perspiring the midday sun was unseasonably strong and the wide glass windshield of the van magnified its heat so that the rays burned his naked meaty forearms and scorched the legs of his trousers he was awful hot as well as that he was terrified jacko had told him to drive slowly the advice was superfluous a mile from the scrap yard he had run into heavy traffic and it had been bumpertobumper since then across half of south london he could not have hurried if he had wanted to he had both of the vans sliding side doors open but this did not help there was no wind when the vehicle was stationary and all he got when he moved was a light breeze of warm exhaust smoke jesse believed driving ought to be an adventure he had been in love with cars since he stole his first motora zephyrzodiac with customized finsat the age of twelve he liked to race away from traffic lights doubledeclutch on bends and scare the hell out of sunday drivers when another motorist dared to sound his horn jesse would yell curses and shake his fist and fantasize about shooting the bastard through the head in his own car he kept a pistol in the glove compartment it had never been used but driving was no fun when you had a fortune in stolen money in the back you had to accelerate gradually and brake evenly give the old slowingdown signal when you pulled up refrain from overtaking and give way to pedestrians at road junctions it occurred to him that there was such a thing as suspiciously good behavior an intelligent copper seeing a youngish bloke in a van poodling along like an old dear on a driving test might well smell a rat he came to yet another junction on the interminable south circular road the light turned from green to amber jesses instinct was to push his foot to the floor and race the signal he gave a weary sigh flapped his arm out of the window like a fool and came to a careful stop he should try not to worrynervous people made mistakes he ought to forget the money think about something else he had driven thousands of miles through the exasperating traffic of london without ever being stopped by the law why should today be different even the old bill couldnt smell hot money the lights changed and he pulled forward the road narrowed into a shopping center where delivery trucks lined the curb and a series of pedestrian crossings slowed the flow of cars the narrow pavements were thronged with shoppers and obstructed by several hawkers flogging substandard costume jewelry and ironingboard covers the women were wearing summery clothesthere was something to be said for the hot weather jesse started to watch the tight tshirts the delightfully loosefitting frocks and the bare knees as he crawled forward a few yards at a time he liked girls with big bottoms and he scanned the crowds for a suitable specimen to undress with his eyes he spotted her a good fifty yards away she was wearing a blue nylon sweater and tight white trousers she probably thought she was overweight but jesse would have told her otherwise she had a nice oldfashioned bra which made her tits look like torpedoes and her highwaisted slacks flared out over big hips jesse peered at her hoping to see her tits wobble they did what he would like to do was to stand behind her and pull her trousers down slowly thenthe car in front moved forward twenty yards and jesse followed it it was a brandnew marina with a vinyl roof maybe he would get one with his share of the takings the line of cars stopped again jesse pulled the handbrake and looked for the plump girl he did not pick her up until the traffic was moving off again as he let the clutch in he saw her looking in the window of a shoe shop her back to him the trousers were so tight that he could see the hem of her panties two diagonal lines pointing to the fork of her thighs he loved it when you could see their panties under the trousers it turned him on almost as much as a bare bum then id slide her panties down he thought andthere was a crash of steel on steel the van stopped with a bump throwing jesse forward against the steering wheel the doors slid shut with a double bang he knew before he looked what he had done and the taste of fear made him feel sick the marina in front had stopped sooner than it needed to and jesse wrapped up in the plump girl with the tight trousers had gone straight into its back he got out of the van the driver of the saloon car was already inspecting the damage he looked up at jesse his face red with anger you mad bastard he spat what are youblind or stupid he had a lancashire accent jesse ignored him and looked at the bumpers of the two vehicles folded together in a steel kiss he made an effort to keep calm sorry pal my fault sorry you people should be banned from the ruddy road jesse stared at the man he was short and portly and wore a suit his round face was a picture of righteous indignation he had the quick aggressiveness of small people and their characteristic backward tilt of the head jesse hated him instantly he looked like a sergeant major jesse would have liked to punch his face or better shoot him through the forehead we all make mistakes he said with forced amiability lets just give each other our names and everything and get on its only a little bump dont make a federal case of it it was the wrong thing to say the short man became even redder youre not getting off that lightly he said the traffic in front had moved on and drivers behind were getting impatient several of them sounded their horns one man got out of his car the marina driver was writing the number of the van in a little notebook that type of man always does have a little notebook and pencil in his jacket pocket jesse thought he closed the book this is bloody careless driving im going to ring the police the driver from behind said how about moving this little lot out the way so the rest of us can get on jesse sensed an ally nothing id rather do mate but this fellow wants to call in kojak on the case the portly man wagged a finger i know your typedrive like a hooligan and let the insurance pay im having you up sonny jim jesse took a step forward clenching his fists then stopped himself he was getting panicky the police have got enough to do he pleaded the other mans eyes narrowed he had seen jesses fear well let them decide whether theyve got better things to do he looked around and spotted a phone booth you stop here he turned away jesse grabbed his shoulder he was scared now he said this is nothing to do with the police the man turned and knocked jesses hand away get off you young punk jesse seized him by the lapels and pulled him onto his toes ill give you punk suddenly he became conscious of the crowd that had gathered looking on with interest there were about a dozen people he stared at them they were mostly housewives with shopping bags the girl with the tight trousers was at the front he realized he was doing all the wrong things he decided to get out of it he let the aggrieved man go and got into the van the man stared at him disbelievingly jesse restarted the stalled engine and backed up there was a wrenching sound as the vehicles parted he could see that the marinas bumper hung loose and its rearlight cluster was smashed fifty quid to put right and a tenner if you do the work yourself he thought wildly the portly man moved in front of the van and stood there like neptune waving an officious finger you stay right here he shouted the crowd was growing as the row became more spectacular there was a lull in the oncoming traffic and the cars behind began to pull out past the accident jesse found first gear and revved the engine the man stood his ground jesse engaged the clutch with a jerk and the van shot forward too late the portly man dived toward the curb jesse heard a dull thud from the nearside wing as he swung out a car behind braked with a squeal of tires jesse changed up and tore away without looking back the street seemed narrow and oppressive traplike as he hurtled along ignoring pedestrian crossings swerving and braking he tried desperately to think he had screwed it all up the whole tickle had gone beautifully and jesse james had pranged the getaway motor a vanload of paper money blown on a fiftynicker crunch arseholes stay cool he told himself it wasnt a blowout until he was locked up there was still time if only he could think he slowed the van and turned off the main road there was no point in attracting attention again he threaded his way through a series of backstreets while he figured it out what would happen now a bystander would phone the police especially as he had knocked down the portly man the vans number was in the little notebook besides somebody in the crowd would have noted it too it would be reported as a hitandrun and the number would go out over the air to patrol cars anything from three minutes to fifteen to get that far another five minutes and they would broadcast a description of jesse what was he wearing blue trousers and an orange shirt arseholes what would tony cox say if he were here to be asked jesse recalled the guvnors fleshy face and heard his voice tell yourself what the problem is right jesse said aloud the police have got my number and description think what youd have to do to solve the problem what the hell can i do tone change my license plate and my appearance then do it right jesse frowned tonys analytical thinking only went so far where the hell could he get license plates and how could he fit them of course it was easy he found his way to a main road and drove along until he came to a garage he pulled on to the forecourt quad stamps he thought jolly good show there was a repair shop back of the pumps a tanker was discharging on the far side the attendant approached cleaning his spectacles on an oily rag five quids worth jesse said wheres the khasi round the side jesse followed the jerked thumb a rough concrete path led alongside the garage he found a broken door marked gents and went past it behind the garage was a small patch of waste ground where newish cars in for repair jostled with rusty doors buckled wings and discarded machinery jesse could not see what he was looking for the back entrance to the repair shop gaped open beside him big enough to drive a bus through there was no point in being furtive he walked in it took a moment to adjust to the gloom after the sunlight outside the air smelled of engine oil and ozone a mini was on a ramp at head height its entrails hanging down obscenely the front end of an articulated truck was wired up to a krypton tester a jaguar on chocks had its wheels off there was no one about he looked at his wristwatch they would be having their dinner he looked around he spotted the things he needed a pair of redandwhite trade plates stood on an oil drum in a corner he crossed the floor and picked them up he looked around again and stole two more things clean overalls hanging on a peg in the brick wall and a length of dirty string off the floor a voice said looking for something brother jesse jerked around his heart in his mouth a black mechanic in a grimy overall stood on the far side of the shop leaning on the gleaming white wing of the jaguar his mouth full of food his afro haircut shifted as he chewed jesse tried to cover the trade plates with the overalls the khasi he said want to change my clothes he held his breath the mechanic pointed outside he said he swallowed and took another bite out of a scotch egg thanks jesse hurried out anytime the mechanic called after him jesse realized the man had an irish accent irish spades that was a new one the pump attendant was waiting beside the van jesse climbed in and threw the overalls and their contents over the seat into the back the attendant looked curiously at the bundle jesse said my overall was hanging out the back door it must be filthy how much we generally charge a fiver for five quids worth i didnt notice it nor did i for fifty bleeding miles i did say five quids worth didnt i thats what you said no charge for the bog jesse gave him a fivepound note and pulled away rapidly he was a little off his route now which was good the area was quieter than the places he had traveled through earlier there were oldish detached houses on either side set back from the road horsechestnut trees lined the pavements he saw a green line bus stop he needed a quiet lane in which to perform the switch he checked his watch again it must be fifteen minutes since the accident there was no time left for finesse he took the next turning the street was called brook avenue all the houses were semis he needed somewhere less exposed for christs sake he could not switch plates in full view of sixty nosy housewives he took another turn and anotherand found a service road behind a little row of shops he pulled in and stopped there were garages and garbage cans and the back doors through which goods were delivered to the stores it was the best he could hope for he climbed over the seat into the back of the van it was very hot he sat on one of the money chests and pulled the overalls up his legs jesus he was nearly there give me a couple more minutes he thoughtit was almost a prayer he stood up bending over and shrugged into the garment if id blown it tony would have slit my throat he thought he shuddered tony cox was a hard bastard he had a bit of a kink about punishment jesse zipped up the overalls he knew about eyewitness descriptions the police would by now be looking for a very big viciouslooking character with desperate eyes wearing an orange shirt and jeans anyone actually looking at jesse would just see a mechanic he picked up the trade plates the string had gonehe must have dropped it he looked around the floor damn there was always a piece of rope floating around on the floor of a van he opened the toolbox and found a length of oily string tied around the jack he got out and went to the front of the van he worked carefully afraid to botch the job by hurrying he tied the redandwhite trade plate over the original license plate just as garages usually did when taking a commercial vehicle for a road test he stood back and examined his work it looked fine he went to the rear of the van and repeated the job on the back plate it was done he breathed more easily changing the plates then jesse jumped and turned his heart sank the voice belonged to a policeman for jesse it was the last straw he could think of no more wrinkles no more plausible lies no more ruses his instincts deserted him he did not have a single thing to say the copper walked toward him he was quite young with ginger sideburns and a freckled nose trouble jesse was amazed to see him smile a ray of hope penetrated his petrified brain he found his tongue plates worked loose he said just tightened them up the copper nodded i used to drive one of these he said conversationally easier than driving a car lovely jobs it crossed jesses mind that the man might be playing a sadistic catandmouse game knowing perfectly well that jesse was the driver of the hitandrun van but pretending ignorance so as to shock him at the last minute easy when theyre running right he said the sweat on his face felt cold well youve done it now on your way youre blocking the road like a sleepwalker jesse climbed into the cab and started the engine where was the coppers car did he have his radio switched off had the overalls and the trade plates fooled him if he were to walk around to the front of the van and see the dent made by the bumper of the marinajesse eased his foot off the clutch and drove slowly along the service road he stopped at the end and looked both ways in his wing mirror he saw the policeman at the far end getting into a patrol car jesse pulled into the road and the patrol car was lost from view he wiped his brow he was trembling gawd stone the crows he breathed evan jones was drinking whiskey before lunch for the first time in his life there was a reason he had a code and he had broken italso for the first time he was explaining this to his friend arny matthews but he was not doing too well for he was unused to whiskey and the first double was already reaching his brain its my upbringing see he said in his musical welsh accent strict chapel we lived by the book now a man can exchange one code for another but he cant shake the habit of obedience see i see said arny who did not see at all evan was manager of the london branch of the cotton bank of jamaica and arny was a senior actuary at fire and general marine insurance and they lived in adjoining mocktudor houses in woking surrey their friendship was shallow but permanent bankers have a code evan continued do you know it caused quite a stir when i told my parents i wanted to be a banker in south wales the grammar school boys are expected to become teachers or ministers or coal board clerks or trade union officialsbut not bankers my mother didnt even know what an actuary was said arny sympathetically missing the point im not talking about the principles of good bankingthe law of the least risk the collateral to morethancover the loan higher interest for longer termi dont mean all that no arny now had no idea what evan did mean but he sensed that evan was going to be indiscreet and like everyone in the city he enjoyed the indiscretions of others have another he picked up the glasses evan nodded assent and watched arny go to the bar the two of them often met in the lounge of pollards before catching the train home together evan liked the plush seats and the quiet and the faintly servile barmen he had no time for the newer kind of pub that was springing up in the square mile trendy crowded cellars with loud music for the longhaired whiz kids in their threepiece suits and gaudy ties drinking lager in pints or continental aperitifs im talking about integrity evan resumed when amy came back a banker can be a fool and survive if hes straight but if he hasnt got integrity absolutely now take felix laski theres a man totally without integrity this is the man whos taken you over to my everlasting regret yes shall i tell you how he got control arny leaned forward in his seat holding a cigarette halfway to his lips okay we had a customer called south middlesex properties they were tied up with a discounting outfit we knew and we wanted an outlet for a lot of longterm money the loan was too big for the property company really but the collateral was vast to cut a long story short they defaulted on the loan but you had the property arny said surely the title deeds were in your vault worthless what we had were copiesand so did several other creditors straightforward fraud indeed although somehow they managed to make it look like mere incompetence however we were in a hole laski bailed us out in exchange for a majority holding shrewd shrewder than you think arny laski practically controlled south middlesex properties mind you he wasnt a director but he had shares and he was employed by them as a consultant and the management was weak so he bought into the cotton bank with the money hed borrowed and defaulted on looks like it doesnt it arny shook his head i find that very hard to credit you wouldnt if you knew the bugger two men in solicitors stripes sat at the next table with halfpints of beer and evan lowered his voice a man totally without integrity he repeated what a stroke to pull there was a note of admiration in arnys voice you could have gone to the newspapersif its true who the hell would publish it other than private eye but its true boy there is no depth to which that man will not sink he took a large swallow of whiskey you know what hes done today it couldnt be worse than the south middlesex deal arny goaded him couldnt it ha evans face was slightly flushed now and the glass trembled in his hand he spoke slowly and deliberately he has instructed meinstructed mind youto clear a rubber check for a million pounds he set down his glass with a flourish but what about threadneedle street my exact words to him the two solicitors looked around and evan realized he had shouted he spoke more quietly my very words youll never believe what he said he said who owns the cotton bank of jamaica then he put the phone down on me so what did you do evan shrugged when the payee phoned up i said the check was good arny whistled what you say makes no difference its the bank of england who have to make the transfer and when they discover that you havent got a million i told him all that evan realized he was close to tears and felt ashamed i have never in thirty years of banking since i started behind the counter of barclays bank in cardiff passed a rubber check until today he emptied his glass and stared at it gloomily have another no you shouldnt either will you resign must do he shook his head from side to side thirty years come on have another no arny said firmly you should go home he stood up and took evans elbow all right the two men walked out of the wine bar and into the street the sun was high and hot lunchhour lines were beginning to form at cafes and sandwich shops a couple of pretty secretaries walked by eating icecream cones arny said lovely weather for the time of year beautiful evan said lugubriously arny stepped off the curb and hailed a taxi the black cab swerved across and pulled up with a squeal evan said where are you going not me you arny opened the door and said to the driver waterloo station evan stumbled in and sat down on the backseat go home before you get too drunk to walk arny said he shut the door evan opened the window thanks he said homes the best place evan nodded i wish i knew what im going to tell myfanwy arny watched the cab disappear then walked toward his office thinking about his friend evan was finished as a banker a reputation for honesty was made slowly and lost quickly in the city evan would lose his as surely as if he had tried to pick the pocket of the chancellor of the exchequer he might get a decent pension out of it but he would never get another job arny was secure if hard up quite the opposite of evans plight he earned a respectable salary but he had borrowed money to build an extension to his lounge and he was having difficulty with the payments he could see a way to earn out of evans misfortune it felt disloyal however he reasoned evan could suffer no more he went into a phone booth and dialed a number the pips went and he thumbed in a coin evening post which department city editor there was a pause then a new voice said city desk mervyn speaking this is arnold matthews hello arny what goes on arny took a deep breath the cotton bank of jamaica is in trouble doreen the wife of deaf willie sat stiffly upright in the front of jackos car clutching a handbag in her lap her face was pale and her lips were twisted into a strange expression compounded of fury and dread she was a largeboned woman very tall with broad hips and tending to plumpness because of willies liking for chips she was also poorly dressed and this was because of willies liking for brown ale she stared straight ahead and spoke to jacko out of the side of her mouth whove took him up the hospital then i dont know doreen jacko lied perhaps it was a job and they didnt want to let on who you know all i know is i get a phone call deaf willies up the hospital tell his missus bang he made a slammingthephonedown gesture liar doreen said evenly jacko fell silent in the back of the car willies son billy stared vacantly out of the window with his long awkward body he was cramped in the small space normally he enjoyed traveling in cars but today his mother was very tense and he knew something bad had happened just what it was he was not sure things were confusing ma seemed to be cross with jacko but jacko was a friend jacko had said that dad was up the hospital but not that he was ill and indeed how could he be for he had been well when he left the house early this morning the hospital was a large brick building faintly gothic which had once been the residence of the mayor of southwark several flatroofed extensions had been built in the grounds and tarmacadamed car parks had obliterated the rest of the lawns jacko stopped near the entrance to casualty no one spoke as they got out of the car and walked across to the door they passed an ambulance man with a pipe in his mouth leaning against an antismoking poster on the side of his vehicle they went from the heat of the car park into the cool of the hospital the familiar antiseptic smell caused a nauseous surge of fear in doreens stomach green plastic chairs were ranged around the walls and a desk was placed centrally opposite the entrance doreen noticed a small boy nursing a glass cut a young man with his arm in an improvised sling and a girl with her head in her hands somewhere nearby a woman moaned doreen felt panicky the west indian nurse at the desk was speaking into a telephone they waited for her to finish then doreen said have you had a william johnson brought in here this morning the nurse did not look at her just a minute please she made a note on a scribbling pad then glanced up as an ambulance arrived outside she said would you sit down please she came around the desk and walked past them to the door jacko moved away as if to sit down and doreen snatched at his sleeve stay here she commanded im not waiting bloody hoursim stopping here until she tells me they watched as a stretcher was brought in the prone figure was wrapped in a bloody blanket the nurse escorted the bearers through a pair of swing doors a plump white woman in sisters uniform arrived through another door and doreen waylaid her why cant i find out whether my husbands here she said shrilly the sister stopped and took the three of them in at a glance the black nurse came back in doreen said i asked her and she wouldnt tell me the sister said nurse why were these people not attended to i thought the roadaccident case with two severed limbs looked sicker than this lady you did the right thing but theres no need for witticism the plump sister turned to doreen what is your husbands name william johnson the sister looked in a register that name isnt here she paused but we do have an unidentified patient male white medium build middleaged with gunshot wounds to the head jacko said thats him doreen said oh my god the sister picked up the phone youd better see him to find out whether he is your husband she dialed a single number and waited for a moment oh doctor this is sister rowe in casualty i have a woman here who may be the wife of the gunshot patient yes i will well meet you there she hung up and said please follow me doreen fought back despair as they trod the linoleum corridor floors through the hospital she had dreaded this ever since the day fifteen or more years ago when she had discovered she had married a villain she had always suspected it willie had told her he was in business and she asked no more questions because in the days when they were courting a girl who wanted a husband learned not to come on strong but it was never easy to keep secrets in marriage there had been a knock at the door when little billy was still in nappies and willie had looked out the front window and seen a copper before answering the door he said to doreen last night there was a poker game here me and scotch harry and tom webster and old gordon it started at ten and went on till four in the morning doreen who had been up half the night in an empty house trying to get billy to sleep had nodded dumbly and when the old bill asked her she said what willie had told her to say since then she had worried when its only a suspicion you can tell yourself not to worry but when you know your husband is out there somewhere breaking into a factory or a shop or even a bank you cant help wondering if hell ever come home she was not sure why she was so full of rage and fear she did not love willie not in any familiar sense of the word he was a pretty lousy husband always out at night bad with money and a poor lover the marriage had varied from tolerable to miserable doreen had two miscarriages then billy after that they stopped trying they stuck together because of billy and she did not suppose they were the only couple to do that not that willie shouldered much of the burden of bringing up a handicapped child but it seemed to make him just guilty enough to stay married the boy loved his father no willie i dont love you she thought but i want you and i need you i like to have you there in bed and sitting next to me watching television and doing your pools at the table and if that was called love id say i love you they had stopped walking and the sister was speaking ill call you in when doctors ready she said she disappeared into a ward closing the door behind her doreen stared hard at the blank creampainted wall trying not to wonder what was behind it she had done this once before after the componiparts payroll job but then it had been different they had come to the house saying willies up the hospital but hes all rightjust stunned he had put too much gelignite on the safe door and had lost all hearing in one ear she had gone to the hospitala different oneand waited but she had known he was okay after that job she had tried for the first and only time to make him go straight he had seemed willing until he got out of the hospital and was faced with the prospect of actually doing something about it he sat around the house for a few days then when he ran out of money he did another job later he let it slip that tony cox had taken him on the firm he was proud and doreen was furious she hated tony cox ever afterward tony knew it too he had been at their home once eating a plate of chips and talking to willie about boxing when suddenly he looked up at doreen and said what you got against me girl willie looked worried and said go easy tone doreen tossed her head and said youre a villain tony laughed at that showing a mouthful of halfchewed chips then he said sos your husbanddidnt you know after that they went back to talking about boxing doreen never had quick answers for clever people like tony so she said no more her opinion made no difference to anything anyway it would never occur to willie that the fact that she disliked someone was a reason for not bringing him to the house it was willies house even if doreen had to pay the rent out of her income from the mailorder catalog every other week it was a tony cox job that willie had been on today doreen had got that from jackos wifewillie wouldnt tell her if willie dies she thought i swear to god ill swing for that tony cox oh god let him be all rightthe door opened and the sister put her head out would you like to come in please doreen went first a short darkskinned doctor with thick black hair stood near the door she ignored him and went straight to the bedside at first she was confused the figure on the high metalframed bed was covered to the neck in a sheet and from the chin to the top of the head in bandages she had been expecting to see a face and know instantly whether it was willie for a moment she did not know what to do then she knelt down and gently pulled back the sheet the doctor said mrs johnson is this your husband she said oh god willie what have they done her head fell slowly forward until her brow rested on her husbands bare shoulder distantly she heard jacko say thats him william johnson he went on to give willies age and address doreen became aware that billy was standing close to her after a few moments the boy put his hand on her shoulder his presence forced her to deny grief or at least postpone it she composed her features and stood up the doctor looked grave your husband will live he said she put her arm around her son what have they done to him shotgun pellets close range she was gripping billys shoulder very hard she was not going to cry but hell be all right i said hell live mrs johnson but we may not be able to save his eyesight what hes going to be blind doreen shut her eyes tight and screamed no they were all around her very quickly they had been expecting hysterics she fought them off she saw jackos face in front of her and she shouted tony cox done this you bastard she hit jacko you bastard she heard billy sob and she calmed down immediately she turned to the boy and pulled him to her hugging him he was several inches taller than she there there billy she murmured your dads alive be glad of that the doctor said you should go home now we have a phone number where we can reach you ill take her jacko said its my phone but i live close doreen detached herself from billy and went to the door the sister opened it two policemen stood outside jacko said whats this then he sounded outraged the doctor said we are obliged to inform the police in cases like this doreen saw that one of the police was a woman she was seized with the urge to blurt out the fact that willie had been shot on a tony cox job that would screw tony but she had acquired the habit of deceiving the police during fifteen years of marriage to a thief and she knew as soon as the thought crossed her mind that willie would never forgive her for squealing she could not tell the police but suddenly she knew who she could tell she said i want to make a phone call one pm kevin hart ran up the stairs and entered the newsroom of the evening post a lad in a brutus shirt and platform shoes walked past him carrying a pile of newspapers the one oclock edition kevin snatched one off the top and sat down at a desk his story was on the front page the headline was govt oil boss collapses kevin stared for a moment at the delightful words by kevin hart then he read on junior minister mr tim fitzpeterson was found unconscious at his westminister flat today an empty bottle of pills was found beside him mr fitzpeterson a department of energy minister responsible for oil policy was rushed to hospital in an ambulance i called at his flat to interview him at the same time as pc ron bowler who had been sent to check after the minister failed to appear at a committee meeting we found mr fitzpeterson slumped at his desk an ambulance was called immediately a department of energy spokesman said it appears that mr fitzpeterson took an accidental overdose a full inquiry is to be made tim fitzpeterson is he has a wife and three daughters a hospital spokesman said later he is off the critical list kevin read the whole thing through again hardly able to believe what he was reading the story he had dictated over the phone had been rewritten beyond recognition he felt empty and bitter this was to have been his moment of glory and some spineless subeditor had soured it what about the anonymous tip that fitzpeterson had a girlfriend what about the call from the man himself claiming he was being blackmailed newspapers were supposed to tell the truth werent they his anger grew he had not entered the business to become a mindless hack exaggeration was one thinghe was quite prepared to turn a drunken brawl into a gang war for the sake of a story on a slow daybut suppression of important facts especially concerning politicians was not part of the game if a reporter couldnt insist on the truth who the hell could he stood up folded the newspaper and walked across to the news desk arthur cole was putting a phone down he looked up at kevin kevin thrust the paper under his nose whats this arthur weve got a blackmailed politician committing suicide and the evening post says its an accidental overdose cole looked past him barney he called here a minute kevin said whats going on arthur cole looked at him oh fuck off kevin he said kevin stared at him cole said to the reporter called barney ring essex police and find out whether theyve been alerted to look for the getaway van kevin turned away dumbfounded he had been ready for discussion argument even a row but not for such a casual dismissal he sat down again on the far side of the room with his back to the news desk staring blindly at the paper was this what provincial diehards had known when they warned him about fleet street was this what the nutcase lefties at college had meant when they said the press was a whore its not as if im a lousy idealist he thought ill defend our prurience and our sensationalism and ill say with the best of them that the people get the papers they deserve but im not a total cynic not yet for gods sake i believe were here to discover the truth and then to print it he began to wonder whether he really wanted to be a journalist it was dull most of the time there was the occasional high when something went right a story turned good and you got a byline or when a big story broke and six or seven of you got on to the phones at once in a race with the opposition and with each othersomething like that was going on now a currency raid but kevin was out of it but ninetenths of your time was spent waiting waiting for detectives to come out of police stations waiting for juries to return verdicts waiting for celebrities to arrive waiting just for a story to break kevin had thought that fleet street would be different from the midlands evening paper he had joined when he left the university he had been content as a trainee reporter to interview dim selfimportant councilmen to publish the exaggerated complaints of council house tenants and to write stories about amateur dramatics lost dogs and waves of petty vandalism he had occasionally done things he was quite proud of a series about the problems of the towns immigrants a controversial feature on how the town hall wasted money coverage of a lengthy and complex planning inquiry the move to fleet street he had fondly imagined would mean doing the important stories on a national level and dropping the trivia entirely he had found instead that all the serious topicspolitics economics industry the artswere handled by specialists and that the line for those specialist jobs was a long line of bright talented people just like kevin hart he needed a way to shinesomething which would make the posts executives notice him and say young hart is goodare we making the most of him one good break could do it a hot tip an exclusive interview a spectacular piece of initiative he had thought he had found that something today and he had been wrong now he wondered whether it would ever happen he stood up and went to the gents what else can i do he thought i could always go into computers or advertising or public relations or retail management but i want to leave newspapers as a success not a failure while he was washing his hands arthur cole came in the older man spoke to kevin over his shoulder to kevins astonishment he said sorry about that kevin you know how it gets on that news desk sometimes kevin pulled down a length of towel he was not sure what to say cole moved across to the washbasin no hard feelings im not offended kevin said i dont mind you swearing i wouldnt care if you called me the biggest bastard on earth he hesitated this was not what he wanted to say he stared in the mirror for a moment then took the plunge but when my story appears in the paper without half of the facts i start to wonder if i ought to become a computer programmer cole filled the basin with cold water and splashed some on his face he fumbled for the towel and wiped himself dry you ought to know this but ill tell you anyway he began the story we put in the paper consisted of what we know and only what we know we know fitzpeterson was found unconscious and rushed to hospital and we know there was an empty bottle beside him because you saw all that you were in the right place at the right time which incidentally is an important talent for a reporter to have now what else do we know we know we got an anonymous tip that the man had spent the night with a whore and that someone phoned up claiming to be fitzpeterson and saying he was being blackmailed by laski and cox now if we print those two facts we cannot but imply that they are connected with the overdose indeed that he took the overdose because he was being blackmailed over the whore kevin said but that implication is so obvious that surely were deceiving people if we dont print it and what if the calls were hoaxes the tablets were indigestion pills and the mans in a diabetic coma and weve ruined his career isnt that a bit unlikely you bet kevin im ninety percent sure that the truth is the way your original story read but were not here to print our suspicions now lets get back to work kevin followed arthur through the door and across the newsroom he felt like the heroine in the movie who says im so confused i dont know what to do he was half inclined to think that arthur was right but he also felt that things should not be that way a phone rang at an unattended desk and kevin picked it up newsroom are you a reporter it was a womans voice yes madam my name is kevin hart how can i help you my husbands been shot and i want justice kevin sighed a domestic shooting meant a court case which in turn meant there was no way the paper could do much of a story he guessed that the woman was going to tell him who had shot her husband and ask him to print it but it was juries who decided who shot whom not newspapers kevin said tell me your name please doreen johnson five yew street east one my willie was shot on this currency job the womans voice cracked hes been blinded she started to shout it was a tony cox jobso just print that the line went dead kevin put the phone down slowly trying to take it in this was turning out to be one hell of a day for phone calls he picked up his notebook and went to the news desk arthur said got something dont know kevin told him a woman phoned up gave me her name and address she said her husband was on the currency raid that he was shot in the face and blinded and that it was a tony cox job arthur stared cox he said cox someone called arthur kevin looked up annoyed at the interruption the voice belonged to mervyn glazier the papers city editor a stocky young man in battered suede shoes and a sweatstained shirt glazier came nearer and said i may have a story for your pages this afternoon possible collapse of a bank its called the cotton bank of jamaica and its owned by a man called felix laski arthur and kevin stared at one another arthur said laski laski kevin said jesus christ arthur frowned scratched his head and said wonderingly what the hell is going on the blue morris was still tailing tony cox he spotted it in the car park of the pub when he came out he hoped they would not play silly buggers and breathalyze him he had drunk three pints of lager with his smokedsalmon sandwiches the detectives pulled out of the exit a few seconds behind the rolls tony was not concerned he had lost them once today and he could do it again the simplest way would have been to find a fast stretch of road and put his foot down however he would prefer that they did not know they had lost him just like this morning it would not be difficult he crossed the river and entered the west end as he picked his way through the traffic he wondered about the old bills motives in following him around it was partly a simple case of making a nuisance of themselves he was sure what did the briefs call it harassment they figured that if they tailed him long enough he would get impatient or careless and do something stupid but that was only the justification the real motive probably lay in scotland yard politics perhaps the assistant commissioner crime had threatened to take the tony cox firm away from c and give it to the flying squad so c had laid on the surveillance in order to be able to say they were doing something so long as they did not get all serious about it tony did not mind they had got serious once a few years ago at that time tonys firm had been under the eagle eye of the cid at west end central tony had had a close understanding with the detectiveinspector working on his case one week the di had refused his usual money and warned tony that the game was over the only way tony had been able to square it had been to sacrifice some of his soldiers he and the di had set up five middlemanagement villains on extortion charges the five had gone to jail the press had praised the cid for breaking the gangs hold on london and business had gone on as usual sadly that di later went down himself for planting cannabis on a student a sorry end to a promising career tony felt he pulled into a multistory car park in soho he paused at the entry spending a long time taking his ticket from the machine and watched the blue morris in his mirrors one of the detectives jumped out of the car and ran across the road to cover the pedestrian exit the other found a parking space on a meter a few yards awaya position from which he could see cars coming out of the building tony nodded satisfied he drove up to the first floor and stopped the rolls beside the office inside he found a young man he did not know he said im tony cox i want you to park mine and get me one of your longstay motorsone thats not likely to be picked up today the man frowned he had frizzy untidy hair and oilstained jeans with frayed bottoms he said i cant do that mate tony tapped his foot impatiently i dont like saying things twice son im tony cox the young man laughed he stood up putting down a comic and said i dont care who you are you tony hit him in the stomach his large fist landed with a soft thump it was like punching a feather pillow the attendant doubled over moaning and gasping for air im short of time boy tony said the office door opened whats going on an older man in a baseball cap entered oh its you tony having trouble where have you beensmoking in the bog tony said harshly i want a car that cant be traced to me and im in a hurry no problem the older man said he took a bunch of keys from a hook on the asbestos wall got a nice granada in here for a fortnight threeliter automatic a nice bronze color i dont give a toss what color it is tony took the keys over there the man pointed ill park yours tony went out of the office and got into the granada he put on the safety belt and pulled away he paused beside his own car which the man in the cap was now sitting in whats your name tony said im davy brewster tony all right davy brewster tony reached for his wallet and took out two tenpound notes make sure the kid keeps his mouth shut okay no problem thanks very much davy took the money tony pulled away as he drove he put on sunglasses and his cloth cap when he emerged into the street the blue morris was away to his right he put his right elbow on the window ledge covering his face and steered with his left hand the second detective on tonys left had his back to the road so that he could see the pedestrian exit the man was pretending to look in the window of a religious bookshop tony looked in his mirror as he accelerated away neither of them had seen him easy tony said aloud he drove south the car was quite pleasant with automatic gears and powerassisted steering it had a tape deck tony sorted through the cassettes found a beatles cassette and put it on then he lit a cigar in less than an hour he would be at the farm counting the money felix laski had been well worth cultivating tony thought they had met in the restaurant of one of tonys clubs the cox casinos served the best food in london they had to tonys motto was if you serve peanuts you get monkeys for customers he wanted rich people in his gambling clubs not yobboes asking for draft bitter and fivepenny chips he did not like fancy food himself but on the night he met laski he was eating a vast rare tbone steak at a table near the financiers the chef was pinched from pruniers tony did not know what he did to the steaks but the result was sensational the tall elegant man at the next table had caught his eye a finelooking man for his age he was with a young girl whom tony instantly marked as a tart tony had finished his steak and was tucking into a mountain of trifle when the accident happened the waiter was serving laski with canelloni and somehow a halffull bottle of claret got knocked over the tart squealed and jumped out of the way and a few drops of wine spattered laskis brilliant white shirt tony acted immediately he stood up dropping his napkin on the table and summoned three waiters and the maitre dhotel he spoke first to the waiter who had caused the mess go and get changed pick up your cards on friday he turned to the others bernardo a cloth giulio another bottle of wine monsieur charles another table and no bill for this gentleman finally he spoke to the diners im the proprietor tony cox please have your dinner on the house with my apologies and i hope youll have the most expensive dishes on the menu beginning with a bottle of dom perignon laski spoke then these things cant be helped his voice was deep and faintly accented but it is nice to have such a generous oldfashioned apology he smiled it missed my dress the tart said her accent confirmed tonys guess about her profession she came from the same part of london as he did the maitre dhotel said msieur cox the house is full there is no other table tony pointed to his own table whats wrong with that one clear it quickly please dont laski said we wouldnt like to deprive you i insist then please join us tony looked at them both the tart obviously didnt like the idea was the gent just being polite or did he mean it well tony had almost finished so if it didnt work out he could leave the table quite soon i dont want to intrude you wont be laski said and you can tell me how to win at roulette rightoh tony said he stayed with them all evening he and laski got on famously and it was made clear early on that what the girl thought did not count tony told stories of villainy in the world of gambling clubs and laski matched him anecdote for anecdote with tales of stock exchange sharp practice it transpired that laski was not a gambler but that he liked to bring people to the club when they went into the casino he bought fifty pounds worth of chips and gave them all to the girl the evening ended when laski by now quite drunk said i suppose i should take her home and screw her after that they met several timesnever by arrangementin the club and always ended up getting drunk together after a while tony let the other man know that he was gay and laski did nothing about it from which tony concluded that the financier was a tolerant heterosexual it pleased tony to know that he could befriend someone of laskis class the scene in the restaurant was the easiest bit and it was well rehearsed the grand gestures the posture of command the heavy courtesy and a conscious moderating of his accent but to maintain the acquaintance with someone as brainy as rich and as used to moving in neararistocratic circles as laski was seemed quite an achievement it was laski who made the first move toward a deeper relationship they had been braggingdrunk in the early hours of a sunday morning and laski had been talking about the power of money given enough money he said i can find out anything in the cityright down to the combination of the lock on the vault in the bank of england tony said sex is better what do you mean sex is a better weapon i can find out anything in london using sex now that i doubt said laski whose sexual urges were well under control tony shrugged all right challenge me that was when laski made his move the development license for the shield oil field find out whos got itbefore the government makes the announcement tony saw the gleam in the financiers eye and guessed that the whole conversation had been planned why dont you ask me something difficult he countered politicians and civil servants are much too easy it will do laski smiled okay but ive got to challenge you too laskis eyes narrowed go on tony said the first thing that came into his head find out the schedule for deliveries of used notes to the currency destruction plant of the bank of england it wont even cost me money laski said confidently and that was how it had started tony grinned as he drove the ford through south london he did not know how laski had managed to keep his half of the bargain but tonys side had been a doddle who has the information we want the minister whats he like the next thing to a virgina faithful husband is he getting his oats from the wife not much will he fall for the oldest trick in the game like a dream the tape ended and he turned it over he wondered how much money had been in the currency vana hundred grand maybe even a quarter of a million much more than that would be embarrassing you couldnt walk into barclays bank with sacks full of used fivers without arousing suspicion about a hundred and fifty grand would be ideal five gees for each of the boys a few more for expenses and about fifty thousand surreptitiously added to the takings of various legitimate businesses tonight gambling clubs were very useful for concealing illicit income the boys knew what to do with five grand pay off a few debts buy a secondhand car put a few hundred in each of two or three bank accounts give the wife a new coat lend the motherinlaw a couple of bob spend a night in the pub and bang it was all gone but give them twenty thousand and they started to get silly ideas when unemployed laborers and freelance oddjob men were heard to talk about villas in the south of france the law began to get suspicious tony grinned at himself i should worry about having too much money he thought problems of success are the kind i like dont count your chicks before youve laid them jacko sometimes said the van might be full of wornout halfpennies for melting down now that would be a chuckle he was nearly there he started to whistle felix laski sat in his office watching a television screen and tearing a buff envelope into narrow strips the closedcircuit tv was the modern equivalent of the ticker tape and laski felt like the worried broker in an old movie about the crash the set continuously screened market news and price movements in equities commodities and currency there had been no mention of the oil license hamilton shares had dropped five points on yesterday and trading was moderate he finished demolishing the envelope and dropped the scraps into a metal wastepaper basket the oil license should have been announced an hour ago he picked up the blue phone and dialed at the third stroke the time will be one fortyseven and fifty seconds the announcement was more than an hour late he dialed the department of energy and asked for the press office a woman told him the secretary of state has been delayed the press conference will begin as soon as he arrives and the announcement will be made immediately after he opens the conference the hell with your delays laski thought ive got a fortune riding on this he pressed the intercom carol there was no reply he bellowed carol the girl poked her head around the door im sorry i was at the filing cabinet get me some coffee certainly he took from his in tray a file headed precision tubingsales report st quarter it was a piece of routine espionage on a firm he was thinking of taking over he had a theory that capital equipment tended to do well when a slump was bottoming out but does precision have the capacity for expansion he wondered he looked at the first page of the report winced at the sales directors indigestible prose and tossed the file aside when he took a gamble and lost he could accept it with equanimity what threw him was something going wrong for unknown reasons he knew he would not be able to concentrate on anything until the shield business was settled he fingered the sharp crease of his trousers and thought about tony cox he had taken to the young hoodlum despite his obvious homosexuality because he sensed what the english called a kindred spirit like laski cox had come from poverty to wealth on determination opportunism and ruthlessness also like laski he tried in small ways to take the edge off his lowerclass manners laski was doing it better but only because he had been practicing longer cox wanted to be like laski and he would make itby the time he was in his fifties he would be a distinguished grayhaired city gent laski realized he did not have a single sound reason for trusting cox there was his instinct of course which told him the young man was honest with people he knew but the tony coxes of this world were practiced deceivers had he simply invented the whole thing about tim fitzpeterson the television set screened the hamilton holdings price again it was down another point laski wished they wouldnt use that damn computer typeface all horizontal and vertical lines it strained his eyes he began to calculate what he stood to lose if hamilton did not get the license if he could sell the shares right now he would have lost only a few thousand pounds but it would not be possible to dump the lot at the market value and the price was still slipping say a loss of twenty thousand at the outside and a psychological setbackdamage to his reputation as a winner was there anything else at risk what cox planned to do with the information laski had supplied was certain to be criminal however since laski did not actually know about it he could not be convicted of conspiracy there was still britains official secrets actmild by east european standards but a formidable piece of legislation it was illegal to approach a civil servant and get from him confidential data proving that laski had done that would be difficult but not impossible he had asked peters whether he had a big day ahead and peters had said one of the days then laski had said to cox its today well if cox and peters could be persuaded to testify then laski would be convicted but peters did not even know he had given away a secret and nobody would think of asking him suppose cox was arrested the british police had ways of squeezing information out of people even if they did not use baseball bats cox might say he got the information from laski then they would check laskis movements on the day and they might discover he had taken coffee with peters it was a pretty distant possibility laski was more worried about finishing off the hamilton deal the phone rang laski answered yes its threadneedle streetmr ley carol said laski rutted its probably about the cotton bank put him on to jones hes been through to the cotton bank and mr jones has gone home gone home all right ill take it he heard carol say i have mr laski for you now laski the voice was highpitched the accent an aristocratic drawl yes ley here bank of england how are you good afternoon now look here old chaplaski rolled his eyes at this phraseyouve made out rather a large check to fett and company laski paled my god have they presented it already yes well i rather gathered the ink was still wet now the thing is its drawn on the cotton bank as you obviously know and the poor little cotton bank cant cover it do you follow me of course i follow you the bloody man was talking as if to a child nothing annoyed laski more clearly my instructions as to the arrangements for providing these funds have not been followed however perhaps i can plead that my staff might well have thought they had a little time to spare mmm its nice really to have the funds ready before you sign the damn thing you know just to be safe dont you think laski thought fast damn this need not have happened if the announcement had been made on time and where the devil was jones you may have guessed that the check is payment for a controlling interest in hamilton holdings i should think those shares would stand as security oh dear me no ley interrupted that really wouldnt do the bank of england is not in business to finance speculation on the stock market maybe not laski thought but if the announcement had been made and you knew that hamilton holdings now had an oil well you wouldnt be making this fuss it occurred to him that perhaps they did know and hamilton had not got the oil well hence the phone call he felt angry look youre a bank he said ill pay you the rate for twentyfourhour money the bank is not accustomed to being in the money market laski raised his voice you know damn well i can cover that check with ease given a little time if you return it my reputation is gone are you going to ruin me for the sake of a lousy million overnight and a foolish tradition leys voice went very cold mr laski our traditions exist specifically for the purpose of ruining people who sign checks they cannot honor if this draft cannot be cleared today i shall ask the payee to represent that means in effect that you have an hour and a half in which to make a cash deposit of one million pounds at threadneedle street good day damn you laski said but the line was dead he cradled the receiver cracking the plastic of the phone his mind raced there had to be a way of raising a million instantly didnt there his coffee had arrived while he was on the phone he had not noticed carol come in he sipped it and made a face carol he shouted she opened the door yes redfaced and trembling he threw the delicate china cup into the metal wastepaper basket where it shattered noisily he bellowed the bloody coffee is cold the girl turned around and fled two pm young billy johnson was looking for tony cox but he kept forgetting this he had got out of the house quite fast after they all returned from the hospital his mother was doing a lot of screaming there were a few policemen hanging around and jacko had been carted off to the station to help with inquiries the neighbors and relatives who kept dropping in added to the confusion billy liked quiet nobody seemed disposed to get his lunch or pay him any attention so he ate a packet of ginger biscuits and went out the back way telling mrs glebe from three doors down that he was going up to his aunties to watch her color television he had been getting things sorted out as he walked walking helped him to think when he found himself baffled he could look at the cars and the shops and the people for a while to rest his mind he went toward his aunties at first until he remembered that he did not really want to go there he had only said that to stop mrs glebe making trouble then he had to think where he was going he stopped looking in the window of a record shop painstakingly reading the names on the gaudy sleeves and trying to match them to songs he had heard on the radio he had a record player but he never had any money to buy records and his parents taste did not suit him ma liked soppy songs pa liked brass bands and billy liked rockandroll the only other person he knew who liked rockandroll was tony coxthat was it he was looking for tony cox he headed in what he thought was roughly the direction for bethnal green he knew the east end very wellevery street every shop all the bomb sites patches of waste ground canals and parksbut he knew it in bits he passed a demolition site and remembered that granny parker had lived there and had sat stubbornly in her front room while the old houses on either side had been torn down until she had caught pneumonia and died relieving the london borough of tower hamlets of the problem of what to do about her billy had followed the story with interest it was like something on the television yes he knew every particle of the east london landscape but he could not connect them together in his mind he knew commercial road and he knew mile end road but he did not know that they met at aldgate despite this he could almost always find his way home even if sometimes it took longer than he expected and if he really got lost the old bill would run him back to the house in a squad car all the coppers knew his pa by the time he got to wapping he had forgotten his destination again but he thought he was probably going to see the ships he got in through a hole in a fence the same hole he had used with snowy white and tubby toms that day when they caught a rat and the others told billy to take it home to his ma because she would be pleased and cook it for tea she had not been pleased of course she jumped in the air and dropped a bag of sugar and screamed and later she cried and said they shouldnt make fun of billy people often played tricks on him but he did not mind because it was nice to have pals he wandered around for a while he had the feeling that there used to be more ships here in the days when he was little today he could see only one it was a big one quite low in the water with a name on the side which he could not read the men were running a pipe from the ship to a warehouse he stood watching for a while then asked one of the men whats in it the man who wore a cloth cap and a waistcoat looked at him wine mate billy was surprised in the ship all wine full yes mate chateau morocco vintage about last thursday all the men laughed at this but billy did not understand it he laughed all the same the men worked on for a while then the one he had spoken to said what are you doing here anyway billy thought for a moment then said ive forgot the man looked hard at him and mumbled something to one of the others billy heard part of the reply might fall in the bleeding drink the first man went inside the warehouse after a while a docks policeman came along he said to the men is this the lad they nodded and the copper addressed billy are you lost no billy said where are you going billy was about to say he was not going anywhere but that seemed the wrong answer suddenly he remembered bethnal green all right come with me and ill set you on the right road always willing to take the line of least resistance billy walked alongside the copper to the dock gate where do you live then the man asked yew street does your mother know where you are billy decided that the policeman was another mrs glebe and that a lie was called for yes im going up my aunties sure you know the way yes they were at the gate the copper looked at him speculatively then made up his mind all right then off you go dont wander around the docks no moreyoure safer to stop outside thanks billy said when in doubt he thanked people he walked off it was getting easier to remember pa was up the hospital he was going to be blind and it was tony coxs fault billy knew one blind manwell two if you counted squint thatcher who was blind only when he went up west with his accordion but really blind there was only hopcraft who lived alone in a smelly house on the isle of dogs and carried a white stick would pa have to wear sunglasses and walk very slowly tapping the curb with a stick the thought upset billy people usually thought he was incapable of getting upset because he never shed tears that was how they found out he was different when he was a baby he used to hurt himself and not cry ma sometimes said he do feel things but he dont never show it pa used to say that ma got upset often enough for two anyway when really awful things happened like the rat joke that snowy and tubby played billy found he got all boiled up inside and he wanted to do something drastic like scream but it just never happened he had killed the rat and that had helped he had held it with one hand and with the other banged it on the head with a brick until it stopped wriggling he would do something like that to tony cox it occurred to him that tony was bigger than a ratindeed bigger than billy that baffled him so he put it out of his mind he stopped at the end of a street the corner house had a shop downstairsone of the old shops where they sold lots of things billy knew the owners daughter a pretty girl called sharon with long hair a couple of years ago she let him feel her tits but then she ran away from him and would not speak to him anymore for days afterward he had thought of nothing else but the small round mounds under her blouse and the way he felt when he touched them eventually he had realized that the experience was one of those nice things that never happen twice he went into the shop sharons mother was behind the counter wearing candystriped nylon overalls she did not recognize billy he smiled and said hello can i help you she was uneasy billy said hows sharon fine thanks shes out at the moment do you know her yes billy looked around the shop at the assortment of food hardware books fancy goods tobacco and confectionery he wanted to say she let me feel her tits once but he knew that would not be right i used to play with her it seemed to be the answer the woman wanted she looked relieved she smiled and billy saw that her teeth were brownstained like his fathers she said can i serve you with something there was a clatter of shoes on stairs and sharon came into the shop from the door behind the counter billy was surprised she looked much older her hair was short and her tits were quite big wobbling under a tshirt she had long legs in tight jeans she called bye mum she was rushing out billy said hello sharon she stopped and stared at him recognition flickered in her face oh hi billy cant stop then she was gone her mother looked embarrassed im sorryi forgot she was upstairs still its all right i forget a lot of things well can i serve you with something the woman repeated i want a knife it had popped into billys head from nowhere but he knew straightaway that it was right there was no point in banging a strong man like tony cox on the head with a stonehe would just hit you back so you had to knife him in the back like an indian for yourself or your mother me whats it for billy knew he shouldnt tell her that he frowned and said cutting things string and that oh the woman reached into the window display and pulled out a knife in a sheath like boy scouts had billy took all the money out of his trouser pocket money was something he was not good abouthe always let the shopkeeper take however much was needed sharons mother looked and said but youve only got eight pence is it enough she sighed no im sorry well can i have some bubblegum then the woman put the knife back in the window and took a packet of gum from a shelf six pence billy offered his handful of money and the woman took some coins thanks billy said he went out into the street and opened the packet he liked to put it all in his mouth at once he walked on chewing with enjoyment for the moment he had forgotten where he was going he stopped to watch some men digging a hole in the pavement the tops of their heads were level with billys feet he saw with interest that the wall of the trench changed color as it went down first there was the pavement then some black stuff like tar then loose brown earth then wet clay in the bottom lay a pipe made of clean new concrete why did they put pipes under the pavement billy had no idea he leaned over and said why are you putting a pipe under the pavement a workman looked up at him and said were hiding it from the russians oh billy nodded as if he understood after a moment he moved on he felt hungry but there was something he had to do before he went home for lunch lunch he had eaten a packet of biscuits because pa was up the hospital that had something to do with why he was here in bethnal green but he could not quite make the connection he turned a corner looked at the road name on a sign tacked high up on a wall and saw that he was on quill street now he remembered this was where tony cox livedat number nineteen he would knock on the doorno he didnt know why but he felt sure he ought to creep in by the back door there was a lane behind the terrace billy walked along it until he came to the back of tonys house all the taste was gone from his bubblegum so he took it out of his mouth and threw it away before quietly unlatching the back gate and walking stealthily in tony cox drove slowly along the rutted mud track out of consideration for his own comfort rather than for the owner of the borrowed car the lane which had no name led from a broad to a farmhouse with a barn the barn the empty dilapidated house and the acre of infertile land surrounding them were owned by a company called land development ltd which was in turn owned by a compulsive gambler who owed tony cox a lot of money the barn was occasionally used to store job lots of firedamaged goods bought at rockbottom prices so it was not unusual for a van and a car to draw up in the farmyard the fivebar gate at the end of the lane was open and tony drove in there was no sign of the blue van but jesse was leaning against the farmhouse wall smoking a cigarette he came across to open the car door for tony it havent gone smooth tony he said immediately tony got out of the car is the money here in the van jesse jerked his head toward the barn but it never went smooth lets get insideits too hot out here tony heaved the barn door open and stepped in jesse followed him a quantity of packing cases occupied one third of the floor area tony read the labels on a couple they contained surplus forces uniforms and coats the blue van stood opposite the door tony noticed that trade plates had been tied over the original license plates with string what have you been playing at he asked incredulously oh blimey tony wait till you hear what ive had to do well bloody tell me then well i had a prang seenothing much just a little bump but the geezer gets out of his car and wants to call the police so i pisses off dont i but he stands in the way and i hits him tony cursed softly now fear showed in jesses face well i knew the law would be looking for me didnt i so i stops at this garage goes round the back to the khasi and nicks a set of trade plates and these overalls he nodded eagerly as if to lend his own approval to his actions then i come on here tony stared at him in amazement then burst out laughing you mad bastard he chuckled jesse looked relieved i done the best thing for it though didnt i tonys laughter subsided you mad bastard he repeated here you are with a fortune in hot money in the van and you stophis chest heaved and he wheezed with renewed laughteryou stop at a garage and nick a pair of overalls jesse smiled too not from amusement but out of the pleasure of a fear removed then he became serious again there is proper bad news though gorblimey what else the van driver tried to be a hero you never killed him tony said anxiously no just knocked him on the head but jackos shooter went off in the fracashe pronounced it frackarseand deaf willie got hit in the boat race hes bad tone oh balls tony sat down suddenly on an old threelegged stool oh poor old willie did they take him up the hospital did they jesse nodded thats why jackos not here hes took him whether he got there alive that bad jesse nodded oh balls he was silent for a while he dont get no luck deaf willie the one ears gone already and his boys a mental case and his wife looks like henry cooperand now this he clicked his tongue in sorrow well give him a double share but it wont mend his head he got up jesse opened the van relieved that he had managed to convey the bad news without suffering tonys wrath tony rubbed his hands together right lets have a look at what we got there were nine gray steel chests in the back of the van they looked like squat metal suitcases each with handles at both ends each secured by a double lock they were heavy the two men unloaded them one by one and lined them up in the center of the barn tony looked at them greedily his expression showed an almost sensual pleasure he said its like ali baba and the forty bloody thieves mate jesse was taking plastic explosive wires and detonators out of a duffel bag in a corner of the barn i wish willie was here to do the bangbangs tony said i wish he was here full stop jesse prepared to blow open the chests he stuck the jellylike explosive all around the locks attached detonators and wires and connected each tiny bomb to the plungertype trigger watching him tony said you seem to know what youre doing ive seen willie do it often enough he grinned maybe i can become the firms peterman willie aint dead tony interrupted gruffly not so far as we know jesse picked up the trigger and trailing wires took it outside tony followed him tony said drive the van outside in case of the petrol going upknow what i mean theres no danger youve never done a peter before and im not taking the risk okay jesse closed the rear doors and backed the van into the farmyard then he opened the bonnet and used crocodile clips to connect the trigger with the vans battery he said hold your breath and pressed the plunger there was a muffled bang the two men went back inside the chests stood in line with their tops hanging open at odd twisted angles you done a good job tony said the chests were neatly and tightly packed the bundles of notes were stacked twenty across ten wide and five deep one thousand bundles per chest each bundle contained one hundred notes that made one hundred thousand notes per chest the first six chests contained tenshilling notes obsolete and worthless tony said jesus h christ the next contained oners but it was not quite full tony counted eight hundred bundles the last chest but one also contained onepound notes and it was full tony said thats better just about right the last chest was packed solid with tenners tony muttered gawd help us jesses eyes were wide how much is it tony one million one hundred and eighty thousand pounds sterling my son jesse gave a whoop of delight were rich were lousy with it tonys face was somber i suppose we could burn all the tenners what are you talking about jesse looked at him as if he were mad what do you mean burn them you going potty tony turned around and gripped jesses arm squeezing hard listen if you go into the rose and crown ask for a half of bitter and a meat pie and pay with a tenner and if you do that every day for a week what will they all think theyll think ive had a tickle youre hurting my arm tone and how long would it take for one of those dirty little snouts in there to get round the nick and spill it five minutes he let go its too much jess your trouble is you dont think this much money youve got to keep it somewhereand if its kept somewhere the old bill can find it jesse found this point of view too radical to digest but you cant throw money away youre not listening to me are you theyve got deaf willie right their driver will connect willie with the raid right and they know willies on my firm so they know we done the job right you bet your life theyll be up your place tonight slitting the mattresses and digging up the potato patch now five grand in oners might be your life savings but fifty grand in tenners gotta be incriminating right i never thought of it that way jesse said the word for it is overkill i suppose you cant put that much money in the abbey national anybody can have a good night at the dogs but if you got too much it proves youve had a tickle see jesse was explaining it back to tony as if to demonstrate that he understood thats it aint it yes tony had lost interest in the lecture he was trying to think of a foolproof way of disposing of hot money in large quantity and you cant walk into barclays bank with over a million nicker and ask to open a savings account can you youre getting it tony said sarcastically suddenly he looked sharply at jesse ah but who can walk into the bank with a pile of money and not arouse suspicion jesse was lost well nobody can you reckon tony pointed to the packing cases of surplus forces clothes open a couple of those boxes i want you dressed as a royal navy seaman ive just had a bloody clever idea an editors conference in the afternoon was rare the editor sometimes said the mornings are fun the afternoons are work up until lunchtime his efforts were expended in the production of a newspaper by two oclock it was too late to do anything significant the content of the paper was more or less determined most of the days editions had been printed and distributed and the editor turned his brain to what he called administrative sludge but he had to be around in case something came up which required a toplevel decision arthur cole believed that such a thing had come up cole the deputy news editor sat opposite the editors oversize white desk on coles left was the reporter kevin hart on his right was mervyn glazier city editor the editor finished signing a pile of letters and looked up what have we got cole said tim fitzpeterson will live the oil announcements been delayed the currency van raiders got away with more than a million and england are all out for seventynine and and theres something going on the editor lit a cigar if the truth were known he quite liked to have his administrative sludge interrupted by something exciting like a story go on cole said you remember kevin came in during the morning conference a little overexcited about a phone call allegedly from tim fitzpeterson the editor smiled indulgently if young reporters dont get excited what the hell will they be like when they get old well its possible kevin was right to say it was the big one remember the names of the people allegedly blackmailing fitzpeterson cox and laski cole turned to hart okay kevin hart uncrossed his legs and leaned forward another phone call this time from a woman who gave her name and address she said that her husband william johnson had been on the currency van raid that he had been shot and blinded and that it was a tony cox job the editor said tony cox did you follow it up there is a william johnson in hospital with shotgun wounds to the face and theres a detective beside his bed waiting for him to come round i went to see the wife but she wouldnt speak the editor who had once been a crime reporter said tony cox is a very big fish id believe anything of him not at all a nice man go on cole said the next bit is mervyns theres a bank in trouble the city editor said the cotton bank of jamaicaits a foreign bank with a branch in london does a lot of uk business anyway its owned by a man called felix laski how do we know the editor asked that its in trouble i mean well i got a tip from a contact i rang threadneedle street to check it out of course they wont give a straight answer but the noises they made tended to confirm the tip tell me exactly what was said glazier pulled out his pad he could write shorthand at words per minute and his notes were always immaculate i spoke to a man called ley who is most likely to be dealing with it i happen to know him because skip the commercial mervyn the editor interrupted we all know how good your contacts are glazier grinned sorry first i asked him if he knew anything about the cotton bank of jamaica he said the bank of england knows a good deal about every bank in london i said then youll know just how viable the cotton bank is at the moment he said of course which is not to say that im going to tell you i said theyre about to go undertrue or false he said pass i said come on donald this isnt mastermindits peoples money he said you know i cant talk about that sort of thing banks are our customers we respect their trust i said i am going to print a story saying that the cotton bank is about to fold are you or are you not telling me that such a story would be false he said im telling you to check your facts first thats about it glazier closed his notebook if the bank was okay he would have said so the editor nodded i have never liked that kind of reasoning but in this case youre probably right he tapped his cigar on a large glass ashtray where does it get us cole summed up cox and laski blackmail fitzpeterson fitzpeterson tries to kill himself cox does a raid laski goes bust he shrugged theres something going on what do you want to do find out isnt that what were here for the editor got up and went to the window as if to make time in which to consider he made a small adjustment to his blinds and the room became slightly brighter slats of sunshine appeared on the rich blue carpet picking out the sculptured pattern he returned to his desk and sat down no he said were going to leave it and im going to tell you why one we cant predict the collapse of a bank because our prediction on its own would be enough to cause that collapse just to ask questions about the banks viability would set the city all atremble two we cant try to detect the perpetrators of a currency raid thats the police forces job anyway anything we discover cant be printed for fear of prejudicing a trial i mean if we know its tony cox the police must know and the law says that if we know an arrest is imminent or likely the story becomes sub judice three tim fitzpeterson is not going to die if we blunder around london asking about his sex life before you know it there will be questions in parliament about evening post reporters scouring the country for dirt on politicians we leave that sort of thing to the sunday rags he laid his hands on his desk palms down sorry boys cole got up okay lets get back to work the three journalists left when they got back to the newsroom kevin hart said if he was editor of the washington post nixon would still be winning elections on a lawandorder ticket nobody laughed three pm i have smith and bernstein for you mr laski thank you carol put him on hello george felix how are you laski put a smile into his voice it was not easy on top of the world has your service improved any george bernstein played tennis not a bit you know i was teaching george junior to play yes now he beats me laski laughed and hows rachel no thinner we were talking about you last night she said you ought to be married i said didnt you know felix is gay she said gay so why cant happy people be married i said no i mean hes a homosexual rachel she dropped her knitting she believed me felix would you credit it laski forced another laugh he was not sure how much longer he could keep this up im thinking about it george marriage dont do it dont do it is that what you called to say no thats just a little thought hovering around in the back of my mind so what can i tell you its a little thing i want a million pounds for twentyfour hours and i thought id put the business your way laski held his breath there was a short silence a million for how long has felix laski been in the money market since i found out how to make a real profit overnight let me in on the secret will you all right after you lend me the money no kidding george can you do it sure we can whats your collateral uhsurely you dont normally ask for collateral against twentyfourhour money laskis fist tightened on the phone until the knuckles bulged whitely youre right and we dont normally lend sums like this to banks like yours okay my collateral is five hundred and ten thousand shares in hamilton holdings just a minute there was a silence laski pictured george bernstein a thickset man with a large head a big nose and a permanent broad grin sitting at an old desk in a poky office with a view of st pauls checking figures in the financial times his fingers playing lightly over the keys of a desktop computer bernstein came back on the line at todays price its not nearly enough felix oh come on this is a formality you know im not going to screw you this is mefelixyour friend he wiped his brow with his sleeve id like to do it but ive got a partner your partner is sleeping so heavily theres a rumor hes dead a deal like this would wake him if he was in his grave try larry wakely felix he might do something for you laski had already tried larry wakely but he did not say so i will how about a game this weekend love to the relief in bernsteins voice was obvious saturday morning at the club ten pounds a game itll break my heart to take your money look forward to it goodbye george take care laski closed his eyes for a moment letting the phone dangle from his hand he had known that bernstein would not lend him the money he was just trying anything now he rubbed his face with his fingers he was not beaten yet he depressed the cradle and got a purring tone he dialed with a chewed pencil the number rang for a long time laski was about to dial again when it answered department of energy press office laski said trying to connect you another womans voice press office good afternoon laski said can you tell me when the secretary of state is going to make the announcement about the oil the secretary of state has been delayed the woman interrupted your news desk has been told and there is a full explanation on the pa wire she hung up laski sat back in his chair he was running scared and he did not like it it was his role to dominate situations such as this he liked to be the only one in the know the manipulator who had everyone else running around trying to figure out what was going on going cap in hand to moneylenders was not his style the phone rang again carol said a mr hart on the line am i supposed to know him no but he says its in connection with the money the cotton bank needs put him on hello laski here good afternoon mr laski it was the voice of a young man im kevin hart of the evening post laski was startled i thought she saidnever mind the money the cotton bank needs yes well a bank in trouble needs money doesnt it laski said i dont think i want to talk to you young man before laski could hang up hart said tim fitzpeterson laski paled what do the cotton banks troubles have anything to do with the attempted suicide of tim fitzpeterson how the hell did they know laskis mind raced maybe they didnt know they might be guessingflying a kite they called it pretending to know something in order to see whether people would deny it laski said does your editor know youre making this call umof course not something in the reporters voice told laski he had struck a chord of fear he pressed the point home i dont know what kind of game youre playing young man but if i hear any more about all this nonsense ill know from where the rumors originated hart said what is your relationship with tony cox who goodbye young man laski put the phone down he looked at his wristwatch it was a quarter past three there was no way he could raise a million pounds in fifteen minutes it looked as if it was all over the bank was going to go under laskis reputation was to be destroyed and he would probably be involved in criminal proceedings he contemplated leaving the country this afternoon he would be able to take nothing with him start all over again in new york or beirut he was too old if he stayed he would be able to salvage enough from his empire to live on for the rest of his life but what the hell kind of a life would it be he swiveled around in his chair and looked out of the window the day was cooling after all it was not summer the high buildings of the city were casting long shadows and both sides of the street below were shaded laski watched the traffic and thought about ellen hamilton today of all days he had decided to marry her it was a painful irony for twenty years he could have had his pick of women models actresses debs even princesses and when at last he chose one he went broke a superstitious man would take that as a sign that he should not marry the option might no longer be open to him felix laski millionaire playboy was one thing felix laski bankrupt exconvict was quite another he was sure his relationship with ellen was not the kind of love that could survive that level of disaster their love was a sensual selfindulgent hedonistic thing quite different from the eternal devotion of the book of common prayer at least that was how it always had been laski had theorized that the permanent affection might come later from simply living together and sharing things after all the nearhysterical lust that had brought them together was sure to fade in time i shouldnt be theorizing he thought at my age i should know this morning the decision to marry her had seemed like a choice he could make coolly lightly even cynically figuring what he would get out of it as if it were just another stock market coup but now that he was no longer in command of the situation he realizedand the thought hit him like a physical blowthat he needed her quite desperately he wanted eternal devotion he wanted someone to care about him and to like his company and to touch his shoulder with affection as she passed his chair someone who would always be there someone who would say i love you someone who would share his old age he had been alone all his life it was quite long enough having admitted that much to himself he went farther if he could have her he would cheerfully see his empire crumble the hamilton holdings deal collapse his reputation destroyed he would even go to jail with tony cox if he thought she would be waiting when he got out he wished he had never met tony cox laski had imagined it would be easy to control a twobit hoodlum like cox the man might be enormously powerful inside his own little world but he surely could not touch a respectable businessman maybe not but when that businessman went into partnershiphowever informalwith the hoodlum he ceased to be respectable it was laski not cox who was compromised by the association laski heard the office door open and swung around in his chair to see tony cox walk in laski stared openmouthed it was like seeing a ghost carol scuttled in behind cox worrying him like a terrier she said to laski i asked him to wait but he wouldnthe just walked in all right carol ill deal with it laski said the girl went out and shut the door laski exploded what the devil are you doing here nothing could be more dangerous ive already had the newspapers on asking me about you and about fitzpetersondid you know he tried to kill himself calm down keep your hair on cox told him calm down the whole thing is a disaster ive lost everything and if im seen with you ill end up in jail cox took a long stride forward grabbed laski by the throat and shook him shut your mouth he growled he threw him backward in his chair now listen i want your help no way laski muttered shut up i want your help and youre going to give it or ill make bloody sure you do go to jail now you know i done this job this morninga currency van i know no such thing cox ignored that well ive got nowhere to hide the money so im going to put it in your bank dont be ridiculous laski said lightly then he frowned how much is it just over a million where outside in the van laski jumped to his feet youve got a million pounds in stolen money outside here in a fucking van yes you are insane laskis thoughts were racing what form is the money in assorted used notes are they in the original containers im not that daft theyve been transferred to packing cases serial numbers out of sequence youre getting the idea slowly if you dont get a move on theyll tow the van away for parking on a yellow line laski scratched his head how will you carry it into the vault i got six of the boys out there i cant let six of your roughnecks carry all that money into my vault the staff will suspect theyre in uniformnavy surplus jackets trousers shirts and ties they look like security guards felix if you want to play twenty questions leave it till afterward eh laski decided all right get moving he ushered cox out and followed him as far as carols desk ring down to the vault he told the girl tell them to prepare to take in a consignment of cash immediately i will be dealing with the paperwork personally and give me an outside line on my phone he strode back into his office picked up the phone and dialed the bank of england he looked at his watch it was three twentyfive he got through to mr ley its laski here he said ah yes the banker was cautious laski forced himself to sound calm ive sorted out this little problem ley the necessary cash is in my vault now i can arrange delivery immediately as you suggested earlier or you can inspect today and take delivery tomorrow um ley thought for a moment i dont think either will be necessary laski it would rather throw us to have to count so much money this late in the afternoon if you can deliver first thing in the morning well clear the check tomorrow thank you laski decided to rub salt in the wound im sorry to have irritated you so much earlier today perhaps i was a little brusque goodbye laski laski hung up he was still thinking fast he reckoned he could drum up about a hundred thousand in cash overnight cox could probably equal that from his clubs they could swap that cash for two hundred thousand of the stolen notes it was just another precaution if all the notes he delivered tomorrow were too worn to be reissued someone might wonder at the coincidence of a theft one day and a deposit the next a leavening of goodcondition currency would allay that suspicion he seemed to have covered everything he allowed himself to relax for a moment ive done it again he thought ive won a laugh of sheer triumph escaped from his throat now to supervise the details he had better go down to the vault to provide reassurance to his no doubt bemused staff and he wanted to see cox and his crew off the premises fast then he would phone ellen ellen hamilton had been at home almost all day the shopping trip she had told felix about was invented she just needed an excuse for going to see him she was a very bored woman the trip to london had not taken long on her return she had changed her clothes redone her hair and taken much longer than necessary to prepare a lunch of cottage cheese salad fruit and black coffee without sugar she had washed her dishes scorning the dishwasher for so few items and sending mrs tremlett upstairs to vacuumclean she watched the news and a soap opera on television began to read an historical novel and put it down after five pages went from room to room in the house tidying things that did not need to be tidied and went down to the pool for a swim changing her mind at the last minute now she stood naked on the tiled floor of the cool summerhouse her swimsuit in one hand and her dress in the other thinking if i cant make up my mind whether or not to go swimming how will i ever summon the willpower to leave my husband she dropped the clothes and let her shoulders sag there was a fulllength mirror on the wall but she did not look in it she took care of her appearance out of scruple not vanity she found mirrors quite resistible she wondered what it would be like to swim in the nude such things had been unheard of when she was young besides she had always been inhibited she knew this and did not fight it for she actually liked her inhibitionsthey gave to her lifestyle a shape and constancy which she needed the floor was deliriously cool she was tempted to lie down and roll over enjoying the feel of the cold tiles on her hot skin she calculated the risk of pritchard or mrs tremlett walking in on her and decided it was too great she got dressed again the summerhouse was quite high up from its door one could see most of the groundsthere were nine acres it was a delightful garden created at the beginning of the last century eccentrically landscaped and planted with dozens of different species of trees it had given her much pleasure but lately it had palled like everything else the place was at its best in the cool of the afternoon a light breeze set ellens printed cotton dress flapping like a flag she walked past the pool into a copse where the leaves filtered the sunlight and made shifting patterns on the dry earth felix said she was uninhibited but of course he was wrong she had simply made an area in her life where constancy was sacrificed for the sake of joy besides it was no longer gauche to have a lover provided one was discreet and she was extremely discreet the trouble was she liked the taste of freedom she realized that she was at a dangerous age the womens magazines she flicked through but never actually read were constantly telling her that this was when a woman added up the years she had left decided they were shockingly few and determined to fill them with all the things she had missed so far the trendy liberated young writers warned her that disappointment lay in that direction how would they know they were just guessing like everyone else she suspected it was nothing to do with age when she was seventy she would be able to find a lively nonagenarian to lust after her if at that age she still cared nor was it anything to do with the menopause which was well behind her it was simply that every day she found derek a little less attractive and felix a little more it had reached the point where the contrast was too much to bear she had let both of them know what the situation was in her indirect manner she smiled as she recalled how thoughtful each had looked after she had delivered her veiled ultimatums she knew her men each would analyze what she had said understand after a while and congratulate himself on his perspicacity neither would know he was being threatened she emerged from the copse and leaned on a fence at the edge of a field the pasture was shared by a donkey and an old mare the donkey was there for the grandchildren and the mare because she had once been ellens favorite hunter it was all right for themthey did not know they were getting old she crossed the field and climbed the embankment to the disused railway line steam engines had puffed along here when she and derek were gay young socialites dancing to jazz music and drinking too much champagne giving parties they could not really afford she walked along between the rusty lines jumping from sleeper to sleeper until something small and furry ran out from under the rotting black wood and scared her she scampered down the bank and walked back toward the house following the stream through rough woodland she did not want to be a gay young thing again but she still wanted to be in love well she had laid her cards on the table as it were with both men derek had been told that his work was edging his wife out of his life and that he would have to change his ways if he was to keep her felix had been warned that she would not be his fancy piece forever both men might bow to her will which would leave her still with the problem of choice or they might both decide they could they could do without her in which case there would be nothing for her to do except to become desolee like a girl in a novel by francoise sagan and she knew that would not suit her well suppose they both were prepared to do as she wished whom would she choose as she rounded the corner of the house she thought felix probably she realized with a shock that the car was in the drive and derek was getting out of it why was he home so early he waved to her he seemed happy she ran to him across the gravel and full of guilt she kissed him kevin hart should have been worrying but somehow he could not summon up the energy the editor had quite explicitly told them not to investigate the cotton bank kevin had disobeyed and laski had asked does your editor know you are making this call the question was often asked by outraged interviewees and the answer was always an unworried nounless of course the editor had forbidden the call so if laski should take it into his head to ring the editoror even the chairmankevin was in trouble so why wasnt he worried he decided that he did not care for his job as much as he had this morning the editor had good reasons for killing the story of course there were always good reasons for cowardice everyone seemed to accept that its against the law was a final argument but the great newspapers of the past had always broken the laws laws at once harsher and more strictly applied than those of today kevin believed that newspapers should publish and be sued or even arrested it was easy for him to believe this for he was not an editor so he sat in the newsroom close to the news desk sipping machine tea and reading his own papers gossip column composing the heroic speech he would like to have made to the editor it was the fag end of the day as far as the paper was concerned nothing less than a major assassination or a multipledeath disaster would get in the paper now half the reportersthose on eighthour shiftshad gone home kevin worked ten hours four days a week the industrial correspondent having taken eight pints of guinness at lunch was asleep in a corner a lone typewriter clacked desultorily as a girl reporter in jeans wrote an undated story for tomorrows first edition the copytakers were arguing about football and the subeditors were composing joke captions for spiked pictures laughing uproariously at each others wit arthur cole was pacing up and down resisting the temptation to smoke and secretly hoping for a fire at buckingham palace every so often he would stop and leaf through the sheets of copy impaled on his spike as if worrying that he might have overlooked the big story of the day after a while mervyn glazier sauntered across from his own small kingdom his shirt was hanging out he sat down beside kevin lighting a steelstemmed pipe and resting one scuffed shoe on the rim of the wastepaper basket the cotton bank of jamaica he said by way of preamble he spoke quietly kevin grinned have you been a naughty boy too mervyn shrugged i cant help it if people ring me up with information anyway if the bank ever was in danger its out now how do you know my tightlipped contact at threadneedle street i have looked more closely at the cotton bank since your call and i find it to be in excellent financial health unquote in other words its been quietly rescued kevin finished his tea and crumpled the plasticpaper cup noisily so much for that i also hear from a quite separate source not a million miles from the council of the stock exchange that felix laski has bought a controlling share in hamilton holdings he cant be short of a few bob then is the council interested no they know and they dont mind do you think we made a big fuss over nothing mervyn shook his head slowly by no means nor do i mervyns pipe had gone out he tapped it into the wastebasket the two journalists looked helplessly at each other for a moment then mervyn got up and went away kevin returned his attention to the gossip column but he could not concentrate he read a paragraph four times without understanding it then gave up some large piece of skulduggery had gone on today and he itched to know what it was the more so because he felt so close to understanding it arthur called him sit behind here while i go to the lav will you kevin walked around the news desk and took a seat behind the news editors bank of telephones and switchboards it gave him no thrill he had the job because at this time of day it hardly mattered he was just the nearest idle man idleness was inevitable on newspapers kevin mused the staff had to be sufficiently many to cope on a big day so they were bound to be too many on a normal day on some papers they gave you silly jobs to do just to keep you busy writing stories from publicity handouts and local government press releases stuff that would never get in the paper it was demoralizing timewasting work and only the more insecure of newspaper executives demanded it a lad came across from the teleprinter room carrying a press association story on a long sheet of paper kevin took it from him and glanced at it he read it with a growing sense of shock and elation a syndicate headed by hamilton holdings today won the license to drill for oil in the last north sea oil field shield the secretary of state of energy mr carl wrightment announced the name of the winning contender at a press conference overshadowed by the sudden illness of his junior minister mr tim fitzpeterson the announcement was expected to provide a muchneeded fillip to the ailing shares of the hamilton print group whose halfyear results published yesterday were disappointing shield is estimated to hold oil reserves which could ultimately amount to half a million barrels a week the hamilton groups partners in the syndicate include scan the engineering giant and british organic chemicals after making the announcement mr wrightment added it is with sadness that i have to tell you of the sudden illness of tim fitzpeterson whose work on the governments oil policy has been so invaluable kevin read the story three times hardly able to believe its implications fitzpeterson cox laski the raid the bank crisis the takeoverall leading in a great frightening circle back to tim fitzpeterson it cant be that he said aloud what have you got arthurs voice came from behind him is it worth a fudge the fudge was what the public called the stop press kevin passed him the story and vacated his chair i think he said slowly that story will persuade the editor to change his mind arthur sat down to read kevin watched him eagerly he wanted the older man to react to jump up and shout hold the front page or something but arthur stayed cool eventually he dropped the sheet of paper on the desk he looked coldly at kevin so what he said isnt it obvious kevin said excitedly no tell me look laski and cox blackmail fitzpeterson into telling them who has won the shield license cox maybe with laskis help raids the currency van and gets a million pounds cox gives the money to laski who uses it to buy the company that got the oil license so what would you like us all to do about it for christs sake we could drop hints or mount an investigation or tell the policeat least tell the police were the only people who know it allwe cant let the bastards get away with it dont you know anything arthur said bitterly what do you mean arthurs voice was as somber as the grave hamilton holdings is the parent company of the evening post he paused then looked kevin in the eye felix laski is your new boss four pm they sat down in the small dining room on either side of the little circular table and he said ive sold the company she smiled and said calmly derek im so glad then against her will tears came to her eyes and her icy selfcontrol weakened and crumbled for the first time since the birth of andrew she saw through the tears the shock in his expression as he realized how much it meant to her she stood up and opened a cupboard saying i think this calls for a drink i got a million pounds for it he said knowing she was not interested is that good as it happens yes but more importantly its enough to keep us comfortably well off for as long as were likely to live she made a ginandtonic for herself would you like a drink perrier please ive decided to go on the wagon for a bit she gave him his drink and sat opposite him again what made you decide no single thing talking to you and talking to nathaniel he sipped his mineral water talking to you mainly the things you said about our lifestyle when does it become final it already has i shant go back to the office ever he looked away from her out through the french windows across the lawn i resigned at twelve noon and i havent felt the ulcer since isnt that marvelous yes she followed his gaze and saw the sun shining redly through the branches of her favorite tree the scots pine have you made any plans i thought we could do that together he smiled directly at her but i shall get up late and eat three small meals a day always at the same times and watch television and see whether i can remember how to paint she nodded she felt awkward they both did suddenly there was a new relationship between them and they were feeling their way unsure what to say or how to behave for him the situation was simple he had made the sacrifice she asked given her his soul and now he wanted her to acknowledge it to accept the gift with some gesture but for her that gesture would mean letting felix go out of her life i cant do it she thought and the words rang in her head like the echoing syllables of a curse he said what would you like us to do it was as if he knew of her dilemma and wanted to force her hand to make her talk about the two of them as a unit i would like us to take a long time deciding she said good idea he got to his feet im going to change my clothes ill come up with you she picked up her drink and followed him he looked surprised and in truth she too was a little shocked it was thirty years since they had been in the habit of watching one another undress they went through the hall and climbed the main staircase together he panted with the effort and said in six months time i shall be running up here he was looking to the future with so much pleasure she with so much dread for him life was beginning again if only he had done this before she met felix he held the bedroom door open for her and her heart missed a beat this had once been a ritual a sign between them a lovers code it had started when they were young she had noticed that he became almost embarrassingly courteous to her when he felt lustful and she said as a joke you only open doors for me when you want to make love then of course they thought of sex every time he opened a door for her and it became his way of letting her know he wanted it one felt the need of such signals in those days nowadays she felt quite happy about saying to felix lets do it on the floor did derek remember was he now telling her that this was the acknowledgment he wanted it had been years and he was so gross was it possible he went into the bathroom and turned on the taps she sat at her dressing table and brushed her hair in the mirror she watched him come out of the bathroom and begin to take off his clothes he still did it the same way first shoes then trousers then jacket he had told her once that this was the way it had to be for the trousers went on the hanger before the jacket and the shoes had to come off before the trousers would she had told him how peculiar a man looked in his shirt tie and socks they had both laughed he removed his tie and unbuttoned his shirt collar with a sigh of relief collars always bothered him perhaps he need not wear them buttoned anymore he took off his shirt then his socks then his vest and finally his underwear shorts then he caught her eye in the mirror there was something close to defiance in his gaze as if he were saying this is what an old man looks like so youd better get used to it she met his eyes for a moment then looked away he went into the bathroom and she heard the surge of the water as he climbed into the bath now that he was out of sight she felt freer to think as if before he might have overheard her thoughts her dilemma had been posed in the most brutal way could she or could she not face the thought of sex with derek a few months ago she might haveno not might but would and eagerlybut since then she had touched the firm muscular body of felix and rediscovered her own body in the sheer physicality of their relationship she forced herself to visualize dereks naked body the thick neck the fatty breasts with tufts of graywhite hair at the nipples the huge belly with its arrow of hair widening to the groin and therewell at least he and felix were much the same there she imagined herself in bed with derek and thought of how he would touch her and kiss her and what she would do to himand suddenly she realized she could do it and take pleasure in it because of what it meant felixs fingers might be skillful and knowing but dereks were the hands she had held for years she might scratch felixs shoulders in passion but she knew she could lean on dereks felix had dashing good looks but in dereks face there were years of kindness and comfort of compassion and understanding perhaps she loved derek and perhaps she was just too old to change she heard him stand up in the bath and she panicked she had not had enough time she was not yet ready to make an irrevocable decision she could not right here and now accept the thought of never having felix inside her again it was too soon she must talk to derek she must change the subject break his mood and hers what could she say he stepped out of the bath now he would be toweling himself and in a moment he would be here she called out who bought the company his reply was inaudible and at that moment the phone rang as she crossed the room to pick it up she repeated who bought the company she lifted the receiver derek shouted a man called felix laski youve met him remember she stood frozen with the phone to her ear not speaking it was too much to take in the implications the irony the treachery the voice from the telephone said in her ear hello hello it was felix she whispered oh god no ellen he said is that you yes ive a lot i want to talk to you about can we meet she stammered ii dont think so dont be like that his deep shakespearean voice was like the music from a cello i want you to marry me oh god ellen speak to me will you marry me suddenly she knew what she wanted and with the realization came the beginning of calm she took a deep breath no i most certainly will not she said she hung up the phone and stood staring at it for several moments slowly and deliberately she took off all her clothes and placed them in a neat pile on a chair then she got into bed and lay waiting for her husband tony cox was a happy man he played the radio as he drove slowly home through the streets of east london in the rolls he was thinking how well everything had gone and he was forgetting what had happened to deaf willie he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel in time to a pop song with a bouncy beat it was cooler now the sun was low and there were streamers of high white cloud in the blue sky the traffic was getting heavier as the rush hour approached but tony had all the patience in the world this evening it had gone well in the end the boys had had their shares and tony had explained how the rest of the money had been hidden in a bank and why he had promised them another payout in a couple of months time and they had been happy laski had accepted the stolen money more readily than tony expected maybe the crafty sod thought he could embezzle some of it just let him try the two of them would have to cook up some scheme for concealing the true nature of any withdrawals tony made from the funds that couldnt be difficult tonight nothing could be difficult he wondered what to do with the evening perhaps he would go to a gay bar and pick up a friend for the night he would dress up put on some fancy jewelry and stuff a roll of tenners into his pocket he would find a boy a couple of years younger than himself and shower him with kindness a wonderful meal a show champagnethen back to the barbican flat he would knock the boy about a bit just to soften him up and then it would be a good night in the morning the boy would go away with his pockets full of money bruised but happy tony enjoyed making people happy on impulse he pulled up outside a corner shop and went in it was a news agents with bright modern decor and new racking along the walls for magazines and books tony asked for the biggest box of chocolates in the shop the young girl behind the counter was fat spotty and cheeky she reached up for the chocolates letting her nylon overalls ride up almost to her bottom tony looked away whos the lucky lady then the girl asked him my mum pull the other one tony paid and got out fast there was nothing more revolting than a revolting woman as he drove away he thought really with a million pounds i should do something more than just go out for a night on the town but there was nothing else he wanted he could buy a house in spain but he got too hot out there he had enough cars world cruises bored him he did not want a mansion in the country there was nothing he collected it made him laugh when he thought of it this way he had become a millionaire in a day and the only thing he could think of to buy was a threepound box of chocolates the money was security though if he went through a bad patcheven if god forbid he did a stretchhe could look after the boys more or less indefinitely running the firm could be expensive at times there were about twenty blokes in all and each of them looked to him for a few quid every friday whether they had had a tickle or not he sighed yes his responsibilities would weigh less heavily now it was worth it for that he pulled up outside his mothers house the dashboard clock said four thirtyfive ma would have tea ready soon perhaps a bit of cheese on toast or a plate of baked beans then some fruit cake or battenberg and canned pears with ideal milk to finish off or she might have got him his favoritecrumpets and jam he would eat again later tonight he had always had a good appetite he entered the house and closed the front door behind him the hall was untidy the vacuum cleaner stood unattended halfway up the stairs a raincoat had fallen from the hall stand onto the tiled floor and there was some kind of mess by the kitchen door it looked as if ma had been called away suddenly he hoped there wasnt bad news he picked up the raincoat and hung it on a hook the dog was out too there was no welcoming bark he went into the kitchen and stopped with one foot still in the hall the mess was awful at first he could not figure out what it was then he smelled the blood it was everywhere walls floor ceiling all over the fridge the cooker and the draining board the stench of the abattoir filled his nostrils and he felt sick but where had it all come from what had caused it he looked around wildly for some clue but there was nothing just the blood he crossed the kitchen in two big squelching strides and flung open the back door then he understood his dog lay on her back in the middle of the little concrete yard the knife was still in herthe same knife he had sharpened too much this morning tony knelt beside the mutilated corpse the body looked shrunken like a balloon with a leak a string of soft blasphemous curses came from tonys lips he stared at the multiple cuts and the bits of cloth between the dogs bared teeth and whispered you put up a fight girl he went to the garden gate and looked out as if the killer might still be there all he could see was a large pink wad of chewed bubblegum on the ground casually thrown away by a child obviously ma had been out when it happened which was a mercy tony decided to clear up before she got back he got a spade from the outhouse between the yard and the garden gate was a small patch of poor soil which the old man used to cultivate intermittently now it was overgrown tony took off his jacket marked out a small square of ground and began to dig the grave did not take him long he was strong and angry too he trod the spade viciously and thought about what he would do to the killer if he ever found him and he would find him the bastard had done it out of spite and when people did things like that they had to boast about it either before or afterward otherwise they would have proved their point to nobody but themselves and that was never enough he knew the type somebody would hear something and tell one of the boys in the hope of a reward it crossed his mind that the old bill might be behind it it was unlikely this was not their style who then he had plenty of enemies but none of them possessed both the hatred and the guts to do a number like this when tony met somebody with that much front he usually hired the bloke he wrapped the dead dog in his jacket and placed the bundle gently in the hole he shoveled the earth back in and made the surface even with the flat of the spade you didnt say prayers for dogs did you no he went back into the kitchen the mess was awful there was no way he could clean it up alone ma would be back any minuteit was a bloody miracle she had stayed out this long he had to have help he decided to ring his sisterinlaw he went through the kitchen trying not to spread the blood around it seemed an awful lot of blood even for a boxer dog he went into the parlor to use the phone and there she was she must have been trying to reach the phone a thin trail of blood led from the door to the body lying stretched full length on the carpet she had been stabbed only once but the cut had been fatal the look of horror frozen on tonys face changed slowly as his features contorted like a squeezed cushion into an expression of despair he raised his arms slowly upward and pressed his palms against his cheeks his mouth opened at last words came and he roared like a bull ma he cried oh god ma he fell to his knees beside the body and cried huge loud racking sobs like the cries of a child in total misery outside in the street a crowd gathered around the parlor window but no one dared to come in the city tennis club was an establishment which had nothing to do with tennis and everything to do with afternoon drinking kevin hart was often struck with the implausibility of its title in an alley off fleet street squeezed in between a church and an office block there was hardly room to play table tennis let alone the real thing if all they wanted was an excuse to serve drinks when the pubs were shut kevin thought they could surely have found something more credible like philately or model railways as it was the nearest they could get to tennis was a coinintheslot machine which displayed a miniature tennis court on a television screen you moved your player by twiddling a knob however it did have three bars and a restaurant and it was a good place to meet people from the daily mail or the mirror who might one day give you a job kevin got there shortly before five oclock he bought a pint of draft beer and sat at a table talking idly to a reporter from the evening news whom he knew vaguely but his mind was not on the conversation inside he was still seething the reporter went away after a little while and kevin saw arthur cole come in and go to the bar to kevins surprise the deputy news editor brought his drink across to the table and sat down by way of greeting arthur said quite a day kevin nodded he really did not want the older mans company he wanted to be alone to sort out how he felt arthur sank half his beer in one and set his glass down with a sigh of satisfaction i didnt get one at lunchtime he explained just to be polite kevin said youve been holding the fort on your own yes cole took out a packet of cigarettes and a lighter and put them on the table ive said no to those all day i wonder how long i can keep it up kevin looked surreptitiously at his watch and wondered whether to move on to el vinos arthur said youre probably thinking you made a mistake ever to join this profession kevin was startled he had not credited cole with that much perspicacity i am you might be right thats very encouraging cole sighed thats your trouble you know you will come out with these clever remarks if ive got to lick boots i am in the wrong profession arthur reached for the cigarettes then changed his mind youve learned something today havent you youre beginning to understand what its all about and if theres anything to you at all youve acquired a trace of humility kevin was angered by the patronizing tone it amazes me that after whats happened today there is nobody around here with a sense of failure cole laughed bitterly and kevin realized he had struck a chord arthurs sense of failure must be more or less permanent the older man said you people are a new breed and i suppose we need you the old waymaking everyone start at the bottom and work their way up slowlywas better at producing reporters than executives god knows theres a shortage of brains in newspaper management i hope youll stick it out want another pint thanks arthur went to the bar kevin was somewhat bemused he had never had anything but criticism from cole yet now the man was asking him to stay in newspapers and become a manager that was not in his plans but only because he had never thought of it it was not what he wanted he liked finding things out writing working for the truth he was not sure he would think about it when arthur came back with the drinks kevin said if this is what happens when i get a big story how am i ever going to get anywhere arthur gave that bitter laugh again you think youre alone do you realize i was news editor today at least for you there will be another story he reached for the packet of cigarettes and this time he lit one kevin watched him inhale yes he thought for me there will be another story for arthur there wont
