marion lennox dating the millionaire doctor dear reader on february wildfire destroyed a vast section of australias southeast corner almost two hundred lives were lost many people lost their homes and vast tracts of farmland and natural bushland were destroyed but in the days that followed we saw our community at its best i was privileged to be part of a livestock appeal and the response left us overwhelmed by human kindness people brought in birdseed and cuttlefish and others staggered in under huge bags of dog food we had people who looked as if they had no money at all coming in with animal bedding foodanything they could think of we had companies donating truckloads of their produce we had vets arriving with veterinary equipment volunteers loaded unloaded distributed out in the burnedout bushland volunteers scattered feed searched for injured animals did whatever was needed volunteers are working still in toris story i wanted to share with you some of my pride in my community and my awe at what people are capable of from the ashes springs new life take care of each other but know that in times of deepest trouble were never truly alone and we can still look forward to love marion lennox this book is dedicated to all the wonderful volunteers who worked tirelessly to save injured wildlife after the australian black saturday bushfires chapter one fiveminute dating was five minutes too long hed dated nine women tonight and the last was the least inspiring of the lot jake glanced down at his fact sheet hoping for help victoria twentynine single there wasnt a lot here to talk about im pleased to meet you victoria he ventured thats terrific he thought wryly snappy dialogue incisive excellent way to start things rolling my friends call me tori she ventured dragging her gaze from the door was she thinking about escaping is this your first try at speed dating yes and you yes this wasnt exactly scintillating he conceded where did he go from here each of his last nine dates had been vivacious and chirpy he hadnt needed to make an effort now when effort was required he wondered whether it was worth it had tori made an effort victoriaor torilooked a real country mouse she was wearing a kneelength black skirt scuffed court shoes and a white blouse with ruffles down the front her chestnutbrown curlshad she cut the fringe herselfhad been pulled into a rough knot simply tied with a white ribbon she wore no make up and no jewellery why was she here if she wasnt prepared to spend some time on her appearance he wondered the lines around her clear green eyes were stretched tight making her seem a lot older than twentynine years but did she care she looked as if she wanted to be here even less than he did which was really saying something the manager of dr jake hunters australian properties had promised jake hed enjoy it but enjoy was so far off the mark jake couldnt believe it but he was here he was stuck he had to make conversation so what do you do for a living i care for injured wildlife thatd be right she looked like a dogooder not that he had anything against dogooders he reminded himself hastily it was just that she lookedthe type so youll have been busy in the fires yes and here was another conversation stopper six months ago wildfire had ripped this little community apart decimating the entire district as an outsider jake didnt know where to take it should he say something like was your house burned was anyone you cared about hurt surely the fact that shed come to speed dating was proof that it hadnt touched her too badly but dont go there he told himself and he didnt which left silence whatwhat about you she asked sounding desperate and he thought three minutes and fifty seconds left i live in the us but i own properties here in the valley and up on the ridge ive come back now to check on them maybe put them on the market were they damaged not badly my managers been taking care of them for me hes the one who talked me into coming tonight so speed datings not your thing no he admitted and decided to be honest she looked the sort of woman who called a spade a spade rob said you were a guy short i got dragged into this at the last minute you dont want to be here no then im wasting your time she said and suddenly the mouse had changed into something else entirely her relief was palpable she rose and took his hand in a grip so firm it surprised him this is the last round so we can finish this now goodnight jake then astonishingly she smiled a wide white smile that had the power to turn her face from plain to something extraordinary but he didnt have a chance to register the smile for long shed released his hand and was heading for the door her sensible heels clicking briskly on the polished wooden floorboards of the combadeen hall and to his further bewilderment the moment she rose she lookedcute definitely cute he thought her curls bounced on her shoulders she had curves in all the right places the badly fitting skirt unable to conceal her tiny waist the lovely lines of her legs and the unconscious wiggle of her hips as she stalked to the door he wasnt the only one watching as she tugged the door open and walked out into the night as the door slammed closed behind her he realised everyone else in the hall was looking as well as astonished as he was hed just been stood up for a speed date hed been stood up by a smile that was truly stunning should he follow um no she was right speed dating was not his thing nor was any other sort of dating he acknowledged he was in town to check on his fathers property to sign documents to put the farmhouse on the ridge on the market and to make a decision about the resort then he was out of here his job back in the states was waiting he had no place here so why was he watching a country mouse stalk away from him as if he cared why had she come her best friend barb had lied to her they cant have been a woman short if that guyjakecould patronise her by saying he was only here to make up numbers to do them all a favour arrogant toerag outside the stars were hanging low in the sky the air was crisp and clean and she filled her lungs as if the hall inside had been full of smoke of course it wasnt though maybe the smell of smoke would never completely leave her the fire that had ripped through these mountains had changed her lifeand she wasnt ready to move on no matter what barb said please come tonight barb had pleaded were desperate to make up the numbers itll be fun come on tori life can be good again you can try so shed tried not very hard she conceded looking ruefully down at her serviceable skirt shed been living courtesy of welfare bins for too long now torior more formally dr victoria nicholls veterinary surgeonhad no financial need of welfare bins but the outpouring of the australian public had been massive the local hall was filled with clothes donated to replace what was burned and it was easier to grab what she needed than to waste time shopping she hadnt shopped since she shook herself dont go there but maybe she had to go there maybe that was part of the healing no she hadnt shopped since the fire she hadnt dated since the fireor before of course but then shed had toby or shed thought shed had toby there was the king of all toerags even the thought of him made her cringe that she could have imagined herself in love with him shed been incredibly appallingly dumb shed made one disastrous mistake that had cost her everything so what on earth was she doing lining up for another oh for heavens sake she was supposed to be moving on there were good people out there she told herself good men she had to learn to trust again jake had seemed bored compelled to be there but sort of interesting maybe barb was right she did need to get out more because jake seemed to have stirred something in her that hadnt been stirred for a long time hed been long and lean and sort ofsculpted rangy he hadnt bothered to shave and there was another mark against him shed gone to all the trouble of finding this stupid blouse and hed come with a fiveoclock shadow mind it had looked incredibly sexy with his deep black haira little bit wavyand his lovely brown eyes and the crinkles around his tanned face that said he normally didnt look as bored as this normally he smiled how stupid was this she gave herself an angry shake shed met ten men tonight all of them seemed uninterested and uninteresting and even though jake seemedinterestinghe was the rudest of the lot shed been stupid once any relationship she might have in the future must thus be dictated by sense and not by hormones and all shed felt with jake was hormones lots of hormones disgusted she climbed into her battered van and headed out of the car park back up the mountain shed been away for long enough no matter what barb said she wasnt ready for a new life she already had an allconsuming one or did she barb was right she accepted the life she knew was coming to an end where did she go from here whereveras long as her decisions were based on sense and not hormones she told herself fiercely and headed back up the mountain anyone strike your fancy jakes manager and friend from university days was watching a blonde totter across the car park to her cute little sports car she was definitely robs choice for the night maybe hed even take it further as opposed to jake he had no intention of ever taking things further yeah it had been crazy to agree to speed dating he was here for less than a week and every one of the women hed met tonight had diamonds in their eyes he didnt do diamonds diamonds had been drilled out of him early jake had been brought up by a mother who spent her life bewailing an australian father who was according to her the lowest form of life on the planet love made you cry his mother told him over and over from the time he was a toddler since shed taken him back to the states andas shed said repeatedlyabandoned her dreams for ever maybe his mothers broken dreams had left their legacy who knew he needed a shrink to tell him but a shrink couldnt change him he didnt do longterm relationships hed never felt the slightest need to take things down that road women were colleagues and friends they were often great companions the occasional mutually casual relationship was great but why open yourself to the angst of commitment rob however had talked about tonight as though it was the answer to his prayers as if diamonds were on his agenda which was ridiculous what do you see in this fiveminute setup he demanded and rob gave a crooked smile my perfect womans out there somewhere i just have to find her so there was no one tonight who struck your fancy your ladys hot jake conceded being generous but no so what did you say to doc nicholls rob asked to make her walk out doc nicholls tori barb says shes the vet up on the ridge part of the group that rent your house im thinking i should have met her before this but since the fires lifes been crazy any negotiations been done through barb then tonighti couldnt make her talk but at least she stayed the full five minutes unlike you you didnt say anything to upset her did you barbll have me hung drawn and quartered if youve hurt her feelings how could i have hurt her feelings you say it like it is rob said not always best i dont tell lies if thats what you mean so what did you tell her just that i was here to make up the numbers right rob said thatd be a turnon im speed dating because im being kind woohoo look it doesnt matter anyway jake said shoving his hands into his pockets and staring out at the vast night sky hankering for manhattan where stars were in shop windows and not straight up ill get the house on the market and leave again though i dont know why you cant do it for me i offered if you remember and for once you decided to take an interest and come do it yourself the figure seemed ludicrously low who wants a house on top of a fireprone ridge it was snapped up pretty fast after the fires only because there was still green feed around it rob said bluntly and you offered it rent free but six months on theres feed everywhere and its smoke damaged property values on the ridge will rise again but not until the memory of the fire fades a bit so many of the people round here lost someone youre lucky you werent living here yourself yeah well luck had all sorts of guises jake thought as they headed back down the valley towards the second property his father had left hima lodge with attached vineyard his mother would definitely say he was lucky not to live here his mother would be devastated that he was here now but how could he help but come jake was wealthy before his father died but his fathers death had made him more so the combined properties even at postfire prices were worth a fortune why had he held onto them that was a question he was having trouble facing and maybe thats why he was hereseeking some final connection to his father apart from financial supportgiven grudgingly according to his motherjakes father had played no part in his life he hadnt contacted him all through his childhood thered been nothing but twelve years ago when jake qualified as a doctor hed finally received a letter congratulating him and wishing him all the best for his future intrigued hed written back thats when hed discovered his father was working as a country doctor in the hills outside melbourne hed decided he wouldnt mind getting a personal idea about this man whod cared for him financially but in no other sense tentatively hed suggested a visit but i hear your mothers ill and shed hate it his father had said bluntly ive married again weve all moved on after all these years whats the point im glad youve graduated and im proud of you im sorry i havent been able to contact you before but now i havelets leave it there so hed left it and then life grew busy hed immersed himself in his career hed visit australia one day he promised himself but then five years ago his father died suddenly of a massive coronary jake had finally come then to a funeral that shocked him with the community outpouring of grief hed sat at the back of the church and watched strangers cry for a father he didnt know a father who hadnt even objected when his mother had changed his name back to hers who seemed to have little connection to him at all but when tentatively hed confessed to the elderly lady beside him who he was to his astonishment shed known all about him im one of old docs patientsand you must be jake shed said sniffing and beaming a watery smile at him his american son doc had a baby picture of you up on his clinic wall i used to say to him it was a shame your mother took you away but hed say just because hes in the states doesnt make him any less my son i love him wherever he is hed loved him that was the first hed heard of it the woman had wanted to introduce him around but he was so shocked hed simply walked away maybe he should have sold the properties then but it had seemed wrong troubled by the conflicting messages he was gettinghad his father indeed caredand by the morality of accepting such an inheritance hed employed rob to manage the properties and hed retreated to the states to his allconsuming career as chief anaesthetist at manhattan central but now finally hed returned the lodge once owned by his stepmother and run as a winery and genteel place of retreat had been needed as emergency accommodation in the first weeks after the fire rob had it running again now but there were few guests rob had worked in hospitality for years five years back hed followed a lady to australiaof courseand jumped at the opportunity to run the lodge but getting it viable again could take more than robs enthusiasm and up on the ridge jakes second propertythe one used by tori and her friendswas smoke damaged and had been used for six months as an animal hospital so maybe he should sell both maybe he should abandon any last trace of a father he didnt know abandon any last connection rob would find alternative employment his friend was born hopeful the blondes car was in front of them and rob was speeding up and slowing down doing a bit of automotive courting jake shook his head in disbelief hey stop it with the disapproval rob grinned sensing his thoughts worry about your own love life i dont have a love life exactly my lifes work wine and women your lifes medicine medicine and medicineand worry you know you dont need to the resort will turn around maybe it will jake agreed and then thought why was he worrying the winery supported the lodge he had no money problems so why was he even here and the farmhouse up on the ridgeold docs place the locals called itwell why was he quibbling about price ill go check out the ridge tomorrow put it on the market and then go home back to your medicine its what i do its what you are rob said why do you think i conned you into coming tonight you need a life i have a life right rob drawled in a voice that said he didnt believe it at all sure thing chapter two she was losing the fightand someone was banging on the front door her nurses gaze shifted towards the entrance her brows raised in enquiry leave it tori said tightly shes slipping up until now the koala under her hands had been responding well like so many animals shed been caught up in the wildfire but she was one of the lucky ones found by firefighters the day after the fire brought into toris care and gradually rehabilitated tori had worked hard with her and up until now shed thought shed survive but then a few days ago shed found a tiny abscess in the scar tissue on her leg despite antibiotics and the best of care it was spreading it needed careful debridement under anaesthetic that left a problem with this shelter winding down she no longer had full veterinary support if she took her down the mountain she could get another veterinarian to assist but travel often took more of a toll on injured animals than the procedure itself thus she was working with becky a competent veterinary nurse who worked under instruction it wasnt enough she needed an expert right here right now who could respond to minutebyminute changes in the koalas condition she was working as fast as she could to get the edges of the abscess clean but she couldnt work fast enough the little animal was slipping to lose her after all this time she was starting to feel sick anyone there it was a deep masculine voice calling from the hallway whoever had knocked had come right in the door to their improvised operating theatre opened tori glanced up ready to yell at whoever it was to get outand it was jake her oneandahalfminute date whatever it could be the king himself and there was only one reaction out she snapped and becky said i think shes stopped breathing her attention switched back to her koala she could have wept to lose her now can i help jake demanded she shook her head hardly conscious that she was responding she had to intubate but if she left the wound she couldnt do both jobs herself unless you can intubate she whispered hopeless she shouldnt have tried the oral conformation of koalassmall mouth narrow dental arcade a long soft palate and a caudally placed glottal opening all of these combined with a propensity to low blood oxygen saturationmade koala anaesthetics risky at the best of times and without another vet i can intubate he snapped keep working you can jake was already at the side bench staring down at equipment what size tube four millimetre she said automatically another vet maybe he was she thought as he grabbed equipment and headed to the table whoever he was he knew what he was doing the soft palate of the koalas obscures the epiglottis from direct view but jake didnt hesitate hed found and was using silicone spray snapping instructions at becky to hand him equipment tori was concentrating on applying pressure to the wound to prevent more blood loss she was therefore able to watch in awed amazement as jake manoeuvered the little animal into a sternal recumbency position as he applied more sprayand as he slid the tube home it was like the angel gabriel had suddenly appeared from the heavens ask and ye shall receive shed barely been aware that shed prayed no matter where hed come from no matter that she couldnt see his wings and he sounded autocratic and fierce rather than soft and halolike her oneandahalfminute date was definitely assuming angellike status he had oxygen flowing in what seemed seconds the monitor by toris side showed a slight shift in the thin blue lineand then a major one she had life heart rates seventy beats a minute jake snapped adjusting the flow how does that compare to normal not a vet then or not a vet who cared for koalas of course not low but a whole lot better than before you arrived she told him but there was no time for questions stunned she went back to what she was doing she was incredibly grateful but now wasnt the time to show it she had to get this wound debrided then get it dressed so the anaesthetic could be reversed koalas died under anaesthetic this one wouldnt please as if in echo of her thoughts jake said she seems knocked around wouldnt euthanasia be the kindest option hed had time now to take in the scar tissue the signs of major trauma says the man who just saved her tori muttered lets try to keep her alive until i finish we can do the moral debate later right there was silence while she worked on becky had faded into the background assisting both of them deeply relieved tori guessed to be freed from a task she hated there was so much theyd done in the past six months theyd all hatedincluding putting down more animals than she wanted to think about how to explain that after so much death one life became disproportionately important this little one she was working on didnt have a name orshe shouldnt give her one she should not be emotionally involved only of course she was emotionally involved koala number thirtyseventhe thirtyseventh koala shed treated since the firebelonged in the wild and tori was determined to get her back there she would win this last battle she must thanks to this man she just might who was he she was finishing now applying dressings having enough time again to pay attention to the man at the head of the table he was watching the monitors like a hawk his face fierce absorbed totally committed to what he was doing inserting an endotracheal tube in a koala was always dangerous territory if you went too deep there was a major risk of traumatising the trachea and extending the tube into bronchus she hadnt told him that there hadnt been time but hed seemed to know it instinctively how maybe he was a vet or maybe he did paediatric anaesthesia sometimes she thought paediatrics and veterinary science were inexplicably linked varying weights and sizes the inability of the patient to explain where the pain was who was he she was finished another check of the monitors pulse rate eighty blood oxygen saturation ninety percent koala thirtyseven just might live she couldnt help herself she put her hand on the soft fur of the little koalas face and bestowed a silent blessing you keep on living she whispered youve come so far you will make it she might well jake said he was working surely and confidently removing the endotracheal tube with care and watching with satisfaction as the little animal settled back into normal breathing pattern so whos going to pay her bill now theres a question she murmured she was carrying the little animal carefully back to her cage in the corner she wasnt out of the woods yetshe knew that any procedure took it out of these wild animals but at least there was hope shed done all she could she thought arranging the iv line the little animal needed to provide fluids until she started eating again then she was finished really finished she thought suddenly there was now nothing left to do the sensation was strange for the six months since the fires tori had worked nonstop this place had been a refuge for injured wildlife from all over the mountain theyd had up to fifty volunteers at one time with tori supervising the care of as many as three hundred animals kangaroos wallabies possums cockatoos koalasso many koalas so many battles so much loss it was over those who could be saved had been saved and were being reintroduced in the wild the spring rains had come the bush was regenerating there was food and water out there for animals to reestablish territories this little koala was the last of her responsibilities she glanced down at her and as she did she felt a wave of the deep grief that was always with her all those shed failed is it okay if i go now becky said glancing uncertainly at jake its justbens picking me up hell be waiting sure becky thanks for your help you wont need me again will you no she glanced back at the koala if there was a need for more surgery she knew what her decision would have to be and for that she wouldnt need becky see you then becky said im out of here hooray for the cityim so over this place and with another curious glance at jake she disappeared closing the door behind her leaving tori with jake i thank you she managed he looked pretty much like he had the night before slightly more casual faded jeans and a white opennecked shirt elasticsided boots he looked like a local she thought which was at odds with his american accent my pleasure he said and sounded like he meant it i didnt realise last night that you were a vet i didnt know you were im not so inserting endotracheal tubes in koalas is just a splinter skill for say a television repairman im an anaesthetist jake hunter an anaesthetist tori said blankly in combadeen you have to be kidding im not kidding im staying at manwillinbah lodge rob winstons place she was struggling now with the connection what had jake said last night i own properties here in the valley and up on the ridge and rob distracted she thought of the pleasant young man whod flirted outrageously last night she remembered him arriving with this man with jake was rob winston the ninth date last night she demanded that was rob he was nice fun meaning i wasnt i didnt say that but i wish id known who he was she said ruefully he should have told me i need to thank him and not only for letting us use this place i had a friend who went to manwillinbah lodge when she was released from hospital two months ago it wasnt right for her she needed ongoing medical treatment but that wasnt robs fault and she said he tried so hard to give her time out so many people around here need that she frowned figuring more things out so is thisis this your farm it is oh my uhoh last night shed walked out on her landlord on the guy whod made this whole hospital possible youve been giving this place to us rent free and i didnt even know who you were it was practically a wail and he grinned this is a whole new conversation topic if wed known last night we could have used our whole five minutes she managed a smilejust how embarrassing and how to retrieve the situation she should shake his hand or um not she glanced down at her gloves and decided gratitude needed to wait plus she needed to catch her breath breath seemed in remarkably short supply could you excuse me for a moment she muttered i need to wash and she disappearedshe almost ranleaving him alone with koala number thirtyseven he was in the front room of what seemed to have been a grand old farmhouse it still was somewhere under the litter of what looked to be an animal hospital when the fires had ripped through here almost fifty percent of properties on the ridge had been destroyed the loss of life and property had been so massive thered been international television coverage horrified hed contacted rob to see how he could help the lodge and the winery are okay rob told him were almost ten miles from where the fire front turned back on itself so apart from smoke on the grapes theres little damage ive been asked if we can provide emergency accommodation if its okay with you and the farmhouse on the ridge theres an animalwelfare place wanting headquarters when the wind shifted pushing the fire back on itself your place was spared just theres still feed around it and the house itself is basically okay but your tenants are moving off the mountain they cant cope with the mess and the smell and theyre going to her mothers can the animalwelfare people use it for six months or so of course hed said so it was now a hospitalof sorts but as he looked around he thought he wouldnt have minded seeing it as it once wasa gracious family home and he wouldnt have minded seeing the bushland around here as it was either the fire had burned to within fifty yards of the house and then turned beyond that demarcation the bush was black and skeletal green tinges were showing through the ash now alleviating the blackness but six months ago it must have been a nightmare he stared out the window until tori bustled back into the room carrying a bucket of steaming soapy water she looked like a woman who didnt stay still for long he thought busy clinically efficient cute definitely still cute she was in ancient jeans an even more ancient tshirt and a white clinical coat with a torn pocket her curls were again scraped back into a ponytail last night shed pulled them back with a ribbon today they were tied with an elastic band she lookedworkmanlike but workmanlike or not he thought nothing could hide her inherent sexiness why had he wasted time last night thinking she was dowdy when she left the room shed looked confused now however she looked relieved as if shed spent her bucketfilling time figuring things out as well i know now why youre here she told him youre old docs son jake i loved your father she hesitated as if she wanted to say something else but then thought better of it so youre here to put this farm on the market she continued briskly thats fine but first i need to thank you she abandoned her bucket put her hands out and grasped his holding them in the same strong grip of the night before a grip that made him wonder how hed ever thought her a mouse the connection felt strangelyright but tori wasnt noticing connections she was moving right on i cant tell you how grateful weve been she said its been fabulousand barb said you wont take any rent its been truly lifesaving she looked across at the little koala in her cage and her businesslike tone faltered a little and now youll sell thats fine we dont need it any more as soon as this one goes shes the only one here now we release as soon as we can she said efficient again wild animals respond to captivity with stress theres a few that are too damaged to survive on their own but weve relocated them all now to bigger animal shelters places where they can have as close to a normal life as possible so yes theres only this little one here now and me he frowned youre living here i yes i hope you dont mind its easier youre on twentyfourhour call not many of my patients buzz me its not as hard as it sounds she was opening the door onto the verandah and ushering him out almost before he was aware of what she was doing there was a small dog lying on an ancient settee by the door hed seen him as he arrived he was some sort of terrier a nondescript brownandwhite mutt who hadnt bothered checking jake out when he arrived too old to care he glanced up now gave a feeble wag of his tail and then went back to what he was doing which wasnt sleeping jake realised he was staring down the valley as if he was waiting for someone tori touched the dogs ears and the dog nosed her palm and went right back to looking waiting to go home youll be looking forwards to going homehe ventured and saw a flash of pain hidden fast uhoh he thought stupid if she was staying here shed be one of the hundreds burned out she hesitated and he knew he was right but it was too late to retrieve the situation i guess i must be she said slowly before he could think what else to say and she shrugged no of course i am its time i moved on is that what you were doing last nightmoving on what i was doing last night was being conned by my friend i gather you were conned as well so when do you need me to move out i dont itll be soon youll need to clean the place up before you put it on the market theres a lot of smoke damage do you want to look through now she glanced at her watch i have a teleconference in five minutes with our local shelter staffers but you could look around yourself id be happier if you could show me personally why had he said that surely he could see what he needed from here what point was there doing a detailed inspection and why did he need a personal tour from tori she had him fascinated there was something about the way her hand had shaken his brisk efficient but alsothere was something vulnerable about her something he couldnt figure out she wasnt sounding vulnerable though she was organising i can show you she said but if you want the personal tour itll have to be later in the day but tomorrow would be better is nine in the morning all right sure when are you going back to the states monday six days away suddenly six days seemed okay if he kept the resort there was only this place to organise he could be here again tomorrow and be shown over the property by tori those jeans hed never seen jeans look this good on a woman i do need to get in to my teleconference she said a bit sharply and he pulled himself together what was he thinking this woman was a country mousea vet who lived on the other side of the world to him if she hadnt stood him up on a fiveminute date was that what this was bruised ego thank you very much for saving my koala she said starting to edge away whats she called i dont name them you get attached if you name them you dont get attached i try hard not to now if youll excuse me of course he said but he was still surprised when she stepped back inside the house and closed the door sharply behind her she wasnt a time waster then dr nicholls he didnt waste time eitherbut he couldnt help feeling piqued most women reacted to him differently to the way this woman had what was he thinking nothing there was nothing to think about he gave himself a mental swipe to the side of the head and headed back to his rental car he should get back to the states fast if he thought shabby little country vets were cute if he thought shabby little country vets were fascinating he wasnt to know that one shabby little country vet watched him until he was out of sight boy was she hopeless she twitched the smokestained drapes back into place and glowered at nothing in particular one gorgeous male and here she was feelingweird which was dumb the last thing she needed in her life was another man so why had she let barb talk her into fiveminute dating because with the leaving of the army of volunteers shed become so lonely she was starting to talk to walls dad micki dont go there there werent even enough animals left to talk to she returned to the makeshift surgery and stooped to check the little koala she was barely conscious so small so battered maybe it had been a mistake to keep on trying live she whispered almost fiercely you must get better you must start living again she knew she must too she glanced out the window to the west and flinched like she always did she could just see the chimney stack which was all that was left of the house shed lived in forever her dad her sister move on she whispered get yourself a nice little town house in the city you can be a pet vet take care of allergies dew claws vaccinations maybe she would it was justshe didnt feel ready yet in a couple of weeks this little koala should be ready to move on to a wildlife refuge and this place would be sold to be a home again but not her home shed sheltered here for long enough it was time to face the world again she knew she could shed schooled herself to be independent so why was the thought of jake hunter walking away so disturbing so whats the story with tori he asked rob it was after dark there were only two guests staying at manwillinbah lodge right now and both had gone to bed early rob had organised a theatre nightan old showing of casablanca hed set up a themed dinner decorated the sitting room with blackandwhite posters even worn a hatbut both his guests were weary and just wanted their own beds they were fire victims too jake had discovered both were elderly women living in temporary accommodation organising to rebuild theyd come here for time out because the process was leaving them exhausted and all they wanted to do was sleep it left rob dissatisfied though he loved being the entertainer but by eight he was left to entertain himself and his boss they sat on the back porch and watched the stars and drank beerand jake pushed tori he prodded again tell me about her i dont even know her but barbs told you nope therere tragedies everywhere and if youre not told you dont ask some people need to talk about it some people cant all i know is that she was put in charge of the wildlife rescue effort and she was vet up on the ridge before the fires i didnt know she was staying onsite but i did say they could use it for whatever they wanted i told you that when i phoned he had thered been a couple of days when the news coming through from australia was dreadful hed been ready to promise anything he still was i dont want to kick tori out he said now uneasily if she still wants to live there she doesnt barb says as soon as the last animal goes so will she its fine to put it on the market does she have somewhere to go i have no idea rob said giving him a curious glance ive never met the lady until last night and five minutes with her didnt give me much time for indepth questions yours was worsehow many questions did you manage in your minute and a half dont rub it in jake growled i dont make a great speed dater i dont think you make an anything dater rob said pouring another beer but youve met the lady properly today whats she like smart tired worried and very cute he thought but he didnt say it really sexy despite those appalling clothes tired and worried equals everyone up here in the hills rob said not hearing his afterthoughts so were back to smart how smart shes a vet and and she had the gumption to walk away from me when i was being an i know exactly what you were being rob said and had the temerity to grin good for tori she practically told me to leave today too youre kidding its your property which shes legally entitled to be on oh she wasnt rude she evicted me in the most businesslike way maybe shes a man hater not if she agreed to dating so youre interested im not interested im just concerned where has everyone else gone whose houses burned relatives friends or theres a whole town of mobile homesrelocatablesset up further down the valley for anyone who needs them youll have passed them on your way from the airport shell go there why dont you ask her its none of my business so why do you want to know he didnt have an answer he sat on staring into the night and finally rob left him to his silence leaving jake alone with half a bottle of beer a starlit sky and a silence so immense it was enough to take his breath away a faint rustle came from beside him a wallaby was watching from the edge of the garden moonlight glinting on its silvery fur hi jake said but the wallaby took fright and disappeared into the shadows leaving jake alone again he should go inside he had journals to study he didnt donothing but the stars were immense and somewhere under them alone up on the mountain was tori a woman with shadows she was nothing to do with him so why did a faint insistent murmur in his head tell him that she was chapter three he arrived at the farmhouse at nine the next morning and nobody answered the door he knocked three times the same van hed seen yesterday was in the driveway but there were no sounds coming from the house there was no dog on the settee he tried the door and it opened unlocked and undefended hi tori he called its jake still no answer shed been expecting him should he come back later he hesitated and then thought maybe she was in the surgery again doing something that couldnt be interrupted he went through cautiouslyand stopped at the open door even from here he could tell the koala was dead the little animal was facing him curled on her side still the cage door was open he crossed to the cage and stooped putting his hand on her fur to make sure but yes she was gone simply he thought there was no sign of distress the iv lines tori had attached yesterday had been removed but were lying neatly to the side as if theyd been removed after death she looked as if shed hardly moved since yesterday shed simply died hed had patients whod done thisjust died the operation had been a success yet the assault on their bodies had been too great their hearts had simply stopped mostly it happened in the aged where maybe thered been a question of whether the operation should have been done at all only how could you convince a patient that you couldnt remove cancer because there was a risk of heart failure maybe you tried but the patient could elect to have the operation anyway he hated cases like those he hated this he knelt and saw closer now and more dreadfully the full extent of scar tissue he thought about what this little animal must have gone through in the past six months and he knew that yesterdays decision to operate must have been a hard one for tori to make where was she he glanced around out through the window and then he saw her she was out at the edge of the clearing and he knew what she was doing hadnt she cried enough she didnt get attached to her patients she couldnt getting attached was the way of madness she was crying so hard she could barely see the ground she was trying to dig this was the first of the animals shed tried to bury up until now thered been volunteers taking away bodies of the animals shed failed this was the end her last failure if shed known it would turn out like this shed have euthanised her six months ago shed had to make a decision shed got it wrong and there were no volunteers left to bury her so much loss so much appalling waste dad micki one tiny baby with no life at all one little koala who somehow represented them all i cant do this any more she whispered and hit the ground with the spade the spade shuddered back was she hitting tree roots she swore and hit the ground again three spade lengths away rusty flinched as if the little dog felt every shudder you and me both she told rusty and shoved the spade uselessly down again this was dumb dumb dumb but she did not want to take the little koalas body down the mountain to the veterinary crematorium she did not all she could see was the combadeen cemetery two graves with brass headstones dad micki mickis with a tiny extra plaque white on silver no she shoved the spade down hard again uselessly she gulped back tearsand suddenly the spade was taken out of her hands where he came from she didnt know she knew nothing only that the spade was tossed aside two strong arms enfolded her and held her close and let her sob hed never held a woman like this hed never felt emotion like this jake was chief anaesthetist in a specialist teaching hospital in manhattan once upon a time hed spent time with patients but that seemed long since now he handled only critical cases patient interviews and examinations were done by his juniors his personal contact with patients was confined to reassurance as they slipped under anaesthetic and occasional further reassurance as they regained consciousness if there were problems during an operation it was mostly the surgeon who talked to the family as anaesthetist jake took no risks he did his job and he did it well there were seldom times he needed to talk now as he faced toris real and dreadful grief he realised he actively kept away from this type of anguish his mother had cried at him all of his life hed done with tears and this was just a koala just a koala even as he thought it he recalled the limp little body lying alone down at the house the scar tissue the evidence of a sixmonth battle now lost he looked around him and saw the blackened skeletons of a ravaged forest his mother had cried for cryings sake he knew instinctively that toris tears were very different so much death tori was trying desperately to pull herself together sniffing against his shirt tugging back im sorry she managed this is stupid it was a risk operating on her i should have put her down i should have you werent to know what you should or shouldnt have done he said gently you did your best thats all anyone can ask no but she was wild shes been through so much you didnt add to that tori you had to give her every chance but was i operating for me she demanded sounding desperate shed managed to pull back now and was wiping her hand furiously across her cheeks i named her how stupid was that you told me you didnt i told everyone i didnt all the volunteers ive worked with the nurses the drivers the firefighters who brought animals in i told them we cant afford to get attached there are so many if we get attached well go crazy lets do our best for every individual animal and lets stay dispassionate there was nothing dispassionate about tori she looked wild her face was blotched from weeping the spade she was working with was covered with ashes and dirt her hands were filthy and shed wiped her hands across her sodden face she looked like someone whod just emerged from this burnedout foresta fire victim herselfand something inside him felt her pain or felt more than that it hurt that she was hurting and it hurt a lot he wanted to hug her againbadlybut she was past hugging she had her arms folded across her breasts in an ageold gesture of defence trying to stop an agony that was unstoppable this was much more than the death of one koala he thought as bad as that was there were levels to this pain that he couldnt begin to understand keep yourself to yourself his mothers words sounded through the years dont get involvedyoull only get hurt wise advice hed always thought so but right now it was advice he was planning to ignore what did you call her he asked and she hiccupped on a sob and tried to glare at him it didnt come off how could it manya why was she glaring did she think hed mock maybe she did he knew instinctively that tori was assessing him and withdrawing as if hed think she was stupidwhen stupid was the last thing hed think her why manya he asked searching for the right words to break through what does it mean justlittle one its from the language of the native people from around here not that it matters it was only i talked to her she sounded desperate again and totally bewildered i had to call her something i had to talk to her i guess you did he said and then as she still seemed to be drawing in on herself he thought maybe he could make this professional maybe itd make it easier do you know why she died no she spread her filthy hands and stared down at them as if they could give her some clue she shook her head or maybe i do shes been under stress for months but i thought we were winning i knew she wouldnt be able to go back to the wild but there are sanctuaries thatd take her good places thatd seem like freedom and she was so close but one tiny abscess it must have been the last straw she was fine when i checked on her at seven and when i checked at eight she was dead everything juststopped it does happen he said softly to people too have you had it happen to patients she managed and he knew she was struggling hard to sound normal her little dog nosed forwards and she picked him up and held him against her shieldlike he licked her nose and she held him harder the dog was missing a leg he saw with a shock and his initial impression of him as an old dog changed not old wounded as tori was wounded have you had it happen to patients toris question was still out there and maybe talking medicine was the way to go until she had herself together not often he told her but yes i have that it hasnt happened often means ive been lucky as opposed to me she said grimly ive lost countless patients in the past six months she looked exhausted to the point of collapse he thought had she slept at all last night when had she last slept your patients are wild creatures he said and he felt as if he was picking his way through a minefield knowing it was important that she talk this out but suspecting she could close up at any minute my patients are the moneyed residents of manhattan theres no way a rich private hospital will cause them stress and theres the difference he hesitated tori let me dig for you i can do it she put the little dog down and grabbed the spade again can you she closed her eyes gave herself a minute and then opened them no this is dumb i accept that now the grounds one huge root ball ill take her down the mountain and get her cremated but you dont want to justjust because i named her she whispered hugging the spade while the little dog nosed her boots in worry i wanted her buried here at least the edges of the bush here are still alive i wanted her buried under living trees does that make sense it does he said strongly and surely and before she could protest again he took the spade from her hands and started digging she was right the ground was so hard it would be more sensible to cremate her only there was something about tori that said this burial was deeply important on all sorts of levels so he put all his weight behind the spade and it slid a couple of inches in slowly he got through the hardened crust to the rootfilled clay below while tori watched on in silence after a couple of minutes she sank to her knees and gathered the little dog against her whats his name he asked trying not to sound like the digging was as hard as it was rusty how did he lose his leg fire she said harshly and he glanced at the little dog in surprise hed lost his leg but he wasnt otherwise scarred he was burned wasnt everything around here she hugged him closer and got another nose lick for her pains but rusty was luckysort of he was i found him in the fireplace ofof where i lived over there she motioned to the neighbouring property part of the bricks had collapsed trapping his leg but otherwise he was okay he was my dads rusty hes just waiting til he comes home her voice broke no more questions were allowed jake thought while she struggled for control so he kept right on digging it took time ten minutes fifteen he wasnt in a hurry this was giving tori time to catch her breath figure if she wanted to tell him more there were cockatoos screeching in the gums about his head apart from the birds and the sound of the spade against the earth there was nothing but silence what had happened to this woman he shouldnt ask but finally he had to so who did you lose he asked into the silence and for a while he thought she wouldnt answer then my father and my sister she said flatly dreadfully my sister was eight months pregnant dear god he thought helplessly where to take this from here you all lived over there he tried we did micki margaret my sisters relationship had fallen apart and shed come home so she could have her baby with us toby and i were going to look after her for the first few weeks after the birth she took a deep breath but then they died dad and micki and benedict benedict was mickis baby a little boy she was going to call him benedict i found rusty three days later when i finally got back up here but there was nothing else left nothing it took his breath away he felt ill but desperately he wanted to help and somehow he knew that the only way to do that was to keep on going keep diggingand keep on talking sotoby toby was my fiancé but he wasnt killed what do you think she laughed mirthlessly and buried her face in her dogs soft fur her laugh sounded close to hysteria he let her be for a moment pushing the spade deeper into the tree roots the grave was deep enough but he knew instinctively that if he stopped then so would she shed get back to the business of livingbut maybe talking about the dying would help hed done a bit of psychology in medical school but hed never practised it now however what to do seemed to be instinctive a human skill rather than a professional one whatever it seemed to be working sorry she said at last sniffing and giving rusty a bit of slack thatthat sounds dumb of course youd think hed be killed but tobywell toby was a charmer and he was also a survivor he was a lovely vibrant guy a photographer who came up here last autumn and took pictures of the mountains took pictures of my vet clinicand finally stayed she paused again but then went on more in control now i need to tell you dad started the vet practice up here when micki and i were kids mum died early but dad looked after us really well we had a great childhood micki married and moved interstatei did veterinary science then dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis the past couple of years have been hard but then along came toby and he made us both laugh he brought the house to life and when he asked me to marry him i dont know who was happier me or dad toby didnt have any money but what could be more natural than he stay here his photography would take off id do the vet work i love and wed live happily ever after he let that sink in for a bit and dug a few more spadefuls this was getting to be a very deep hole and still he didnt have the full story buthe prompted softly and he thought she wouldnt answer but finally she did so then micki came home for christmas because her relationship had ended she was having a tough pregnancy but toby charmed her as well maybemaybe things between toby and me werent as good as they could have been but micki and dad loved him and then the fires hit then the heat hit she said dully micki was so pregnant she could hardly move dad was having one of his bad spells he could hardly move on the day it was so hot there was no sign of fires but i was nervous everyone was nervous then the district nurse rang to say she didnt want to come up the mountain because she was scared her car might boil but dad had run out of his medication so i made a run down into the valley id only be away for an hour or so toby was here with the other car what could go wrong and then the fires hit theres no need he said hearing the raw anguish in her voice and not wanting to make her say it hed stopped digging now he moved towards her but she waved him back let me finish she whispered he heard on the radio that there were fires on the other side of the ridgethats where they started so toby took the van and went to see he took magnificent photographs you probably saw themthey were the ones beamed around the world the next day after the wind changed and over a hundred people were killed and dad and micki and benedict and all the animals in our vet clinic were left without a vehicle to escape in dad put rusty in the fireplace and protected him with his body our three big dogsmutsy and pogo and bandit they died too one little dog was all they could save once more he made a move to go to her but she flinched she swiped her hand across her face again and she sniffed trying desperately to move on enough she said bleakly toby made a fortune and i lost everything i promised micki shed be safe here but it didnt happen i failed her as i failedso many trusting toby leaving the mountain but its dopey to keep crying well bury manya and then rusty and i will move on where i dont know she whispered this is where i belong but i dont know any more look its deep enough i can do the rest youll do nothing he growled im the undertaker today stay he helped tori gather sheaths of fresh eucalyptus leaves he carried the little body from the house they laid her on a bed of the leaves shed loved they covered her with more leaves and then he filled in the grave they spread more leaves on the freshly dug earth and then jake stood back silent not knowing where to go next not knowing how to help he wanted to hold her again but tori was standing apart rigid as if ashamed at her previous show of emotion thank you she whispered thank you so much i when do you want your house back lets look at it now he said and held out his hand she looked at it but she didnt take it her reserve was back again the woman whod sobbed her heart out was well hidden of course she said stiffly and led the way back down to the house with rusty limping along behind them she ushered him into one room after another letting him see it all apart from yesterday hed never been in this house when his father died it had already been let to tenants whod wanted to keep renting a realtor had acted as intermediary and thered been no opportunity or need for him to see it the grand old homestead was battered now from years of renting from six months of being used as an animal hospital and from the fires themselves the building hadnt burned but it was still smoke stained and grim the only furniture was what theyd needed for the animal hospital the last room tori showed him was what was obviously the master bedroom he stood at the door and saw how shed been living for the past six months and he drew in his breath in dismay there was a camp stretcher in the corner there were half a dozen cardboard cartons acting as storage and as a bedside table a basket lay in the corner for rusty nothing else at speed dating hed thought shed looked dowdy it was a miracle shed managed to look presentable at all no mirror he asked trying to make it sound as though he was joking no mirror shed recovered a little now her voice was firmer moving on just as well as i suspect id scare myself silly you look all right to me said the man who looked at me like i was a porrywiggle on our fiveminute date a what a tadpole something that wiggles out of pond scum i never said you never had to have you seen enough more than enough are these all your possessions i live light she said in a tight voice i can be gone in half an hour where are you staying tonight youre not kicking me out tonight she demanded alarmed and he shook his head im not kicking you out at all im asking if you have an alternativesomething a bit less appalling than here heres fine heres not fine this place needs an army to make it habitable its a lovely house it could be a lovely house its anything but now do you have anywhere you can go of course i do she retorted but he thought that she was lying there were all sorts of emotions twisting inside him right now he didnt want to get involvedwhen had he everbut walking away from her hed be as bad as toby if he left her anchored to this place to her grief to her loss come down to manwillinbah lodge he found himself saying you know the lodge i know it but but what i cant why not its your place its a guesthouse and its almost empty so im offering and i believe youd be sensible to accept he spread his hands tori either you stay here tonight in this bleak and lonely place and i suspect cry your eyes out again for a little koala called manya or you come down the mountain and let rob take care of you while you regroup then as she hesitated he added you know youd be doing rob a favour he loves the lodge being full and he loves company since the fire all his guests have come and stared out into the night and not wanted to talk i dont think i want to talk no but our housekeeper can cook for you and rob can make you smile robs good with people she looked at him curiously at that you talk as if you mean youre not im not a people person yet you let me soak your shirt sometimes im compelled to be a people person that sounds like your fiveminute date like you want to be out of here i didnt mean it to sound like that he said flinching hell he had to figure out how to sound nice but to his relief she was smiling a faint smile but a smile nonetheless yeah okay youre not a people person but you did very well just now she said i was really grateful for your shirt and you held on manfully so whether you wanted to bolt or not the fact is you didnt and im not asking questions she turned and looked down at her camp bed at the detritus of six months camping in this sooty makeshift home he could see her indecision you dont really want to stay here i have rusty though rusty was on the verandah again staring fixedly at the road still endlessly waiting rusty can come with you stay in the lodge while you figure where to go she stared down at the camp stretcher again ive been offered a job she said in a smallanimal clinic down the mountain will you take it i donti dont know when did you last sleep through the night i dont know that either she admitted and people person or not he took her hands in his and held tori youre in no state to decide anything come to the lodge let rob look after you for a month or so a month no okay come for tonight and take it from there he said hastily but you need to sleep and you need to start thinking of something other than destruction thats what barb said when she talked me into fiveminute dating she whispered i need to move on it doesnt work how can it yeah well maybe the dating wasnt a great idea for either of us he said ruefully lets try it another way do you need to move on too no he said blankly i meant you she looked up at him then and another glimmer of a smile crossed her face really its only me whos got ghosts why do i get the feeling youre as strained as i am im not okay she pulled her hands away and held them up in surrender youre staying at the lodge as well until monday you think you can stand my company of course i can theres no of course about it she said still with a touch of humour one and a half minutes as i remember it was you who walked out so it was she said and suddenly her smile became real and i can do it again if life gets tricky but now does the lodge have baths theres a spa in every room a spa she said awed and a heated swimming pool and beds with so many downfilled pillows you cant count them one of robs ditzy blondes did his decorating for him and i have to say she cant have been as ditzy as most ditzy rob thinks ditzy equals sexy and you dont um no well im not even going to go there she said and her smile was still in place i cant imagine what woman would have tied you to speed dating for more than five minutes but look i need to clear up here if rob agrees to having rusty and me of course hell agree im the owner hes the manager ill phone and check she said with a touch of reproof and im paying lets make this formal you will not pay ill pay or i wont come she said with asperity and dont look at me like that ive spent almost nothing in six months and im tired of charity i know that sounds ungrateful she said suddenly rueful but there it is ill phone him ill lock up and ill come down later this afternoon he was being dismissed can i help clean up no she said thank you dr hunter jake he growled and dont be pigheaded i will help you jake she said but still with a touch of formality and pigheaded or not id like to clean up by myself and suddenly he could see her hidden agenda he could take offence at her knocking back his helpor he could understand this place was filled with six months memories she needed to say goodbye on her own terms she might well cry again the thought was bad but he suspected she needed to and she certainly had the right how could he ever have thought her frumpy how could he ever have thought she was uninteresting he gazed down into her troubled face and he thought suddenly id like to hold her again and then he thought id really like to kiss her it wasnt sympathy now she had so many levels she was such a woman he couldnt kiss her of course he couldnt shed run a mile and the thought was totally illogical and besides he thought trying hard for logical she was too dirty too tearstained too not the sort of woman he kissed but as she turned away as she knelt to start filling boxes he looked down at her in her tight faded jeans clinging to her neat figure like a second skin at her torn tshirt at the way a curl was wisping down the nape of her neckand he was aware of a sharp stab of missed opportunity what would she be like to kiss he didnt know and he had no business thinking about finding out he formed relationships with women who knew the rulesindependent women who wanted nothing but a lighthearted relationship which went nowhere would tori understand those rules he knew she wouldnt and there was no way he was risking giving pain so he wanted to kiss her but he couldnt she didnt even want his help cleaning this houseand he had to respect her wishes ill see you down at the lodge he said more harshly than he intended before dinner see you then she said without looking up thank you again jake so that was that he turned and left leaving tori shoving welfare clothes into welfare boxes packing up life as she knew itand moving on while a little dog watched jakes car until it disappeared from view the place was a mess she gazed around the house and thought she couldnt just walk out it wasnt fair she should have let jake help and maybe if it hadnt been jake she would have but then jake wasnt anyone else the man had her thoroughly off balance the equilibrium shed striven so hard to reach had been tossed off course by the death of one little koalaand then by the way shed reacted to jake for this was more than grief barb said she had to move on her head told her she couldnt but her body was telling her it was more than time so shed thought he was lovely and shed sobbed all over him what a turnon she headed into the bathroom to fetch her toiletries despite what shed told jake there was a mirror there and she saw what she looked like a nightmare just forget it she said fiercely to a pile of secondhand clothes she had no use for your body would react to anything in pants right now youre needy and weepy and pathetic so get a grip and dont even begin to think that jake hunters seeing you as anything more than a basket case she sniffed and dont go blubbering about that as well she snapped to her reflection and headed back to the bedroom and kicked the closest cardboard box which promptly collapsed she stared at it as if itd personally betrayed herand then the phone rang doc nicholls yes its combadeen cleaners a womans voice said weve been paid to clean the place youre using up on the ridge cart away garbage give stuff to welfare scrub do whatever you want youve been paid she said cautiously this guyjake hunterapparently he owns the lodge as well as your place he said youre moving out if its okay with you he said you do what you want then leave the rest for us when youre finished leave a key on the kitchen table well collect it tonight well clean and lock up after ourselves but its only if you want us he made that clear weve been paid already but its up to you its up to you jake understood he was helping but on her terms the offer took her breath away for the past six months shed been in charge shed been giving instructions shed organised jake had listened to what shed said but hed heard the underlying message and hed organised around her the woman was giving her time to think about it she gazed around her at six months chaos of a house being used as an animal hospital she should do it herself jake was bossy she thought he was autocratic he also scared her just a little the way he understood logic said she should stay right away from jake hunter and his grandiose gestures it wasnt going to happen she sniffed again and thought if she cried one more time today shed need an iv line to replace fluids thank you she said simply i accept with pleasure would she come jake paced the lodge and thought he should have been more insistent why was it so important she accept he didnt know he only knew that it was chapter four shed done what she could the cleaners could deal with the rest tori sat in her little white van with rusty close beside her and thought leaving wasnt as easy as it sounded stupid or not it was a grief in itself moving away from the ridge she and rusty had spent the first dreadful nights after the fire on barbs couch then when theyd found jakes place and settled that it could be a staging post for injured wildlife it had seemed sensible that she move in here six months later she was still not looking further than her next patient until now rusty was staring out the window with longing along the road that led to her burnedout home home she closed her eyes it didnt help to be angryshe knew thatbut the rage she felt towards toby was still real and dreadful that she could have imagined she loved him he hadnt come near her since the fire which was just as well he was a coward of the worst kindand shed thought shed loved him so dont trust your stupid heart again she told herself move on from the ridge but do not trust she was trying to get her tired mind to think maybe accepting jakes invitation for accommodation at the lodge was a mistake she decided but staying up here tonight in the empty refuge seemed unthinkable and landing on barb again was equally impossible there were relocatable homes set up down in the valley for anyone displaced by the fires she could move into one of those but not tonight she thought shed give herself this night of respite a night with jake no this was a night at a lovely guesthouse she told herself fiercely it had nothing to do with jake it was a night of indulgence before moving onto practicalities to the dreary other side she glanced at rusty sitting passively beside the cardboard box that held all her worldly possessions the practical thingschanges of clothes toiletries things shed had to find to survive she would survive she and rusty and well come back to the ridge she told the little dog as he looked mournfully along the road towards where they used to live dad and micki and benedict and mutsy and pogo and bandittheyre still here just a little bit but theyre still here but for now they had to leave well come back she said again and she flicked the engine into life and drove out the gateand to rustys great sorrow she turned right instead of left down into the valley instead of where theyd left so much i promise you rusty well come home she was coming she rang rob and it was all jake could do not to listen in on the extension youre really worried about her rob said when he finished shes had a tough time so has half this valley i dont know half this valley he growled i know tori only since yesterday right rob said thoughtfully so shall we give her the honeymoon suite what the best rob said patiently the one i tried to put you in its expensive yes but charge her halfrates you dont want to give it to her free if we dont charge her then she wont come and you want her to come yes he snapped and rob grinned i see he said thoughtfully shall i ring barb then and tell her the fiveminute dating was a success just try it thats what i thought rob said okay not yet but im thinking i might get mrs matheson to pull out all the stops its time we had a great dinner nothing special jake said you dont want to scare her rob i know his manager said placating but im thinking lobster she can think we have it every night because were not trying to impress her at all manwillinbah lodge she turned into the driveway and she could scarcely believe she was on the same planet as the place shed just left the lodge looked gracious and inviting long and low and sprawling beyond rambling rose gardens were acres of grapevines just coming into bud it looked not where she belonged at all why was she panicking she shouldnt be here she should be somewhere she could be alone to think things through though hadnt she had enough time to think things through and where had that got her but before her muddled thoughts could take her any further her car door was tugged open and jake was looking in hey he said softly i was starting to think id need to come up the mountain and fetch you welcome tori welcome rusty he was smiling that smile was enough to make a girl panic all on its own i was just coming to tell youto tell rob i wasnt coming she muttered and to thank you for the cleaners he nodded suppressing his smile that makes sense or not the cleaners were my pleasure as for not staying you want to have dinner while you tell us why not i cant stay here she said wildly gesturing towards the house why ever not i dont fit you fit in fine he said our only two guests were burned out themselves theyre here to sleep i dont have any clothes odd he said thoughtfully youd have thought id have noticed no clothes you know what i mean he did his gaze met hers and she knew he understood you look great he said softly tori you look lovely jeans and tshirt are practically uniform here and no ones going to judge you even if they werent dinners on the table in an hour that gives you time to have a bath first youre saying im dirty im saying theres a heated spa bath on your balcony with a view to die for its totally private if youre dirty to start with theres only you to notice unless you want me to come scrub your back no no he was laughing now and suddenly she found herself smiling back okay she thought maybe this wouldnt be as bad as it seemed she didnt need to trust she only needed to stay for a night and tomorrow worry about right now jake said gently and chameleonlike his laughter was gone again it was replaced by a gentle concern she found disconcerting insidious impossible to resist inviting her to trust terrifying okay no backscrubbing he said and he put out a hand to help her from the car nothing but bath food sleep and if thats not what you need ill eat my medical degrees theres no pressure tori youre our welcome guest his hand was waiting just waiting all she had to do was accept i wont bite he said softly robs in the house as is our housekeeper mrs matheson there are two elderly ladies lying on robs fabulous lounges on the balcony watching the cockatoos ones wearing dungarees ones wearing tweed lifes safe here tori its a refuge if you like you provided refuge for your battered wild creatures now its time for you to take refuge i dont need i think you do barb thinks you do too he hesitated but then continued maybe i should confess i phoned barb this afternoon when she heard your koala was dead she was all for rushing up the mountain and taking you home herself only i gather barb has a husband five sons and a menagerie we both thought youd be best here so whats it to be tori here or barbs because no ones going to let you stay in a motel by yourself tonight even if i want to if you really want then well pay for a fivestar hotel in the best part of melbourne he said and you neednt think id have to personally payaccording to barb half the valley would have their hands in their pockets in a minute to help you so whats it to be still his hand was held out to her what was it to be she could still drive away she knew she could there was a bath inside a bath and jake there was the problem she looked up at him he smiled she couldnt trust she didnt need to trust this was a night in a guesthouse nothing more she took a deep breath she tried to smile back she put her hand in his and let him pull her up the tug had her rising too fast she almost overbalanced but he had her steady catching her shoulders holding he was so near she should pull awaybut didnt tori he said uncertainly and she just looked at him sex on legs she thought absently no he was much much more get a grip she thought frantically and shoved her hands up breaking his grip she came close to falling back down into the carbut didnt thankfully a girl had some pride i thank you she muttered and managed to get herself round to the other side of the car to retrieve her cardboard box i like your luggage he said and grinned eat your heart out mr gucci she said managing a smile in return this is so next years catwalk i believe it is he said if theres anyone who can start a trend it would be you enough with the compliments she said feelingdisconcerted no more than that totally flummoxed you promised me a bath i did let me carry your box i can manage myself she said with an attempt at dignity once upon a time i depended on others i dont do that any more its only carrying a box he said mildly no she said softly as she carted her belongings up the steps and into the house believe me its much much more she lay back in the vast spa she let the bubbles float up around her and she felt as if she was floating herself from here she could see all the way across the valley floor there were candles lit around her gardenia with maybe a hint of citrus the housekeeper had lit them as shed settled her into the room and dont worry about privacy shed said theres oneway glass so you can see forever but no one can see you even if there was someone outside which there isnt the oneway glass is brilliant jake had it installed just after his father died jake did that he wants this place to be the best it was his stepmothers passion and we want to carry it on jakes stepmothers passion there was a lot here she didnt understand that she hadnt thought through she knew this place had been built by the local doctor and his wife charlie mcdonald had cared for this community for as long as most people remembered hed cared for her mother during her long illness allowing her to die at home surrounded by her family and her beloved animals tori remembered him with deep affection and with gratitude hed lived in combadeen and his wife had run the lodge the place up on the ridge had been his weekend retreat so theyd been weekend neighbours but just after shed started university hed retired to the city and shed not heard of him until his funeral and now the old doctor was charlie mcdonald jake was jake hunter illegitimate who knew with mixed families she tried to remember community gossip there was talk of a son at his funeral she remembered a faded baby photo on dr mcdonalds surgery wall that must be jake shed find out she had all the time in the world to get it right she thought dreamily as she sank deeper into bubbles but then she thought no she was only here for a night until she organised something more permanent and jake himself would return to new york thered be no time for questions the thought left her curiously bereft but at least she could sleep tonight she reminded herself she glanced through into the bedroom at the enormous bed piled with whiteonwhite eiderdowns and feather pillows a woman could melt into a bed like this as opposed to melting into a man like jake hunter she was delirious that was the only possible explanation for where her mind was taking her she was not thinking of doing any melting into any man all she had to do to stop that was to think of toby betrayal a heartache that would never leave her jake was different maybe or maybe not she thought sharply but jake was heading back to new york and he didnt want to even indulge in fiveminute dating much less anything else she was tired beyond belief and her mind was playing tricks so get out of the bath get to dinner so you can go to bed right she wiggled even deeper under the bubbles tori uhoh jakes voice brought her bolt upright tori are you okay im fine she managed feelingdiscombobulated she was covered in bubbles and she was bright pink had she locked the door she didnt think so dinners ready ive fed rusty but do you want yours here or in the dining room in here she thought but then maybe he had it with him maybe if she said the word the door would open in the dining room she squeaked you want a hand out of the bath no she heard him chuckle hey im a doctor remember im used to human bodies youre not my doctor and youre not used to this one go away yes maam he said and there was silenceand she pulled herself awkwardly out of the bath and thought maybe just maybe she should have let him in maybe she even wanted to maybe she was losing her mind the meal was served on the terrace tori left rusty on her bed watching the doorof courseand made her way cautiously through the dining room and outside and paused she could see the whole world the valley meandered downhill following the ancient river path far in the distance she could see the faint flickering lights of the city at dusk but the foreground was simple natural beauty the dusk wasnt so deep that she couldnt see vines around the house lines and lines reaching into the distance gum trees followed the rivermassive eucalypts with wide spreading branches for tori whod lived with blackened skeletons for so long the sight was enough to make her gasp we thought you might have gone down the drain it was jake rising to greet her as well as jake there was rob and two tiny wrinkled women smiling a welcome one of the women had her arm in a sling she looked pale and strained and she held her arm as if it hurt the other looked a little better but not much her forehead was badly scarred and she was glancing nervously at her companion as if she was deeply worried about her fire victims both six months raw they were all six months raw do you need introductions rob said easily rising as well shed recognised the women but was given introductions anyway tori you must know miss glenda parlingpostmistress to combadeen until fifteen years ago and mrs doreen ryde doreens glendas sister youve already met mrs matheson our own personal wizardchef and of course you know jake sit down and wrap yourself round some of mrs mathesons cooking jake was holding her chair for her there was nothing for her to do but sink onto the lovely upholsteryand sink into the night jake and rob were chatting drawing the elderly ladies out between them they let her be as if protecting her the conversation had obviously been going on before she got there she was free to take in her surroundings and the people around her the lilt of soft music in the background the fragrance ofmore gardenias and then the food arrived for six months shed been living on snacks on the run whatever jake and rob planned for this place it was obvious snacks on the run were not on the menu for all her life afterwards she remembered that meal first there were tiny garfish with slivers of lemon and curls of melting butter cooked to perfection and leaving her mouth exploding with flavours of the sea shed barely finished when fingers of crusty toast arrived spread thickly with a creamy trout pate with caviar on the side around the plate were tiny tomatoes shreds of lettuce and curls of shallots how could a salad taste of sunshine when winter was barely over the greenhouse at the edge of the balcony gave her the clue the night grew more dreamlike jake was filling her wineglass with something white and cool and luscious she was achingly conscious of his presence but he didnt speak to her and she didnt speak to him conversation was happening around her but she felt as if she was in some sort of bubble free to be her with no intrusion then came the lobster and it took her breath away it had to have been caught this morning she thought shed never tasted lobster like this she glanced up and jake was watching her enjoying her enjoyment she should think of something to say but it was too wonderful and she left him to think what he liked and went back to cracking a claw or trying to crack a claw she was struggling then jake leaned over and cracked it for her expertly as though hed cracked a thousand claws in his life he tugged the flesh free and held it out she almost took it straight into her mouthbut what was she thinking somehow she pulled back took it in her fingers and slid it into her mouth herself almost decorous but not quite jake smiled and she tried to smile back and feltand felt she didnt know what she was feeling she wasnt making any sense to herself rob was at her elbow then asking if she wanted her wine refilled she put her hand over her glass in a gesture of panic had she only had one glass she felt dizzy or maybe floating was a better word they were eating by candlelight now the night sky was full of stars and the moon was rising vast and round it was unseasonably warm and the warmth was adding to her feeling that shed been transported to another world jake was watching hershe knew itand that added to the floating sensation as well you cant always eat like this she managed as the housekeeper put a parfait of raspberries and chocolate before her mmm jake said we were to pull out all the stops tonight mrs matheson said though the foods wonderful all the time glenda ventured this place is fabulous doreen and i keep coming here whenever we need time out and its like heaven if only we could bring pickles pickles our cat glenda said suddenly sad and once again tori noticed her wince as she moved her hand he was very traumatised during the fires but hes better now were all traumatised we live in the relocatable village while we rebuild but we both have health problems when things get too much we put pickles in the cattery and come here why cant you bring him she asked trying to focus on something other than the food the night jake mrs matheson was setting down platters of frosted grapes and tiny chocolates and jake was watching her with an air of a genie producing his magic she could reach out and touch him no we dont welcome animals here rob was telling her but rusty rustys a special request from the owner rob said giving jake a rueful grin old docs wife was allergic to dog and cat hair the nopet rule seemed easiest so weve stuck with it old doc being your father she asked jake and he gave a curt nod as if he didnt want to go there but this was obviously news to doreen and glenda clearly no one had explained who jake was until nowmaybe thered been no need maybe he hadnt even eaten with the guests until tonight now they looked astounded youre doc mcdonalds son they gasped as one and got another curt nod oh my dear doreen whispered sounding awed your father he was the most wonderful man oh when our papa died nothing was too much trouble she hesitated then looking puzzled youre not he and hazel didnt and then her face cleared i know youre dianes son thats right jakes voice said dont go there but doreen had had a wonderful dinner and wonderful wine and she was past picking up subtleties oh my dear of course you are doreen said thelma said you were at the funeral but no one believed her but youre the little boy doc lost he broke his heart over you not so much as youd notice jake snapped clearly wanting to move on i had no contact with my father from the time i was three i heard from him only once after my mother took me back to the states but i was a man by then andwelleven then he didnt seem keen to get to know me well thats nonsense glenda snapped back as if rising to bait she clutched her hand and winced again but a little pain wouldnt stop her defending a man she clearly idolised i was postmistress in combadeen for forty years and i can tell you that your father wrote to you every single week from the day your mother took you away with that awful american big fat letters they were crammed with everything he could think of he posted them every friday and you know what nearly every one of them came back marked returned to sender but he still kept sending them then about twenty years ago he went over to the states im going to find him glenda he told me but three months later he came back he looked dreadfuland he hadnt seen you your mother wouldnt let him near oh that woman glendas cheeks were pink with indignation anger building and building not that its any of my business she said but to hear you say there was no contact it makes my blood boil that your mother wouldnt let him keep in touch but then he met hazel even then he and hazel couldnt have children and i know he missed you every day of his life there was a deathly silence round the table jake looked as if hed gone into shock tori thought his face was a mixture of conflicting emotions maybe she should reach out and touch him maybe she could reassure him maybe she should just keep out of what was clearly not her business you said he met hazel twenty years ago jake said tightly now angry and disbelieving surely you meant thirty or more oh no dear glenda said that was why they couldnt have children hazel was in her early forties when they met of course they hoped but it didnt happen but my mother left because of my fathers affair with thishazel no dear she left because of the american his name was chuck or something appalling and his automobile broke down here and he had to stay until it was mended and thenwell off he went with your mother and you your father couldnt believe it he loved her so much oh but it was never going to work your mother hated the life as a wife of a country doctor she hated the calls the feeling of everyone knowing everyone the community she just hatedhere are you a doctor as well finally doreen spoke her eyes were alight with pleasureand with something else yes oh my dear doreen breathed to think glenda docs son coming home and a doctor as well and then she looked uncertainly at her sister and then directly at jake if you really are his son i dont suppose you know glenda wont go and see a doctor she broke her wrist dragging me out of the fire since she left hospital she wont go back and i know it hurts her terribly do you think we could trouble you to look at it just to tell us what you think im not sure that i could helpand i dont have registration to practise in this country jake said sounding flummoxed no but you could give us advice i dont think i can if youre old docs son you could try doreen said suddenly stern and tori remembered shed been a schoolteacher shes in such pain she hasnt slept for weeks it hurts and hurts and she doesnt tell me but i know she lies awake night after night she doesnt want to go to bed because the pain takes over again im so worried about her i dont know what to do the sternness left her she sniffed and then she sniffed again and finally she hiccupped on a sob while glenda stared at her in horror as if shed been betrayed doreen dont hes old docs son hell help us he even looks like his father i didnt know my father jake said tightly you should go back to see your own doctor they just give her sleeping pills doreen retorted gulping back more tears sleeping pills and those other blue things that stop it hurting for a little bit but then her stomach gets upset and she wont keep taking them and the sleeping pills dont work she cant go on like this neither of us can she touched her chest a fleeting gesture that spoke volumes it hurts us both please help us we have no right to ask glenda said sounding angry and distressed glenda was right tori thought they had no right to ask for professional help from this man he wasnt even qualified to practise in australia but then tori thought of the way hed worked with manya of the skills hed shown and he was an anaesthetist she thought hed know about pain management maybe he could help and despite her absolute certainty that she should stay out of this tori found herself inexorably caught up in doreens plea glenda jakes my friend she said softly ignoring jake for the moment and concentrating on glenda he helped me try and save my koala doreens right you knew jakes dad so you know him will you let him help jake can you see if theres anything you can do she caught the flare of shock on jakes facebut shed started now there was no way she could back off jakes also an anaesthetist she told glenda firmly but softly pain relief is what he does isnt that right jake yes he had no choice but to agree we know you dont practise medicine in australia she continued inexorably hooking him and keeping him hooked but if all glendas been offered is sleeping pills and little blue pills morphine yes glenda said hopelessly but my arms better they put a plate in it and screws its as good as they can get it and then can i see jake said and it was as if the whole world held its breath can i see those three little words had the capacity to turn this desperate little scene around glenda stared at him wideeyed and jake gazed right back not speaking giving her time to make up her mind the room held its collective breath and then very slowly glenda held out her arm and tori wondered if jake knew just how much trust went into that gesture glenda had been postmistress in the valley forever and her independence was legendary when her postboys called in sick glenda had been known to get on a bike and deliver herself often two or three mail runs in the one day for her to accept help but it seemed she was jake was pulling his chair round the table so he could sit facing her gently he took her hand in his and while glenda submitted her arm for inspection while tori watched glenda place her trust in him the warmth around toris heart grew and grew she should be concentrating on glenda she wassort of but when hed taken glendas hand in his it was as if hed taken her own i could be in huge trouble here she told herself feeling dazed i need to leave right now if i stay longer but she couldnt leave now jake was holding glendas hand lightly in his watching glendas face intently the tension in the elderly womans body was palpable was she expecting jake to hurt her im not probing jake said softly im just touching he rested her hand in his left hand and touched her damaged wrist with his right running his forefinger gently up and down her arm along her fingers not pressing smooth as silk stop me the minute i make you feel uncomfortable or i hurt you he told her stop me the moment i make anything worse she didnt stop him he ran his fingers over the back of her palm over and over and then cupped her hand and felt that too around her tori felt the tension ease everyone it seemed had been holding their breaths even mrs matheson whod been clearing coffee cups had paused riveted press my hand jake was saying here one finger at a time can you clench no dont try then what does that feel like like my hand doesnt belong to me glenda whispered like its not thereonly it is i can feel it but not like i want to feel it sometimes it hurts so much i just want to chop it off its not mine any more its not real it is real im being stupid glenda said as finally jake rested her hand in his again and let it lie no it was such a flat response that glenda stared youre not being stupid how long have you been putting up with pain like this a while months doreen said dully and its getting worse but at the beginning it did seem to get better yes glenda whispered thats why its stupid it got better and all the scans are good and the doctors say im cured only then the pain started ive seen this before jake said he was still holding her hand in his so gently he couldnt possibly be hurting im thinking this is something called complex regional pain syndrome he said and it was as if he was alone with glendaeveryone else had disappeared everything fits youve had major trauma so many of the bones and blood vessels and nerves were damaged that often a physical recovery masks more complex nerve problems the symptoms often occur months after the injury itself your hand feels cold and there are areas of sensory blunting it feels strange and stiff like it doesnt quite belong to you and then theres the pain you protect it to stop it hurting and the more you protect it the worse it gets your fingers are already starting to curl its hard to make them move i dont want to move them glenda whispered but its only my hand i was so lucky im better youre not better you have nerve damage that needs to be addressed jake said sternly and glenda blinked and looked at him with something akin to hope the doctors say theres nothing they can do that might be because youve been talking to surgeons jake said and no theres nothing more surgeons can do now its time to move to another specialty like you someone like me i cant prescribe in this countryim not registered but im happy to write a note for you to take to your family doctor asking that you be sent to a pain specialist more morphine morphines not great for this type of pain jake said what you need is a drug specifically targeting nerve pain and there are good ones my guess is that we can give you immediate relief the moment we get you a nervespecific drug if you agree first thing tomorrow we can find out who knows who in this valley and get you on something that will help i know people tori offered and jake sent her a smile that made her feel even more dazed there you go then first cab off the rank is our local vet they say there are six levels of connection between you and anyone else in the world im thinking tori will do it in two and then as glenda looked at him in disbelief he touched her cheek a huge gesture tori thought for someone who seemed to hold himself so aloof its okay he told her the nervespecific pain relievers are easy on the tummy and its not like youll need them forever you also need a hand therapist and you need her urgently as well if that hand isnt to turn into a claw you think you might be able to find us one of those tori dads old vet nurse has a daughter whos a hand therapist tori said absurdly pleased she works in the same clinic as the doctor i use there you are then jake said but firstlets pack that hand in heat before you go to bed well pack it in hotwater bottles or heat packs if robs got them well give you some of that morphineyes it has side effects but im thinking this is the last time youll take itand then youll sleep thats an order and he said it so sternly that to toris astonishment glenda giggled yes doctor she said thats what i like he said an obedient patient thank you doreen breathed and tori looked from jake to glenda and then back to jake and she thought i am in such trouble do not trust how could she not she didnt have a choice concentrate on work she thought suddenly fiercely jake was being kind because he was a doctor maybe she should think of a way she could be useful too rob tomorrow you and i need to talk about your pet policy she ventured as glenda glowed at her and then glowed back at jake she looked as if she might be as smitten as tori was feeling if youre giving fire victims time out what they most need is the people and pets they love are you allergic to cats jake no but but what but nothing he told her and shrugged and smiled there dont seem to be many buts right now where was the aloof man shed met at fiveminute dating he was unbending by the minute you organise it he said tell rob what he needs to do and hell do it what youre capable ofare you sure youre just a vet im just a vet she said a trifle unsteadily but jakes smile was making her feel as if she didnt know what she was any more do not trust if youll excuse me she said unsteadily im really very tired and rusty will be waiting goodnight all and because the night really was getting blurrybecause she didnt understand how the expression on jakes face was making her feelshe rose and fled just as fast as her dignity allowed her chapter five exhaustion took care of the first part of the night it almost always did but despite the wonderful meal the fabulous bed and the feeling of being nurtured the demons were never far away tori woke as shed done for the past six months at three in the morning to stare wideeyed into the dark remembering a darkness shed never forget rusty had gone to sleep on her bed now however he was where he always was at this time of the morning with his nose hard against the door waiting for someone to come home its time we both stopped waiting for them she told him but he whimpered and pawed the door and she rose to let him out to show him that no one was on the other side of the door rusty had been one of a pack maybe she should get a new pup she thought maybe thatd help somewhere sometime shed read that a measure of a life well lived was how many good dogs could be fitted in as a vet and dog lover since childhood she accepted that for a fundamental truth but still to take that last step and move on she wasnt ready and she wasnt sure rusty was either she walked out onto the verandah and gazed up at the mountains looming above the moon was vast and full turning the night into a sepia version of daylight with the blackened landscape softened disguised rusty nosed her ankle and whimpered we shouldnt be off the ridge she whispered stooping to hug him it feels wrong it wasnt wrong she had to start her new life tomorrow but maybe shed come down too quickly right now it felt as if shed forgotten something very important maybe we need to say goodbye she whispered come on rusty we can do this do this and move on she slipped back into her room and tugged on jeans and windcheater then headed out again her little dog at her heels she didnt go out through the house though she didnt want to wake the household so she slipped out onto the verandah down through the rose garden around the corner of the house to the car parkand she barrelled straight into jake coming in the opposite direction for a moment all her breath was pushed out of her shock left her speechless jake had caught her steadied her by her shoulders looked quizzically down at her then as rusty whimpered he squatted and patted the little dog under the ear hey its okay he told him im a friend rusty nuzzled his hand and moved closer to jakes ankle which was surprising all by itself tori thought feeling breathless rusty hadnt responded to anyone since his masters death are you running away jake asked mildly looking up at her in polite enquiry arent you supposed to have a pole with a bandana slung over your shoulder i dont think running aways proper without them were not going far she managed struggling to make her voice work why are you up i couldnt sleep he said simply i had a whole lot of my preconceptions stood on their head at dinner its taking a bit of getting my head around like your father loved you theres a way to go before ill believe thathe said and his smile faded words are easy but youyoure going where up to the ridge you forgot something hed straightened his gaze held hers serious compassionate i yes do you want company i dont she faltered say no her head screamed but there was something about this night there was something about this man we left too fast she whispered tomorrow rusty and i will move onwe need to well start a new life but for six months weve simply been putting one foot in front of another over and over and in rustys case weve even lost a foot doing it i thought tonight i wanted to just say she faltered but his gaze didnt waver he took her hands of course you do he said softly can i drive you i dont if you dont want company then ill wait here for you to come back he said if you need to be alone then i understandof course i do ill sit here and wait and see if i can get rid of my own demons and if you dont come back by dawn then ill come up to the ridge and demand the ghosts give you back you belong in the real world tori tonight the real world will look out for you ill look out for you and she knew that he would trust there was that word again raising its ugly head but the night was still and beautiful and jake was watching her with a look that was nonjudgemental nonpossessive or needy it was simplycaring the sensation was insidious in its sweetness and there was no way in the wide world she could resist then yes please she whispered stupid or not id love it if you would come with me so they headed up to the ridge with jake driving and rusty cradled on toris knee only instead of glancing out the window all the time as rusty always did the little dog kept glancing across at jake as did tori she didnt understand what she was feeling she mistrusted the instinct that had her accepting his company but for now jakes presence was warm and solid and real and strangely it made what she wanted to do feel even more right they drove past jakes darkened farmhouse the hub of so much activity over the past six months and that felt strange then they turned into the drive of what once had been her home and that felt worse even the night couldnt disguise the destruction blackened fence posts massive trees felled and not yet cleared a gaping void in the blackened bushland where the house had once been a chimney rising out of the ashes like a lone sentinel a monument to what had happened i cant begin to imagine what it must have been like jake murmured and tori shook her head tears not far away what was it with this man she hadnt cried for six months how could she cry now i was in the valley she whispered i couldnt get back the whole mountain was on fire i was going out of my mind everyone with people we love up here was going out of their minds it took three days before we could get back three days he didnt respond just looked steadily out at the ruins and she knew by his silence that he could see how it must have been she climbed out of the car and he didnt follow as she made her way carefully over the ruins jake knew instinctively that she didnt want him to follow rusty came with her limping by her side but he had the right this had been home for both of them home if she could turn back time if only she hadnt trusted she picked her way across the rubble to the chimney stack the fireplace was almost intact a few bricks at the corner had fallen when a roof beam had dropped across the mantelthats how rusty had lost his leg she placed her fingers on the ledge above the fire cavity thered been a wooden mantel resting here and on it an ancient clock that never kept time pictures of her parents on their wedding day pictures of tori and micki as kids her graduation photo micki at some glamorous wanttobemodel shoot this hearth had been the heart of their home and in the end this small fireplace had succeeded in saving one little dog one small thread to connect her past to her future at least micki and her father had thought she was coming she thought bleakly letting herself think back as she so seldom allowed herself to do that was the only thing that kept her sanethat last frantic call from micki tori the fires on this side of the ridge ive rung emergency services shed said as she pushed her van past the speed limit heading into smoke so thick she knew shed have trouble getting through the fire trucks are on their way im on my way stay cool stay cool it had been their farewell line for ever between two sisters and taken up as a joke by their father shed said it then with love her sister had laughed and she knew her father and micki had died knowing she was moving heaven and earth to get to them and suddenly it was okay their ghosts were here now she could feel them a soft and gentle presence it was right to come tonight she thought shed loved her family more than life itself and they were still with her in this place rusty was by her side pressing against her a link to them she knelt and fondled him we can go on she whispered i cant forgive toby but maybemaybe i can forgive myself for trusting him dad and micki trusted him too they wouldnt want me to beat myself up forever jake was waiting life was waiting the night was still and warm and the moons gentle beams were almost a blessing it was time to go she straightened and turned jake was at the edge of the clearing watching gravely from the shadows im all right she said managing a smile im not about to wail or rend my garments im pleased to hear it thank you for coming it was my honour he said gravely and it was so much the right thing to say that she caught her breath she picked her way back over the ruins but he met her halfway catching her hands as she stumbled and helping her the last few steps okay he asked softly and she managed a smile and a sniff and if she left her hand in his then who could blame her it was so lovely here she whispered i cant tell you my mum and dad my sister our friends our dogs chooks chooks hens all sorts my dad bred rhode island reds they spent their lives clucking around the orchard can i show you the orchard she didnt wait for an answer but led him around the pile of rubble to a stand of small trees behind the house site the fruit trees stood out from the trees hed been seeing over and over up here on the ridge for they werent burned they were a mass of blossom in the moonlight on a bed of deep green grass the orchards deciduous she said simply not native they were so green in the summer that they didnt burn the grass under them was dry and it burned but the trees themselves didnt catch so now we have cherry blossom and apple blossom and peach micki and i had a big log swing hanging on the peach one day ill hang that swing again her voice faltered i hope youd want to live here again its my community she said simply my home rusty thinks so too but rusty wasnt looking around him he was pressed against jakes leg he was forming a new allegiance tori thought confused she pulled away a little and walked further into the orchard a lowhanging cherry branch brushed her hair and blossoms drifted around her she put her fingers out and caught them and suddenly she found herself smiling rusty had limped over to the base of the oldest treethe peach the grass here was thickest he wriggled down burrowing his nose in the long grass and gave a sigh of pure contentment it felt good more it felt great for the first time in six months she felt free the ghosts of her family were all around her a gentle loving presence that would do nothing to hold her back and jake was here suddenly it seemed right that he was youre beautiful jake said softly wonderingly and she smiled at him and shook the branch a little letting loose another cascade beautifuls how i feel right now she said simply thank you theres nothing to thank me for he stepped closer and plucked blossom from her hair youre facing your demons all by yourself no she said gravely how can i dont you know that all by yourself is a really bad idea i sense youre a loner jake hunter but loneliness isnt for now not for tonight and then because she didnt know whythe night the warmth the smell of blossom the sight of rusty wriggling contentedly in the grass that was once his favourite place the feel of this mans hand brushing her cheek as he lifted blossoms awayfor some a reason she would never understand she stood on her tiptoes and she kissed him loneliness isnt for now for jake too this day had been huge hed come to this country to put his property on the market and depart cutting the links to a father he held in dislike even contempt but things had changed his view of the past taught to him by a bitter woman had been challenged by an unbiased witness and had been found wanting there were emotions in his head that matched toris and now toris tragedy was layered on top of his he couldnt figure out what he was feeling but he didnt have to figure it out tori was doing it for him her mouth was on his her body was pressed against him and all he could feel was her sweetness her gentleness the beauty of this night he wanted her and as if shed read his thoughts i want you she whispered his hands tightened involuntarily on her waist and he was pulling her against him with a hold that was entirely proprietary entirely sure of what he wanted tori quite simply she was the most beautiful woman hed ever met she was in battered jeans and trainers an ancient windcheater her curls were all over the place her eyes were huge in her too pale face she was gorgeous and he wanted her this was some sort of magnetic attraction hed never met before some primitive link some compulsion he didnt fully understand who was he kidding he did understand it he wanted her as simple as that something tonight had pulled him to her in a way he didnt understand but he wasnt questioning it it was the way her hands held his the way she looked up at him in the moonlight the way she tugged him closer closer so he could no longer see her face so all he could do was feel the beating of her heart they both knew where this was going they both knew how right this moment was but i dont have a condom on me he said in a voice so hoarse he hardly recognised it we cant im protected from pregnancy she managed breathless sounless were talking multiple partners were okay toby and iwe tested im safe he growled but sense prevailed enough for him to haul away from her long enough to rake his fingers through his hair knowing he should put her away from him knowing he must tori you dont know me you shouldnt trust me you shouldnt want to i know its crazy stupid risky crazy you already said crazy that means its double crazy so we stop we go sensibly back to the lodge he said it trying to keep his voice flat inflexionless as though she ought to agree to the sensible option he was giving her the sensible option but who wanted to be sensible not tori sensible was for tomorrow she took a deep breath her eyes not leaving his she tugged her ancient windcheater up and over her head and she tossed it aside her figure was perfectand more her bra was beautiful made of exquisite lace so white it was almost luminous in the moonlight her breasts were framed by the sweetly curving lace they were soft mounds of perfection and they took his breath away all of her took his breath away shed kicked off her shoes now she pushed the zip and stepped out of her jeans as if it was the most natural movement in the world her panties matched her bra hed forgotten how to breathe not all the welfare bins held handmedowns she said totally unselfconscious grinning at the look on his face a gorgeous swiss lingerie company sent a care box you like did he like he was speechless she was standing barefoot on the grass under the blossom tree smiling up at him all imp in the most beautiful lingerie hed ever seen in the most beautiful body hed ever seen the contrast to the woman hed methow many hours agowas stunning youre beautiful he said and it was totally inadequate my undies are beautiful she corrected him and he tilted her chin and gazed straight into her eyes and he shook his head youre beautiful he repeated so strongly she had to believe him but this are you sure tori i want you tonight i want you more than ive ever wanted anything in this lifetime but i do need to go back to the states your medicines in the states she whispered and she met his gaze directly clear and true knowing as he did that this was far too soon for any decision to be made as to a future this is no fiveminute date jake but neither is it any kind of commitment this is seduction need call it what you will but its for tonight its your need and mine for tonight and tonight only i trust you she said steadilyand she knew she was right for this night trust had returned with a vengeance she thought suddenly of jakes father of the elderly doctor shed known and loved and she knew that no matter how little hed known him jake truly was his son jake a stranger yet not here now he was hers im as sure as anything ive ever known she whispered my body wants you i want you and she fumbled with the catch to her bra but he was before her unfastening the clasp then cupping her breasts caressing holding teasing her nipples sending fire surging through her body blocking out all else this was so right this wasnow crazy but right stupid but wonderful perfect for now her body was on fire not crazy not stupid perfect he was touching each nipple in turn with his lips reverent wondering and she arched back hot with want it felt so good so wonderful to be lifted out of the past six months to feel the grey fading away like some forgotten nightmare her body was surging to his touch a bud unfurling in a blast of heat coming to life in ways shed never felt before jake she should be embarrassed she should at least be a little selfconscious she felt nothing but right his gaze told her she was beautiful and for tonight she believed that message absolutely i believe things are a little unequal she managed and somehow she unfastened his shirt button by button a slow inexorable path of exploration while he kissed her lips her breasts the nape of her neck trailing kisses downwards while she tried to concentrate on undressing him his shirt was gone his belt his chinos and then finally he was kicking them aside and all his clothes had disappeared her skin met his as he tugged her close closer her body curved into his and fell onto the bed of soft lush grass they gasped as one as the coolness of the grass met their bodies they were clinging to each other for warmth for heat waiting for the loving to take over and for the cool of the night to disappear as it did as it must she wanted him she ached for him as he kissed her deeply searchingly wonderfully as his fingers explored every contour of her body as her breasts moulded to him as their heartbeats synchronised she wanted him wanted him wanted him skin against skin fulllength she had him all he was hers she was riding his body mounting him holding him hard under her she was aching aching tori he whispered and then he groaned and then there was no space for words at all for finally searingly wondrously he was a part of her his rhythm was her rhythm his body was her bodyskin merging into skin body merging into body and the night was dissolving in a haze of heat and want and pure wondrous delight she loved for tonight she even trusted for tonight this was her man chapter six somewhere towards dawn they made their way back to the lodge jake drove tori sort ofwafted she felt beautiful she felt cherished more she felt as if her world had transformedlike the grey had shifted and the sun was shining through it marked an end of the dreariness she thought and as jake refused to let her walk but carried her from the car to the houseand that meant carrying rusty as well because she wasnt letting him goshe felt as if shed moved to another life the dawn was beginning to glimmer over the mountains when the household woke life would begin again life on the other side youre smiling like the cat that got the cream he murmured as he climbed the verandah steps and her smile broadened i believe i am i believe i did tori no she reached up and touched his lips not a word nothing that was justperfect it woke me up it was like life started again i dont know if you can understand all i understand is that youre beautiful can i carry you to my bedroom no she whispered i dont want to wake up beside you something shuttered in his facean expression she didnt like pain no it was a closing of something that had barely started to open jake no she said swiftlyshe did not want to hurt this man but this was important she was struggling to explain it struggling to understand it herself but somehow she had to find words for what she was feeling what happened tonight was magic time out of frame i needed it so muchi needed youand ill be grateful for the rest of my life but if i wake up beside you in the morning it is morning you know what i mean if i wake up beside you then i might hold and cling i might even get needy i dont want that i dont want anything to mess with what we had tonight i dont want to fall in love where had that come from no matter it was there hovering between them as if both had thought it who knew what jake was thinking but she felt it knew it and accepted that it was to be feared love after one night she didnt think so she knew she had to move on somehow jake seemed to have given her the strength to do just that and she would not mess with it i loved tonight she whispered tonight i loved you but we both know our worlds dont fit together lets just accept tonights magic and move on im not sure i can he was pushing open the door to her bedroom with his foot to leave you here its what i want was it no part of her was screaming but the rest of her was sensible and it had to be sensible for all of her youre so and so are you and then she paused they both paused toris room was right at the end of the house the room next to hers was doreens from the other side of the wall came the muffled sound of terror whimpering sobs of fear real pain they couldnt ignore it neither of them could tori slid down from jakes arms and slipped rusty onto the bed but before shed straightened jake was heading out the door she reached him before he reached doreens door tugging him back let me she knows me she knocked doreen its tori can i come in i no oh my dear did i wake you it was a breathless gasp im so sorry for answer tori opened the door a sliver jake was beside her but she motioned him to stay where he was she slipped in but she left the door open just a little so jake could hear doreen whats wrong she asked and then as her eyes grew accustomed to the dim light and she made out the figure huddled among the vast nest of pillows her heart wrenched she was with her in a heartbeat gathering the elderly woman to her simply holding oh my dear dont tell glenda doreen gasped jake stayed outside silent as a panther she couldnt hear him but she knew he was there waiting to see if he was needed you mustnt tell glenda doreen gasped again shes asleep at last its just angina nothing it hurts and i wake up and you know how the night terrors take over of course she did night terrors must surely be reality for every person whod been on the ridge that day tori thought but as she held her as she felt her thin frame shake she thought this was more than nightmares and maybe more than angina too her hands were cold and sweaty and she could feel her tremors she put her fingers on her neck finding her carotid pulse it was fast erratic frightening doreen im not sure this is just angina she said trying to keep her voice steady not wanting to put fear into the equation as well i think we should get this checked can i call an ambulance no at least let me call jake no doreen whispered but she said it much less forcefullyand then she stopped breathing one minute she was sitting on the edge of her bed half supported by tori the next she simply swayed backwards falling onto her pillows unconscious toris fingers had been on her neck feeling her pulse her hand followed her downand there was no longer a pulse doreen had said not to call jake that was five seconds ago this was now jake she yelled at the top of her lungs jake i need you now he was with her before shed stopped yelling she was still searching for a pulse but with her other hand she was hauling doreens legs back onto the bed shoving away the bedclothes that were half covering her she said angina i think nowcardiac arrest no pulse jake was on the other side of the bed like her searching for a pulse then hauling pillows away lying her flat checking her airway breathe for her jake snapped and took the neckline of doreens flannelette nightgown and ripped it to the waist his big hands rested on doreens chest for a moment steadied then moved rhythmically into cardiac massage breathe he snapped at her again tip her head back hold her nose and fill her lungs with your breath twice then i pump come on tori she needed no third bidding she breathed while jake took a short break from chest compressions fifteen pumps per minute down down down while tori breathed and prayed and breathed and prayed and breathed and prayed they needed an ambulance defibrillator oxygen adrenaline but there was no time no space to call for help if they didnt get doreen back now no amount of equipment or expertise would help her no more deaths please no not doreen breathe and pray breathe and pray dont panic jake said softly and he must have sensed rather than felt her surge of despair steady tori slow and steady dont stop breathing until youve seen her chest rise he wasnt altering his rhythm down down down over and over over and over how long now please please early days jake said two minutes no longer big breaths tori deeper im going harder he did and she heard the unmistakable sound of a rib cracking she winced but kept on breathing kept on breathing another crack and then a ragged heaving gasp so harsh it caught them both by surprise doreens whole body shuddered tori drew back a little hardly believing but doreen dragged in another breath and then another life jake was hauling her onto her side clearing her mouth again supporting her making sure she didnt gag choke while tori sat back on her heels and stared and felt sick to the stomach and then suddenlynot sick she could hear doreen breathe itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout where had that come from it was weird little song a childs tune from her past and suddenly as she watched jake work as she waited to see that she was no longer needed that she was free to go for help the song was in her head her mother had taught it to her she remembered sitting on her mothers bed singing it and then after her mothers funeral she remembered her father bringing home two puppies one for her and one for micki im calling him itsy shed told her father and micki had called her puppy bitsy she thought suddenly crazily and totally inappropriately if doreen lived then she wanted another dog and she wanted to call him itsy it was part of her prayer doreens breathing was steadying tori was grinning like a fool and jakes smile was almost as wide as hers but he wasnt relaxing yet his smile was there but it was intent and his attention was totally fixed on doreen he was moving on she thought totally concentrated on medical need she however could back away a little with doreens breathing settling they could risk tori leaving for a moment call the ambulance jake said you have mobile cardiac units here micas yes mobile intensivecare ambulances thats what i want and i want them here yesterday then wake rob i want the firstaid kit he keeps we have oxygen move tori she moved she might be a vet and not a doctor but she didnt have to be a doctor to know the situation was still grave something had stopped the flow of blood to doreens heart and that something was still not resolved see if rob has dissolvable aspirin jake snapped and then as doreens eyes widened focused his tone changed he sat down on the bed beside her and he took her hand in his hey doreen youve given us all one hell of a fright he told her as tori headed for the door you passed out on us im supposed to be an anaesthetist not a cardiologist and im not supposed to practise medicine in australia are you trying to get me into trouble he was wonderful tori thought dreamily she fled when the ambulance arrived it came complete with its own paramedical team they moved swiftly and efficiently and tori and the now wideawake rob were no longer needed and doreen still wouldnt let them wake glenda she hasnt slept for weeks she whispered i checked on her before i went to bed and she was sleeping like a baby please dont wake her i dont need anyone to go with me ill go with you tori said i dont need anyone of course you do tori smiled down at her the events of the night making her feel spacey and happy and floaty nothing would happen now jake had saved doreen and somehowsomehow it felt as if jake had saved her the leaden weight that had hung around her heart for six long months had lifted she glanced down as something brushed against her leg and it was rusty but he wasnt brushing against her he was simply positioning himself so he could press more closely against jake you and me both she thought mistily and then doreens hand reached out and took jakes and she thought you and me three could you come with me doreen whispered to jake and the force shed used to forbid them to wake glenda was gone she sounded frail again and frightened youre old docs son im thats a really good idea rob said sounding relieved itd be great if she had a doctor go with her in case she arrests again it was unspoken but definitely implied and for reasons of her own doreen agreed old docs son doreen whispered combadeen has its doctor back her hold on jake tightened its so good to have you home who could sleep after that the ambulance left with doreen and jake aboard despite robs protestations tori sat on the verandah and watched the dawn rusty was watching the road again but things had changed who he was watching for had changed theres no use changing your allegiance in that direction she told him but as a transitional tool hes very useful the only problem was jake didnt seem like a transitional tool he felt permanent but of course he wasnt when shed run into him tonight hed been shocked to the core thrown out of kilter by what hed heard about his father he had a lot of thinking ahead of him shed seen his face as hed followed doreen to the ambulance there was no choice in what he had to do hed care for the old lady hed do his best but he was thrown what had doreen said hed come home he was a long way from home she was sitting outside glendas bedroom the french windows were open and when finally she heard her stir she went in to tell her what had happened to her surprise glenda seemed almost relieved i knew something was wrong ive been so worried but all shed do was worry about me i had to pull her out of the fire i was sure shed collapsed and it wasnt from the smoke but everyone was so busy they just treated the burns she sat up in bed and nursed her bad wrist and she looked almost happy and old docs son is with her jake jakes home im sure shell be fine she had breakfast refusing to be worried her faith in jake absolute when rob offered to take her to the hospital to relieve jake to bring him home she accepted with pleasure they leftand finally tori went back to bed jakes home it didnt make any sense at all but it kept playing and she slept with it in her head jakes home it was midday before jake drove robs car back to the lodge doreen had been transferred to the large teaching hospital in the citywithout glenda accompanying her stubborn and independent r us described the two sisters jake thought wryly they worried about each other and not themselves thus you stay here and get that hand seen to doreen ordered glenda as she was wheeled away to the waiting ambulance on her way to get a cardiac stent rob offered to stay on with glenda he had things to do in town and was happy to wait if jake came back later in the afternoon to pick them both up that should have left jake free to return to the lodge but the combadeen hospital was shortstaffed and once shed heard the story of glendas hand once glenda told her what jake did for a living the local doctor grabbed him and held if youre an anaesthetist id like some solid advice she said so firmly he had nowhere to go i cant get glenda into see a specialist before the end of the month yet i cant have her in this level of pain until then if shed told me it seemed she hadnt discharged from hospital glenda had made perfunctory followup visits to the city outpatients and then had simply ceased complaining neuropathic pains horrible dr susie fulton said gently to glenda still fixing jake with a gimlet eye he wasnt escaping on her watch but anaesthetists are better at diagnosing it than family doctors so can you bear dr hunter examining you fully so he can tell us what he thinks is going on that way i can care for you until we get you some specialist help jake is specialist help glenda said stoutly hes dr mcdonalds son charlie mcdonald the plump little country doctor straightened and beamed charlies son oh my dear have you come home no jake said shortly this is not my home but as he examined glenda with a lot more care than hed done the night before as he gave solid advice and then finally as he drove back to the lodge the phrase kept playing in his head had he come home of course he hadnt this could never be home why not it didnt make any kind of sense this was the place his mother hated the walls closed in on me in that place shed told him everyone knew everyone elses business you couldnt get away your father was everyones best friend everyone thought he was their own property everyone thought i was their property its claustrophobicpeople clutching you needing you you cant imagine he could imagine doreen had clutched him and as soon as glenda arrived at the hospital shed done her own clutching then the local doctor even rob great that you were here hed said you know if you were to consider staying this valley needs doctors more than it needs rain it was as though he was being hammered too much had happened too fast and on top of the myriad emotions he was feeling towards a family he felt he no longer knew hed made love to a woman whod twisted his heart was it only two days ago that hed met her disturbed and tired beyond bearing he pulled the car over to the verge and closed his eyes he desperately needed to sleep a power nap would keep him going and itd also clear his mind hed used this technique often during his career when things were closing in on him seemingly too difficult hed simply stop clear his mind of everything sleep a little and when things percolated back the white noise would be gone and only the urgent issues would stay he lay back in the car seat letting everything fade maybe he slept for a little when he opened his eyes a flock of white cockatoos had landed in the paddock beside the car they were screeching and wheeling like something in an alfred hitchcock movie and yes things were clearer no matter the pressures mounting on him he didnt belong here no matter that it had been his fathers home it wasnt his home the screeching of these unfamiliar birds cemented it but tori tori was different the thought of her was front and centre in his mind still right where shed been when hed gone to sleep she was one special woman the white noise was the claustrophobia of this environment of the needs of this valley that had to be removed it had nothing to do with him tori was separate maybe they couldnt be separated well if not he had no place here his life his work his future were in manhattan the past two days had changed nothing except he might have fallen very hard for a woman called tori tori rang the hospital as soon as she woke things are fine susie told her doreens already in melbourne north western shes seen a cardiologist and theyre putting a stent in later this afternoon it seems a relatively straightforward block and amazingly there looks to be little longterm damage he thinks shell be fine glendas still here jake told me your suggestion about the hand therapist and shes with her now jakes lovely by the way glenda says he was your fiveminute date how about that she blushed nothing was secret in this valley hes nothing to do with me no dear but if you could have him be something to do with you id very much appreciate it susie said briskly the valley needs someone like him so much and his fathers reputation has gone before him people would trust him he lives in the states he has houses here susie pointed out so if you could think of any way to make him stay suse just saying susie said and laughed is he home with you now no he should be soon then robs got a couple of things to do in town the arrangement is that jakell bring back the car at five and pick up rob and glenda so that gives you a whole lot of time all by yourselves so see what you can do my dear ive been advertising for a partner for years if you can do it with one fiveminute date ill be very pleased indeed she chuckled and disconnected tori stared at her phone as if it was poison the valley gossips had been at it already no one knew about last night all they knew was that shed walked out of a fiveminute date and she was sharing a house with jake yet already already she felt her cheeks flush jake would hate it she hated it she would not have last night sullied by gossip so move on she told herself move on fast jake was on his way home she needed to be out of here make another phone call yes of course she was told by a women whose sympathy was matched with the efficiency of six months postbushfire organisation youve been almost the last one left living up on the ridge therere three homes left in our relocatable village you can take your pick feeling more and more panicked tori decided she could sort her gear later she gathered rusty and headed out the drive she turned out the stone entranceand almost hit jake coming in she stopped it was only courteous she had to say goodbye shed made love to this man what had she been thinking she knew exactly what shed been thinking he climbed out of the car and she was caught again by how good he looked yes his pants were creased and when she looked closely there were a couple of grass stains on his shirt he needed a shave his hair needed a brush he looked incredibly hot he climbed out and smiled at her and hot didnt begin to describe it he made her heart turn over where are you going he asked peering in her passengerside window and rusty practically turned himself inside out in order to reach him tori pressed the window button the window slid down and rusty was in jakes arms in a flash jake submitted to being licked and even laughed as the little dog squirmed his ecstasy in finding his friend his friend her friend this man was seriously seriously sexy im going to see my new home she said frantically attempting to firm something inside her that felt very much in need of firming can i come with you could he come um no um not wise but rusty was licking his nose again he was laughing and what was her head doing saying no of course he could come she could no sooner deny this man than fly of course she said and he opened the door and climbed in uhoh where was her escape plan now you dont have anything else to do she asked half hopeful i need to be back at the hospital at five to collect rob and glenda thats four hours you dont need to sleep ive slept youve slept for at least an hour any more is for wusses right she said thoroughly disconcerted and restarted the engine and headed down the valley to her new home with her man beside her her man who wasnt her man a manhattan doctor jake the relocatables were set up as a village from a distance they looked like rows of shoeboxes lined up side by side even from the road tori could see there was no use checking out the three shed been offered and choosing between them theyd be exactly the same what is this place jake demanded staring around in dismay home tori said resolutely heading for shoebox the key was in the door she pushed it open and bit back a gasp of dismay home not shed need to make it home fast she thought or the resolution shed decided on would fail her somehow what had happened last night had seemed the catalyst for moving on but now staying near jake any longer seemed dangerous this was the sensible option but this was beige and jake was still here so shed use him again she thought shed use his energy we need to shop she said briskly but jake wasnt listening you cant stay here its like a budget motel its better than a budget motel she snapped its new and its comfortable and its mine so what will you do here ive been offered a job in a pet clinic on the outskirts of the city was that what you were doing on the ridge my father and i ran a horse clinic she said with a smallanimal practice on the side there were scores of horse studs on the mountain theres not a lot of horses up there now though and there wont be for years so its pets only a furrow appeared between her eyes and she shrugged no matter last night showed me i can move on and i will she was looking around taking careful assessment but youre right i cant live here like it is now she said i need to go shopping she glanced at her watch hesitating i should have come alone but we have time before youve promised to pick up glenda if i wait until after then i wont have stuff today and i need this place to be cheerful tonight youre not staying here tonight i am she said flatly and definitely and then she smiled taking the sting from her words todays the first day of the rest of my life do you want to come shopping did he theres time she said refusing to be deflected by his dismay theres a great asian trading centre a couple of miles from here i reckon i could get all i need there and more he stared at her stunned the difference between the tori of now and the tori of yesterday was quite simply extraordinary what had happened between them last night had shaken his world but for tori it seemed to have marked a turnaround transforming her from griefstricken victim to woman about to embark on her new life we should have brought the two cars she said but cheerfully as if she wasnt very sorry youre welcome to stay here and wait or are you happy to watch me shop she smiled and there was determination behind the smile she might be transformed he thought but the grief was still with her she was moving forwards with shadows and the least he could do was come along for the ride shoppings my favourite thing he lied really no but its like hard work i can watch it being done for hours she chuckled a lovely rich chuckle that had the power to transform this stark little apartment into something else toris home bleak as a great mans house without a fireplace in it the words came fromwhere he hardly recalled the analogy so why should they spring to mind now dredged from literature or a play hed once seen but he knew why theyd come a house without tori in it seemed the same unthinkable she had the power to light from within and thats just what she was doing as she grabbed her bag and jingled her car keys rustys due for a nap i bought him a doggy chew so hell be happy enough staying here you want to drive or will i i will he said faintly i kind of like the challenge of driving on the leftand you should save your energy for shopping chapter seven so shop she did while he stood back and watched in something akin to awe she shopped with professional purpose quilts cushions rugs curtains blankets jugs vases wall hangings there was little hesitation she simply saw an item beamed picked it up stuck it in her trolley and when her trolley was full she used his arms instead youre not leaving much timeor roomfor milk and bread he managed muffled under rugs and she balanced another rug on top and steered him towards the door i can get milk and bread after weve taken rob and glenda home youre definitely leaving the lodge tonight he asked and she started unloading onto the register and tried to locate her purse among pillows of course she said absently thats what this is about i need to get my own place but i dont want to live with beige its only one step better than grey and im not going there ever again itd be good if you stayed at the lodge a bit longer he said diffidently but shed handed over her money her hands were free and she could respond now with her full attention she turned and faced him square on frivolity gone good for whom you need to rest i wouldnt rest if i went back to the lodge we both know that not with you around the cashier a bored teenager with lavender spiked hair looked suddenly less bored well maybe lack of rest has its advantages he ventured fighting an adolescent urge to blushbut tori shook her head any more than one night and i might get the wrong idea no strings jake you dont seriously want them do you i how had they got here so fast no was there any other possible response there you go then she was piling stuff back into his arms tucking a pillow under his chin press down or well have pillows all over the car park can you manage yes of course then were finished she said lets go conversation finished she steered the talk onto inanities while they drove back to her new home and unloaded hed never seen colour used to such effect within fifteen minutes the drab little relocatable had become home outside it was still a shoebox but inside it was the sort of shoebox a man might walk into and smile because it looked exactly what his vision of toris home should be even rusty approved hed been staring dolefully at the door when they arrived lying on the beige carpet now he was snuggled between two crimson and skyblue cushions with a purple throwrug wrapped snugly around his injured lower half he looked approving jake thought he approved as well itll take me a while to organise the curtains tori said glowering at the beige venetian blinds these might give us privacy but if anyone thinks im looking at them for more than a night they have another think coming now she glanced at her watch half an hour i need flowers flowers theres a flower farm half a mile from here you want to come watch tori buy flowers or stay here and wait of course he wanted to come rusty decided to come this time so he drove them both to the flower farm and she bought half a dozen daffodils and then two dozen tulips and then about a hundred gerberas in about three minutes and then she decreed she was finished the word sounded too stark finished she had such courage he thought as they loaded the car and set off again she was amazing and more and more the thought of her staying in that sterile little relocatabledespite her additionswas almost unbearable but her face was set determined as though shed made a decision and nothing was about to deflect her she felt his glance and met his gaze and smiled but he knew the smile was an effort he was leaving for new york he couldnt help her even if he could thatd mean getting involvedand he didnt do involved did he lots of things had to be thought through he mused fighting confusion but in the meantime there should be something he could do there must be some way he could help her and suddenly there was they were driving past a farm gate and a sign roughly scrawled on a piece of tin propped against the mailbox made him take his foot off the accelerator then as the idea took hold he braked pulled the car onto the verge and stopped um why are we stopping she demanded weve forgotten something both you and rusty need he was backing into the driveway and finally she saw the sign golden retriever puppies ten weeks old we dont she gasped yes you do he said and somehow he knew enough of this woman to realise his gut instinct was right you had four dogs you and rusty have had six months by yourselves and thats long enough i have colleagues with dogs and i know how big a part of their lives they are and ive met golden retrievers they smile you live in a place where pets are welcomeyes i saw the signso why not then as he saw her face a mixture of distress and despair he cut the engine tilted her chin with his finger and said tori you need something warm and alive and new something not scarred by whats gone before if rusty hates itif you hate it then okay but i do want you to think about it she still looked distressed he hesitated unsure what to say unsure what his feelings were last night this woman had moved him as no one had ever done if he had longer if it was possible maybe shed even penetrate the armour hed built up around himself but for now he couldnt leave her like this despite the colour and the flowers he couldnt leave her in her strange little relocatable relocatable even the name seemed wrong this woman needed a home home was a strange concept for jake whod always regarded home as where he could crash with least effort but there was something about tori that said home was much more last night changed things he said softly they say men can take sex as it comes and maybe theyre right most of the time but theyre not talking about what we had last night its bound me to you in some way i cant begin to figure it made me feel like part of you is part of me whether thats dumb or not thats the way you make me feel our lives dont connect not now not yet but i cant walk away and leave you and rusty without something of me he glanced again at the sign maybe this was a copout he thought but for now it was all he could do anything else scared him stupid so can i buy you and rusty a puppy he asked again from me to you so we get to hug a puppy in the middle of the night instead of you she whispered in a voice that wasnt quite steady instead of nothing he said and he heard bleakness but he couldnt help it he hesitated and then because it seemed right he kissed her gently on the lips and forced a smile though you can pretend its me if you like i hear golden retrievers make great tongue kissers eww he grinned the distress on her face faded and the tension between them lessened a little the kiss seemed to have made things better it had made them seemfriends as well as lovers friends instead of lovers tori was smiling a little now but she was chewing her bottom lip looking at the sign looking at him looking at the sign again focusing on a puppy it was no small thing he thought to lose three beloved dogs and then to move forwards should i call him jake she asked and he blinked jake big and warm and a bit shaggy hey it fits i dont believe im shaggy you could be she said if you loosened up a little if you forgot to be a manhattan millionaire im not rob says you are rob talks too much im just a doctor doing his best she said laughter fading and your best has been wonderful you saved doreens life last night in a way youve saved glendas youre wonderful the depth of sincerity in her voice was unmistakable youre wonderful hed never been given such a complimentby such a woman and suddenly the light kiss hed just given her was no longer enough he desperately wanted to kiss her againonly this time deeply and longbut she was looking at the sign again and there was a furrow between her eyes that told him her focus was no longer on him he had to back off i guess she said slowly im not working yet itd be a good time to get a pup and it could really help rusty okay forget the kiss concentrate on what was important itd be a great time to get a pup and id love to buy one for you id pay she said quickly no he said and he tugged her round to face him again manhattan millionaire tori my gift she smiled a little bit wobbly but a smile for all that if hes from a manhattan millionaire then he should have a diamondstudded collar hed think it was girlie then she said her smile widening as she climbed out of the car lets see if they have a girl jake might need to become jackie a golden retriever who doesnt sniff at diamonds jake or jackie lets see what they have she didnt choose a jake she chose a female and she chose a runt or rusty chose a runt and tori agreed he might have known there were six pups as big as one another as energetic as one another as healthy as one another there was one bigger than the rest a male who obviously spent his life trying to round up his litter mates growing more and more exasperated as his siblings didnt do what he wanted and then there was a tiny female who tried gamely to join into the family romp and got knocked over every time rusty went straight to her nose to tail tail to nose and they started tentatively to play we nearly put her down the breeder told them as tori scooped up the pup in one hand and rusty in another my husband wanted toshes such a runtonly she kept on fighting for her place at a teat and she has such courage that i couldnt bear to but shes not right she confessed as tori snuggled her under her chin her left ear is weird it sort of sticks up when its supposed to flop and her tails supposed to be long and feathery and i can tell already that its not the older shes getting the worse its looking if you want her shes cheap neither of them was thinking of money jake watched tori snuggle the little girl to her he watched her with two dogs in her arms and he felt great this was going to work then he got distracted the biggest pup had been tearing round in circles he had his litter mates rounded up but then one of his sisters made a break for it he darted after her the others scattered and he had to start the whole process again he practically beamed as he proceeded to bounce around the circle again he didnt know dogs his mother had hated them and now he spent his life at work a dog was out of the question but he watched tori cuddle her two and he thought he thought would you like two pups he asked her i think the roundup guys great toris arms were full of wriggly dog for a runt the little one had plenty of bounce and rusty was wriggling too they were practically turning inside out to reach each other two tori gasped are you trying to drown me she sank onto the floor and was pounced on by a sea of pups oh jake i shouldnt even think about one she was half laughing half crying this was a huge thing for her jake thought as he watched her hug armloads of pups shed lost three dogs in the most dreadful of circumstances and shed lost so much more for her now to move on to learn to love again it feels like a betrayal she whispered but she hugged her runt closer grief has to let you go sometime jake said softly what did auden say stop all the clocks they did stop for you tori but now they need to start again nothing is worth stopping the clocks for the rest of your life and if that means loving again says the man who doesnt do loving how did i can guess she whispered smiling up at him through tears im guessing your parents stuffed you so badly youve never got over it so why dont you get a pup i work fourteen hours a day he said shortly i can hardly leave one of these guys in a corner of the operating room while i work i guess you cant she said sadly but then a tiny smile tugged at the corner of her mouth as opposed to me im a vet i could take these guys to work i could manage two dogs not three he was still eyeing the roundup king circler extraordinaire can you imagine that guy in my shoebox she demanded following his gaze my yards the size of a pocket handkerchief even ones stupid maybe i shouldnt okay he needed to focus forget the roundup king he told himself and he crouched among the puppies so he was right in front of her it would be my pleasure to buy one of these pups for you he said please let me her gaze met his her eyes were glimmering with unshed tears but she was trying to smile a birthday gift whens your birthday he demanded stunned today youre kidding sort of she admitted but thats what it feels like my birthday like yesterday was one life and todays the beginning of another jake last night the breeder was watching a big broad woman in wellingtons and overalls waiting for them to make a decision on the puppies this was hardly the time to talk about last night but last night was great he told her and tonight not tonight she said fast her puppy wriggled to get down she released him and the king immediately took it as a personal affront that his huddle of pups had been interfered with he yapped and started circling again jake last night was last night she said it was the most wonderful gift its just made me feel alive again like theres life still to come so now as you said its time to start the clocks again so yes jake id love you to buy me a birthday gift my lopsided puppy itsy i think after a song my mother taught me itsy bitsy spider he asked bemused thats the one my guy could be bitsy nice try she said and grinned and lifted up her puppy and held her only this time it was almost as a shield one pup no more there were so many conflicting emotions in his head he didnt know where to start business he thought and he grabbed his wallet and made a play of finding his credit card for suddenly he couldnt look at her this woman with her arms full of pup this woman whose life had been destroyed and was now starting againwhile he went back to manhattan he need never see her again he thought and he felt suddenly unutterably bleak which was nonsense he didnt do relationships and he surely didnt do relationships with vets who lived on the far side of the world to him and he didnt do relationships with women he might just end up falling in love with but he looked at the play of emotions on her face as itsy licked and licked he looked at the errant curl that had escaped the knot shed tied last night those curls had been down hed run his fingers through them soft as silk he wanted her you want her or not the breeder demanded the dog she was talking about the dog i think we do he said still watching tori dont you love she blinked love figure of speech he said hastily dont you um tori she said and smiled and it was as if she could read his thoughts dr nicholls her smile held the memory of the night before it was the smile of a woman whod taken her man who knew what he was her man he belonged in new york he thought trying desperately to ground himself remember relationships he told himself they never last his mother had drilled it into him over and over until it was almost a mantra depend on yourself and only yourself you fall in love and you start being stupid only his mother had lied if shed lied about his father what else had she lied about but maybe in this she was right stupid would be taking tori into his arms right now and holding her and and what carrying her back to new york he surely couldnt see tori in his sleek manhattan apartment shed have to walk itsy in central park hed known her for what two days so maybe in this at least his mother was right you fall in love and you start being stupid he concentrated on payment he felt tori look at him for a long moment and then she turned her attention back to itsy bitsy was chewing his shoelaces he glanced down at the little dog and he thought bitsy was the stupid side of him as well the breeder scooped him up and put him back into the pen bitsy looked out through the bars as if hed just been put in solitary confinement will he sell he couldnt help asking oh yeah the breeder said confidently hes the best of the litter im thinking though that ill keep him myself for stud look at those bones bones all he could see was eyes looking out through the bars as if hed personally betrayed him he glanced at tori who was also looking wistfully at bitsywhile clutching itsy and rusty i cant she whispered she couldnt he could see that they had to get out of here before they had the whole litter just itsy he said just itsy tori whispered two is enough two dogs that was what she meant she had her house now she had her dogs shed start a new job a new lifeand hed go back to new york what was wrong with that they made a fast visit to a pet shop to buy itsy supplies then they headed back to the shoebox to drop off the flowers they also did two medical consultations it seemed that word had already spread that dr nicholls had moved into shoebox mansions they arrived back to find a border collie with a grass seed in its paw and a corgi with flatulence dogs and owners waiting patiently at her front door to jakes surprise tori took it in her stridein fact she even seemed pleased while rusty and itsy explored their miniscule backyard tori sat on the doorstep and turned into a vet again while jake and the owner held the big docile collie still she carefully tweezed out a cruellooking hayseed she cleaned the paw and disinfected it she then told the corgis owner where to buy charcoal tablets and to add a little yoghurt to her meals both owners went away happy youll be inundated jake said thinking of his mother of the way shed hated patients demands i like it she said simply it makes me feel like i belong he thought of his work of the careful distance he kept he worked long hours but to have someone approach him out of context a neighbour someone in his gym this wasnt his world tori wasnt his world he thought but how could he leave her maybe he couldnt it was a bit after five before they arrived back at the hospital to pick up rob and glenda were a wee bit late tori said starting to apologise but then glenda spotted itsy and no apologies were necessary glenda was beaming the new painkillers were obviously working the tight lines of pain around her eyes had eased and even though she was still cradling her arm there was a huge sense of relief about her doreen had gone through the surgery with flying colours the cardiologist had spoken to her and had been completely reassuring and rob had promised to take her to see her tonight and the hand therapist is wonderful she told them he didnt do very muchhe says i need really good pain control first and hes only going to work within the limits of what doesnt hurtbut he massaged really gently and i did tiny exercises and already its feeling better hes given me a sheet of exercises to do at home but im to come here every day because he says if we hadnt caught it now there might be longterm loss of function there might already be a little jake thought but he watched glendas shining eyes and thought a little loss of function would be nothing now that the pain was relieved so were both going to be okay glenda said happily but dr fulton says we have to persuade you to stay here she says anaesthetists make great pain specialists and this valley needs a pain specialist so badly and if youre anything like your father youd be wonderful she says therere so many burns victims with longterm problems longterm pain that we all need you and suddenly they were all looking at him glenda rob torieven rusty and itsy no he said really fast and glendas face fell toris face didnt change but he thought he saw the smallest quiver dont go there we need to get back to the lodge he said still too fast and glenda took the hint and turned her attention back to itsy is itsy coming to stay im only coming back to get my car tori told them ive moved into my new house itsy and rusty and i need to go home home there was that word again oh my dear thats a shame glenda said throwing jake a reproachful lookas if somehow he could have persuaded her to stay but had chosen not to oh and itsy would have made the lodge much more fun wheres your cat tori asked her pickles in the cattery on james street glenda said but then lets go spring him and take him back with us tori grinned happily at them all rob says the rule is no animals but im thinking hes the manager and jakes the owner jake your stepmother set the lodge up as an indulgence for the wealthy thats gone out the window what it needs now is to be a place people can come to recover if i were you id think about pushing that aspect hard even when the fires forgotten therell always be people who need an interim place between hospital and home pets are the first thing rob could make individual runs attached to the bedrooms guests can contain their own pet as much as they like but still take it for runs or cuddle it in bed at night she hugged itsy and rusty like i do itll be great and there it was again that queer lurch he didnt know what to do with oh if we could keep our cat glenda said while he tried to figure what exactly he was feeling and you know what else you could organise medical visits tori said and she was speaking directly to him now maybe you could set up treatment rooms so you could have visiting doctors physiotherapists hand therapists counsellors anyone you need youre talking staff jake said trying to focus on business when he just wanted to focus on tori you can afford it she said blithely and grinned i chose a very cheap pup you did he was distracted but his mind was on what shed said manwillinbah lodge as a health resort he looked at glenda and he thought it could work maybe rob would enjoy the challenge maybe hed enjoy the challenge he thought fleetingly but he stomped on that thought almost before it had a chance to reach the surface maybe he said trying to sound dampening but neither tori nor glenda would be dampened itll be lovely glenda said smiling and smiling doreen and i will come and stay all the time he hasnt said we can take pickles yet rob reminded her are you allergic to cats glenda asked suddenly frowning like your stepmother he knew nothing about his stepmother im not allergic he said shortly do you like cats yes but then theres no problem rob said you could buy a cat tori told him and they all looked at her she coloured a little but held her ground he jake said he couldnt buy a puppy because he works fourteen hours a day do you dear glenda demanded thats far too long yes but he could still have a cat tori said patiently or better still two cats cats are fiercely independent but theyre still there when you get home at night you need someone glenda said and glanced at tori who was still colouring and amended her statement i meansomething i think i know someone with a litter of kittens tori said no no tori said cautiously and he thought he heard laughter behind her tentative query if i want a cat i can get one in new york yes but will you no no i dont have room in my life for anything or anyone glenda said forgetting to be innocent and she was looking from tori to jake and back again no jake said steadier this time and firmer and mrs matheson will have dinner on we need to get back and he swung himself into the drivers seat without another word she sat in the passenger seat holding her dogs while jake concentrated on driving rob and glenda were chatting in the back seat jake was staring straight ahead and she thought there were things in this mans past that were hurting now shed noticed the way hed watched the crazy little male pup as he did his roundups hed lookedhungry she saw the same expression when he glanced at her as if he was looking at something he wanted but couldnt have fair enough she thought she felt a bit the same or okay she felt a lot the same they collected pickles from the cattery the ancient tabby purred with pleasure when glenda collected him he eyed the dogs with weary indifference through the bars of his cat cage as if to say if this is what i have to put up with to be free then so be it but toris dogs werent staying with pickles at the lodge she was taking them back to the relocatable tonight her new home she had an almost irresistible urge to stay at the lodge one more night but she glanced across at jakes set face and she thought no one more night would be one night too many maybe last night had been one night too manybut then neither of them had planned it it had just happened a primeval need that had shocked them both mrs matheson was on the verandah she walked down to meet them and added her voice to the chorus urging her to stay no she said sounding ungracious suddenly close to tears she thrust the dogs into jakes arms and disappeared inside to fetch her possessions when she came back out glenda and mrs matheson and rob had gone there was only jake leaning against her car he was holding itsy and rusty was at his feet he didnt look like a millionaire she thought inconsequentially he looked a bit rumpled casual nice jake she had to go she thrust her stuff into the trunk and lifted itsy from jakes arms before she got teary she put the dogs in the crate in the back seat and she was right to leave she was ready to walk away jakethank you she whispered holding out her hand in an absurdly formal gesture of farewellbut suddenly she couldnt say anything more because he had her in his arms and he was kissing her in a crazy way in a way that said he wanted her he needed her she was his woman this had nothing to do with reality she thought wildly but she let herself be kissed of course she let herself be kissed and kissed and kissed this was still about last night it was about the letting down of barriersthe beginning of her new life it had nothing to do with her wanting this man she couldnt want him she couldnt but for just a moment well maybe for just several moments she surrendered to him and she felt her body light from within she felt beautiful she felt wanted jake was kissing her holding her her breasts were moulding to his chest her feet were hardly touching the groundand she felt all woman and when finally he let her go when finally he put her away from him and held her at arms length she felt as if her world was shifting she felt breathless and bruisedand like she couldnt bear to walk away and it seemed that neither could he come to manhattan with me he said and her world didnt just shift it threatened to roll right over come to manhattan tori this thing between us whatthing the thing that says i want you he said simply simple there was nothing simple about this what was he asking she stared up at him dazed beyond belief tori i dont understand this he said softly tugging her close again kissing her hair ive never felt like this ive never expected to feel like this but now im due to start work back in manhattan next week and how can i leave how can i walk away from you i guessyou dont have to leave she whispered trying to make sense of what he was saying you own two houses here this is my fathers world not my world he said and suddenly he sounded more sure of his ground he sounded forceful determined even a little angry that she could make such a suggestion im an anaesthetist in a large teaching hospital im good at what i do ive worked hard to get there but you and i you and i she said the words slowly you and i theres a we jake you dont have room in your life for a puppy yet you ask me plenty of doctors have wives wives the word hung between them it felt like a threat tori thought suddenly bleak beyond description plenty of doctors have wives was he asking her to marry him what a thought what a way to bring it up if he was sothese doctors wivesthey dont need big yards his brow snapped downwards what the thats not what im saying so what are you saying youre asking me to marry you i dont know he said explosively i hadnt even thought of marriage but the way you make me feel you just do something to me youre saying its my fault im not talking about fault no she said bleakly but you dont want this to feel like this i cant pretend i never intended to of course you didnt and i wont be proposed to against your better judgement she said suddenly angry to be slotted into your life in the few minutes youre home between work and sleep in a place where theres no one i love how can you ask that of me we could take itsy and rusty back with us we could get a larger apartment he raked his hair and she thought he really hasnt thought this through he hadnt even known he was going to ask her to join him until the words were out of his mouth now he was trying to figure out how he could make it work we could make arrangements he said i dont want to make arrangements she snapped anger had arrived now coming to her aid in a red hot mist he thought he was attracted to her so hed take her home like a puppy from a pet shop without even doing the groundwork plenty of doctors have wives what sort of statement was that id take up space in your life jake hunter and you dont have space to give she told him knowing she was right even if it hurt like crazy to say it my community is here my work is here my life is here its not sitting in some drab new york apartment waiting for you to get home at night its not drab what colour is it grey but i rest my case tori this is stupid it is isnt it she said and suddenly inexplicably the anger died for somehow she knew where he was coming from he was as confused as she was and as blown away by the unexpectedness of it i know she said much more mildly youre feeling about me the way im feeling about you like we have something special but honestly we dont we had aa frisson like a lightning bolt or something that shocked us and made us think we were special only you know what happens after lightning hits you run in case it hits again you dont want to be a part of my life jake and i cant think i could possibly be part of yours so lets just get over it there was a long silence while anger dissipated while sense prevailed if thats what you want he said at last its not what i want she thought but what did she want she wanted him to sweep her into his arms and carry her off into some magical happy ever afteronly he didnt even have a yard for a dog where was the happy ever after in that we need to say goodbye she said struggling with her dignity and jake looked down into her eyes for a long long moment and then finally he nodded we do her anger was completely gone now this was jake the man shed loved last night the man she could still love the man she might even learn to trust anger was gone but sadness took its place regret that a different time a different place could have worked goodbye he said softly and she thought i will not cry i will not but then he smiled down at her and suddenly she didnt want to cry she tilted her chin and met his gaze square on this wasnt about loss this wasnt about grief it couldnt be jake had been a watershed a magical romantic way to start her new life hed been her knight in shining armour she thought mistily and while the thought remained she stood on tiptoes and kissed him lightly this time and gently my lancelot lancelot he sounded confused you were my white knight right when i needed you most a white knight he said sounding revolted and she grinned only for two days she said while i played damsel in distress only now im not so thank you jake off you go thenback to new york to your medicine i wonder if therere more damsels in distress in manhattan i suspect most women where i come from know how to rescue themselves she didnt like that it sounded as though she needed to get a bit of spine she straightened and she pulled her hands away and she put as much spine in her voice as she could ill remember you for ever she said firmly and surely im sure i could have rescued myself but it was much more fun being rescued by you thank you very much dr hunter im sorry i cant follow you to manhattan im sorry i couldnt buy bitsy as well as itsy and im sorry you dont have a yard meanwhile we need to move on we both have our careers to get back to and somehow she smiledand he mustnt know just how hard that smile wasand she climbed into the car and started the engine goodbye tori jake said but her car was already moving he felt sick he stood in the car park of his fathers lodge and watched until he could no longer see her car hed let her go he had to hed asked her to come with him and shed refused what did she expect that he stay here he thought back to the little scene back at shoebox mansions to her impromptu clinic people needing her people expecting her to help at any time he compartmentalised his life hed go nuts if he accepted that kind of need but then he turned and glenda was on the verandah watching him watch tori leave oh my dear she said and he thought she understands how could she understand she didnt know him shed known his father community no he thought savagely what had his mother said it was insidious it sucked you in his life was in manhattan and he had no place here dinners ready glenda said but her message was much deeper you go in he told her were waiting for you itd be a long wait he thought he had limits he was not his fathers son were waiting glenda said again gently and he gave up and walked inside with her he could do dinner he just couldnt do the rest of his life chapter eight she bought a sewing machine and hemmed curtains yes this home was temporary yes shed eventually think about rebuilding up on the ridge or selling and finding something else permanent but right now that decision still seemed too hard sewing was therapeutic trying to keep trailing drapes from itsy so was taking a complete break from injured wildlife so was letting herself think about jake he was just a memory she told herself a gorgeous guy whod helped her move on hed been her fiveminute date whod turned into her twoday stand but the thought of him still made her smile she should do something about getting a job she thought as the days wore on she shouldnt settle here and let herself dwell on jake but she wasnt dwelling or not exactly she was simply savouring what had happened why she felt different this morning shed sewn for a whole hour enough she wouldnt mind a small nap this must be the lessening of pressure she thought as she and itsy and rusty headed for bed it was another reason she wasnt accepting a job right now she was too tired we match she told they dogs they got up and bounced into frenetic activity for an hour or so itsy wore rusty out wore herself out and then both exhausted they slept rusty loved it he loved itsy and tori loved watching them but she was as exhausted as they were were like litter mates she told them letting them sneak up to her end of the bed and she slept dreaming of jake he should have forgotten her by now or at least he shouldnt be thinking of her as often as he was he needed more challenging cases he decided his patients were all too healthy he worked steadily through a surgery list that he purposely left even longer than usual he administered anaesthetic he monitored his patients like a hawkalmost hoping for a challengeand they stayed nicely stable and he didnt have to do anything and then his thoughts drifted to tori he should ring her and find out how she was doing or not hed rung rob to find out how the new direction of the lodge was going hed spoken to glenda who told him how well doreen was and that she was back at the lodge already that she was without pain and that she was getting better every day glenda herself was also better she was starting to be able to grip with her hand her life was so much better without pain her cat was settling in there were two more guests at the lodge now one with a cat and one with two chihuahuas and when finally he got to talk to rob and casually enquired about tori rob said bluntly he hadnt seen her and his blonde had given him the flick so he was over women for the moment glenda was a bit more forthcoming but not much no dear we havent seen her either wasnt she taking a job down in the valley doreen and i intend to find out where so when pickles needs his shots we can see her again but pickless shots arent due for another three months great he was dependent for news on pickless shots and he didnt have her phone number he wouldnt ring it even if he did he decided itd mean itd mean nothing it was what friends and colleagues did itd make sense to ring and ask her how itsy and rusty were doing whether shed found a job where her life was going he wanted to he didnt hed asked her to come to manhattan with him that request had changed things her anger had changed things hed messed up their friendship so he worked and he tried not to think about her he was currently on his fourth case for the day the patient under his hands was an obese diabetic all the signs said his triple bypass should be a nightmare but every one of his vital signs was great every monitor showed normal the surgical team was chatting between themselves but they let him be they knew jake was normally silent he had the reputation of being aloof that was the way he liked itwasnt it onlyit meant there was time to think and right now thinking was the one thing jake didnt know how to handle she wasnt quite sure when she started thinking it but when she did she couldnt get it out of her head it started with a vague sense of uneasea wondering about the sleepiness why was she so tired and then she thought and then she tried not to think only she couldnt it was only that she was thinking about jake too much she told herself but it had her trying to remember her files had been burned along with everything else the important dates were gone and her memory had holes in it many of the people from the ridge were suffering like this she knew trauma had left gaps in their collective pasts posttraumatic stress disorder but giving a name to what was happening wasnt helping not when something else might be happening or might have happened she could phone susie she thought only thatd give voice to her fears susie when did i have my contraceptive implant put in am i overdue for renewal she looked up the brand of her implant on the webcautiouslyand found what she didnt want to read effective pregnancy prevention for three years after that marked decreasing efficacy replacement must be undertaken within the threeyear window decreasing efficacy surely she cant have been due to change surely she couldnt be that dumb could she she wasnt ringing susie she decided the problem with having a friend as her doctor was that her doctor was also her friend shed never be allowed to get away with a simple query like when waswhen am i due to change so wait she woke three weeks after jake had left and nothing had happenedagain she showered and dressed and she felt too nauseous to face breakfast she took rusty and itsy for a walk into town she came home and she felt like a sleep again only first shed just check out the package shed brought from the local pharmacy she looked a thin blue line she stared at it for maybe ten minutes it didnt change she tried the second packet another blue line shock held her motionless strangely though she wasnt devastated she couldnt be even though she was stunned there was a tiny part of her that admittedjoy dumb or what but there it was maybe subconsciously shed been expecting it the lethargy that had enveloped her for the past few weeks almost seemed to have prepared her she went out onto the front porch of her shoebox and stared at the distant hills she was pregnant she was twentynine she had a great careerslightly stalled at the moment but ready to resume any time she wanted she had heaps of insurance money she could have a baby she was having a baby like micki her sisters face was suddenly before her laughing joyful tori feel hes kicking my babys kicking her hand went to her tummy and pressed my baby and with the thought came a surge of joy so great it threatened to make her head explode were having a baby she told the dogs trying the words out to see how they sounded after so much destruction life she was carrying jakes baby im going to have to tell him she told the dogs to not tell him was unthinkable would he be angry she deserved his anger shed promised him she was safe its early days though she was talking out loud thinking out loud something could happen no both hands were on her tummy now as if somehow she could protect it nothing would happen to this baby so tell him she whispered phone him tonight she couldnt she wasnt brave enough hed think shed lied to him hed think i have to explain she whispered and then the phone rang doc nicholls we heard you were at a bit of a loose end how do you feel about a flying trip to the states chapter nine the last case had been complex and hed welcomed it finally here was medicine that held his full attention jeff holden was someone hed worked with before jeff had needed surgery as a child and had recurring adhesions jake had recognised him as hed come in jeff had been allocated to one of his more junior anaesthetists but almost to his surprise hed found himself changing the list taking time to talk to him before he put him under do you watch baseball no do you watch football then hed asked to his surprise jeff did and so did the nurse assisting and instead of a tense few moments before theatre thered been a heated discussion about jeffs teamand while he worked he figured he ought to learn more about a sport he only took a fleeting interest in now the operation was oversuccessfully he thought though with adhesions you could never be sureand he thought maybe he could hang around until jeff was properly awake this surgeon was known as being curt jake had watched the operation he knew the outcome and maybe he could answer questions thanks to tori he was changing he decided as he reversed the anaesthetic and headed out into the recovery area and as if the thought had conjured hertori was there for a moment he thought he was dreaming he wasnt she was in full surgical garbshe must to be allowed into this area she had green gown green cap green bootees green eyes tori she was chatting to a patient at the end of the recovery queuea woman wideawake and ready for an orderly to take her back to the ward both of them were smiling she looked up and saw him and she stopped smiling she said something to the woman in the bed and she turned to face him hi she said i believe you owe me three and a half minutes dr hunter im here to collect shock held him immobile for all of three seconds now though he was across the room before he knew it and he meant to take her hands or he thought he meant to take her hands but instead she was folded against him in a hold that felt good felt right felt wonderful her surgical cap was under his chin he wanted to feel her curls but they were in a hospital ward and she was gowned almost a professional and it seemed every one of his colleagues had suddenly found an excuse to be here how long had she been here had his colleagues known why hadnt someone told him she wouldnt let us brad the oldest of the orderlies answered his question before he asked she came to reception a couple of hours ago looking for you marie gowned her and brought her in here i was just as happy in the waiting room tori said tugging away so she was at arms length and grinning happily up at him with that smile that had knocked him sideways a month ago and was still knocking him sideways now but marie asked me where i was from and we got talking and next thing i was in here its been lovely watching everyone wake up procedure over shes been talking to the holloways brad said his gaze on tori openly speculative shes calmed them right down the holloways jodi holloway was seventeen with a diagnosis of kidney cancer the parents had been close to hysterics since the diagnosis but the surgery performed by centrals most skilled urologist had gone well you know our jim brad said ruefully still seeming to sense what he was thinking if the great man says one more word than he must itll kill him he told the holloways thered been a complete excision and the recurrence rate was on the outer edge of the normal curve and then he went off to find his dinner only of course we had jodie looking like death after anaesthesia and mr holloway staring after jim like hed never heard a word and mrs holloway threatening to have hysterics and heres your tori moving in like shes our own personal counsellor only better saying no its fantastic news and drawing them a normal curve and explaining probability and saying wow if jodis outside normal limits for recurrence then theres only this tiny chance itll come back its the best news and by the time jodie woke up she had both parents smiling so if you dont keep her we will brad said grinning and jake realised everyone was grinningpractically the whole ward what was she doing here two and a half minutes now she said softly for only them to hear we need to talk im almost finished so you should be brad said darkly you started at six this morning and its almost midnight take him home he told tori and hes not supposed to be on call tomorrow so you can keep him til monday i wont keep him tori said sounding suddenly strained i have a hotel she said to jake i dont want to intrude youre not intruding jake said feeling more and more as though his world had just lit up again he didnt know why she was here but he was pleased to see her on all sorts of levels give me a minute to finish up here and well go find somewhere to eat at this hour she said doubtfully will anywhere be open hey this isnt combadeen he said grinning i dont know why youve come but welcome to manhattan she felt as if she was here under false pretences he was acting as though he was really pleased to see her she should just blurt it out now she thought but she had to wait until hed spoken to the family of the guy hed just been working on and hed checked his patient was fully awake and could take in what he was saying so she watched and waited calm on the outside she was anything but calm on the inside but finally he was finished he filled in his paperwork they both got rid of their gowns and at last he was ushering her out through the hospital entrance hed taken her arm as if he was genuinely pleased to see heras though she was a favourite friend dropping in unexpectedly you look great he said and she smiled but absently shed put all sorts of effort into her appearance but now she was too nervous to think about it how to tell him why are you here he asked and at least that was easy after the wildfires we have lots of animals that cant go back to the wild zoos are offering them homes i was asked if id come with a consignment of two koalas and four wombats to manhattan close enough close enough to drop in for a visit he said and tugged her closer so where are the dogs at the lodge robs nursing a broken heart hes a great puppy sitter but jakei needed to talk to you i was trying to phone you but then they asked me to come with the animals theres something they were in the crowded entrance to emergency people were bustling past them intent urgent an ambulance was pulling up people were spilling out life was happening all around them but toris life was centred right here on this moment and it could wait no longer im pregnant she said loud enough for a guy pushing a wheelchair towards the entrance to grin and say lovely news dear come back in a few months and see how smooth i can push a gurney tori flushed from the toes up jake stopped they both stopped she knew what hed say she braced waiting no she thought wildly she didnt know what hed say for there were two alternatives he could say you told me you were safe or he could say whose is it or how do i know its mine shed been trying to figure out answers to both trying to force herself not to react it was she whod made the mistake he was allowed to be angry but now the silence was stretching out and she thought which which hey its okay he said finally strongly catching her hands in his tori dont look like that we can cope with this but you will have to move here she blinked this was so much what she hadnt expected simple acceptance you will have to move here she could ignore that she thought that was an aside what mattered most was that he knew shed told him i thought i was safe she started so did i i guess we were both wrong no but i told you i thought and i accepted your assurance because i wanted youhe said and his hands were firm and sure imparting strength and reassurance tori i know you well enough to accept youd never lie about something so important but hey were both medical we both know the only true contraceptive is a brick wall so where do we go from here i dont know she managed shocked almost beyond speech she pulled away a little and stared up at him searching for anger she saw shock she thought but no anger at all not even revulsion just a man taking in important news and trying to deal with it as best he could a man concerned for her thank you she whispered awed for making you pregnant his mouth quirked at the corners and she thought hes laughing the concept of laughter right now was so ludicrous it wasludicrous maybe she wouldnt mind a bit more emotion she thought was she reaching for the stars to want joy i meant thank you for not yelling she said thinking it wasnt enough why would i yell because i made a mistake andand for not asking me who the father is there was a pause at that i have too great a respect for selfpreservation for thathe said finally grave again i dont want to be kicked into the middle of next week i dont think i could kick you that far youd be entitled to come to dinner its close they didnt talk again until he ushered her into a latenight diner where a guy called louis greeted him by name and ushered them into an alcove he obviously used a lot burger and fries for me jake said louis does the best would you like some too no dry toast jake tried sympathetically and tori screwed up her nose again and so did louis his eyes alight with interest how about hot cakes with blueberries louis said encouragingly a nice short stack guaranteed not to overwhelm a lady and maybe a glass of wine maybe hotcakes and tea tori said gratefully and louis beamed and disappeared and tori was left with jake and his nice sensible reaction shed sweated over this moment for three weeks now tried to figure what to say now it had been said shed done what shed come to do she didnt even need to stop and have hotcakes she thought suddenly she could go home only she wasnt going home not now not yet she was sitting in a latenight diner with jake about to have hotcakes while he assimilated fatherhood into his life plan sensibly anger was rising again unreasonable maybe she wanted joy how he ventured at last i had a contraceptive implant shed rehearsed this question they last for three years only then my life fell apart and i forgot it was due for replacement the nightthe night we made love he said gently and she stared at her hands and nodded made love she repeated softly it was love wasnt it of a sort all i could think that night was that i neededi wantedyou and i thought yes im protected even afterwards i didnt worry only then when i tried to figure it out all my records were burned in the fire as were dr susies so the letters that were supposed to go out reminding people of routine stuff were never sent so there you are comedy of errors resulting in one baby our baby if you want a say youre not considering termination no why mickis baby died theres been enough death i want this baby louis arrived then with their meals the normally jovial host had sussed them out by now he left with only a sideways speculative glance at jake so you came to manhattan just to tell me jake said i dont want anything from you if thats what you mean she concentrated on her hotcakes and left him to his thoughts there were a million sensations running through him right nowshock disbelief that this could be happening overwhelming responsibilityyeah and a healthy dose of fear too but the one that suddenly hit the top was anger youll take my help he snapped before he could control the anger behind his words its my call too tori you have my baby then im in the equation like it or not youll stay here her face stilled she met his gaze steadily but he thought he saw a flash of fear behind her eyes what had she expected what was she expecting no she said you know where my home is and its not here your homes burned your home could be anywhere in your dreams eat your dinner tori he said forcing his tone to gentle and almost to his surprise she did she nodded and addressed herself again to her hotcakes they seemed to agree with her his appetite had deserted him but he ate his burger on automatic pilot while tori made her way through louiss truly excellent hotcakes she didnt speak she drank her tea cradling her cup as though she needed the comfort of its warmth shed done some serious shopping he thought watching her she looked great in tightfitting jeans high boots a tiny white coat then he realised she wouldnt be able to wear those jeans for much longer she was carrying his child she was alone and she was pregnant she had to staybut he couldnt force her i didnt mean to scare you he said and she flashed him a look of mistrust this is new territory for both of us she murmured scary territory people do it all the time not me not us then she shrugged look this has been a big shock to throw at you its after midnight you must be exhausted i know i am im staying tomorrow so if you want to talk about it again youre staying tomorrow i have a flight booked the day after i thought id take two days after the delivery one to tell you and one to let you come to terms with it and yell she was only half joking shed expected anger there was anger he thought but the anger wasnt at her it was at himself hed met her when she was at her most vulnerable why had he ever touched her we cant undo it she said evenly and steadily seemingly forcing herself to be calm im sorry to give you this responsibility you dont want im not sorry for me though so dont you be sorry for me either im a big girl and i can cope with this in fact i intend to love this baby i suspect all combadeen will love it she rose can i catch a cab back at the hospital where are you staying she told him and he frowned its saturday night that whole district parties theres no way youll sleep it looked fine when did you arrive four i came to the hospital almost straightaway and i made you wait he was trying to get jumbled thoughts into order but it was like herding ants all he could see was toris pale face and all he could register was that this woman was carrying his child tell you what he said noting her toobig eyes the effort bravado was costing her knowing half of her wanted to run my apartments got a great settee in the living room theres more than enough sleeping space for two i bought the place knowing i needed to sleep any time so quiets where its at i dont want to stay with you you can trust me tori he said gently but inexorably dont you she stared at him for a long moment a moment that stretched on into something far beyond trust for a night shared it stretched into something that was important for their future shared parenting and something more he thought but that was suddenly somewhere he didnt want to go not yet not ever lets get a cab he said focusing on practicalities because practicalities were all he could bear to think about ill take you to your hotel if im exaggeratingif you think you can sleep therethen ill leave you and well meet in the morning but if what i say is true will you trust me enough to bring your gear back to my apartment separate rooms tori nothing you dont want i promise and youll let me leave i dont have a choice no she said heavily you dont he was right her hotel was appalling they went back to his apartment jake slept on the settee tori slept in his room ill spend the night pacing he told her when she objected so i might as well pace on the balcony once upon a time a man could go through a couple of packets of smokes in this situation now its traffic fumes or nothing she was so tired she hardly smiled so he made up the settee for himself and tori lay in jakes bed and thought she was so tired she should sleep but sleep was a long time coming the bed was really comfortable and really big big enough to entertain thered have been women of course there must have been women but none of them had stayed very long she thought this place was almost clinically austere her little relocatable home had been austere and beige this place was austere and grey maybe it was chic but she hated it just the same as shed hated the drabness of her relocatable it was cool and grey and impersonal she missed her dogs the dogs were fine theyd hardly miss her but there was no onenothingto hug there was silence from the sitting room maybe jake wasnt serious about pacing maybe hed said that to make her think he was taking her news seriouslythat he thought it was a big deal hed accepted it so smoothly maybe it had even happened before that was unthinkable but why should she lie here and want this baby to be as new and as wonderful an experience for jake as it was for her it couldnt be she thought she and her baby would be in australia jake would be here shed organise videos not of the birth though she thought hastily there was no way she was going there shed do that on her own by herself there was a bleak thought jet lag was insidious she decided exhaustion was making her depressed or maybe it was this appalling apartment jake had prints on the wallcharcoal sketches of something avant garde horrible in the moonlight she couldnt see detail she could only see the vague outline of garish figures thinking on it wasnt even moonlight it was the glare of a million buildings lit at night with a million neon signs how could she be homesick when shed been away for less than a week no matter she was she wanted the dogs she wanted to hear the birds in the trees outside her window she wanted for jake to be not right through that door and for that door not to be closed go to sleep she told herself firmly desperately now pigs might fly jake had learned from years of being on call to hit the pillow and summon sleep selfpreservation had taught him the knack it had never failed himuntil now hed never had tori sleeping right through the wall until now hed never been told hed be a father until now he wanted he didnt know what he wanted he wanted tori if you made a woman pregnant you married her it was an old dictumdid it still apply shed already refused him he didnt know the first thing about relationships where to start by taking tomorrow off yeah okay he thought wryly good one it was his rostered day off anyway very magnanimous he could do a quick checkin at the hospital before she woke and then hed show her new york but monday he had a list longer than his arm and it was too late to delegate shed be on her own then he could probably cut it a bit get home at a reasonable hour to find the little wife waiting for him with supper served and his slippers warmed tori was right it was a ludicrous concept only it had to be thought of she had to stay why he had a sudden vision of himself aged about seven summer holidays his mother off with one of her lovers he in his grandparents mausoleum of a house on long island lonely as hell tori was having his baby and his kid wasnt going to be lonely if he was going to be a father he wanted his kid here whether tori agreed or not his kid hed never thought of being a father hed had such a solitary upbringing hed simply expected more of the same hed reacted calmly enough to toris news or more hed been so stunned that all he could feel was concern for tori to think past that to fatherhood itself hed have a daughter a son the idea was so overwhelming he couldnt take it in he let it swirl for a while trying to figure things out but no matter how he looked at it one thing stood out this child would not have his upbringing his mother telling lies about his father his parents continents apart she had to stay hed marry the mother of his child she slept until ten and when she woke jake was standing over her lean and long and gorgeous wearing a sleek business suit a crisp white shirt and a crimson tie what the she glanced from him to the clockand yelped he grinned and set toast on the bedside table then sat on the side of the bed it was such a familiar thing to do that she practically yelped again feel up to breakfast he said and smiled and she thought this man is the father of my child that was such a seriously sexy seriously wonderful thing to think that her toes practically curled but what was with the suit youre dressed up why she managed ive been into the hospital so i could clear the rest of the day i thought you had today off i dont do off days but im free now moving on you dont look like you have morning sickness he said and she hauled her thoughts back to earth or almost back to earth im only sick if i move fast then dont move fast i wont he leaned forwards and took the pillows from the spare side of the bed then wedged them behind her and there it was again that blast of caring and of maleness and ofwant down girl she told herself fiercely you have twentyfour hours left of this man theres no use lusting after somethingsomeoneyou cant have but she was definitely lusting he was handing over tea and she had to take it even though there was suddenly a really big part of her that wanted to fling the tea onto his coolgrey carpet grab him and haul him back onto his own pillows he was the father of her baby so have you ever been to new york he asked and she blinked and had a couple of sips of tea and mustered her hormones into some sort of corral but the boundaries she put around them looked frail very frail indeed no she managed and her voice came out a squeak and she had to try again so where have you been he handed over toast her fingers brushed his and she practically yelped all over again she had to get herself under control um sydney she ventured is that the furthest he demanded astounded yeah she said defensive and then because she didnt want him to think she hadnt travelled because she was a wimp she told him the rest mum died when micki and i were small dad had the veterinary practice up and we helped him after school every holiday i thought i might travel for a bit after vet school but by the time i finished dad had parkinsons mickis marriage was in trouble and she was in perth she couldnt help if i hadnt stayed dad would have had to sell up and itd have broken his heart she paused and then added quietly though if he sold up maybe hed still be alive hey tori dont he smiled coaxing her to let it go you cant beat yourself up over decisions like that and youre here now he said your first overseas experience you need to stay for more than a day no the thought terrified her not necessarily with me id mess with your life she said and glanced at the spare side of the bed theres no one i didnt mean that okay you didnt mean that but im telling you anyway if you want to sleep in my bed for the next month no no no she said and she sounded desperate but there wasnt anything she could do about it i need to get up now if you need to sleep then sleep if ive only got one day in new york im not sleeping you should take more im housetraining itsy she said i cant take more tori i havent come to interfere with your life ive just come to tell you and then to go i cant see that i can let you go you dont have a choice she said trying hard to sound firm and sure and confident was he planning on locking her up until this baby was born ha shed thrown him she thought shed had a month to get used to the idea of a baby hed had less than a day so ill get up and you can point me to the statue of liberty she said moving right on is that what you want to see and the empire state building and central park and tiffanys tiffanys he said blankly my very favourite movie in the whole world dont you just love audrey hepburn like life itself he said promptly and she giggled and ate a bit of toast and thought this could be okay shed do the tourist thing maybe theyd meet for dinner tonight theyd discuss practicalities like just how much access he wanted and how they were going to figure it out and then shed head back to australia and get on with it ill go put on my walking shoes he said you dont have to come with me she said startled im guessing youll already have seen the statue of liberty i might have he agreed but shes worth a second look and to be honest ive never once been inside tiffanys chapter ten they did the empire state building they had to queue for two hours but at the top she gasped and decreed the view was worth every minute she produced a camera and took the shots every tourist took but she insisted on having him front and centre this is your town she said im visiting jakes manhattan this is jake with the statue of liberty in the background very nice a tourist offered to take a shot of them together and she beamed thatll be good for later she decreed handing over her camera later he held her tightly as the german gentleman lined up the shotbecause holding her close seemed the right thing to do also it was a good excuse to keep her near him he hadnt forgotten how good she felt his body was reminding him every time she came within touching distance he could hardly understand her smile he thought she must be jetlagged she was facing an uncertain future alone and here she was cheerfully soaking up every minute of her twoday visit she was gorgeous but then this will be a shot of mummy and daddy for our babys first album she told him as he held herand desire gave way to something else entirely a range of emotions he couldnt begin to understand but he kept her still and when he saw the resulting picture he thought no one would know by his fixed smile that he felt as if hed been punched but he did feel as though hed been punched no matter how many traffic fumes hed inhaled last night he didnt have his head round this this lovely vibrant woman was carrying his baby and she was only here until tomorrow would he go to australia for the birth he must he thought as tori went back to snapping views and what if something happened early a miscarriage a problem later in the pregnancy what sort of antenatal care would she get in combadeen how could he let her go back to australia but how could he not he had no hold on her theyd had what a twoday relationship there was no way a future could be based on that but still still he didnt know what to think finally viewed out tori headed to the elevators a big guy overweight and overbearing barged into the elevator beside tori and pushed her backwards he saw toris hand instinctively move to protect a bump that wasnt there yet and he wanted to move his body in between them and thump the guy into the bargain he wanted to say thats my kid in there watch it more he wanted to say thats my woman and ill thump anyone who touches her only of course he didnt he was civilised and careful he was a senior medico with a responsible job he was someone who taught nonaggressive solutions to his staff when patients were violent more he was a guy who walked alone but he still wanted to punch the guys lights out his phone rang while he was thinking of it he answered it as he always did dr hunter speaking jancey ian her intrathecal catheters packed up he paused as the rest of the elevator streamed out around them swearing under his breath jancey was a tiny africanamerican woman in her midseventies and she had advanced bone metastases hed inserted morphine and local anaesthetic via an intrathecal catheter to stop pain that had been almost unbearable but not only did jancey have crumbling vertebrae from the cancer she also had severe arthritis it had taken skill experience and luck to get the drugs flowing to just the right spot itd be a miracle if any of the junior doctors on duty could get the catheter back in level of pain he asked knowing already what the answer would be bad mardi fry was the senior nurse on the ward if she said bad it must be hellish i cant you can tori was suddenly in front of him facing him down shed only heard his side of the conversation but obviously shed guessed the rest im an unexpected and uninvited guest and im a very happy tourist dont you dare leave someone in pain because of me ill take a cab to central park meet me there if you can tori strawberry fields at two oclock she said heading to the cab rank already and calling back over her shoulder thats the bit i most want to see in central park or back at your apartment at six and she was gone before he could even argue she was asleep when he found her right where shed said shed be in central park snoozing on a bench in the weak autumn sunlight with a bag of uneaten bagels on her knee he touched her on the shoulder and she opened her eyes and smiled at him he thought back to the number of dates hed had to interrupt for medical necessity thered always been reproof but tori was smiling at him as if this was a whole new date hey its only two oclock she said well done all fixed piece of cake he said catheter went in like a dream in fact it had been a nightmare but it was okay now jancey was out of pain and asleep she searched his face and he thought she saw the truth but she said nothing no recriminations no questions a woman in a million so what were you dreaming of he asked names names baby names she said as if he was a little bit thick for some reason now im in strawberry fields im thinking jude but im also thinking maybe elizabeth for my mother you dont sound sure and why would i be sure this babys the size of a peanut and do you know how many books there are on childrens names if you help me well barely get through them do you want me to help there was a moments silence and then carefully as if she was bestowing a huge honour on him she broke her bagel in half share she said thats why im here though i have to say if your mother was gertie its not going to happen its not but i dont think i want anyone called after my mother anyway thats right she was a horror tori said cheerfully bestowing his parentage the attention it deserved which in itself was strangely healing that makes life easier can we go to tiffanys now so they went to tiffanys a place jake had never been to yes it was famous but it was definitely a girl place he felt like waiting outside only then he couldnt watch tori enjoy herself which was growing more and more unthinkable so in he went the doorman welcomed them and the unobtrusive staff watched with indulgent eyes of all the women in here tori stood out she was a woman with no rings on her fingers nothing no jewellery at all but tori wasnt looking at anything she might buy she was intent on the fantasy oh wow she breathed as she reached a display case of tiaras that must be worth a kings ransom or several kings ransoms he thought as he checked out the prices arent they wonderful tori said giggling what if you were wearing it and it fell off in the mud i dont think theres any mud where any of these are going no she said suddenly disapproving theyll be worn once a year maybe twice tops and the rest of the time theyll be stuck in a safe there theyll just sit until something like the fire happens and what a waste she had a different perspective he thought as he watched her move from jewel to jewel she was loving looking at these beautiful things but there was no wistfulness in her eyes at all shed lost everything and yet she wanted nothing look at this she breathed and he looked more closely and was as stunned as she was it was the most amazing ring hed ever seen its centre was a diamond perfectly cut as a heart and so large it took his breath away every facet glistened and sparkled on the outer edge of the heart were five rubies set into white gold to glitter at each extremity surrounding them was a ring of smaller diamonds though thinking on they were only small in comparison to the central stone the ring was ostentatious and it was ridiculous and itd take more muscle than most women had in their ring finger to wear it without complaintbut for all that it was quite extraordinarily lovely and it didnt even have a price tag oh wow tori breathed what a knuckle duster she giggled againand then she looked sideways at it you know its like something absolutely exquisite but blown up she said slowly a little version would be just perfect but this its wonderful but its crazy youd never want something like this are you kidding again came that infectious chuckle whats not to want mind id have to find me a sheikh and sheikhs are in small supply where i come from do you have any jewellery at all he asked but almost as the words left his mouth he knew he shouldnt have asked shed been working when the fire came through nothing had been saved toby the erstwhile fiancé had a lot to answer for again jake found himself dealing with anger but the fire was history tori had moved on and so should he and luckily tori hadnt heard the question her attention was caught yet again oh she was peering into a different display section now where opulence had given way to a far more demure kind of beauty she seemed totally captivated not amused this time but rather stunned she was gazing at a celtic love knot wrought in gold with silver threads woven through compared to the jewellery theyd just looked at this was tiny but it was no less beautiful slivers of diamond were scattered through the knot like stones set into rope it looked rough almost as though it had been hewn from the earth already formed it hung on a simple silver chain and jake looked at it and then looked at tori and her eyes were shining with unshed tears its like my mothers she whispered its not the same but its so close she wore it always and it was burned she managed a watery smile i need to buy it she said simply and an assistant was sliding it out of the display case before she finished speaking tori reached to touch it with hands that trembled she ran her fingers across its intricate surface almost reverently ill take it she said and she hadnt even looked at the price tori she was hardly aware of him this chain had been a part of her past that was somehow being restored jake thought as he watched her face and he was feeling just a bit emotional himself and he knew what he wanted to do hed been thinking it ever since hed walked into the place and now was the right time will you let me he asked and he laid his hand over hers it would be my honour and my pleasureand my pride as wellto buy this for you she turned puzzled why youre the mother of my baby he said simply and surely in truth there were many emotions at play here and the fact that tori was pregnant was only a tiny part of the whole but it was all he could understand right now i need to do something to mark this he said softly though the assistant had melted discreetly away its a piece of jewellery that reminds you of whats lost can it also be something to mark whats to come she looked up at him then through a mist of tears she gave a wavering smileand she sniffed oh for heavens sake he was feeling teary himself whoa that wasnt going to happen what was this woman doing to him he got practical by handing over a handkerchief distracted she gazed down at it in disbelief a handkerchief whats wrong with a handkerchief guys do this in romance novels she said faintly not in real life what sort of modern male carries handkerchiefs men who get their laundry done but she wasnt listening she was buying time he thought fighting to get her emotions in order she turned her back on him and blew her nose and when she turned back she had her face straightor almost her eyes were still shimmering how had he ever thought she was plain he wondered she was quite extraordinarily beautiful he wanted her he wanted her so badly but i cani can afford it she said breathlessly easily theres no need for you to pay i know that but stillwill you grant me the honour of buying it for you there you go again she said darkly romance novels have a lot to answer for if i didnt know you made such a lousy fiveminute dater id suspect youd been taking chivalry lessons no lessons he said put it on he lifted it from the velvet and held it out silently she turned so he could fasten it around her neck he clipped the hook closed and then because the temptation was irresistible he bent and kissed her lightly on the nape of her neck her skin felt smooth and lovely and for an instantfor just an instant he felt her lean into him let herself relax against him trust him jake he wanted to kiss her properly as he needed to kiss her as she deserved to be kissed but her moment of weakness was gone she tugged away apparently to look in the mirror but he knew it was more than that hed felt her body stiffen hed felt her fear bad move he thought very bad move considering what he was thinking the assistant had melted away again in the emotional stuffhow did they know to do thatbut as tori moved to the mirror she materialised again beaming her approval will madam take it madams taking it tori said softly and a slight tremor ran through her a tremor she couldnt disguise madam fell in love with romance novels when she was thirteen years old and she knows when shes hooked does this mean youll let me buy it for you jake asked why yes she said softly yes i believe it does they bought chinese takeaway and took it back to the apartment for dinner because tori was simply too tired to go on jake usually ate at his kitchen bench his dining table was covered in journals halfwritten papers important work in progress he could sort it and stack it neatly he thought but that could take half an hour or he could make tori eat at the kitchen bench but if this was the only night he had to persuade her then he needed to move fast so he cleared the table by the simple expedient of tipping it lengthways it worked a treat hey when was the last time hed seen this table it had cost him a bomb it was a great table or maybe not he conceded thinking on the table was of coolgrey lacquer designed to match the apartments coolgrey walls he remembered toris scathing comments about grey hmm tori was looking at the mess as they ate bemused itll take you days to get that back in order i have days hed have all the time in the world after she went home he thought if she went home how to broach it again he didnt for a while they shared their food they both had sodahed have liked a beer but janceys catheter might mean hed be called out again they listened to music she liked his music that was something the decorator hadnt chosen what times your plane tomorrow he asked late afternoon i figure ill sleep in no more sightseeing i hear sohos good she said but maybe not you need to go to work right he did hed been trying to figure out how not to need to go to work but case lists for monday were always the most complex if he cancelled patients would be sent home you cant let them down tori said softly and he knew she understood he was doing a rapid assessment of cases in his head but it wasnt helping hed seen jack carver in the cardiac ward on friday jack had severe ulceration on his legs so severe amputation was becoming an option he needed shunts to restore blood supply back so they could heal but he had a cardiac condition and diabetic complications as well when jake had done the initial assessmentsomething he usually avoided but he seemed to be doing it more in the weeks since hed met torijacks wife had been holding her husbands hand as though if she let go hed drown please shed said to him jacks all i have make him well the risk of jack losing his legor worsewas increasing every day he waited he couldnt reschedule jake thought grimly no matter what he wanted personally he needed to be there tomorrow and jancey would be watching the door waiting for him he couldnt let jancey down i could have done with some warning of your visit he growled but tori shook her head i suspect youd still be as busy even if you were expecting me and i didnt want to interrupt your life i dont want to interrupt your life soho will just be shops i might go on my own or i might just sleep but either way i can take a cab to the airport i dont need your company but her voice wobbled a little at that and he noticed her fingers crept to the chain at her throat you should stay he said strongly i need to go home i need to start my life as i need to go on why not stay here we already talked about that id like to marry you there was a sharp intake of breath but youve said that before she whispered still touching her chain just because im having your baby it doesnt make it any better i think i love you she gazed across the table at him seemingly bemused seemingly astounded you think i dont know he admitted hell tori i havent done this before done what become involved you sound like its happened against your will well what do you think he said raking his hair i dont have a clue how im feeling but were going to be parents you need to rebuild anyway youve lost everything and finally she reacted with something apart from shock i havent lost everything she retorted and she tilted her chin and met his gaze levelly and calmly okay youve got your dogs he conceded ive got my home a relocatable i have my community the emotion now was suddenly pure unmitigated anger i have my work she said struggling to stay calm you have your work too its important as my works important but i have more i have place my parents lived and worked at combadeen and so do i i know every family rebuilding on the ridge my parents are buried in the combadeen cemetery ive buried my dogs behind our house okay ive been stunned shocked gutted by the fires and their aftermath but im handling it and im moving on to make a home for myself in my place not in some sterile grey designer shoebox on the seventeenth floor of a thirty storey tower block its not a shoebox yes it is she retorted theyre all shoeboxes its whats around them that matters and whats in them here youd be at work all day every day and the shoebox would close in on me you could work parttime we could get somewhere a bit bigger hell tori you need looking after i dont need looking after youre pregnant and i still dont need looking after her anger was building rather than subsiding i have a community who cares i have friends and i have colleagues youve seen me at a point where i was at my lowest where the resources of the whole district were stretched to the limit but dont judge me on that dont judge combadeen by that theres not one person in combadeen whod suggest i live in a grey monument to solitude and go crazy you wouldnt go crazy i would if i lived here she said rising and glowering so would you but you dont live here either you use it to crash or to study or to take a shower no one lives in places like this living jake you dont know what living is and im surely not raising my child teaching him this life is normal she closed her eyes then and she swayed he was on his feet in an instant surging around the table to hold her but her eyes snapped open and she stepped away no she said dont dont dont touch me she whispered i was a fool to come the truth was i wanted to see you as well as needing to tell you about our baby but it was wrong you and me no theres no you and me tori youre alone she whispered and thats the way you want it but if im alone id curl up and die i need people i need dogs i needlife she sighed then and steadied im sorry jake she said getting angry was dumb yelling at you is dumb youre doing the best you can she shook her head as if clearing fog okay heres confession time she said im trying desperately not to fall in love with you you say you might love me well maybe i know that i could love you and you know what that means if i came here then youd risk me clinging he didnt understand why would you cling you have your work im not talking about my work im talking about needing you and you needing me youre fine with the idea of looking after me could you ever admit that you need me i there was deathly silence no she said and she was fighting now for the composure shed lost enough this is dumb talk and we both know it were two mature professionalswe can handle this your work is waiting and my life is waiting so please jake she took a deep breath please jake she said again im exhausted and i need to go to bed thank you for a wonderful day her fingers crept once again to her celtic knot thank you for my chain ill keep it for ever but now another deep breath now im going into your bedroom she said softly steadying and im going to bed alone thats the way it has to be we both know that i guess when i wake up in the morning youll be gone to work so ill get on my plane tomorrow and i wont look back yes youll want to see our baby we can work that out later but we need to do it in a way where i can be normal and civil and the fact that i had the best night of my life with you and im thinking entirely inappropriate thoughts can be forgotten please jake thats what i need so goodnight and before he could guess what she intended she took three swift steps towards him she took his face in her hands and she kissed him fast and hard on the mouth then before he had a chance to respond before he could hold her as he needed to hold her she pushed herself away goodnight jake she said firmly and steadily and goodbye and she was gone into his bedroom closing the door firmly behind her and he knew he couldnt follow it was all very well being angry and virtuous and sure anger and virtue and certainty lasted all the way until the door was shut and then she just felt miserable nothing else just plain bad hed asked her to marry him and shed refused shed hardly had a choice she told herself fighting to drum up anger again what had she hoped for and there was the crux the biggie hope finally she was acknowledging exactly what shed hoped for she loved him shed told herself that one night together was simply a way of moving on but it was so much more and that was regardless of her pregnancy hed said he thought he loved her but he didnt know what it meant love she thought back to jake holding her as theyd buried a little koala named manya she thought of the way hed held glendas hand of the way hed laughed at bitsy she thought of jake in the ward talking through a procedure to the patient he was about to anaesthetise carefully so there could be no misunderstanding she knew hed be wonderful she thought of the way jakes body felt against hers oh enough youre behaving like a moonstruck teenager she scolded herself youve come all this way and hes been lovely hes taken you sightseeing hes given you a beautiful piece of jewellery hes reacted to our baby with honour he even tried to figure out how he could love you what else do you want from the man nothing jake lay on the toohard settee and stared up at his blank ceiling running the conversation over and over in his head love yes hed said it but tori had known he hadnt meant it and she must be right love would be something you learned over months or more probably years a gradual buildup of trust and affection it surely wasnt what he and tori had a oneandahalfminute date followed by one night of passion unbidden the words of his mother crept back into his subconscious i fell in love with your father on one meeting one meeting how ridiculous was that he carted me off to some strange country to a life i had no way of dealing with and look what happened love at first sight dont make me laugh nothing made sense the night was too long the settee was too hard the concept of love and of home was too difficult to get his head around that tori could say she loved him that she could possibly throw her heart where her head should be seemed unreal and if she felt like that then why wouldnt she marry him should he have insisted he love her do the romantichero thing if he did that hed be no better than his father but he no longer believed in his father as the villain he no longer knew what he believed in he was getting into territory that was simply too hard and the hardest thing the hardest thing was that tori was right through that door his woman she wasnt his woman he had no rights she felt like his woman so what are you intending caveman he muttered into the night go and stake your claim youve done enough damage you have a surgical list longer than your arm waiting for you in the morning its not fair on your patients if you dont sleep somehow he managed to switch off and sleep but he couldnt turn off his dreams she woke and she knew hed gone the coolgrey apartment practically echoed shed thoughtmaybe shed hopedthat shed wake when he left and she could say goodbye but it had been almost dawn before shed drifted into troubled sleep her exhausted body had finally demanded what it needed and jakes bedside clock was telling her it was eight oclock she threw back the covers and padded out to the living room cautiously just to see but the sleek leather settee was back being a sleek leather settee the spare bedding was neatly folded ready to be stored back in the bedroom closet there was a note on the bench catheter trouble again travel safe ill be in touch a farewell note how romantic she crumpled it and slid it into the trash the kitchenette was squeaky clean not even a dirty coffee mug to tell her hed breakfasted before hed left she touched the designer kettle it was cold really cold he hadnt even had coffee here if she lived here she wouldnt have her morning coffee here either she decided this place was awful hed come home tonight to this she thought feeling more dismal by the minute as the cool of the apartmentand the lack of jakesoaked into her shed have changed the sheets and put hers in the commercial laundry basket shed seen near the entrance maybe by the time jake got home the laundry would already have been collected cleaned and returned nothing would remain of her visit there should be something stupid or not she wanted there to be something her fingers moved instinctively to her throat to her chain to something she knew shed treasure for ever she loved her chain she loved that jake had given it to her she should have refusedbut how strong could a woman be not strong enough i should leave him something she said gazing helplessly around at the designer chic i cant leave him with grey and then a thought i did it for me she murmured to herself how hard would it be in new york soho maybe id need a cab maybe id need two id also need time so what are you waiting for she demanded of herself jake wanted me to make a home here maybe i can do that only not quite the way he imagined he knew when her plane took off for hed checked the qantas web site in truth he checked it half a dozen times and if he hadnt been pushed to his limit with his surgical list maybe hed have cracked and headed to the airport just to say goodbye he told himself and wondered why he had to tell himself that surely it was obvious but the hands of the clock slipped inexorably around and six oclock was suddenly right there not quite ready to knock off yet said the surgeon he was working with and jake thought how bad did he have it how often had he glanced up at the clock on the operating room wall he didnt have it bad it was only it was only that it was now one minute past six the plane would be taxiing to the runway tori was gone she could see the statue of liberty from the plane lit up and beautiful she sniffed and the man in the seat next to her smiled in sympathy and handed over a tissue thank you she managed and sniffed again and groped in her purse its very nice of you but i have a handkerchief it was one in the morning before jake finally finished he was wrecked emotionally and physically and by the time he reached his apartment his legs didnt want to work any more he worked out in the basement gym most mornings he hadnt this morning one lost workout and his legs were turning to jelly or maybe it was because of one lost tori see thats what you cant think he told himself that kind of thinking does no one any good but he rode the elevator and he thought those kinds of thoughts all the way up how soon could he go to australia what use was going to australia he belonged here here was home home he turned the key in the lock and thought it was no such thing it was grey he was starting to feel ill hed had tori here and hed let her go leaving him with grey he pushed the door wide and it was anything but it was decorated by tori it might not be the same stuff shed bought in melbourne but it was as close as made no difference back in australia shed transformed a beige relocatable home into a riot of colour and life here it wasa riot colours colours and more colours cushions lamps throws vases prints weird and wonderful statues a persian carpet almost completely covering the cool grey tiles an imitation log fire it was too much it waswonderful he found himself smiling moving through the room fingering things that were tactile as well as lovely it was warm inviting and wonderful his table had been moved against the wall it was covered with a rich tapestry and a vast mirror set behind it so it reflected the warmth of the lamps there was an antique desk against the far wall the books hed swept onto the floor last night were neatly stacked ready to be used again and then a faint noise had him moving to the bedroom he opened the door and a small brown cat stalked out looking suspicious and curious and eager all at once a halfgrown cat fawn with a tip of white on its tail it was followed by another brown cat even smaller but this one had no tip burmese he wasnt sure of his cats they looked like siamese cats he thought only different the first one sniffed his shoes then carefully wound its way round and round his ankles the second one sat and watched acting superior cats there was a note on his bedon top of the riot of an amazing patchwork quilt i looked for another celtic love knot but couldnt find one these are my alternative meet ferdy and freddy theyre from the pet store on the note stuck on their litter tray i paid double their asking price on condition that if you really dont want them theyll take them back but id recommend keeping them they keep each other company all day and when you get homewell they might just mean you do come home he found himself grinning ferdy and freddy ferdyor was it freddyyowled his brother joined in then both of them set their tails high and stalked over to the fridge what was he supposed to do with cats bemused he opened the fridge and found what he was supposed to do with cats tori had thought of everything youll have to go back he told them as he fed them but he couldnt do it tonight when would he find time to take them back tomorrow he had work to do before he went to bed there was a case he needed to look up for the next day he sat down at his new desk and opened a textbook ferdy was on his knee in seconds followed by freddy how was a man supposed to work when he waswhen he was home where was tori right now somewhere around hawaii not that far too far this place was wonderful it was missing something i dont think i can he told the cats fondling two ears fondling four ears impossible my work is here yes but shes just given me two more complications i can handle complications he couldnt though he thought or not immediately itd take some thought love takes time he told the cats months maybe years years didnt bear thinking of he closed his eyes this was crazy he was a man who walked alone ferdy dug his claws into his thigh and gently kneaded i dont do pets he said through gritted teeth i dont dolove he had this all the wrong way round hed go to sleep and hed wake up in the morning being sensible maybe or maybe not chapter eleven the operation on harley had been long and perilous the big schnauzer was only seven years old but the liver abscess hed developed was as unexpected as it was lethal and the only option if he was to survive was to remove part of the liver at least tori was no longer working by herself her new workplace had specialist canine surgeons shed been able to call for help and then work as the assistant of a far more experienced surgeon all the same she was exhausted she should be feeling perky and full of energy at five months pregnant she told herself but it wasnt happening try as she might she couldnt be perky ever since shed come back from new yorkokay even before that ever since jake left she concededthered been something exhausting her that wasnt pregnancy something was trying to tug her back into the grey fog shed been in after the fire and she wasnt going to be tugged she told herself fiercely as she worked she had great friends a lovely new job caring colleagues shed just saved harley and rusty and itsy were waiting for her back home doreen and glenda cared for the dogs during the day but the dogs knew who their mistress was and when tori arrived they almost turned inside out with joy theyd be expecting her now tori glanced at her watch and winced she still needed to talk to harleys owners and stop off and buy something for tea and then collect the dogsand the tiredness was insidious two more days til the weekend she promised herself two more days until she could spend the whole time at home but the weekend brought more problems most of the population of the relocatable village spent their weekends up on the ridge working on their new homes but for some reason her head still wouldnt let her go there and there was the other thing at the weekend she had time to think of jake the surgeon was closing its as good as we can get he told her you want to go tell harleys mum and dad the good news of course she did she pinned on a bright smile and opened the doorand jake was in the waiting room he was reading a copy of horse hound as though it was totally riveting harleys owners an elderly couple whod been frantic about their dog sprang to their feet jake gave her a tiny smile acknowledging her priorities and retreated again to his horses or hounds hi tori said as much to him as to paul and ida clemens and then somehow forced herself back to professional mode its okay she told them quickly more than okay its good weve taken about twenty percent of the liver but that includes a wide margin of healthy tissue were sure we have it all as long as we can keep his cholesterol under control theres no reason why he shouldnt live happily into a ripe old age the elderly couple stared at her in silence for a long momentand then paul put his hands on his face and sank back into his chair the elderly farmers shoulders shook with silent sobs his wife sat down and hugged him tori produced a box of tissues and paul grabbed about a dozen he needed them all they waited then all of them for paul to recover tori was achingly aware of jake watching from the sidelines but she couldnt hurry this paul and ida had lost their farm in the fires theyd barely survived by holding blankets over their heads as they lay in shallows of their dam harley had been under the blankets with them if they needed time shed give them all the time in the world finally paul had himself under controlor almost he sat while ida held his hand and while tori gently repeated the good news then their questions started she repeated the initial diagnosis hypercholesterolemiamassively elevated cholesterolhad caused the liver abscess schnauzers were genetically prone to it and of course paul and ida had treated harley as a human before the fires and afterwards they could refuse his pleading eyes nothing so harley had eaten cheese and sausages and chocolate and finally his liver had started to disintegrate under the strain so you think you can resist now tori asked them and ida managed a strained smile once upon a time we were firm parents she said we can go back to that cant we paul i guess and we move into our new home next week ida was sounding firmer ready to move on well be able to take harley home to somewhere permanent no chocolate paul said no chocolate ida said and looked speculatively at pauls rotund girth i have the men in my life back and im not risking anything again thank you very much can we see him of course you can our nurse will be taking him through into recovery tori saidand they thanked her and tori was left with jake he put down horse hound hi she managed finally but it didnt come out properly um why are you here youre supposed to say welcome youre very welcome she said and he was could he feel it she wondered just how welcome he was i was hoping for five minutes of your time five minutes all the best dates are five minutes he said you can meet the love of your life in five minutes or as it happens in one and a half minutes if you try hard enough there was enough in that to take her breath away it did take her breath away she wanted to sink onto the seat paul had just vacated and maybe hyperventilate where was a paper bag when she needed one so harley really will be okay he asked giving her time to recover and she thought she could do this she could talk medicine until she got herself coherent maybe it was a beautiful resection of the liver she managed textbook case guy sallers our surgeonhes the best so you didnt do it i dont have the skills you tried antibiotics and closed drainage first he was definitely giving her time we tried everything i know resections lastresort stuff but believe me this was last resort if wed waited any longer we risked rupture hes young and healthy the liver has every chance of regenerating and best of all hes abstained from alcohol so cirrhosis isnt a problem you checked for cirrhosis he said faintly its happened she said recovering enough now to start to smile ida and paul have given him everything elsewhy not a wee drop of sherry with theirs at night youre kidding me ive seen cases of alcoholic poisoning in dogs she told him the stupidity of owners sometimes defies belief jake why are you here and then as he didnt answer straightaway she jumped in for him is there a problem at the lodge theres no problem do you need to sign papers for sale or something rob tells me the farmhouse had been cleaned up and is looking great thats what id like to talk to you about it is it is he said so about that five minutes youve already had it she said but she couldnt get her voice to work properly again she was sounding breathless she was feeling breathless nope he said the fiveminute date has to start at a designated place the first date was in a booth in the combadeen hall our second date has to be somewhere else i have a rental car outside can i take you to my designated date spot your designated date spot she said faintly its not so far i need to collect the dogs i dropped in on glenda and doreen he said and at the look on her face he grinned i had to do something i landed five hours agoi made a beeline for you only to be told you were in surgery and werent expected out until now unlike manhattan central theres a dearth of people to talk to even paul and ida had taken themselves off to stay with their daughter and horse hound circa has a limited appeal so ive heard all about how glendas hand is now behaving beautifully and how well doreen is ive been slobbered on by one vast golden retrieverwhat are you feeding her by the way i thought she was supposed to be a runt oh and ive bought bitsy youve bought bitsy she was suddenly feeling faint i wanted him jake said ive wanted him for months like some other things ive wanted ive been telling myself i was stupid but a man can only do that for so long before he starts believing it and starts to act stupid so ive been to see the breeder and yes she kept him for herself but money talks and i can pick him up as soon as im ready therere just a couple of things i need to sort first he hesitated no theres only one thing one really important thing five minutes tori will you come with me and listen i dont think no dont think he said thinking does your head in ive been thinking and thinking and its doing me no good at all and finallyyou know what i stopped thinking and im letting my heart decide they drove in silence past the lodge through the burnedout state forest and up onto the ridge the year had been kind with above average rainfall and gentle weather and the australian bush had regenerated as only the australian bush can burned trees had new shoots spurting manically out of blackened trunks grasses and ferns had pushed up through the ashes it still looked dreadfully scarred there were places where the heat had been so intense that itd take years to come back but it was no longer grey and rebuilding had begun in earnest every second house site had been cleared of debris and was now a halfbuilt home with the kinder weather many families had brought caravans up to the ridge so they could live close to where they were rebuilding there were birds back as well and as they drove there were wallabies feeding on the roadside as dusk settled tori could almost imagine the fire had never been but it had her life would never be the same if the fire hadnt happenedshe wouldnt have met jake she wouldnt be pregnantand her hand touched her tummy as it did a hundred times a day thank you for sending me the ultrasound pictures jake said gravely and she thought he must have seen the movement selfconsciously she linked her hands onto her knees and stared straight ahead she would not think about why he was here she decided she would not she would not allow herself to hope did you like them she asked i carry mine in my purse i carry mine in my wallet he said and she gasped youre joking my kid he said gravely my wallet he smiled by the way i checked every picture and not one of thems taken from the right angle do we know if we have a daughter or a son we the tiny word was enough to make her breathless all over again she had to fight to make herself speak i didnt want to know she managed at last i like surprises like me coming im not sure what to think about you coming dont think he said again just feel its the only safe way there was nothing she could say to that so she sat in silence until they pulled up at their destination which was his farmhouseher former wildlife shelteronly it was very different from when shed left it as a child she remembered this place looking beautiful when the doctor and his wife had loved it but it had only ever been a weekend retreat for them jakes father been on call all the time and hed lived in combadeen so maybe it had been shabby even then now it was anything but shabby it was a magnificent homestead its weatherboards gleaming with fresh white paint its gracious verandah running the full circle of the house the ancient rivergum timbers of the decking rubbed and oiled back to their original glory someone had worked in the garden there were so many roses that possums could come and share she thought and thered still be enough to go around the french windows were cleaned and gleaming some of them were open and there were soft white drapes floating out in the warm evening breeze it lookedlike home she thought stunned as jake helped her out of the car she didnt need help but she was so dazed she accepted it anyway and she didnt object as he led her into the house and took her from room to room without saying a word why was she here why was he here it was so beautiful it wasnt furnished yet the rooms were bare the place was a home waiting for its people dogs she thought suddenly and kids and her hand touched her tummy again before she could help herself theres something else you need to see before i explain myself jake said softly and she opened her mouth to argueor ask or somethingbut she couldnt think what to argue or ask or something so she closed it again he took her hand and led her and she let herself be led out of the house back to the car then along the track and into the first driveway on the left home or home as shed once known it now it was a mass of regenerating bushland all that was left was the chimney the hearth the fireplace the heart of the home for her parents lives for her grandparents lives stretching far far back now the scene for grief and destruction only she wasnt feeling grief now or not so much it was tempered by this new little life inside her it was tempered by her dogs her new job her new life it was tempered by jakes hand once again he was helping her out of the car he was leading her along the path to where the house had once been then stopping by the ancient lemon tree that had somehow miraculously survived its singed branches had regenerated and amazingly it was loaded with lemons the sight actually made her smile a massive gum had fallen right in front of it the team of men whod cleared the place had taken away the smaller litter but theyd chopped the log into three obviously thinking she might want to use it for landscaping or something she couldnt think of using anything here but jake had brought along a rug he spread it across the log so any soot was covered and he propelled her gently downwards sit he said and she sat because she was beyond arguing then ive done all i can without your input he told her its time i brought you onboard onboard onto my sea of plans he said i have three directions i can go and i dont know which one to take i dont understand okayhe said gently and he sat down beside her he took her hand in his and held it like it was truly precious first things first ive come home how was a girl to respond to that she couldnt i was born here he said taking no obvious offence at her silence but ploughing on regardless i suspect i was conceived in the house over there as you were conceived here they say theres a strong chance you end up marrying the girl next door how about that whoa she should say something she thought but what what but im getting ahead of myself he said smiling it was a teasing smile it was the smile she loved with all her heart ive quit my job he told her for the past two months ive been undertaking intensive postgraduate training in pain management theres more to learn but instead of being an anaesthetist whos good at managing pain what ive decided to do is to become a pain management specialist i need more training still but i can learn it on the job and i can learn it here i can be useful now i can be useful here and then as surprise did give her something to say he pressured her hand telling her there was more to come that for now he simply needed her to listen tori i was brought up believing my father didnt care he told her my mother didnt care eithernot emotionallyand that left me with nothing or maybe i had emotions but i learned to lock them away and then i found you breaking your heart over a dead koala and i found the community of combadeen i found people whod loved my father and who hed loved in turn i discovered that id been raised on a lie he tugged her hand then just a little so she turned and was facing him none of that matters he said except in explaining why i was so long in seeing what was before my eyes when you left i kept going to work telling myself i was dumb only youd left me colour all through my apartment i knew youd like it she interrupted absurdly pleased i love it he said simply ive had it all shipped here and i love ferdy and freddy theyre already in quarantine im hoping itsy bitsy and rusty take kindly to them theyre very bossy cats she was almost beyond hearing she was so confused she felt dizzy he was shipping his lifehere youre coming here im here you cant why cant i your lifes in manhattan my lifes with you there was a heart stopper if ever she heard one her heart definitely stopped and it took time before she got it going again and when she did caution she thought dont get your hopes up this cant be what it seems jake we can organise access some other way she managed i meani know you want a say in how our babys raised i want more than thathe said strongly and surely i want to see him wake up in the morning and i want to read him bedtime stories i want to make sure hes taught baseball and not indoctrinated into that very curious game you call football i want to change diapers that too he said and he didnt even smile it seemed he was deadly serious i want to share in getting up in the middle of the night i want to cope with dramas i want to go to school plays did you know my mother never went to a single one of my school plays not a one im going to the lot does this mean i dont have to she asked trying to joke but it didnt work there was too much at stake here for laughter i suspect its a team effort he said softly seriously the mother and father need to sit together jake i know its too fast he said quickly now as if he was afraid shed stop him before shed heard him out i know weve barely had more than our fiveminute date but i want to put a proposition before you he rose and tugged her to her feet then led her through the cleared area where once her home had stood to a spot at the northern end this was the kitchen right he said and she nodded so this viewitll have been where you stood and looked out as a family as you cooked as you washed dishes as you lived yes then theres a choice to be made he said softly as i said at the beginning therere three options three number one he said moving right on that you fall into my arms right this minute and we go next door and we move into what was my fathers home and we live happily ever after its only my preferred option because its the quickest he said hurriedly but no pressure i came up before and opened the windows and made it smell great and i think it looks great but if you dont want jake you need to listen to all three before you decide he told her trying to sound severe and you need to listen to the plans in full if we did thatif lived next doorthen i think we should build the worlds best wildlife shelter here plus a clinic for the work you used to do caring for the horses that used to live up here and will live up here again families are returning tori lifes starting here again but and we could call it after the dogs you lost he said gently mutsy and pogo and bandits animal care big letters out the front every care in the world inside oh jake or two he said hurriedly and maybe he thought she was about to burst into tears she might she thought mistily she just might but for now it was more important to listen okay moving right onto option two he said and his grip on her hands became more urgent option twos if you decide you still want to live here but even if you did want to live here youd agree that i could live here too ive thought that one through if you did that then we could turn next door my place into mutsy and pogo and bandits animal care itd take a bit more work as we have a house there and a blank canvas here and itd be a bit of a waste of new curtains but it could be done if you want this to stay as your kitchen view my love then thats your option your love it was a squeak it was definitely a squeak definitely my love he said and he tugged her tight against him and then there lies option three because much as i love you much as i admit that my fiveminute date was the best thing that could ever have happened to me much as i want you to be beside me for the rest of my life if you dont want that or youre not ready or you think you could do better then ill help you rebuild here and ill live next door so i can still teach hildebrand to play baseball hildebrand we have some discussion to do he said lovingly lots of discussion jake yes she was trying to get her head around this her head wasnt big enough to take it in youd live up here and workin melbourne in the valley as susie says theres work and to spare shes already set up discussions with healthcare providers i can start work tomorrow if i want ill need to go back and forth to the city for further training but thats feasible you could come with me and i need to take a few weeks off before i start i have a halfgrown dog to train jake stop its too fast he said suddenly rueful i promised myself i wouldnt pressure you those three optionsyou can take your time my love you can have our baby and we can decide then i wont coerce you into falling into my arms because i want to be a father because i want to be your husband first thats what i want most everything else can wait and then because she didnt speak because she couldnt he smiled and suddenly lifted her up into his arms and he carried her across the scrapedup earth that was all that was left of her past life and he took her to where the fireplace still stood a blackened sentinel in the centre of what once had been her home the chimney stood charred and blackened the massive mantel that had straddled it still there burned and twisted but still recognisably a mantel and on the blackened timber a crimson box this is for later jake said softly and he set her down i came up here on the way to find you and i left this here and i made a vow id help you rebuild your life my love and if at any stage of the rebuilding you think maybe i wouldnt mind a man in my life then this little box will be here itll sit here waiting so that i wont have to wait for the right time any sliver of opportunity and im in youyou just left it here there were three wallabies here when i got here jake said they promised theyd guard it you want a look and what was a girl to say to that its not as big as the one at tiffanys he said suddenly anxious and its presumptuous i only want a peek she could almost laugh at the look on his face almost but not quite so he flipped it open it was like the one at tiffanys hed had it copied exactly a glistening solitaire diamond in the centre a heart then five tiny rubies with the thinnest ring of diamonds forming the outer edge of the heart it had all the beauty of the one shed seen but none of the ostentation it was exquisite her heart seemed to still settle warm but then as she put her finger down to touch he tugged it back and the lid snapped closed with a firm little click back it went onto its resting place of charred timber a crimson slash against the black its too soon he said sounding firm far too soon its to sit there tori until its not too soon its to stay there until you know your heart and if it stays there until were old and grey its okay ill still be waiting she started up at him speechless and she knew he was absolutely serious no pressure she could live here again for as long as she wanted and hed be next door the father to her child doctor to this community the man she loved was it too soon and she knew fiveminute dating she didnt need five minutes she thought mistily and she put both her hands on jakes shoulders and she pushed him sideways so hard he staggered she grinned for her way was clear now there were no barriers between herself and the blackened hearth if you dont mind she said softly wondrously even finding room for laughter youre getting in the way of my hearts desire and she stepped forwards and retrieved the box and she slid the ring on her finger before jake could produce any more dumb arguments about too soon and wait and which path would she go for she knew her own path with jakes ring on her finger she turned to her man and she stepped into the arms of her hearts desire a gleaming new family wagon bright red big enough to hold dogs cats and kids turned into the gate of the homestead up on the ridgeold docs place according to the localsand drew to a halt jake climbed out went round to the passenger side to help his wife out of the car and then together they lifted the baby capsule from the back seat charlotte elizabeth hunter gazed up at her parents wideeyed and wondering they smiled down at her they smiled at each other and together they carried their brandnew baby into her home the dogs were waiting to meet them itsy and bitsy and the boss of the pack rusty were quivering with excitement but the pecking order had been established months ago ferdy and freddy came first prancing down the steps in stately dignity to investigate this new little member of their family when the cats conceded their placesafter cautious approvalthe dogs wriggled and bounced and shivered their pleasure until jake ordered control back jake said and the dogs backed just like that they were beautifully trained theyd been trained by jake under instruction from tori a team effort this whole place was a team effort jake thought in satisfaction there were delicious smells coming from the kitchen doreen and glenda had been here this morning to make sure everything was perfect then slipping away before they arrived to give them some privacy there was team effort everywhere through the regenerating bushland jake could just see signs of activity next door the new mutsy and pogo and bandits animal care centre was up and running in the place where toris house had once stood i dont mind moving shed said choosing option one with alacrity home is where the heart is after all home he knew what it was now he thought as he ushered his new wife inside as he carried his new child into her new home home it didnt go with the concept of alone home was dogs he thought and cats and a goldfish called jake home was friends neighbours community home was colour and comfort and a fire and toast on sunday morning and great coffee or no coffee at all because someone had forgotten to buy it so home might also be hot chocolate and cleaning up after the dogs and yelling at the cockatoos who were intent on stripping the paintwork off the verandah home was patients dropping in and friends home was life so now we get to live happily every after he said to tori settling charlotte elizabeth on the settee and wondering vaguely what they were going to do with her parents coped with newborns all the time he thought it couldnt be that hard then there was a knock on the door and frenzied barking he and tori looked at each other and sighed and jake opened the door a little girl was there twelve maybe and behind her was a horse about three times the size of her the horse was being held by a guy who looked like a farmer please the little girl whispered and looked past jake to tori yes tori said shed scooped charlotte up and was cradling her she looked beautiful jake thought his tori my horse stood on a nail the little girl said its really deep dad saiddad said he knew you had a little baby and cats and the odd wombat with an injured pawbut if we brought prince to you maybe you could just see im real sorry the man called out its justhaving new docs place so close now itd save us trailering her down to the city and itd be simple i think if its okay and the wifes sent a sponge cake and to jakes astonishmentor maybe not because he should be used to it by nowtori was smiling smiling and smiling its fine she said and before jake knew what she intended charlotte was in his arms my husband can take care of our baby she told the farmer ill just get my bag so jake was left holding his babywho was starting to feel wetand a plate of chocolate sponge cake he stood on the verandah of their new home while tori did her vet thing while the community went on around them while his dogs slept at his feet and he smiled too home is where the heart is home is here marion lennox
