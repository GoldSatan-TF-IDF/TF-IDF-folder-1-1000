jack higgins a fine night for dying chapter english channel there were times when jean mercier wondered what life was all about and this was very definitely one of them somewhere beyond the boat in the darkness was a shoreline that he could not see hazards at which he could only guess and the lack of navigation lights wasnt helping a wind that came all the way from the urals spilled out across the gulf of st malo driving the waves into whitecaps scattering spray against the windscreen of the launch mercier throttled back the engine and adjusted his steering slightly straining his eyes into the darkness waiting for a light like some sign from heaven he rolled a cigarette awkwardly with one hand aware of a trembling in the fingers that would not be stilled he was cold and tired and very scared but the money was good cash on the barrel and taxfreemore than he could earn from three months of fishing with an ailing wife on his hands a man had to take what came and be thankful a light flashed three times and then was gone so quickly that for a moment he wondered whether he had imagined it he ran a hand wearily across his eyes and it flickered again he watched through a third repetition mesmerized then pulled himself together and stamped on the floor of the wheelhouse there were steps on the companionway and jacaud appeared he had been drinking again and the smell sourly sharp on the clean salt air made mercier slightly sick jacaud shoved him to one side and took the wheel where is it he growled the light answered him ahead and slightly to port he nodded pushed up speed and turned the wheel as the launch rushed into the darkness he took a halfbottle of rum from his pocket swallowed what was left and tossed the empty bottle through the open door in the light from the binnacle he seemed disembodied a head that floated in the darkness a macabre joke it was the face of an animal a brute that walked on two legs with small pig eyes flattened nose and features coarsened by years of drink and disease mercier shuddered involuntarily as he had done many times before and jacaud grinned frightened arent you little man mercier didnt reply and jacaud grabbed him by the hair one hand still on the wheel and pulled him close mercier cried out in pain and jacaud laughed again stay frightened thats how i like it now go and get the dinghy ready with a heave he sent him out through the open door and mercier grabbed at the rail to save himself there were tears of rage and frustration in his eyes as he felt his way along the deck in the darkness and dropped to one knee beside the rubber dinghy he took a spring knife from one pocket feeling for the line that lashed the dinghy into place he sawed it through then touched the razor edge of the blade to his thumb thinking of jacaud one good thrust was all it would take but even at the thought his bowels contracted in a spasm of fear and he hastily closed the knife got to his feet and waited at the rail the launch rushed into the darkness and the light flashed again as jacaud cut the engine they slowed and started to drift broadside onto the beach marked by the phosphorescence of the surf a hundred yards away mercier got the anchor over as jacaud joined him the big man heaved the dinghy into the water on his own and pulled it in by handline off with you he said impatiently i want to get out of here water slopped in the bottom of the dinghy cold and uncomfortable as mercier mounted the two wooden oars and pulled away he was afraid again as he always was these days for the beach was unknown territory in spite of the fact that he had visited it in identical circumstances at least half a dozen times before but there was always the feeling that this time things might be differentthat the police could be waiting that he might be drifting into a fiveyear jail sentence the dinghy was suddenly lifted on a wave poised for a moment then dropped in across a line of creamy surf sliding to a halt as she touched shingle mercier shipped his oars slipped out and pulled her round prow facing out to sea as he straightened a light pierced the darkness dazzling him momentarily he raised a hand defensively the light was extinguished and a calm voice said in french youre late lets get moving it was the englishman rossiter again mercier could tell by the accent although his french was almost perfect the only man he had ever known jacaud to touch his cap to in the darkness he was only a shadow and so was the man with him they spoke together briefly in english a language mercier did not understand then the other man got into the dinghy and crouched in the prow mercier followed him unshipping the oars and rossiter pushed the dinghy out over the first wave and scrambled across the bow jacaud was waiting at the stern rail when they reached the launch his cigar glowing faintly in the darkness the passenger went up first and rossiter followed with his suitcase by the time mercier had reached the deck the englishman and the passenger had gone below jacaud helped him to get the dinghy over the side left him to lash it to the deck and went into the wheelhouse a moment later the engines rumbled softly and they moved out to sea mercier finished his task and went forward to make sure that all was secure rossiter had joined jacaud in the wheelhouse and they stood together at the wheel the englishmans thin aesthetic face contrasting strongly with jacaudsopposite sides of the coin one an animal the other a gentleman and yet they seemed to get on with each other so well something mercier could never understand as he moved past the wheelhouse jacaud spoke in a low voice and they both burst into laughter even in that they were different the englishmans gay chuckle mingling strangely with jacauds throaty growl and yet somehow they complemented each other mercier shuddered and went below to the galley for most of the way the passage was surprisingly smooth considering what the channel could be like at times but toward dawn it started to rain mercier was at the wheel and as they started the run in to the english coast fog rolled to meet them in a solid wall he stamped on the deck and after a while jacaud appeared he looked terrible eyes swollen and bloodshot from lack of sleep face gray and spongy now what mercier nodded toward the fog it doesnt look too good how far out are we six or seven miles jacaud nodded and pulled him out of the way okayleave it to me rossiter appeared in the doorway trouble jacaud shook his head nothing i cant handle rossiter went to the rail he stood there face expressionless and yet a small muscle twitched in his right cheek a sure sign of stress he turned and brushing past mercier went below mercier pulled up the collar of his reefer jacket thrust his hands into his pockets and stood in the prow in the gray light of early dawn the launch looked even more decrepit than usual and exactly what it was supposed to bea poor mans fishing boat lobster pots piled untidily in the stern beside the rubber dinghy nets draped across the engineroom housing moisture beaded everything in the light rain and then they were enveloped by the fog gray tendrils brushing against merciers face cold and clammy unclean like the touch of the dead and the fear was there again so much so that his limbs trembled and his stomach contracted painfully he wiped his mouth with the back of one hand and started to roll a cigarette fighting to keep his fingers still the launch slipped through a gray curtain into clear water and the cigarette paper fluttered to the deck as mercier leaned forward clutching at the rail two hundred yards away through the cold morning a sleek gray shape moved to cut across their course jacaud was already reducing speed as rossiter appeared on deck he ran to the rail and stood there one hand shielding his eyes from the rain a signal flashed through the gray morning and he turned face grim theyre saying heave to i wish to board you its a royal navy mtb lets get out of here mercier clutched at his sleeve panic rising to choke him those things can do thirtyfive knots monsieur we dont stand a chance rossiter grabbed him by the throat seven years thats what youll get if they catch us with him onboard now get out of my way he nodded to jacaud ran along the deck and disappeared below the engines roared as jacaud gave them full throttle spinning the wheel at the same time and the launch heeled over onto one side almost coming to a dead stop then surged forward into the fog the gray walls moved in hiding them from sight and the door to the companionway banged open and rossiter appeared with the passenger he was a black man of middle years tall and handsome and he wore a heavy overcoat with a fur collar he looked around in bewilderment and rossiter spoke to him in english the man nodded and moved forward to the rail and rossiter pulled out an automatic and struck him a heavy blow at the base of the skull the man lurched to one side and fell to the deck without a cry what happened next was like something out of a nightmare the englishman moved with incredible speed and energy he grabbed a heavy chain from the stern deck and wound it around the mans body several times he gave it a final turn about the neck and hooked the two loose ends together with a spring link he turned and shouted to mercier above the roaring of the engine okay grab his feet and over with him mercier stood there as if turned to stone without hesitation rossiter dropped to one knee and heaved the man into a sitting position the man raised his head painfully the eyelids flickered then opened he glared at mercier not in supplication but in hate his lips parted and he cried out in english rossiter stooped and had him across the shoulders the englishman straightened and the man went over the rail headfirst into the sea and disappeared instantly rossiter turned and struck mercier heavily in the face sending him sprawling to the deck now pick yourself up and get to work on those nets or ill send you after him he went into the wheelhouse mercier lay there for a moment then got to his feet and stumbled along to the stern it couldnt have happened oh god but it couldnt have happened the deck slanted suddenly as jacaud spun the wheel again and mercier fell on his face in the pile of stinking nets and started to be sick it was the fog that saved them spreading out halfway across the channel shrouding them from view on the run back to the french coast in the wheelhouse jacaud swallowed rum from a bottle and chuckled harshly weve lost them your luck is good rossiter said you must live right pity about the package thats life rossiter seemed completely unconcerned and nodded to where mercier crouched by the nets head in hands what about him a worm jacaud said no backbone maybe he should go for a swim too and what would you tell them in saint denise rossiter shook his head leave it to me he went along the deck and stood over mercier with the rum bottle youd better have a drink mercier raised his head slowly his skin was like the belly of a fish the eyes full of pain he was still alive monsieur still alive when you put him into the water rossiters pale flaxen hair glinted in the early morning sun making him look strangely ageless he stared down at mercier his gentle aesthetic face full of concern he sighed heavily crouched and produced an exquisite madonna from one of his pockets it was perhaps eight inches long and obviously extremely old carved by some master in ivory the color of his hair chased with silver when he pressed her feet with his thumb six inches of blue steel appeared as if by magic sharp as a razor on both edges honed with loving care rossiter kissed the madonna reverently and without even a trace of mockery then stroked the blade against his right cheek you have a wife mercier he said gently and his face never lost its peculiarly saintly expression for a moment an invalid i understand monsieur mercier said in a whisper and the heart seemed to stop inside him one word mercier the slightest whisper and i cut her throat you follow me mercier turned away stomach heaving and started to be sick again rossiter stood up and walked along the deck and stood in the entrance of the wheelhouse all right jacaud demanded naturally rossiter took a deep breath of fresh salt air and smiled a fine morning jacaud a beautiful morning and to think one could still be in bed and missing all this chapter fog rolled in across the city and somewhere in the distance ships hooted mournfully to each other as they negotiated the lower reaches of the thames on the way out to sea fogreal fog of the kind that you seemed to get in london and nowhere else on earth fog that killed off the aged choked the streets and reduced one of the worlds great cities to chaos and confusion paul chavasse abandoned his taxi at marble arch and whistled softly to himself as he turned up the collar of his trench coat and passed through the gates of the park personally there was only one thing he liked better than fog and that was rain an idiosyncrasy with its roots somewhere in youth he supposed or perhaps there was a simpler explanation after all both rain and fog enclosed one in a small private world which could be very convenient at times he paused to light a cigarette a tall handsome man with a face as gallic as the pigalle on a saturday night and the heritage of his breton father was plain to see in the celtic cheekbones a park keeper drifted out of the shadows and faded without a word a thing that considering the circumstances could only have happened in england chavasse went on his way unaccountably cheered st bedes hospital was on the far side of the park a victorian gothic monstrosity in spite of its worldwide reputation they were expecting him and when he called at reception a porter in a neat blue uniform escorted him along a series of greentiled corridors each one of which seemed to stretch into infinity he was handed over to a senior lab technician in a small glass office who took him down to the mortuary in a surprisingly modern lift chavasse was conscious of two things the moment the lift doors opened the allpervading smell of antiseptic so peculiar to hospitals and the extreme cold the vast echoing chamber was lined with steel drawers each one presumably holding a cadaver but the object of his visit waited for him on an operating trolley covered with a rubber sheet we couldnt get him into one of the boxes worse luck the technician explained too bloated stinking like last years fish and then some at close quarters the smell was quite overpowering in spite of the preventive measures that had obviously been taken chavasse pulled out a handkerchief and held it to his mouth i see what you mean he had looked on death many times in most of its variations but this monstrosity was something new he stared down a slight frown on his face how long was he in the water six or seven weeks can you be certain of that oh yesurine tests the rate of chemical breakdown and so on he was jamaican by the way or did you know that so they told me but id never have guessed the technician nodded prolonged immersion in salt water does funny things to skin pigmentation so it would appear chavasse stepped back and replaced the handkerchief in his breast pocket thanks very much i think ive seen all i need all right for us to dispose of him now sir the technician inquired as he replaced the sheet i was forgetting chavasse took out his wallet and produced a printed disposal slip cremation only and all documents to the home office by tomorrow theyd been hoping to have him in the medical school for dissection tell them to try burke and hare chavasse pulled on his gloves ashes to ashes for this boy and no funny business ill see myself out when he had gone the technician lit a cigarette a slight frown on his face he wondered about chavasse there was a foreign look about him but he was obviously english a nice enough blokea gentleman to use an oldfashioned word but something wasnt quite right it was the eyes that was it black and completely expressionless they seemed to look right through you and beyond as if you werent there at all the kind of eyes that jap colonel had had the one in the camp in siam where the technician had spent the worst three years of his life a funny bloke that jap one minute full of the milk of human kindness the next smoking a cigarette without turning a hair while they flogged some offender to death the technician shuddered and opened the slip of paper that chavasse had given him it was signed by the home secretary himself that did it he carefully stowed it away in his wallet and pushed the trolley through into the crematorium next door exactly three minutes later he closed the glass door of one of the three special ovens and reached for the switch flames appeared as if by magic and the body bloated with its own gases started to burn at once the technician lit another cigarette professor henson wouldnt be too pleased but it was done now and after all he did have it in writing he went next door whistling cheerfully and made a cup of tea it was almost two months since chavasse had visited the house in st johns wood and returning was like coming home again after a long absence not so strange perhaps when one considered the kind of life he had led for the twelve years he had been an agent of the bureau the littleknown section of british intelligence that handled the sort of business no one else seemed to know what to do with he went up the steps and pressed the bell beside the brass plate that carried the legend brown amp coimporters amp exporters the door was opened almost immediately by a tall graying man in a blue serge uniform who positively beamed a welcome good to have you back mr chavasse youre nice and brown glad to be back george mr mallorys been asking for you sir miss frazers been phoning down every few minutes nothing new in that george chavasse went up the curving regency staircase quickly nothing changed not a thing it was just like it had always been lengthy periods in which damnall happened and then something broke through to the surface and the day needed twentyseven hours when he went into the small outer office at the end of the narrow corridor jean frazer was seated at her desk she glanced up and removed her heavy library spectacles with a smile that was always a shade warmer for chavasse than anyone else paul youre looking fine its wonderful to see you again she came round the desk a small hippy woman of thirty or so but attractive enough in her own way chavasse took her hands and kissed her on the cheek i never did get around to giving you that evening out at the saddle room its been on my conscience oh im sure it has there was a look of skepticism on her face you got my message my flight was delayed but the messenger was waiting when i got to the flat i didnt even have time to unpack ive been to st bedes and had a look at the corpus delicti or whatever they call it most unpleasant hed been in the sea rather a long time bleached a whiter shade of pale by the way which seemed extraordinary considering what you told me about him spare me the details she flicked the intercom paul chavasse is here mr mallory send him in the voice was remote and dry and might have been from another worlda world that chavasse had almost forgotten during his two months convalescence a tiny flicker of excitement moved coldly in his stomach as he opened the door and went in mallory hadnt changed in the slightest the same gray flannel suit from the same very eminent tailor the same tie from the right school not an irongray hair out of place the same frosty remote glance over the top of the spectacles he couldnt even manage a smile hello paul nice to see you he said as if he didnt mean a word of it hows the leg fine now sir no permanent effects it aches a little in damp weather but they tell me that will wear off after a while youre lucky youve still got two legs to walk around on magnum bullets can be nasty things how was alderney chavasses english mother lived in retirement on that most delightful of all the channel islands and he had spent his convalescence in her capable hands it occurred to him with a sense of wonder that on the previous day at this time he had been picnicking on the white sands of telegraph bay cold chicken and salad and a bottle of liebfraumilch frosted from the fridge and wrapped in a damp towel strictly against the rules but the only way to drink it he sighed nice sir very nice mallory got straight down to business youve seen the body at st bedes chavasse nodded any idea who he was mallory reached for a file and opened it a west indian named harvey preston from jamaica and how did you manage to find that out his fingerprints were on record chavasse shrugged his fingers were swollen like bananas when i saw him oh the lab boys have a technique for dealing with that sort of problem they take a section of skin and shrink it to normal size with the use of chemicals they arrive at a reasonable facsimile somebody went to a lot of trouble over the body of an unknown man washed up after six weeks why in the first place it didnt happen in quite that way he was brought up off the bottom in the trawl net of a fishing boat out of brixham with about seventy pounds of chain wrapped around him murdered presumably death by drowning a nasty way to go mallory passed a photo across thats him taken at his trial at the bailey in what was he up for robbing a gambling club in birmingham the crown lost by the way he was acquitted for lack of evidence witnesses failed to come forward and so on the usual story he must have had a lot of pull mallory helped himself to one of his turkish cigarettes and leaned back in his seat harvey preston arrived in england in when he was twenty and joined the royal army service corps during the munich crisis his mother and father followed a few months later with his younger sister and preston fixed them up with a small house in brixton he was stationed at aldershot with a transport regiment as a truck driver his mother gave birth to another son who they named darcy on the third day of the war in september a week later harveys regiment was posted to france during the big retreat when the panzers broke through in his unit was badly knocked about and he was shot twice in the right leg he made it out through dunkirk and back to england but was so badly lamed by his wounds that he was discharged with a pension what did he do then at first he drove an ambulance but then he underwent the kind of personal tragedy so common during the london blitz the house in brixton got a direct hit during a raid and the only survivor was his young brother from then on things seem to have taken a different turn what did he do take your pick black market prostitution after the war he ran a number of illegal gaming clubs and became something of a power in the underworld moved into organized crime about the police were certain he was behind a very efficient hijacking organization but could never prove anything there were several payroll robberies as well and he was very definitely involved in drug trafficking quite a character what happened after his acquittal last year was he deported mallory shook his head hed been here too long for that but the yard really turned the heat on he lost his gaming license for a start which put him out of the casino business it seems they breathed down his neck so hard that he hardly dared stir from his house it was the money from the birmingham casino robbery they were after even if he couldnt be tried again they could stop him from spending it was he married no lived on his own a different girl a night by all accounts right up to the end what about the brother the one who survived the bombing young darcy mallory actually grinned funny thing happened there harvey kept the boy with him sent him to st pauls as a day boy must have been an extraordinary life for him mixing with the sons of the upper crust during the day and the worst villains in london by night he decided to go in for the law of all things passed his bar finals three years ago cleared off to jamaica after harveys trial and what did harvey do left the country on a plane to rome two months ago they just about took him to pieces at the airport but there wasnt a thing on him they had to let him go where did he go from rome interpol had him followed to naples where he dropped out of sight to reemerge two months later in the bottom of a fishing net off the english coast intriguing what do you think he was playing at i should have thought that was obvious mallory shrugged he was trying to get into the country illegally as long as the police didnt know he was here he could recover his money at leisure and leave by the same way he came whatever that was chavasse was beginning to see a little light someone put him over the side in the channel thats what youre suggesting something like that theres a lot of money in this passagebynight business since the commonwealth immigration act pakistanis indians west indians australiansanyone who cant get a visa in the usual way theres good money in it there was a case in the paper the other day chavasse said the navy stopped an old launch off felixstowe and found thirtytwo pakistanis on board thats a fair nights work for someone amateurs mallory said most of them dont stand a chance its the professionals whore getting away with it the people with the organization theres a pipeline running all the way through from naples the italian police have been doing some checking and theyve come up with an interesting report on a boat called the anya that makes the naplesmarseilles run regularly under a panamanian registration chavasse reached for the file turned it round and went through the photos it contained there were several of harvey preston taken through the years one on the steps of the old bailey after his trial an arm around the shoulders of his young brother chavasse leafed through the reports then glanced up this is police work where do we come in the special branch at scotland yard has asked us to help they feel this job requires the kind of talents more appropriate to one of our operatives the last time they asked for help it involved me spending six months in three of the worst jails in britain chavasse said plus the fact that i nearly got my leg blown off why cant they do their own dirty work weve worked out a suitable background for you mallory said impassively use your own name no reason not to australian citizen of french extraction wanted in sydney for armed robbery he pushed a folder across everything you need is in there including a newspaper clipping confirming your criminal background naturally youre willing to pay any price to get into britain and no questions asked chavasse felt as usual as if some great sea was washing over him when do i go theres a threethirty flight to rome you should make it with a quarter of an hour to spare if you leave now youll find a suitcase waiting for you outside i had one brought over a good thing you didnt have time to unpack he stood up and held out his hand the best of luck paul keep in touch in the usual way mallory sat down replaced his glasses and reached for a file chavasse picked up his folder turned and went out he was chuckling when he closed the door whats so funny jean frazer demanded he leaned across her desk and chucked her under the chin prettiest looking sheila ive clapped eyes on since i left sydney he said in a very fair australian twang she stared at him in amazement are you mad he picked up his suitcase and laughed i must be jean i really must be he said and went out chapter naples the woman was an indian and very youngno more than sixteen if chavasse was any judge she had a pale flawless complexion and sad brown eyes that were set off to perfection by her scarlet sari chavasse had seen her only once during the twoday voyage from naples and presumed they were bound for the same eventual destination he was leaning against the rail when she came along the deck she nodded a trifle uncertainly and knocked on the door of the captains cabin it opened after a moment or so and skiros appeared he was stripped to the waist and badly needed a shave but he smiled ingratiatingly managing to look even more repulsive than usual and stepped to one side the girl hesitated fractionally then moved in skiros glanced across at chavasse winked and closed the door which didnt look too good for miss india chavasse shrugged it was no skin off his nose he had other things to think about he lit a cigarette and moved toward the stern of the old steamer pavlo skiros had been born of indeterminate parentage in constantinople fortyseven years earlier there was some greek in him a little turk and quite a lot of russian and he was a disgrace to all three countries he had followed the sea all his life and yet his right to a masters ticket was uncertain to say the least but he possessed other darker qualities in abundance that suited the owners of the anya perfectly he sat on the edge of the table in his small cluttered cabin and scratched his left armpit lust in his soul when he looked at the girl what can i do for you he asked in english my money she told him you said you would return it when we reached port all in good time my dear we dock in half an hour and youll have to keep out of the way until the customs men have finished there will be trouble she asked in alarm he shook his head no trouble i promise you it is all arranged youll be on your way within a couple of hours he got up and moved close enough for her to smell him youve nothing to worry about ill handle everything personally he put a hand on her arm and she drew back slightly thank youthank you very much i will go and change now i dont suppose a sari would be very practical on the marseilles waterfront at night she opened the door and paused looking toward chavasse who is that man just a passengeran australian i see she appeared to hesitate is he another like myself no nothing like that he wiped sweat from his face with the back of a hand youd better go to your cabin now and stay there ill come for you later when everything is quiet she smiled again looking younger than ever thank you youve no idea what this means to me the door closed behind her skiros stood staring at it blankly for a moment then reached for the bottle of whiskey on the table and a dirty tin mug as he drank he thought about the girl and what he would do with her when things were nice and quiet and they were alone the expression on his face was not pleasant they entered marseilles on the evening tide and it was already dark when they docked chavasse had gone down to his cabin earlier and lay on the bunk smoking and staring up at the ceiling on which the peeling paint made a series of interesting patterns but then the whole boat left a great deal to be desired the food was barely edible the blankets dirty and the general appearance of the crew from skiros down was pretty grim using the information obtained by the italian police chavasse had approached skiros in a certain cafe on the naples waterfront flashing a roll of fivers that had set the good captains eyes gleaming chavasse had not used the criminal background part of his story he had preferred to allow skiros to discover that for himself he had simply posed as an australian anxious to get into the old country and denied a visa and skiros had swallowed the story for the money chavasse would be taken to marseilles landed illegally and sent on his way to people who would see him safely across the channel once on board he had deliberately left his wallet around minus his bankroll but containing amongst other things the clipping from the sydney morning herald that spoke of the police search for paul chavasse wanted for questioning in connection with a series of armed robberies there was even a photo to make certain and the bait must have been taken for the cabin had been searchedchavasse had ways of knowing about things like that he was surprised he had gotten this far without some attempt to relieve him of his cash and drop him overboard for skiros looked like the kind of man who would have cheerfully sold his sister in the marketplace on very reasonable terms chavasse had slept with the door doublebolted each night and his smith amp wesson handy under the pillow he took it out now checking each round carefully as he replaced it in the special holster that fitted snugly against the small of his back there was a knock at the door and melos the walleyed cypriot first mate looked in captain skiros is ready for you now good on you sport chavasse picked up a black trench coat and reached for his suitcase its me for the open road outside it was raining and he followed melos along the slippery deck to the captains cabin skiros was seated at his table eating his evening meal when they went in so mr chavasse we arrive safely looks like it sport chavasse said cheerfully lets see now i gave you five hundred in naples thats another five i owe you he produced the roll of fivers and counted a hundred out on the table skiros gathered them up nice to do business with you where do i go from here chavasse demanded there is no watchman on this dock no one will stop you when you pass through the gate catch the ninethirty express for paris wait at the bookstall on the platform at the other end and you will be approached by a man who will ask you if you are his cousin charles from marseilles everything is arranged from then on thats it then chavasse still kept the bonhomie going as he pulled on his trench coat and picked up the suitcase didnt i see an indian girl about the place what about her skiros demanded his smile fading nothing special just thought she might be on the same kick as me you are mistaken skiros got to his feet wiped his mustache and held out his hand i would not delay if i were you youve just got time to catch that train chavasse smiled at both of them cant afford to miss that can i he went out into the rain moved along the deck and descended the gangway at the bottom he paused under the lamp for a moment then moved into darkness melos turned inquiringly to skiros a great deal of money in that roll skiros nodded get after him take andrew with you the two of you should be enough what if he kicks up a fuss how can he hes in the country illegally and the sydney police want him for armed robbery use your intelligence melos melos went out skiros continued to eat working his way through the meal methodically when he had finished he poured himself a very large whiskey which he drank slowly when he went out the rain was falling even heavier drifting down through the yellow quarter lights in a silver spray he moved along the deck to the girls cabin knocked and went in she turned from the bunk to face him looking strangely alien in a blue sweater and pleated gray skirt there was something close to alarm on her face but she made a visible effort and smiled captain skiros it is time then it most certainly is skiros said and moving with astonishing speed he pushed her back across the bunk and flung himself on top of her a hand across her mouth to stifle any sound melos and the deckhand andrew hurried along the dock and paused by the iron gates to listen there was no sound and melos frowned whats happened to him he took a single anxious step forward and chavasse moved out of the shadows turned him round and raised a knee into his groin melos sagged to the wet cobbles and chavasse grinned across the writhing body at andrew what kept you andrew moved in fast the knife in his right hand glinting in the rain his feet were kicked expertly from beneath him and he hit the cobbles he started to get up and chavasse seized his right wrist then twisted the arm around and up in a direction it was never intended to go andrew screamed as a muscle ripped in his shoulder and chavasse ran him headfirst into the railings of the gate melos had managed to regain his feet although he was retching chavasse stepped over andrew and grabbed him by the shirt was i really being met outside that station bookstall in paris melos shook his head and the indian girl whats skiros playing at there melos didnt answer chavasse pushed him away in disgust turned and ran back toward the boat the girls teeth fastened on the edge of the captains hand biting clean to the bone he gave a grunt of pain and slapped her across the face by god ill teach you he said youll crawl before im through with you as he advanced face contorted the door swung open and chavasse stepped in he held the smith amp wesson negligently in one hand but the eyes were very dark in the white devils face skiros swung round and chavasse shook his head you really are a bastard arent you skiros skiros took a step forward and chavasse slashed him across the face with the barrel of the gun drawing blood skiros fell back across the bunk and the girl ran to chavasse who put an arm about her dont tell me let me guess youre trying to get to england but they wont give you a visa thats right she said in astonishment were in the same boat then how much did he charge you he took all my money in naples he said he would keep it safe for me did he now chavasse pulled skiros up and shoved him toward the door get your bag and wait for me at the gangway the good captain and i have things to discuss when he pushed skiros through the door of his own cabin the captain turned angrily blood on his face you wont get away with this chavasse hit him across the face with the gun twice knocking him to the floor he squatted beside him and said pleasantly get the girls money i havent got much time skiros produced a key from his trouser pocket dragged himself to a small safe beside his bunk and opened it he took out a bundle of notes and tossed them across you can do better than that chavasse pushed him to one side reached inside the safe and picked up a black cashbox he turned it upside down and two or three bundles of notes flopped to the floor he stuffed them into his pocket and grinned theres a lesson in this for you somewhere skiros and worth every penny he tapped him on the forehead with the barrel of the smith amp wesson and now the addressthe real addresswhere we can catch a boat for the channel crossing go to saint denise on the brittany coast near the gulf of saint malo skiros croaked saint brieuc is the nearest big town theres an inn called the running man ask for jacaud if youre lying ill be back chavasse said skiros could barely whisper its the truth and you can do what the hell you like ill have my day chavasse pushed him back against the wall stood up and went out the girl was waiting anxiously at the head of the gangway she had a scarf around her head and wore a plastic raincoat i was beginning to get worried she said in her soft slightly singsong voice no need he handed her the bundle of notes he had taken from skiros yours i think she looked up at him in a kind of wonder who are you a friend he said gently and picked up her suitcase now lets get moving i think it would be healthier in the long run he took her arm and they went down the gangway together chapter france they caught the night express to brest with only ten minutes to spare it wasnt particularly crowded chavasse managed to find them an empty secondclass compartment near the rear left the girl in charge and ran to the station buffet he returned with a carton of coffee sandwiches and a half dozen oranges the girl drank some of the coffee gratefully but shook her head when he offered her a sandwich i couldnt eat a thing its going to be a long night he said ill save some for you for later the train started to move and she got up and went into the corridor looking out over the lights of marseilles when she finally turned and came back into the compartment a lot of the strain seemed to have left her face feeling better now he asked i felt sure that something would go wrong that captain skiros might reappear a bad dream he said you can forget it now life seems to have been all bad dreams for some time why not tell me about it she seemed strangely shy and when she spoke it was hesitantly at first her name was famia nadeem and he had been wrong about her age she was nineteen born in bombay her mother had died in childbirth and her father had immigrated to england leaving her in the care of her grandmother things had gone well for him for he now owned a prosperous indian restaurant in manchester and had sent for her to join him three months before on the death of the old woman but there had been snags of a kind with which chavasse was only too familiar under the terms of the immigration act only genuine family dependents of commonwealth citizens already in residence in britain could be admitted without a work permit in famias case there was no formal birth certificate to prove her identity conclusively unfortunately there had been a great many false claims and the authorities were now sticking rigorously to the letter of the law no absolute proof of the claimed relationship meant no entry and famia had been sent back to india on the next flight but her father had not given up he had sent her money and details of an underground organization that specialized in helping people in her predicament she was disconcertingly naive and chavasse found little difficulty in extracting the information he required starting with the export firm in bombay where her trip had commenced passing through cairo and beirut and culminating in naples with the agents who controlled the anya but why did you give skiros all your money he asked he said it would be safer that there were those who might take advantage of me and you believed him he seemed kind she leaned back in her seat head turned to look through her own reflection into the darkness outside she was beautifultoo beautiful for her own good chavasse decided a lovely vulnerable young girl on her own in a nightmare world she turned and catching him watching her colored faintly and you mr chavasse what about you he gave her his background story cutting out the criminal bit he was an artist from sydney who wanted to spend a few months in england which meant working for his keep and there was a long long waiting list for permits he wasnt prepared to join the queue she accepted his story completely and without any kind of query which was bad considering that it was so shot full of holes she leaned back again and gradually her eyes closed he reached for his trench coat and covered her he was beginning to feel some kind of responsibility which was really quite absurd she was nothing to himnothing at all in any case with any kind of luck things would go through pretty smoothly once they reached st denise but what would happen when they arrived on the english coast and mallory acted on his information shed be on her way back to bombay for good theyd never allow her into the country again after an attempt at illegal entry life could be very difficult at times chavasse sighed folded his arms and tried to get some sleep they reached st brieuc just before five oclock in the morning the girl had slept peacefully throughout the night and chavasse awakened her just before they arrived she disappeared along the corridor and when she returned her hair was combed neatly into place any hot water down there he asked she shook her head i prefer cold in the morning it freshens you up chavasse ran a hand over the hard stubble on his chin and shook his head im not too fond of being skinned alive ill shave later the train glided into st brieuc five minutes later they were the only passengers to alight it was cold and desolate and touched with that atmosphere peculiar to railway stations in the early hours of the morning the world over it was as if everyone had just left the ticket collector well protected against the chill morning air by a heavy overcoat and muffler looked ready for retirement he was the kind of man who seemed indifferent to everything even life itself and the pallor of his skin coupled with his constant repetitive coughing boded ill he answered chavasse with a kind of frigid civility as if his attention was elsewhere st denise yes there was a bus to dinard that would drop them within a mile of st denise it left at nine oclock from the square they would find a cafe there that opened early for the market people monsieur pinaud was not one to miss trade he subsided once more into his own cheerless world and they moved on rain drifted across the square as they went down the steps and crossed to the lighted windows of the cafe it was warm inside but not busy chavasse left the girl at a table by the window and moved to the zinctopped bar a middleaged balding man in striped shirt and white apron presumably the monsieur pinaud referred to by the ticket collector was reading a newspaper he pushed it to one side and smiled just off the train thats it chavasse ordered coffee and rolls they tell me theres a bus to dinard at nine oclock thats definitely the earliest pinaud nodded as he poured the coffee you want to go to dinard no saint denise the coffeepot froze in midair and the man glanced across warily saint denise you want to go to saint denise his reaction was more than interesting and chavasse smiled amiably thats right my girlfriend and i are spending a few days holiday there ive arranged to stay at an inn called the running man with a monsieur jacaud you know him perhaps monsieur a lot of people come in here he pushed the coffee and rolls across chavasse took the two cups and the plate of rolls across to the table as he sat down pinaud wiped the zinc top of the bar carefully then moved to a door that obviously led to the rear and vanished ill only be a minute chavasse told the girl and went after him he found himself in a deserted stoneflagged corridor a notice at the far end indicated the lavatory there was no sign of pinaud chavasse started forward cautiously and paused a door on his right was slightly ajar from the sound of it pinaud was on the telephone the interesting thing was that he was speaking in breton which chavasse whose paternal grandfather still presided over the family farm near vaux in spite of his eighty years spoke himself like a native hello jacaud those two packages you were expecting have arrived the girl fits the description perfectly but the man worries me speaks french like a frenchman or like a frenchman should if you follow me yesokay theyre waiting for the bus at nine chavasse slipped back into the cafe famia was already on her second roll hurry up she said your coffee will be getting cold never mind im just going across to the station to check on that bus time again i wont be long he went out into the rain without giving her a chance to reply and hurried across to the station it was still deserted but he quickly found what he was looking for a series of metal lockers each with its own key where luggage might be left he took out his wallet and also the extra money he had taken from skiros he pushed the whole lot well to the rear of the locker closed it quickly and concealed the key beneath the insole of his right shoe famia was looking anxious when he returned to the cafe he patted her hand reassuringly and went back to the counter i wondered what had happened to you pinaud said chavasse shrugged i thought there might be a local train or something its a hell of a time to wait dont worry about that pinaud gave him a big smile you just sit tight and have another coffee lots of farmers and market people are in and out of here at this time in the morning ill get you a lift to saint denise someone is bound to be going that way very decent of you perhaps youd join me in a cognac its a cold morning an excellent idea pinaud reached for a bottle and a couple of glasses and filled them quickly your good health monsieur he raised his glass and smiled chavasse smiled right back and yours the brandy burned all the way down he picked up his coffee and returned to the table to await events people came and went mainly porters from the nearby market and chavasse bought the girl another coffee and waited it was perhaps half an hour later when the old van turned out of a narrow street on the other side of the square he watched it idly as it approached and noticed a renault emerge from the same street and halt at the curbside the van came on and braked no more than a couple of yards from the cafe window jacaud got out the girl reacted immediately that manwhat a terrible face he seems soso completely evil appearances can sometimes be very deceptive chavasse told her jacaud paused just inside the door glancing casually around the room as if seeking a friend before proceeding to the counter and yet he had marked them chavasse was sure of it he purchased a packet of cigarettes and pinaud said something to him he glanced over his shoulder at chavasse and the girl then turned away again pinaud poured him a cognac and came round the counter you are in luck monsieur he told chavasse this man is going to saint denise he has agreed to give you a lift chavasse turned to the girl and said in english our goodlooking friend has offered us a lift should we accept is there any reason why we shouldnt he smiled and shook his head youre really very refreshing but hopelessly out of date stillnever look a gift horse in the mouth jacaud swallowed his cognac and crossed to the door he paused and glanced down at chavasse face expressionless you are going to saint denise i understand im on my way there now youre welcome to a lift wonderful chavasse said brightly well be right with you jacaud nodded briefly to pinaud ill be in touch about further arrangements he said in breton and went out he was already behind the wheel when chavasse and the girl joined him there was room for one passenger the girl took the only seat and chavasse heaved the suitcases into the rear and climbed over the tailgate the van started at once bouncing its way across the cobbles passing the parked renault he caught a quick glimpse of the driver a flash of very fair hair and then the renault pulled away from the curb and came after them which was interesting chavasse touched the butt of the smith amp wesson snug in its holster against his spine then sat back and waited to see what was going to happen within a few minutes they had left the town and were proceeding along a narrow country road the heavy rain and a slight ground mist reduced visibility considerably but he caught an occasional glimpse of the sea in the distance beyond a fringe of pine trees the renault stayed so close that he could see the driver clearly a pale aesthetic man with extraordinarily fair hair who looked more like a priest than anything else they came to a crossroads at a place where the pinewoods seemed to move in on every side the van carried straight on the renault turned left and disappeared chavasse frowned the van swerved into a narrow sandy track to the left and moved down through the pine trees toward the sea a few moments later the engine coughed a couple of times faltered then stopped completely the van rolled to a halt the door opened and jacaud came round to the rear trouble chavasse inquired ive run out of fuel jacaud said but it doesnt matter i always carry an emergency supply at the back of the bench there chavasse found on old british army jerrycan that looked as if it had been in use since dunkirk it was full which made it awkward to handle in the confined space and he had to use both hands which was obviously exactly what jacaud had counted on as chavasse heaved the jerrycan up on the tailgate with every sign of difficulty the big mans hand appeared from behind his back and the tire iron lever he was holding cracked down only chavasse wasnt there any longer he dodged to one side holding the jerrycan in both hands with negligent ease and the tire iron dented the edge of the tailgate jacaud was already moving backward out of harms way every instinct that had kept him intact for fortythree years warning him that he had made a very bad mistake but he was too late the jerrycan took him full in the chest and he went over he rolled onto his face and started to get up and chavasse landed on his back the arm that clamped itself around jacauds throat was like a steel band cutting off his air supply so efficiently that he started to choke at once chavasse wasnt really sure what happened after that he was aware of famia screaming calling his name and then the light was switched off very suddenly there was no painno pain at all a blow to the base of the neck delivered by an expertthe thought was there and yet was not there and in the same moment vision returned he looked up into the face of a ravaged saint an anthony burned clear to the bone by the heat of the wilderness beneath the drift of flaxen hair the pale blue eyes were empty there was no love here no cruelty either and he crouched beside chavasse in a kind of meditation an exquisite ivory madonna clasped in both hands chavasse was aware of the smith amp wesson hard against his back secure in its spring holster famia nadeem stood beside the van hands together terror on her face and jacaud stood beside her chavasse decided to play it cool for another couple of minutes he came back to rossiter stared at him vacantly and ran a hand across his eyes the englishman slapped him in the face can you hear me chavasse chavasse struggled up on one elbow and rossiter smiled briefly i was beginning to think i must have hit you harder than i had intended hard enough chavasse sat up rubbing the nape of his neck with one hand youve heard from skiros i presume naturally he gives me to understand that you have in your possession a considerable sum of money belonging to the organization i work for where is it in a safe place back in saint brieuc i decided it would make what a poker player might term a good aceinthehole who am i talking to by the way youre not jacaud thats for sure monsieur jacaud you have already met my name is rossiter and he and skiros work for you in a manner of speaking then i dont think much of the way your organization treats the cash customers when i reached marseilles skiros sent me on my way to the wrong destination with a couple of goons on my tail to rob me when i went back to the ship to talk things over he was doing his best to rape the girl on top of that hed taken her for a lot of money i dont know how well hes been doing for you but id say his bank account would make interesting reading rossiter didnt seem to be listening he had turned to famia nadeem a frown on his face when he went forward she glanced down and he put a hand under her chin and tilted it up is he telling the truth strangely enough all her fear seemed to have vanished she looked up at him calmly and nodded rossiter turned abruptly and came back to chavasse his eyes were bleak and there was an expression of utter desolation on his face what a world he said softly what a filthy loathsome world he took a deep breath something clicked and he was himself again get up chavasse did as he was told producing the smith amp wesson at the same time jacaud gave a kind of angry cry but rossiter waved him to silence he stood feet slightly apart tossing the ivory madonna high into the air and catching it again in his right hand now what now nothing chavasse said i just want to get to london in one piece and fade into the background understandable enough rossiter actually smiled ten years in an australian jail can hardly have been an exciting prospect i believe they still run their penal system on rather oldfashioned lines chavasse managed to look suitably astonished is there anything you dont know sport not where clients are concerned chavasse sighed and put the smith amp wesson away ive had my bellyful of trouble during the past few months rossiter i dont want any more just get me to england thats all i ask ill pay whatever is necessary that business in marseilles was all skiros believe me rossiter slipped the madonna into his right pocket the money where is it chavasse told him he also took off his right shoe and produced the key which rossiter immediately tossed to jacaud well wait for you here you can take the renault jacaud moved away through the trees without a word and chavasse lit a cigarette so far so good he looked down through the pine trees toward the sea and smiled nice country i was looking forward to this bit of the trip my father came from brittany you know i was wondering about your french rossiter said its quite excellent my mother was english of course but weve never used anything else but french in the house since i can remember my old man wouldnt have it any other way rossiter nodded produced a slim leather case from his breast pocket and selected a thin black cheroot which he lit carefully tell me something about the girl she was sitting in the passenger seat watching them chavasse threw her a smile i only know what shes told me he went through her story quickly and when he had finished rossiter nodded briefly shes very young to have gone through so much he said it as if he meant it with real sympathy in his voice and moved toward her chavasse sat down on a fallen log and watched them rossiter was speaking the girl answered suddenly she was smiling and a few moments later laughed out loud and rossiter laughed with her that was the strangest thing of all so that for a short time he seemed to be an entirely different person curiouser and curiouser chavasse gave up for the moment got to his feet and walked to the edge of the clearing breathing in the scent of damp pines the good salt air from the sea the smell that always brought the brittany of his boyhood back to him wherever he was it would have been nice to have surprised his grandfather at vaux the old man would have loved thatan unexpected visit from his clever halfenglish grandson who lectured at a university whose name he could never remember a little bit too much of the scholar with his doctorate in modern languages but still a chavasse for all that chavasse stared down through the trees toward the sea remembering boyhood a thousand years ago and all its wonderful dreams and now he had returned to brittany and he could not go to vaux a horn sounded through the trees jacaud had arrived and he sighed and came back to the present as rossiter called to him chapter brittany st denise was twenty or thirty granite cottages amongst pine trees fringing a horseshoe cove that was a natural harbor there was a wooden jetty of sorts with an old thirtyfoot launch moored to it that looked as if it had seen better days the tide was turning and four clinkerbuilt fishing cobles moved out to sea line astern a similar boat lay stranded on the beach above the highwater mark and two men worked on her hull chavasse took it all in as the van moved out of the trees along the narrow road that merged into the main street of the village the only sign of life was a stray dog sitting mournfully in the rain outside a cottage door the van left the village behind and almost stalled as jacaud dropped two gears to negotiate a steep hill the running man was at the top a twostoried granite house sheltering behind high walls jacaud turned through an archway and halted in the cobbled courtyard inside chavasse got out and looked around with interest the whole place had a strangely forlorn look about it and badly needed a coat of paint a shutter banged to and fro in the wind and when he glanced up a curtain moved slightly at a window as if it had been pulled to one side while someone glanced out the renault entered the courtyard and pulled up just behind the van famia got out and stood there looking uncertain rossiter came round from the other side picked up her suitcase and took her elbow she looked tired ready to drop at any moment he leaned over her solicitously murmured something and took her inside chavasse turned to jacaud what about me if i had my way you could sleep in the pigsty careful chavasse said youll be making sounds like a man next now lets try again jacaud went inside without a word and chavasse picked up his suitcase and followed him he paused to glance up at the painted sign above the door it was obviously very old and showed a man running apparently some kind of fugitive a pack of hounds at his heels a pleasant sight indeed the terror in the poor wretchs eyes frozen into place for all eternity inside was a large square room with a lowbeamed ceiling and a tiled floor there was a scattering of chairs and tables a large open hearth in which a fire burned and a marbletopped bar jacaud had gone behind it and was pouring himself a large cognac he rammed the cork into the bottle and chavasse dropped his case ill join you like hell you will lets see the color of your money rossiters got it all you know that then you can go thirsty he replaced the bottle on the shelf and raised his voice hey mercier where are you a door at the back of the bar opened and a small worriedlooking man of forty or so came in he wore a fishermans patched trousers and was wiping his hands on a grimy towel yes monsieur what is it another passenger for the leopard take him upstairs he can share with jones jacaud glared at chavasse like some wild animal turned and kicking open the door vanished into the kitchen quite a show chavasse said is he always like this or is today something special mercier picked up the suitcase this way monsieur they mounted some stairs to the first floor and moved along a narrow whitewashed corridor past several doors mercier knocked on the one at the far end there was no reply and he opened it the room was small and bare with whitewashed walls two narrow truckle beds standing side by side there was a crucifix on one wall a cheap color reproduction of st francis on the other it was cleanbut only just mercier put down the case monsieur jones will probably be back shortly he is by the way jamaican a meal will be served at twelvethirty if there is anything else you wish to know you must see monsieur rossiter and who does monsieur rossiter have to see mercier frowned looking genuinely bewildered i dont understand monsieur let it go chavasse told him mercier shrugged and went out chavasse put his suitcase on one of the beds moved to the window and looked out so this was the running man not a very prepossessing sight behind him someone said welcome to liberty hall man a gull cried high in the sky and skimmed the sand dunes down by the waters edge he threw stones into the sea he turned and moved back toward chavasse tall handsome the strong angular face and startling blue eyes evidence of that mixture of blood so common in the west indies jack jones well that was as reasonable a name as any he had the shoulders of a prizefighter and looked good for ten rounds any day of the week or chavasse was no judge he flung himself down on the sand produced a packet of gauloise and lit one so youre from australia thats itsydney they tell me thats quite a town the best you should try it some time the jamaican stared at him blankly you must be joking they wouldnt even let me off the boat they like their immigrants to be the pale variety or hadnt you noticed it was a plain statement of fact without any kind of rancor in it and chavasse shrugged i dont make the laws sport too busy breaking them the jamaican was immediately interested now that explains a lot i was wondering why a free white upstanding protestant like you was having to use the back door into the old country like the rest of us catholic chavasse said free white upstanding catholicjust for the record jones grinned produced his packet of gauloises for the second time and offered him one and just how badly does the law back home want you about ten years worth thats if im lucky and the judge isnt feeling too liverish on the great day jones whistled softly man you must be a real tiger when you get going a weakness for other peoples money thats my trouble chavasse looked across the sand dunes to the small harbor and the sea beyond this is all right about the nicest beach ive touched since bondi thats what i thought five days agonow its just a drag i want to get moving what are you going to do when you get over the channel jones shrugged ive got friends theyll fix me up with something but for how long as long as i need once i hit london i cant go wrong ill just merge into the scenery after all one black face is the same as another or hadnt you noticed chavasse refused to be drawn what about the rest of the clientele if you turn your head a couple of points to starboard youll see them now the old man who appeared over a sand dune a few yards away wore a blue overcoat two sizes too large which gave him a strangely shrunken look and his brown wrinkled skin was drawn tightly over the bones of his face he wasnt too steady on his feet either chavasse got the distinct impression that if it hadnt been for the woman who supported him with a hand under his left elbow and an arm around his shoulders he might well have fallen down old hamid is seventytwo jones said a pakistani hes hoping to join his son in bradford and the woman mrs campbell angloindiana halfandhalf what they used to call chichi in the good old days of empire a fine scots name but she can no more get away from the color of her skin than i can her husband died last year and her only relative is a sister who married an english doctor years ago and went to live in harrogate of all places mrs campbell tried to get an entry permit to join her but they turned her down why she doesnt qualify as a dependent under the immigration act shes an indian national and shes got tuberculosis she was born in india never been to england in her life and yet she talks about it as if going home funny isnt it not particularly mrs campbell was about fifty with sad dark eyes and skin that was darker than usually found amongst eurasians she seemed cold and wore a shabby fur coat a heavy woolen scarf wrapped about her neck and head they paused the old man gasping for breath a cold day mr jones dont you agree jones and chavasse stood up and jones nodded this is mr chavasse a new arrival hell be going with us the old man showed no surprise ah yes miss nadeem spoke of you youve met her chavasse said just before we left for our walk mrs campbell put in hamid held out a soft boneless hand which chavasse touched briefly before it slipped from his grasp as easily as life would slip from the frail old body before very much longer mrs campbell seemed curiously embarrassed and tugged at the old mans sleeve come now mr hamid we mustnt dawdle lunch soon so nice mr chavasse her english was quaint in its preciseness and the way in which she spoke was an echo of a bygone age chavasse watched them stumble away across the sand dunes strange shadowy creatures with no substance to them adrift in an alien world and was conscious of an indescribable feeling of bitterness men made laws to protect themselves but someone always sufferedalways he turned and found jones watching him enigmatically you look sorry for them too sorry for any sydney duck with the law on his tail there was a curious stillness between them chavasse said in a harsh unemotional voice i dont know what in the hell youre talking about neither do i man jones grinned and the moment passed you want to eat wed better move they made their way through the sand dunes and started across the beach above the wooden jetty chavasse pointed toward the motor launch moored beside it is that the boat jones nodded it kind of fits in with jacaud wouldnt you say what do you make of him jones shrugged hed sell his sister or his grandmother for a bottle of rum at the right time hes on two a day at the moment and escalating and the man who works for himmercier frightened of his own shadow lives in a cottage on the other side of the village just him and his wife shes some kind of an invalid a walking vegetable he jumps when jacaud roars and rossiter jones smiled softly you like the question bit dont you chavasse shrugged suit yourself okay i will you know what a zombie is chavasse frowned something to do with voodoo isnt it to be precise a dead man brought out of his grave before corruptions had a chance to set in and given life is that what youre trying to say a kind of life to walk the night and do his masters biddinga creature of pure mindless evil and thats rossiter thats rossiter the jamaican laughed harshly the funny thing is he used to be a priesta jesuit priest and how would you know that ran out of matches one night so i knocked on his door he didnt seem to be around and your natural curiosity got the better of you what else man there were a couple of interesting photographs in the bottom righthand drawer of his dressing table he hasnt changed much theres a nice one dated of about twenty of them in a grouplooks like graduation day at the seminary the other was taken in in korea shows him with a half dozen kids at the gate of some mission or other nineteenfiftyone the year the korean war had started was that where rossiter had lost his faith chavasse frowned remembering that tortured aesthetic face the priest he could see but the murdererit just didnt seem possible he was still thinking about it as they turned into the courtyard of the running man chapter english channel the main room of the inn was deserted when they entered and jones went behind the bar and took down a bottle of cognac and two glasses from the shelf join me he said chavasse nodded why not there was a sudden bellow of anger as jacaud appeared through the rear door put those down you hear me you black ape jones looked him over calmly not a flicker of emotion on his face sure i hear you he observed in very reasonable french he uncorked the bottle and filled both glasses jacaud took a quick step toward him grabbed him by the shoulder and spun him around jacaud rossiter spoke from the doorway his voice full of steel brooking no denial jacaud turned reluctantly they dont even pay he muttered lamely rossiter ignored him and came forward he was wearing gray slacks a handknitted fishermans sweater and steelrimmed spectacles he carried a slim book in one hand a finger marking his place be my guests gentlemen are you going to join us chavasse inquired mr rossiter dont drink jones said were on our own man he saluted chavasse emptied his glass in a single swallow and filled it again jacaud scowling took down a bottle and glass for himself and retired to the other end of the bar youve been for a walk i see rossiter said chavasse nodded thats right its quite a spot they must do well in the tourist season round here too far off the beaten track and they dont encourage strangers i was wondering when we make our move i cant be certain we have one more passenger it depends when he arrives it could be today or tomorrow and whats the form when we do go youll be told at the appropriate time no need to worry we know what were doing behind them a soft voice said hesitatingly may i come in famia stood in the doorway her flawless complexion set off to perfection by a scarlet sari there was a silver rope necklace about her neck gold bracelets on the wrists it was the reactions of his companions that interested chavasse most jones was giving her the kind of appraisal you saw on the face of a connoisseur in an art gallery when confronted with something of value jacaud gazed at her with illconcealed lust and rossiter rossiter seemed transfixed his face had turned very pale which made the eyes seem bluer than ever and then a strange thing happened he smiled and it was as if something had melted inside he went forward and gave her his arm they should be ready for us shall we go in he said and took her through into the dining room he had left his book on the bar counter and chavasse picked it up it was the everyman edition of the city of god by st augustine there were times when chavasse got the distinct impression that he was the only sane person in a world gone mad this was very definitely one of them he emptied his glass nodded to jones and went after them there was a large walled garden behind the inn a sad sort of place with gnarled apple trees long since run to seed from lack of proper attention there were no flowers as yet for it was still too early in the season and last years grass overflowed onto the narrow paths still uncut famia walked there rossiter at her side a figure from brueghel in her scarlet sari vivid against that graygreen landscape she laughed and the sound rose on the quiet air to the window of chavasses room where he sat with jones watching from behind the curtain first time ive seen him smile the jamaican said shes certainly touched something chavasse replied but im not sure what rossiter murmured to the girl turned and went away she walked on by herself pausing to look up at a blackbird on a branch above her head a moment later jacaud appeared he was obviously drunk and swayed slightly as he moved forward staring at her unwinkingly she failed to see him still intent on the blackbird until he reached out and touched her shoulder she turned recoiling immediately but he caught her by the arm pulled her close and kissed her perhaps he meant no more than that for as she cried out struggling to be free he laughed jones beat chavasse to the door by a short head they went down the stairs along the passage and out through the kitchen already they were too late rossiter stood halfway between them and jacaud an arm around the girl very gently he put her to one side his hand slipped into his pocket and came out holding the ivory madonna jacaud didnt even try to escape that was the strangest thing of all he fell on his knees his great face working as rossiter slowly advanced grabbed the breton by the hair and pulled back his head there was a sharp click and steel flashed very deliberately rossiter drew the point of the razorsharp blade across jacauds forehead the flesh opened and blood oozed in a crimson curtain jacaud rolled over without a sound and rossiter wiped the knife mechanically famia stood looking at him a dazed expression on her face he went to the girl put an arm around her shoulders and led her past chavasse and jones without a glance chavasse turned jacaud over and dropped to one knee he took out his handkerchief and wiped the blood away from the great ugly face how is he jones asked fainted dead awayfright i expect rossiter knew what he was doing hes marked him badlyno more than that bandages should be enough did you see his face rossiters chavasse nodded reminded me of something faustus says in marlowes play something like this is hell and i am in it jones said more than apt chavasse grinned one thing about the jamaican educational systemthey certainly must have encouraged you to read and write man and write hell its the coming thing the jamaican got a shoulder under jacauds arm and raised him together they took him inside later in the afternoon the rain came again with a sudden rush shrouding everything in a gray curtain the old woman who did the cooking came in from the kitchen and lit an oil lamp retiring immediately without a word mrs campbell and hamid sat as close to the fire as possible and talked quietly with famia jones was reading a book and chavasse sat with a weekold copy of le monde he dropped it to the floor and went to the door that led to the bar rossiter and jacaud sat at a table talking in low tones a bottle of cognac close to jacauds hand otherwise the place was empty except for mercier who stood behind the bar counter polishing glasses it seemed as good an opportunity as he was ever likely to get and chavasse turned strolled across the room and went into the passage he went up the stairs two at a time moved along the corridor and paused outside rossiters room the lock was childs play an old mortice that opened smoothly with the first skeleton key he tried and he went inside the room was almost exactly the same as his own small and bare with a single bed and an old chest of drawers it was a place of shadows with the gray light of late afternoon seeping in through the narrow window but two tall candles burning steadily on either side of a statue of the virgin gave all the additional illumination that he needed there was a suitcase under the bed that contained nothing but clothes he replaced them neatly and pushed it out of sight again he went through the drawers next and found the photographs jones had mentioned exactly as described chavasse examined them in the flickering light of the candles and rossiters face jumped out to meet him clear and quite unmistakable he replaced them carefully and searched the other drawers there was nothing more of interest which left only the books standing in a neat row on the window ledge the bible life of st francis loyola the city of god and various commentaries there were also copies of the quotations of chairman mao tsetung and das kapital which certainly made for a most catholic collection in more senses than one he checked that everything was as he had left it opened the door cautiously and stepped out jones moved from the shadows of an alcove almost immediately opposite and smiled was i right he demanded coolly chavasse nodded on the nose the story of my life im right so often its sickening there was the sound of a car pulling up outside they moved to the window at the end of the passage and peered out a mercedes was parked at the entrance and rossiter and jacaud stood beside it jacaud opened the rear door and a man wearing a heavy overcoat with an astrakhan collar and a black oldfashioned trilby emeged he was chinese and built like a fort with a round smooth enigmatic face that made his age difficult to judge man this gets more like the united nations every minute jones whispered chavasse nodded as the mercedes drove away and jacaud picked up the chinese mans bags the other passenger presumably wed better get down and see what the form is in the living room rossiter was already making introductions and when chavasse and jones appeared he turned with a pleasant smile ah now we are all here gentlemen mr cheung the chinese man came forward to shake hands close up he was perhaps fortyfive with a smile of exceptional charm so an australian he said to chavasse i have had many dealings with firms in your country i am from hong kong he shook hands with jones rather formally and with considerably less enthusiasm and then disappeared with rossiter and jacaud who at close quarters looked white and ill a great strip of surgical tape pasted across his brow at least he shook hands jones observed they dont like my kind of people man or did you know that already to the chinese a person of any other race is naturally inferior chavasse said so dont start feeling sorry for yourself im in there too he went out into the passage and helped himself to one of the old oilskins hanging from the wooden pegs jones leaned in the doorway and watched him going somewhere i feel like some air mind if i tag along suit yourself the jamaican took down an oilskin and they went out into the rain it fell straight from sky to earth for there was no wind and when they went out through the archway st denise was almost hidden from view chavasse went down through the pine trees and moved along the beach into the sand dunes thinking things over there was the organization apparently simple enough in its aims which were to get you across the channel and into the uk no questions asked for cash on the barrel except that they were also willing to put you over the side in chains in the right circumstances having met jacaud and rossiter that fact was becoming easier to accept by the minute and what about rossiter the jesuit who had lost his faith presumably in korea where a vicious and bloody confrontation with china had dragged on for years hamid famia and mrs campbell were easy enough to accept and jones of course fitted neatly into place but mr cheung from hong kong now he really was an interesting piece of the jigsaw he paused on top of a sand dune and looked out over the gray sea jones nudged him in the ribs you see what i see theyre showing the latest customer the boat chavasse squatted pulling him down beside him rossiter and cheung were walking along the wooden jetty toward the leopard as he watched they scrambled onto the deck and disappeared down the companionway i wonder what theyre up to jones said only one way of finding out chavasse got to his feet and went down toward the water keeping to the cover of the sand dunes and jones followed him the small fishing fleet had long since returned from the days work and the cobles were drawn up on the beach in a neat row that gave excellent cover within a few moments they had reached the shelter of the jetty chavasse paused and jones said what exactly did you have in mind god knowsjust my curiosity id like to know what theyre doing he worked his way along the heavy timbers climbing to the next level at the point where graygreen water slopped in lazily the heavy smell of the sea hung over everything salt water seaweed dead fish harsh and pungent but not unpleasant he crouched in a crosspiece jones right behind him and there were footsteps on the deck above their heads rossiter and mr cheung were talking together in cantonese chavasse strained every nerve to hear what was being said but could only catch odd words and phrases there was a sudden burst of laughter and then their footsteps drummed on the boards overhead as they walked away what were they talking about jones said chavasse shook his head i couldnt catch everything putting it together it seems that cheung has been sent from a place called hellgate by a man named montefiore does that make any kind of sense to you jones nodded montefiore is something new but hellgate ive come across before i overheard a conversation between rossiter and jacaud chavasse scrambled up the cross ties and looked down at the deck of the leopard it was a depressing sight shabby and uncared for festooned with nets and cluttered with lobster pots the rubber dinghy had been inflated and a powerful outboard motor was attached to its stern one things certain he said if anything goes wrong some of us will be swimming that thing wont hold more than four and make progress come on wed better get out of here they scrambled back along the timbers and reached the beach again as they moved up through the sand dunes jones chuckled whats so funny chavasse asked you are jones contrived to look innocent man youre the only australian ive ever met who could speak french and chinese as well as english those sydney schools must really be something you go to hell chavasse said and moved on through the pine trees toward the inn when they entered rossiter was standing alone at the bar and mercier was in the act of pouring himself a brandy the englishman turned and smiled ah there you are we were looking for you we felt like a breath of air chavasse said anything important i think so youll be pleased to know were leaving tonight at approximately nine oclock how long will the crossing take about seven hours if the weather holds youll be landed on a beach near weymouth will we be met naturally my colleagues on the other side will have you in london by nine am at the latest after that you are on your own and what happens if something goes wrong jones said rossiter looked faintly surprised but it never does i can assure you ill see you later he went out closing the door and a small trapped wind scuffled in the corners and died jones sighed wish i had his confidence you think this thing is going to work do you chavasse said they challenged each other each mans thoughts unspoken jones broke first his face creasing into a smile i know one thing its certainly going to be an interesting night chapter the jetty at night was a lonely place a lantern on a sixfoot pole the sole illumination in its harsh light the leopard looked like less of a bargain than ever old and ugly like a whore who has seen better days caught without her makeup on mercier was there as was jacaud working on deck when the party from the running man arrived rossiter led the way carrying famias suitcase where the girl was concerned he was all solicitude helping her to the deck and handing her down the companionway the others followed chavasse and jones taking old hamid and mrs campbell between them in turn rossiter held chavasse back a hand on his sleeve a word before you go below something troubling you chavasse inquired politely your gun rossiter held out his hand no nonsense now theres a good chap chavasse shrugged produced the smith amp wesson and handed it over youre the boss for a few hours more now lets join the others he nodded to jacaud any time youre ready chavasse went down the companionway to the cabin and found the rest of them already seated on either side of a central table looking absurdly formal as if it were some kind of board meeting and they were waiting for the chairman jones pushed up to make room for him on the padded bench and smiled what kept you before chavasse could reply rossiter appeared he leaned on the end of the table his hands taking his weight ladies and gentlemen were about to commence the final leg of your journey if the weather holds and i can assure you that the forecast is a favorable one you will be landed approximately seven hours from now in a creek near a small village not far from weymouth on the english coast a member of our organization will be waiting there to take you on to london by road for the rest of the voyage i must ask you to stay in your cabin are there any questions no one spoke and he smiled youll find sandwiches through there in the galley if anyone feels hungry and a small stove on which you can make coffee ill see you later he left and almost immediately the engines coughed into life and the boat started to move chavasse peered out of the nearest porthole and saw mercier standing under the lantern on the jetty as the leopard moved out to sea he walked away and chavasse sat down again jones offered him a cigarette well what do you think now they seem to know what theyre up to chavasse leaned across to famia everything okay she smiled brightly fine just fine mr rossiter has been so kind he gives one such a feeling of confidence im sure everything is going to be all right now lets hope so chavasse leaned back the business with the smith amp wesson had given him something to think about there could well be some sinister motive behind it on the other hand it was perfectly possible that rossiter was simply taking every precaution not that it mattered for chavasse who had long ago learned by bitter experience never to leave anything to chance still had the walther ppk automatic which before leaving he had strapped to the inside of his left leg just above the ankle with a piece of surgical tape he sat back eyes halfclosed and watched cheung who was reading a book at the far end of the table on the opposite side next to mrs campbell chavasse wondered what it was and in the same moment remembered two things rossiters excellent chinese and the copy of the quotations of chairman mao tsetung he had seen in his room yes indeed the more he thought about it the more interesting mr cheung became with a love of the sea not unnatural in a man whose breton ancestors had been voyaging to the coast of newfoundland to fish long before columbus had discovered the new world chavasse had been running a thirtyfoot motor yacht out of alderney for eight years and knew the gulf of st malo and the general area of the channel islands like the back of his hand because of this he was able to keep a reasonably accurate check on their progress not only from an estimate of the boats speed but by direct observation of various lights that were familiar to him although the weather remained fair the boat pitched considerably in the turbulence common to the area because of the great tidal surge that drives in through the channel islands raising the level of the water in the gulf by as much as thirty feet both hamid and mrs campbell were suffering from seasickness in spite of the pills that rossiter had handed round at the inn before leaving and the old man didnt look at all well it wasnt just the pitching of the leopard that was causing the trouble there was an allpervading stench of fuel that seemed to have gotten steadily worse for the last hour chavasse looked out of the porthole as they rounded hanois lighthouse on the western tip of guernsey he told jones a clear run from here shouldnt take more than a couple of hours if the weather holds jones made a wry face much more of this and ill be sick myself that fuel sure stinks chavasse said in a low voice im not too happy about it think ill go on deck and have a word with our friend the door at the top of the companionway was locked he hammered on it with his clenched fist after a while it opened and rossiter peered in what do you want were getting one hell of a whiff of fuel down here chavasse told him old hamids been sick several times now he doesnt look too good rossiter crouched down and sniffed a frown appeared on his face i see what you mean better bring him up for a breath of air while i get jacaud to check the engine jones and chavasse took the old man up the companionway between them there was a fair sea running and a strength three wind if chavasse was any judge but the old boat was coping nicely the masthead light swung rhythmically from side to side jacaud crouched beside the bow hatch which gave access to the engine he disappeared from view and chavasse left jones to look after hamid and crossed to the open hatch there was only four feet of headroom inside and jacaud had to squat at the bottom of the short ladder while fumbling for the light switch in the dark he found it and in the sudden illumination the trouble was plain enough to see for an inch or so of fuel slopped around his feet he edged forward and disappeared from view reappearing almost immediately how bad is it chavasse asked as he came up the ladder jacaud ignored him replaced the hatch and went aft to the wheelhouse chavasse returned to jones who stood at the rail with an arm around hamid what gives jones demanded chavasse shrugged jacaud wasnt exactly forthcoming id say he has a leak in the fuel tank quite correct rossiter joined them a match flaring in his cupped hands as he lit a cigarette as it happens we have auxiliary tanks that carry enough fuel for the entire trip in themselves jacaud has switched over to them i think youll find that things will improve very quickly now do we have to return below chavasse asked one of you can stay up here with the old man for another ten minutes or so he should be all right again by then he went back into the wheelhouse and chavasse turned to jones you okay here sure goodthen ill go below and see how the others are getting on when he went down the companionway to the saloon the smell of fuel still lingered but it was nowhere near as strong as it had been earlier mrs campbell looked pale and wan but famia seemed fine and cheung leaned back in his seat eyes closed hands folded across his chest chavasse glanced out of the porthole above his head in the distance the greenandred navigation lights of a ship following the steamer lane that ran upchannel from ushant disappeared as if a curtain had dropped into place he peered out frowning and there was a step on the companionway jones eased old hamid into a seat and grinned not too good out there now mist coming in off the water and its started to rain again at that precise moment the boat was rocked by a muffled explosion mrs campbell screamed as she was thrown halfacross the table and chavasse fetched up against the far wall as he picked himself up the leopard came to a dead halt and started to drift chavasse hammered on the door of the companionway it opened almost at once and rossiter peered in a gun in his hand his face had turned very pale the eyes glittered and yet the gun didnt waver in the slightest back you go dont be a damn fool chavasse said if theres trouble weve got a right to know about it when im good and ready rossiter pushed him back and slammed the door whats wrong up there jones demanded it certainly didnt sound too healthy to me in the stress of the moment his accent had undergone a surprising transformation replaced by the kind of faultless clipped english common to the products of the english public school system mrs campbell was sobbing hysterically and famia was trying to comfort her old hamid seemed to have come to life in some strange way and was on his feet an arm around both women it was cheungs reaction that was the most interesting no panic no hysterics he sat at the table face expressionless eyes watchful chavasse unscrewed one of the portholes and peered out there was a smell of burning and rossiter and jacaud were arguing in french just above his head its no good i tell you jacaud cried and there was panic in his voice the old tub has had it how far from the coast are we rossiter demanded five or six milesmaybe seven goodwell continue in the rubber boat get it over the side our friends at fixby can run us back to saint denise the rest of the conversation was blown away on the wind and chavasse turned to face jones who knelt on the seat beside him whats going on jones demanded from what they say the leopards had it theyre talking about going the rest of the way in the rubber boat can it be done i dont see why not its about six miles to the coast and theyve got a good outboard motor on that thing of course theres only room for four passengers but i shouldnt think that will present much of a problem to rossiter the door to the companionway was flung open with startling suddenness and rossiter appeared the gun in his hand he waved it at chavasse and jones right sit down and stay down they did as they were told chavasse leaned across the table and groped for the butt of the walther ppk that was strapped to his leg above the ankle rossiter nodded to famia all right miss nadeem on deck she shook her head complete bewilderment on her face but i dont understand the mask of calmness cracked into a thousand pieces he grabbed her roughly by the arm and cried wildly you want to die do you he pushed her up the companionway go onget on deck mrs campbell sagged into her seat as famia stumbled out of sight and chavasse said what do we do go down with the ship singing abide with me rossiter ignored him and spoke to cheung in rapid chinese on deck quickly the boat is sinking the chinese man pushed past hamid and mrs campbell and chavasse leaned across the table his hand fastening around the butt of the walther ive certainly got to give it to you rossiter it must have taken nerve to see harvey preston off the way you did but this is even better four at one go rossiter turned and fired blindly and in a kind of reflex action the bullet splintering the bulkhead behind chavasse and a foot to one side mrs campbell screamed again chavasse sent jones to the floor with a shove in the back and brought the walther up fast the bullet caught cheung on the side of the face gouging a bloody furrow across one cheek chipping wood from the doorpost as it went on its way cheung didnt utter a sound he spun round and flung himself up the companionway and rossiter fired three shots wildly chavasse went under the table as the echoes died away the door was slammed shut and the bolt clicked he got to his feet and found jones already on his way to the companionway chavasse got to him just in time and dragged him back as two more shots came through the door wait manwait he was expecting one of us to do that chavasse said they flattened themselves against the wall on either side of the companionway and jones said softly you know your business ill say that for you chavasse grinned you dont do too badly yourself for a barrister jones showed no surprise at all you know who i am darcy morgan preston age twentynine profession barrister in practice in jamaica since august married two children youre trying to find out what happened to your brother harvey and you know our friends put him over the side wrapped in about six pounds of anchor chain darcy preston straightened and moved away from the wall his face sagging at the same moment the outboard motor coughed into life outside lets go chavasse said and jumped into the companionway he fired four times splintering the wood around the lock raised his right foot and stamped hard the door swung back and he went through to the deck crouching he was already too late the sound of the outboard fading into the darkness and mist chapter nice people darcy preston said quietly now what do we do there was a sudden hiss as if gas were escaping and a cloud of steam billowed from the engineroom hatch the stern was already low in the water and the leopard wallowed sluggishly hardly lifting as the swell undulated across the sea there was a sudden exclamation from the companionway and when chavasse turned old hamid was standing there in the diffused yellow light from the masthead lamp he looked about a hundred years old he didnt seem afraid in the slightest when he spoke they have gone mr chavasse they have left us to drown not if i can help it chavasse told him hows mrs campbell not too good im afraid chavasse turned to preston get her up on deck and see if you can find some liquor jacaud liked his rum so there must be a few bottles around make her drink as much as you possibly can anything to calm her down ill see what i can find up here and hurry for gods sake we havent got long he found three life jackets in a locker in the wheelhouse and passed one to hamid the old man started to unbutton his overcoat and chavasse shook his head keep that on whatever you do its going to be cold out there the old man pushed his arms through the straps and chavasse did a final deck check the only movable item that might support a persons weight was the aft hatch cover he got it off and eased it toward the rail as preston appeared with mrs campbell she looked ghastly in the yellow light eyes dark and fearful her body shrunken with terror chavasse could smell the rum preston was holding one bottle in his hand and there were two more under his arm he passed one across to chavasse stick that in your pocket it might come in handy chavasse gave him the two life jackets the best i can do and what about you theres an old cork life belt here that will keep me going now hurry it up weve only got a few minutes suddenly it seemed very quiet the rain falling in dull steel lances through the light and they stood by the rail together ready to go the sea was already over the stern and slopped in across the deck in a green curtain chavasse glanced at his watch dawn in another hour were between five and six miles off the coast possibly less but the tide will start to go in fast soon and well go with it dont try to swimyoull tire quickly that way and lose body heatand dont try to take any clothes off that would be the worst thing you could do mrs campbell were going to put you on the hatch i want you to just lie still even if the water breaks over you the rest of us will hang on to the sides its important we try to stay togetherany questions the leopard gave a sudden lurch to one side and preston lost his balance and went into the water he surfaced and grabbed for the rail he even managed a smile we should do this more often better get the hatch over fast somehow i dont think the boat has much longer to live strange how one always thought of a boat as a living creature with a soul of its own swimming awkwardly the cork life belt under his armpits bumping the side of the hatch as he pushed hard chavasse glanced back and watched the leopard slide smoothly under the surface for a brief moment the greenandred navigation lights gleamed above the swell at the masthead and then they too were dimmed it was the darkness that was the real enemy not the cold though that was bad enough to begin with but after a while the body temperature adapted itself and the fact that they were all fully clothed helped considerably as chavasse knew it would but the darkness remained for quite some time and mrs campbell moaned continuously breaking into terrible fits of crying every so often that no one could do anything about gradually the dawn came with a kind of gray luminosity because of the mist visibility was no more than a hundred yards and chavasse noticed with some unease the freshening breeze cold on his left cheek and the whitecaps that were starting to appear all about them he turned to hamid who hung on to the hatch beside him the old man was well out of the water because of his life jacket but his turban was soaked his skin shrunken so that every bone showed are you all right can you hang on hamid nodded without replying and chavasse pulled his way round to the other side to darcy preston who gave him a tired grin give me montego bay any time this is no joke the wind is picking up chavasse said can you feel it itll push us inshore that much faster but things are going to get rough so watch out prestons mouth opened in a soundless cry chavasse turned and saw a graygreen wall of water coming in fast blocking out the sky there wasnt a thing he could do about it nothing anyone could do this time mrs campbell god help her didnt even get time to scream the wave lifted the hatch like a cork chip turned it over and smashed it down chavasse surfaced in a maelstrom of white water struggling for breath still buoyant thanks to the old life belt mrs campbell was twenty or thirty feet away darcy preston swimming after her hamid was over to the right and chavasse kicked out toward him the old man looked badly shaken he had lost his turban and his long irongray hair had come loose and floated on the water as he lay back obviously exhausted as chavasse reached him the wind tore a gap in the curtain of mist and he saw land low down on the horizon no more than a mile away at most so jacaud had been overcautious in his estimate either that or they had come in a damned sight faster than he had realized he turned toward preston who was still swimming after mrs campbell and shouted land no more than a mile preston raised an arm to signify that he understood and continued to swim after mrs campbell the curtain of mist dropped back into place chavasse reached the old man and pulled him close not much longer now i saw land hamid smiled wanly but seemed unable to speak chavasse got the bottle of rum out of his pocket and pulled the cork out with his teeth drink some of this he forced the old mans mouth open and poured hamid coughed halfchoked and pulled his head away it is against my religion he said with a gasp chavasse grinned allah will forgive you this once old man he said in urdu and swallowed the rest of the rum strangely enough the old mans only reaction to being addressed in his own language was to reply in the same tongue if i live it is because allah wills it if i am to dieso be it another halfhour and chavasse was really beginning to feel the cold he had taken off the belt of his raincoat and had used it to secure himself to hamid who floated beside him there was no sign of darcy preston or mrs campbellhadnt been for some time now old hamid was still eyes closed his face a death mask blue with cold chavasse slapped him a couple of times and the eyes opened to stare blankly a kind of recognition dawned the lips moved the words were only a whisper aliali is it you my son he asked in urdu yes my father it took everything chavasse had to make the correct reply not long now soon we will be home the old man smiled his eyes closed and suddenly a wave took them high into a sky of lead holding them above the water long enough for chavasse to see cliffs through driving rain no more than a couple of hundred yards away between them and the land lay wave after wave and white water crashing in to meet the distant shore from that moment they moved fast helpless in the grip of the current that carried them before it chavasse gripped the old man tightly as water broke over them and then another great wall of water green as bottle glass smashed down on them chavasse went deep too deep and found himself alone fighting for life like a hooked fish his life belt was gone old hamid was gone but strangely no panic touched him if he was to die he would die fighting there is a behavior pattern common to all animals and known to psychologists as the critical reaction a phrase that describes the fury with which any living creature will fight for survival when there is no other way either backed into a corner by his enemies or alone in a sea of white water as paul chavasse was now he broke surface sucked air into his lungs and went under again tearing at the buttons of his trench coat he got it off and then the jacket and came up for more air the shoes took a little longer probably because his feet were swollen from their long immersion in cold salt water but suddenly he was free of those too and swimming again his rage to live giving him strength drawn from that hidden reserve that lies dormant in every man and then his foot kicked sand and he went under again a wave took him forward across a great rounded boulder streaming with water and he found himself kneedeep in seaweed another wave bowled him over his fingers hooked across a rib of rock and he held on as the waters washed over him as they receded he staggered to his feet and stumbled across the rocks to the safety of a strip of white sand at the base of the cliffs he lay on his face gasping for air then forced himself to his feet hamidhe had to find hamid the sea was in his mouth his ears his throat it seemed to sing inside his head as he turned and picked his way through the rocks to the main beach he saw hamid at once thirty or forty yards away lying in the shallows the water breaking over him chavasse started to run calling out in urdu im coming hold on hold on stupid really the old man would be dead he knew that he dragged the body clear of the water turned it over and greatest of all miracles the old eyes opened hamid smiled all fatigue and pain washed from his face ali my son i knew you would come he whispered bless me now you are blessed old man hold my hand chavasse said in urdu blessed and thrice blessed go with allah the old man smiled contentedly his eyes closed and the life went out of him chavasse crouched there beside him for quite a while unaware of the cold staring blindly into space when he finally stood up darcy preston was waiting a few yards away watching him gravely like chavasse he was down to shirt and pants and his life jacket was gone there was a cut on his face another on his left arm what about mrs campbell chavasse asked preston shrugged i tried to catch her when that big wave split us all up but the current was too strong for me she was still floating when i last saw her she could still make it not that he believed thatneither of them did and chavasse said wearily okay lets get out of here arent we going to move him lets put it like this chavasse said the way things are at the moment it would make a lot more sense if you and i didnt hang around to be found with him if we take him higher up the beach theyll know someone put him there but what in the hell are we going to do preston demanded chavasse looked at his watch its a quarter to five we find the road and the nearest phone box i put through a call to my people then we get behind the nearest hedge and wait youll be on the way to london in an hour darcy preston shook his head well one things certain whatever else you are you cant be the police full marks chavasse said now lets get out of here and he turned and moved toward the cliffs through the gray morning chapter london montefioreenrico montefiore mallory turned from the window filling his pipe from an elegant leather pouch one of the richest men in europe though very few people have ever heard of him dosent like having his picture taken but youll find one or two in his file hes the kind of big financier whos almost gone out of style a shadowy figure somewhere in the background with his finger in so many pies you lose count and hellgate chavasse asked what about that mallory shook his head doesnt mean a thing as i recall montefiore has a place on lake lucerne and a palazzo in venice actually hes rather dropped out of sight during the past three or four years he shook his head this doesnt make any kind of sense at all why on earth would a man of montefiores background be mixed up in a thing like this there was a knock at the door and jean frazer came in she handed mallory an envelope more material from s sir courtesy of the cia china section she went out and mallory opened the envelope and took out several record cards each with a photo pinned to it better look at these paul see if anyone strikes a chord cheung was number five only his name was ho tsen and he was a colonel in the army of the peoples republic of china it was an excellent likeness and chavasse passed it across thats our boy mallory checked through the card and nodded a slight frown on his face quite a character one of their best men from the looks of this rather stupid to pass him off as a military attache in paris for three years the cia was bound to catch on to him the telephone buzzed and he picked it up and listened for just over a minute when he replaced the receiver he looked thoughtful that was travers calling in from this place fixby its a little village on a creek near weymouth theres a brokendown boatyard just outside it run by a man named gorman hes missing at the moment last seen moving out to sea at about six this morning in a thirtyfoot launch he uses to take people biggame fishing chavasse looked at his watch and saw that it was almost noon theyll be almost there by now if the weather holds saint denise mallory nodded yes im inclined to agree with you and our friend from the peoples republic will have returned with them if im any judge for one thing hes going to need some kind of medical attention and for another he wont want to hang around now that things have turned sour very practical people the chinese what about rossiter mallory picked up a flimsy and examined it now he really is an amazing character i cant get over him stoneyhurst a double first at cambridge five years at the english college in rome and then korea the chinese had him for four yearsfour years behind the wire that must have been hell remembering his own experiences in a similar position for only a week chavasse nodded you can say that again but why did he throw up holy orders what was the given reason difficult to discover the church doesnt exactly fall over itself to discuss this sort of thing however ive pulled a few strings and theyve reluctantly given me the address of a priest who was in captivity with rossiter his parish is right here in london which is convenient chavasse examined the card mallory passed across father henry da souza portuguese which would probably turn out to mean that his family had been living in england for at least five hundred years was there ever the slightest suggestion that rossiter had turned red mallory shrugged anything is possible in this worst of all possible worlds dear boy they certainly did a good job on him of course a priest has something to hang on to something to fight them with having said that theres no question that ministers held by the chinese for a period and later released have sometimes needed psychiatric help on their return thats how complete the brainwashing process has been theyve done research into it at harvard i understand anyway you go and see father da souza and see what you can get out of him what about darcy preston no problem there as long as he behaves himself and keeps his mouth shut well put him on a plane for jamaica tomorrow is it all right if he stays at my place in the meantime i dont see why not mallory shook his head saint pauls by day and soho by night what a strange mixedup life that boy must have had chavasse got to his feet he seems to have survived it well ill be in touch later this afternoon he was halfway to the door when the phone buzzed again mallory called him back with a gesture and picked up the receiver he put it down again with a sigh the body of a middleaged woman wearing a life jacket was pulled out of the sea off weymouth by a fishing boat an hour ago paul im sorrydamned sorry especially in view of what you told me so am i chavasse said and went out quietly murder in his heart the church of the immaculate conception was not far from the east india docks an area that was anything but salubrious chavasse parked his car on the opposite side of the road and switched off the engine he took a cigarette from his case and offered one to darcy preston graham mallory would hang draw and quarter me if he knew id brought you along on the other hand he did tell me to keep an eye on you and i cant very well be in two places at once you could try but i wouldnt recommend it preston said and he got out of the car the church backed onto the river a small rather grimy pseudogothic building of a kind that had been built extensively during a certain period of the nineteenth century they went in through a porched entrance to a place of candles and shadows incense and quiet peace it was empty except for the man who knelt by the altar rail in a priests cassock white hair flaming like a halo in the candlelight chavasse crossed himself and dipped a knee instinctively although he had not practiced his religion for years and they moved down the aisle the priest got to his feet and was about to go toward the vestry when he saw them and paused smiling faintly can i help you gentlemen his eyes were those of a man who loved the whole world a rare enough breed a bad scar ran from the right eye into the hair but otherwise he had a face as calm and untroubled as that of a twoyearold child father da souza my name is chavasse i believe you were expecting me this is mr preston an associate ah yes father da souza nodded something to do with leonard rossiter wasnt it he smiled why dont we go outside its rather pleasant at the moment at the rear of the church a cemetery ran down to the thames spiked railings fringing a low wall there was plenty of activity on the river and the priest had been rightit was pleasant in the pale sunshine he sat on a tombstone and accepted a cigarette from chavasse this is nicevery nice i often come out here to think you know somehow it has the right atmosphere he bent his head to the match preston held out to him and leaned back with a sigh of content now then what was it you wanted to know about leonard before we go any further father i think i should make it clear that this is a serious business and highly confidential in fact a matter of national security da souza didnt seem perturbed in the slightest go on would you say it was possible that leonard rossiter had turned communist father da souza examined the end of his cigarette with a slight abstracted frown and sighed as a matter of fact i shouldnt think there was much doubt about it i see have you ever spoken of this to anyone before no one ever asked me chavasse nodded all right father tell me all you can i was sent to work in korea just after the second world war i was taken prisoner by north korean forces a few days after the korean war started and rossiter oh i didnt meet leonard for quite some timenine months later when i was moved to a special camp in manchuria an indoctrination center run by the chinese and you think rossiter was brainwashed there father da souza laughed gently good heavens it isnt as easy as that you know they have an extraordinarily simple technique and yet it works so very often the original concept is pavlovian a question of inducing guilt or rather of magnifying the guilt that is in all of us shall i tell you the first thing my instructor asked me gentlemen whether i had a servant at the mission to clean my room and make my bed when i admitted that i had he expressed surprise produced a bible and read me that passage in which our lord speaks of serving others yet here was i allowing one of those i had come to help to serve me extraordinary how guilty that one small point made me feel but your faith father preston said wasnt it of any help at all the old priest smiled beautifully my son my faith was triumphant it overcame all odds in spite of everything that was attempted with me i have never felt more certain of god than i did during those dark days and rossiter chavasse said what about rossiters faith the old priest looked genuinely troubled i am in a difficult position here gentlemen i was leonards confessor at nom bek and he mine the secrets of the confessional are sacred let me say that he had problems long before he fell into communist hands from their point of view he was fruit that was ripe for the picking what kind of problems if i may use marxian terminology each man has his thesis and his antithesis for a priest his thesis is everything he believes in everything he and his vocation stand for his antithesis on the other hand is his darker sidethe side that is present in all of us fears and hates violence aggression the desires of the flesh leonard rossiter was racked by guilt long before the instructors at nom bek got to work on him but why did he give up holy orders the official explanation was that he had experienced a crisis of faiththat he could no longer continue this happened three or four years after his return but you think hed fallen for the party line father da souza nodded i think it seemed to offer him what he was searching fora strong faitha faith that would support him you say seemed to offer him father darcy preston said father da souza smiled gently one thing i can tell you with certainty leonard rossiter is a soul in torment he is like the man in thompsons poem pursued endlessly by the hound of god fleeing from the one certain hope of salvation hellbent on destruction because of his own selfloathing chavasse nodded slowly thats all father i think youve made your point i hope ive been of help a pleasure gentlemen he shook hands and they left him there on the cracked tomb finishing his cigarette quite a man darcy preston said as they got into the car and then some mallory listened to what he had to say a strange abstracted look on his face ive spoken to nato intelligence since you were last here about montefiore mallory nodded its curiously disturbing paul they havent got a thing on him now that worries methat really does worry me i wouldnt mind knowing that he was the most dangerous double agent in the game as long as one had a hint but this whole situation smells to high heaven how do you see it chavasse stood up and paced backward and forward across the room lets take the two most important strands colonel ho tsena very dangerous chinese agentand leonard rossiter who seems to have fallen for the party line during his captivity that still leaves us with the most puzzling bit of all why should a multimillionaire financier like enrico montefiore help to further the cause of militant chinesestyle communism and theres another pointthe immigration racket so amateurish all right so rossiters organization is amateurish as you say but the chinese dont have a great deal of choice when it comes to friends and allies theyve only got one toehold in europe rememberalbania its always possible that they just havent realized how secondrate rossiters organization is you could be right chavasse admitted they certainly cant afford to be too choosy any kind of a contact in the european market is better than nothing i suspect that might be the way they looked at it and they can be naive people are always telling us that we dont understand asians that may be true but they certainly dont understand us any better mallory sat there staring into space for perhaps thirty seconds then he nodded right paul its all yours find themall three of them ho tsen rossiter and montefiore id like to know what its all about but the most important thing is to bring them to a stop a dead stop naturally seek and destroy i cant see any point in taking half measures its completely your baby from now on use the usual communication system whenever possible to keep me informed see jean on your way out about money anything else chavasse nodded the man youve got keeping an eye on this bloke gorman at fixbypull him off youre going down there yourself it would seem as good a place as any to start mallory reached for the phone ill see to it now good luck jean frazer glanced up as chavasse emerged you look pleased with yourself i am chavasse helped himself to a cigarette from the box on her desk the eyes were like black glass in the dark celtic face he looked like the devil himself and for some reason she shivered what is it paul im not too sure he said its been a long time since i felt like this like what personally involved in something me paul chavasse not just the bureau im thinking of an old man on his back on a south coast beach this morning who only wanted to see his son and a fussy little woman who died alone utterly terrified a silly stupid little woman who never hurt anyone in her life he sighed heavily and stubbed out his cigarette i want revenge jean for the first time i want to take care of someone permanently for personal reasons its a new sensation what worries me is how happy i feel about the prospect he parted from darcy preston with regret for he had come to like the brilliant sardonic jamaican and not only because of what they had been through together as he packed one or two things darcy sat on the window seat and watched he was wearing a pair of chavasses slacks a polo neck sweater and a sports jacket in donegal tweed sure youre okay for cash chavasse asked as he locked his suitcase darcy nodded i still have a bank account here chavasse buttoned an old naval bridge coat that gave him a rather nautical air i dont suppose ill be seeing you again by this time tomorrow youll be on your way to sunny jamaica land of carefree calypso and shantytowns give me birmingham any day darcy grinned and what about you where do you start at this place fixby good a place as any the jamaican held out his hand this is it then good luck paul and next time you see rossiter give him one for me preferably with your boot chavasse had the door halfopen when darcy spoke again just one thing its been eating away at me so ive got to ask why did they kill harvey that way i can only guess they were probably in danger of being boarded in a manner of speaking they were destroying the evidence darcy preston actually laughed you know something thats really ironic thats exactly what the blackbirders did with their slaves in the old days when the royal navy was on their tailput them over the side in chains he laughed again but this time there were tears in his eyes and chavasse closed the door and left him there alone with his grief in the quiet room chapter fixby was a village in decline the sort of place that had enjoyed a mild prosperity when fishing was still an economic proposition but not now the young ones had left for the big city and most of the cottages had been taken over by town dwellers seeking a weekend refuge chavasse had himself driven to weymouth in a bureau car and completed his journey on the local bus it was four oclock in the afternoon when it deposited him in fixby where he was the only passenger to alight the single street was deserted and the pub in strict adherence with the english licensing laws had its door firmly shut he moved past it and continued toward the creek one hand pushed in the pocket of his old bridge coat a slim leather locked briefcase swinging from the other the boatyard wasnt hard to find a ghost of a place a graveyard of hopes and ships beached like dead whales somber in the rain there was an office of sorts a decaying clapboard house behind there didnt seem to be anyone about and he moved toward the jetty a seagoing launch was moored there a trim craft if ever hed seen one she was rigged for biggame fishing with a couple of swivel chairs fitted to the stern deck and a steel hoist she was a beautiful ship there was no doubt about thata jewel in a jungle of weeds he stood there looking at her for quite a while then turned away a man was standing watching him from the shadow of an old barge he was very tall and thin and dressed in an old reefer jacket peaked cap and greasy overalls his face was his most remarkable feature it was the face of a judas one eye turned into the corner the mouth like a knife slash a face as repulsively fascinating as a medieval gargoyle admiring her are you his voice was hardly more than a whisper and as he approached chavasse noticed a jagged scar that stretched from his right ear to his windpipe shes quite a boat and then some steel hull penta engine radar echo sounder all that and thirtyfive knots you know boats a little are you gorman thats right what can i do for you id like to take a little trip if your boat is available fishing gorman shook his head too late in the day i was thinking of more than that chavasse said the fact is i want to get across the channel in a hurry and a friend of mine told me you might be able to oblige at a price gorman looked down the creek whistling softly who is this friend he asked after a short pause chavasse managed to look suitably embarrassed to tell you the truth he wasnt really a friend just a bloke i met in a bar in soho he said that any time i wanted to get out of the country in a hurry you were a good man to see gorman turned abruptly and spoke over his shoulder as he walked away come up to the office its going to rain chavasse went after him and mounted the rickety wooden stairs to the verandah at the top he paused and turned his head sharply aware of some kind of movement down among the derelict boats a dog perhaps or a rabbit but it left him with a vague unease as he went into the office the place was cluttered with odds and ends of every description gorman cleared the table with a sweep of an arm and produced a bottle of whiskey and two glasses so you want to get across the water pretty badly he said chavasse placed his case on the table and unlocked it he lifted a shirt and uncovered a thousand pounds made up of several neat bundles of english fivers and french francs it looked considerably more than it was and gormans bad eye rolled wildly chavasse took out two bundles of fivers and pushed them across thats how badly i want to get across gorman is it a deal gormans smile was so evil as to be almost seraphic he scooped up the cash and stowed it away in a battered wallet when do you want to leave the sooner the better as far as im concerned gorman smiled again that same seraphic smile then what are we waiting for he demanded and led the way out the boat was called the mary grant and she was every bit as good as she looked chavasse stood at the rail as they moved down the creek toward the open sea and took a few deep breaths of the salt air it was good to be on the move again even toward an unknown future in fact if he was honest with himself that accounted for a great deal of the fascination in his workquite simply the living from day to day not knowing what lay around the next corner waves started to slap against the hull with strange little hollow sounds that vibrated through the whole boat as they left the shelter of the creek and lifted to meet the channel swell he moved to the wheelhouse and paused in the doorway where were you thinking of putting me down anywhere you like gorman said youre the boss i was thinking of somewhere a little bit off the beaten track the gulf of saint malo or britanny i could move on to marseilles from there suits me gorman altered course a couple of points and chavasse said ill go below and get a little shuteye best thing to do could get a little rough in midchannel the glass is falling youll find coffee in the big thermos in the galley chavasse went below to the main saloon he was tireddamned tiredwhich was hardly surprising he found the thermos in the galley poured himself a cup and returned to the saloon he drank the coffee slowly going over the situation point by point there was nothing to be gained from a confrontation with gorman just yet that could come later quite suddenly his brain almost ceased to function god but he was tired he stretched out on the padded seat and stared up at the bulkhead the ribs in the roof seemed to undulate slowly like ripples on the surface of a pond and his mouth was strangely dry it was only in the final moment of his plunge into darkness that it occurred to his bemused brain that something might have gone wrong he surfaced slowly for the first few moments aware only of existing the saloon was in darkness that much was obvious and he was lying facedown on the padded seat he tried to move lost his balance and fell to the floor which was hardly surprising considering that his wrists were securely lashed behind his back the mary grant was still moving but as he tried to scramble to his feet the engines were cut and she started to drift there was a footstep on the companionway the light was switched on and gorman appeared he squatted so close that chavasse was aware of the stale smell of sweat from his unwashed body how are you then matey gorman patted his cheek whats the game chavasse demanded staying with his role for the time being i thought we had a deal gorman got up and opened the slim case which stood on the table he took out one of the packets of banknotes this is the game mateythe green stuff ive always had a feeling for it it makes me come out in goosebumps all over this little collection i like so much that i cant bear to be separated from any part of it okay chavasse said i wont give you any trouble just drop me off at the other end thats all i ask gormans laugh was something to be heard as he pulled chavasse to his feet and pushed him toward the companionway ill drop you off all right matey make no mistake about that right into the deep end it was cold on deck rain drifting down through the yellow light chavasse turned to face him gorman picked up a length of rusty anchor chain and chavasse said calmly who taught you that little trickrossiter it certainly brought gorman to a stop he glared at chavasse his eye rolling horribly and when he spoke his voice was the merest whisper who are you what is this its no good gorman chavasse told him flatly my people know where i am when i end up missing youll have some tall explaining to do he had completely miscalculated his man gorman gave a cry of rage and his arm went back to strike the length of chain cracking out like a leather whip it never landed a hand emerged from the shadows and wrenched the chain from his grasp gorman spun round and darcy preston stepped into the light gorman didnt mess about his hand went into his pocket and came out clutching a revolver but he made the mistake of firing too quickly the bullet plowed into the deckhouse and darcy went headfirst over the rail gorman peered into the dark waters and behind him preston pulled himself over the rail having swum under the keel there was only one possible weapon a longhandled gaff used for pulling in game fish which hung on the side of the wheelhouse in a spring clip as he pulled it free the clip twanged musically and gorman turned this time he went by the manual his arm swung up in a straight line as he sighted along the barrel with his good eye chavasse went for him shoulder down like a rugby forward sending him staggering against the rail the revolver discharged harmlessly and as gorman straightened aiming again darcy lunged with the gaff the point catching gorman in the right armpit he went over the rail backward with a cry by the time chavasse got there the dark waters had closed over his head hold out your hands darcy ordered and sliced through chavasses bonds with the edge of the razorsharp gaff chavasse turned massaging his wrists to restore the circulation now thats what i call a timely intervention is it permissible to inquire where in the hell you sprang from glad to oblige darcy said after youd left i thought about things for at least five minutes then went downstairs to the garage and helped myself to your car i left it at hurn airport and came the rest of the way by taxi i was actually in fixby before you they serve a very nice keg bitter in the local then what oh i hung around the boatyard awaiting events as they say i heard most of your conversation with gorman waited till youd gone into the office then came onboard and hid in the chain locker you certainly took your own sweet time about showing up or was that just your sense of the dramatic as a matter of fact i fell asleep didnt wake up till gorman started thumping around and making all that noise chavasse sighed all right what are you doing here its quite simple my brother was a criminal by every possible standard he was a thief and a gangster but he was good to me if i said that i loved such a man could you accept that perfectly chavasse told him gravely he didnt deserve to die that way paul he deserved many things in this life but not that when the time comes i am going to kill leonard rossiter personally we jamaicans are a religious people a proud people an eye for an eye the book says no more no less i will have rossiters life then for that is the just thing chavasse nodded soberly i respect your feelings i understand them but between the thought and the deed is often a very wide gap especially for a man like you i can kill when i have to quickly expertly and without a second thought because im a professional can you be that certain well have to see wont we fair enough ill get this thing moving you dry yourself well talk things over later the jamaican nodded and disappeared into the companionway chavasse went along the deck to the wheelhouse and started the engines they made a fine lovely sound and he pushed up the throttle and took the mary grant into the night with a burst of power i always wanted to be a boxer darcy said he leaned against the closed door of the wheelhouse a blanket around his shoulders a mug of tea in one hand almost invisible in the darkness what did harvey have to say to that darcy chuckled he argued in percentages and he certainly saw no percentage in that he always said a good fighter was a hungry fighter and i was anything but hungry mind you he indulged me up to a certain point i had lessons from some of the best pro fighters in the game he had an interest in a gym in whitechapel what made you choose the law with my background a hell of a lot of people found that one funny on the other hand i knew every crook in soho which came in useful when i started to practice you were constantly in demand something like that i cleared out after harveys trial because i realized i simply couldnt continue with the kind of double life i had been leading went out to jamaica and started over a good move thats where i met my wife time and chance chavasse said as i told your mr mallory harvey got a letter to me detailing what he intended to do when he didnt turn up friends notified me and i decided to follow in his footsteps it seemed the logical thing does your wife know darcy grinned she thinks im in new york on legal business he emptied his mug and put it on the map table and what about you how did you get into this kind of work time and chance again chavasse shrugged i have a language kink soak them up like water into a spongeno work in it at all i was lecturing in a provincial university and finding it pretty boring when a friend asked me to help him get his sister out of czechoslovakia it had a ring of adventure to it so i gave it a go and succeeded only just i was in an austrian hospital with a bullet in my leg when mallory came to see me and offered me a job that was twelve years ago any regrets its too late for regrets far too late now lets come back to the present and discuss what were going to do when we arrive at saint denise chapter brittany they made such excellent time that it was only ninethirty as they approached st denise there was a small bay with a deepwater channel marked on the chart about a quarter of a mile to the east and chavasse decided to give it a try he couldnt have made a better choice the bay was almost a complete circle no more than a hundred yards in diameter and guarded by high cliffs that gave excellent cover from the sea they dropped anchor and went below chavasse put his leather business case on the table opened it and tossed a couple of packets of francs across to darcy half for you half for me just in case you mean im getting paid too darcy stowed the money away in an inside pocket and chavasse pressed a hidden catch and removed the false bottom of the case to reveal an interior compartment expertly packed away inside were a smith amp wesson magnum revolver a walther ppk and a machine pistol darcy whistled softly what is this prohibition nothing like being prepared chavasse offered him the smith amp wesson guaranteed not to jam about the best manstopper i know he dropped the walther into his pocket replaced the false bottom in the case and stowed it away in a locker under the table and now for the most interesting act of the evening they rowed ashore in the fiberglass dinghy beached it and scaled the cliffs by means of a narrow path the sky was blueblack and every star gleamed like white fire there was no moon and yet a strange luminosity hung over everything giving them a range of vision much greater than might have reasonably been expected under the circumstances they made rapid progress through the scattered pines and soon came to a point from which they could look down into st denise there was a light here and there in the cottages and several in the downstairs windows of the running man how do you intend to play this thing darcy asked by ear chavasse told him strictly by ear lets see how many guests are at the party first they went down the hill scrambled across a fence and continued along a narrow country lane that soon brought them to the outskirts of the village here the cottages were spaced well apart each with its own small patch of ground under cultivation they passed the first house and as they approached the second darcy placed a hand on chavasses sleeve this is merciers place or did you know now that is interesting chavasse said softly lets take a look they moved across the cobbled yard and crouched by the window light reached out with golden fingers into the darkness and through a gap in the curtain they could see mercier sitting at the kitchen table head bowed a bottle of brandy and a tin mug in front of him he doesnt look too happy darcy said chavasse nodded didnt you say something about his wife being an invalid thats right hasnt been out of bed in four years then shes hardly likely to interfere if were quiet knock on the door and then get out of sight ill handle him mercier was slow in responding and his footsteps dragged strangely across the stone floor he opened the door and peered out took a step forward an anxious expectant look on his face chavasse touched the barrel of the gun to his temple one cry and youre a dead man mercier inside mercier moved backward and chavasse went after him preston close behind he closed the door and mercier looked from one to the other then laughed abruptly thisll be a surprise for jacaud he told me you were both dead where is he at the running man entertaining his cronies from the village and rossiter mercier shrugged they came back this morning just before noon in the englishmans boat that would be a man called gorman mercier nodded weve done a lot of business with him in the past hes always in and out of here what about the authorities in these parts monsieur mercier shrugged people mind their own business chavasse nodded what happened to rossiter and the others are they still at the running man mercier shook his head monsieur rossiter left just after noon in the renault he took the indian girl and the chinese man with him the chinese man was heavily bandaged about the face how did the girl look how would you expect her to look monsieur as beautiful as ever i dont mean that did she seem afraid at allafraid of rossiter mercier shook his head on the contrary monsieur she looked at him as if he were he seemed to have difficulty in finding the right word as if he were god darcy preston suggested something like that monsieur he was strangely calm and unafraid and the answers came readily chavasse let it go for the moment and carried on where did they go i havent the slightest idea come off it mercier you can do better than that try hellgate for a start and montefioredont tell me youve never heard of them of course monsieur i have heard those two names on several occasionssnatches of conversation between jacaud and monsieur rossiter but that is all to me they are names and nothing more he was speaking the truth chavasse was certain which didnt seem to make any kind of sense whats happened mercier he said softly youre a different man mercier turned without a word walked to a door opened it and stood to one side messieurs he said with a small hopeless gesture chavasse and preston moved to join him and looked into a small cluttered sitting room a plain wooden coffin rested on the table a candle at each end chavasse closed the door gently your wife mercier nodded not a day without pain for four years monsieur and yet she never complained although she knew there could be only one end i tried everything big doctors from brest expensive medicinesall for nothing that must have cost money mercier nodded how else do you think i came to be working for an animal like jacaud for my nanetteonly for nanette it was for her that i endured so much horror for her and her alone that i kept my mouth shut youre saying you went in fear of your life mercier shook his head no monsieur in fear for my wifes life of what that devil rossiter might do to her he made such threats to keep me quiet he had to monsieur particularly after a trip some weeks ago when i sailed on the leopard as a deckhand what happened then mercier hesitated and chavasse said let me tell you what happened after we left here last night the leopard went down in the channel did jacaud tell you that he said there had been an accident that the engine had exploded and that the rest of you had been killed he and rossiter left us to drown locked in the saloon chavasse said the woman and the old man died trying to swim ashore mercier looked genuinely shocked my god they are animals not men why only the other week monsieur on the occasion i was speaking of earlier we were sighted off the english coast by a british torpedo boat we had only one passenger at the timea special trip for some reason he turned to darcy a west indian like you monsieur prestons face had tightened and he looked ill what happened rossiter said wed get seven years if we were caught with him aboard he put him over the side wrapped in chainsand he was still alive still alive sometimes in my dreams i can still see the look in his eyes when rossiter put him over the rail darcy nodded blindly and he told you hed kill your wife if you didnt keep quiet thats right monsieur darcy turned abruptly wrenched open the door and went out mercier looked bewildered and chavasse said quietly his brotherhis brother mercier weve come to settle the account will you help us mercier took a reefer jacket from behind the door and pulled it on anything monsieur good this is what you will do wait by the running man and watch the harbor in a little while you will see the mary grant come in you know her of course monsieur gormans boat you will enter the running man and tell jacaud that gorman has returned and is waiting urgently for him down at the jetty make sure that other people hear you tell him this and afterward do you have a boat of your own mercier nodded an old whaleboat with a diesel engine goodwhen we leave the harbor we will go to a bay called penmarch you know it as i know every inch of this coast well wait for you there chavasse slapped him on the shoulder we will fix him our brave jacaud eh mercier merciers eyes glowed with fire the hatred of years boiling over and they went out together there were perhaps a dozen fishermen in the bar when mercier entered the running man and jacaud was holding court they pressed round eagerly as he poured red wine from an earthenware jug leaving a trail like blood across the counter while the old woman who worked for him looked on with a tight mouth free he roared everything on me in the morning ill be away and youll never see old jacaud again mercier had difficulty forcing his way through to the bar but when jacaud noticed him he greeted him effusively mercier old friend where have you been hiding his speech was slurred and he gave every appearance of being drunk mercier was instantly suspicious never having seen him the worse for liquor in his whole life ive got a message for you he said loudly from monsieur gorman several heads turned in interest and jacaud frowned instantly sober gorman he is here at the jetty he just came in on the mary grant jacaud put down the jug and nodded to the old woman its all yours he came round the bar and brushed past mercier lets go outside a slight wind moved in from the sea and stirred the pines did he say what he wanted is it trouble mercier shrugged why should he talk to me monsieur jacaud a person of no importance he told me nothing jacaud glared at him in surprise aware of a new belligerency in his tone but there was no time to investigate now at the end of the street mercier paused i leave you here monsieur you are going home thats right jacaud tried to inject a little friendliness into his voice ill drop in later if i may after ive seen what gorman wants id like to talk things over with you now that im leaving as you wish monsieur mercier faded into the night and jacaud continued on his way walking quickly without even the slightest hint of drunkenness in his manner if anything he was worried for he was not overendowed with intelligence rossiter had left him strict instructions as to what he was to do and gorman hadnt entered into them at all the mary grant waited at the jetty her engine whispering quietly he went down the ladder to the deck and paused uncertainly there was a movement in the wheelhouse and he went toward it quickly gorman he demanded hoarsely he reached the door and the heart in him seemed to stop beating for the face that stared coldly at him from the darkness disembodied in the light from the binnacle was one that he had never expected to see again in this life chavasse smiled gently come right in jacaud jacaud took a step back and the muzzle of a revolver touched him on the temple he turned his head involuntarily and found himself looking straight at darcy preston sweat sprang to his forehead cold as death and he started to shake for what he was seeing simply could not be he sagged against the wheelhouse door with a groan and the mary grant left the jetty and moved out to sea by the time they had anchored in penmarch bay jacaud no longer believed in ghosts only in miracles and a miracle was something that could happen to anyone his awe had been replaced by anger and he awaited his chance to strike it came when mercier arrived and tied up alongside in his old whaleboat preston went to catch the line he threw leaving chavasse in charge who suddenly seemed to get careless jacaud grabbed for the gun chavasse was holding and chavasse who had been anticipating just such a move swayed to one side and clouted him over the head the blow would have dazed any other man sent him to his knees for several minutes jacaud simply rolled on one shoulder came to his feet and dived for the rail darcy managed to get a foot under him just in time and jacaud went sprawling when he got to his feet he found preston taking off his jacket come on then jacaud he said lets see how good you are you black ape jacaud came in like a tornado great arms flailing hands reaching out to destroy and proceeded to get the thrashing of his life as darcy demolished him with a scientific exactitude that was awe inspiring in its economy the jamaican in action was something to see and hatred gave him an additional advantage jacaud landed perhaps three or four punches but everything else he threw only touched on air in return he was subjected to a barrage of punches that were devastating in their effect driving him to his knees again and again until a final right cross put him on his back he lay there sobbing for breath and darcy dropped to one knee beside him and now jacaud you will answer some questions quickly and accurately jacaud spat in his face chavasse pulled darcy up take a breather let me try he lit a cigarette we all hate you here jacaud the jamaican because you and rossiter drowned his brother the other week mercier because you dragged him down into the filth with you me because i dont like your smell youre an animalsomething from under a stoneand id no more hesitate to kill you than i would to step on a slug now that we know where we stand well try again where has rossiter gone jacauds reply was coarse and to the point chavasse stood up on your feet jacaud hesitated and mercier kicked him in the ribs you heard the gentleman jacaud got up reluctantly and chavasse tossed darcy a coil of rope tie his wrists jacaud didnt bother to struggle you can do what you like you wont make me talk ill see you in hell first he raved on for some time but chavasse ignored him and walked to the stern where the swivel seats were fastened to the deck for biggame fishing and the hoist and pulley were rigged ready to haul in tuna or shark lets have him down here darcy pushed jacaud forward and chavasse swung him around and looped his bonds over the hook on the end of the pulley line here what is this jacaud demanded chavasse nodded to the other two haul away as preston and mercier turned the winch handle between them jacauds feet left the deck and in a moment he was three feet up in the air he started to struggle kicking wildly and chavasse pushed the hoist out over the water jacaud hung there cursing and chavasse tried again ready to talk jacaud to hell with youto hell with all of you chavasse nodded darcy released the winch handle and jacaud disappeared beneath the surface chavasse gave him a full minute checking his watch carefully then nodded and darcy and mercier cranked him in jacaud hung just beyond the rail chest heaving as he sobbed for breath he started to cough then vomited chavasse gave him a moment to collect himself hellgate jacaud and montefiore i want to know about both of them jacaud cursed him kicking out wildly chavasse turned and nodded his face cold and the winch creaked again this time he made it one minute and a half and when jacaud appeared there was hardly any movement at all chavasse swung him in and after a while the great head lifted and the eyes opened hellgate he said with a croak its a house in the camargue near a village called chatillon monsieur montefiore owns it and thats where rossiter and the others have gone jacaud nodded weakly and montefiore is he there now i dont know ive never met him i only know what rossiter has told me why didnt you leave with the others rossiter wanted me to take care of mercierhe thought he knew too much and he wanted me to leave openly so that questions would not be asked i only had a lease on the inn its up in a couple of months anyway so i made it over to the old hag who works for me i told everyone i was leaving for corsica tomorrow that id been left a farm by a distant relative chavasse nodded slowly so you were to kill mercier jacaud started to cough then gave a strange choking cry his body heaved as if he were in pain and mercier and darcy lowered him to the deck quickly mercier dropped to his knees and put an ear against jacauds chest when he looked up his face was grave he is dead monsieur his heart has given out lets hope he told the truth then chavasse said calmly get the ropes off him and put him in the saloon he turned and darcy grabbed him by the arm is that all you can say for gods sake weve just killed a man one way or the other he was due for it chavasse said so cut out the hearts and flowers i havent got time he pulled free and went into the wheelhouse he was examining the chart when they joined him i need a nice deep channel he said to mercier deep enough for the mary grant to sink into without trace mercier sighed a pity monsieur shes a beautiful boat shes still got to go chavasse said where would you suggest mercier considered the chart for a moment or two then jabbed a finger at a group of rocks marked as dangerous about six miles out the pinnacles monsieur theyve taken plenty of ships in their time they stick up from a trench a thousand feet deep anything that goes down there will stay down believe me chavasse nodded thats it then you lead the way in the whaler ill follow go with him darcy ill stay with you chavasse shook his head no point this kind of job only needs one i said id stay darcys voice was bleak what i say i mean he moved into the prow and stood there with his hands in his pockets shoulders hunched i dont think he is too happy monsieur mercier commented which surprises me after all they did as much to his own brother which is exactly whats bothering him chavasse said he isnt a hunting animal mercier now lets get moving we havent much time the pinnacles were first observed as patches of white water in the distance as the boat approached the turbulence increased and chavasse was aware of great plumes of spray that blossomed in the night the pinnacles themselves were a scattered group of jagged rocks in some cases permanently awash and in others twenty or thirty feet above the waves when mercier whistled sharply and waved the agreed signal chavasse cut the engines and called to darcy who had been waiting by the forward hatch with a fire axe now he dropped inside and commenced to batter a series of holes in the prow when he reappeared she was already settling at that end and he was soaked to the skin chavasse unfastened a cork life belt bearing the ships name and tossed it overboard as mercier came alongside lost at sea he said sunk with all hands nobody will ever see jacaud again and gorman darcy asked what about him chavasse shrugged believe it or not but most people who take a dive into the channel dont turn up again even if somebody does find whats left of him after a few weeks itll all fit neatly you have a naturally tidy mind darcy said too complicated im a professional youre not its as simple as that the whaleboat closed in and they scrambled aboard mercier took her round in a wide circle and they watched the mary grant was well down by the head now her stern lifting out of the water when she went she disappeared so quickly that if any one of them had closed his eyes momentarily he would have missed it the waters rolled over and mercier opened the throttle and took the whaler away and now what darcy preston demanded dropping down on one of the wide seats shoulders hunched against the spray we catch a train chavasse said a train for marseilles if there is one or is it still we darcy nodded slowly ive gone too far now to step back you neednt worryill be behind you all the way fair enough chavasse turned to mercier take us to some quiet spot on the coast as near to saint brieuc as possible can you manage that certainly monsieur chavasse gave him a cigarette and held out a match in cupped hands about jacaud mercier there could be questions perhaps monsieur but i doubt it he was to leave in the morning most people will think he left a little earlier in any case he was seen to go out in the mary grant and where is the mary grant now perhaps in a few days that life belt will be found by a fishing boat or drift ashore somewhere and perhaps not henri jacaud never existed monsieur and you what will you do i will bury my wife mercier said simply chapter france the camargue it was just before midnight when they reached st brieuc by chance there was a train due out in fifteen minutes to rennes and chavasse decided to take it rather than hang about at rennes they had a delay of an hour and a half before the marseilles train and they spent it in a cafe just outside the station the jamaican was still brooding and had little to say for himself in the end chavasse had had enough its no good going on like this he said either we clear the air now or you drop out wouldnt that be a problem darcy said im not even in this country officially chavasse shook his head i can contact our paris office theyll get you out darcy looked genuinely troubled i dont know paul when i first got the idea of following you it seemed to make sense and especially later when i heard what theyd done to harvey i was bitter and angry i wanted revenge so that business with gorman i didnt mind that after all he was trying to kill you there was nothing else i could do but jacaud he shook his head that sticks in my throat if thats the way you feel then youd better leave chavasse told him rossiter drowned your brother like a rat and without a qualm he tried his hand at mass murder when the leopard went down and didnt do so badly when you remember what happened to mrs campbell and old hamid he wont hesitate to see the both of us off the moment he claps eyes on us and realizes were still in the land of the living this isnt the old bailey or the jamaican high court theres only one law herekill or be killedand ive had direct orders ho tsen rossiter and montefioretheyve all got to go the jamaican shook his head you know back there in the old days living with harvey in soho i met every kind of villain there was but youyoure in a class of your own which is why ive survived twelve years at this bloody game chavasse said now are you in or out the way i see it i dont really have much choice in the matter i know that once i get anywhere near rossiter if i dont get him first hell get me it goes against the grain thats all to accept that thats the way it is i had years of it in harveys particular junglei dont suppose a psychologist would have much difficulty in working out why i took to the law he sighed heavily but you can count on me paul i wont let you down good now i know where i am ill put a call through to our field agent in marseilles id like him to be ready for us when we arrive in the morning he stood up and darcy said this place the camarguewhat is it exactly the delta area at the mouth of the rhone chavasse told him about three hundred square miles of lagoons and waterways marshes white sand dunes and hot sun though this isnt the best time of the year for that its famous for three things white horses fighting bulls and flamingos i was there as a boy twenty years ago and ive never forgotten it but what in the hell are they doing in a place like that darcy demanded that remains to be seen doesnt it chavasse said and went to make his phone call jacob malik was polish by birth and had left the country of his origin for political reasons just before the outbreak of the second world war for a couple of years he had worked for the deuxieme bureau the old french secret service organization that had died in he had spent the war working with the british special operations executive acting as a courier to french resistance units an adventurous career had been brought to an end by an fln grenade through his hotel bedroom window during the algerian troubles he had retired to a small cafe on the marseilles waterfront with his moorish wife and three children he had been acting as bureau agent in that city for six years and chavasse had worked with him twice he was standing beside a renault station wagon leaning heavily on his walking stick when they emerged from the station a thin elegantlooking man with a spiked moustache who carried his sixty years well he limped toward them and greeted chavasse with enthusiasm my dear paul how wonderful to see you how goes it excellent chavasse took his hand warmly and nerida and your family blooming she still misses algiers but we could never go back i wouldnt last a week they have long memories those people chavasse introduced him to darcy and they all got into the renault and drove away it was warm and rather sultry the sun hidden from view by heavy gray clouds and yet there was that intense light common to marseilles dazzling to the eyes what have you arranged chavasse asked i gave the whole thing a great deal of thought after your phone call malik said at exactly four am i hit upon an idea of some genius though i say this with all due modesty to get into the camargue presents no problem to stay without being observed is impossible in three hundred square miles of lagoon and marsh chavasse said i dont follow oh the population is small enough mainly wild fowlers and a few cowboys who tend the young bulls and the horses that run wild in all parts of the area it is because of the sparseness of the population that it is difficult for outsiders to enter without it being known what you need is a legitimate reason for being there a reason that anyone who sees you will accept and youve found it birdwatching malik said simply darcy preston laughed out loud he cant be serious but i am malik looked slightly injured the camargue is famous for its wild birds particularly its colony of flamingos people come to study them from all over europe you know i think you might actually have something there chavasse said more than that my dear paul i have the equipment to go with it a small cabin cruiser and all the extras i could think of a rubber boat shooting jackets and waders binoculars a decent camera i checked with s in london and got the goahead it seemed pointless to waste time marvelous chavasse was aware of a sudden irrational affection for him and clapped him on the shoulder truly marvelous no need to overdo it paul for this kind of exercise i get a handsome feedouble if i assist in the field do you want to i know the camargue and you dont so it would seem sensible he smiled and you really have no idea how boring life is these days a little action would definitely be good for my soul thats settled then chavasse turned to darcy who was sitting in the rear nothing like some organization oh im impressed darcy said id be even more so if someone could remember to fill my belly within the next couple of hours its contracted so much its beginning to hurt that too i have arranged monsieur malik said my cafe is a stones throw from the harbor there my wife will reluctantly provide you with bouillabaisse simply because its the local speciality but if you have sense you will choose her stuffed mutton and rice and earn her eternal friendship lead on thats all i ask darcy said and malik swung the renault from one line of traffic to the next narrowly missing a bus and turned into a narrow side street leading down to the harbor the stuffed mutton and rice was everything malik had promised and afterward they went down to the old harbor parked the renault and walked along a stone jetty there were boats of all shapes and sizes riding at anchor and scores of dinghies and tenders of every description were tied close to the jetty they went down the steps and malik hauled in a sixman yacht tender chavasse did the rowing and under orders threaded his way through the crowded harbor until they fetched alongside a twentyfoot fiberglass cabin cruiser powered by an outboard motor she was named lalouette and was painted white with scarlet trim darcy climbed aboard then turned to give malik a hand chavasse followed after tying up the tender the cabin was small the two padded side benches making up into beds at night the only other accommodation was a lavatory and a small galley malik sat down with a sigh produced a thin black cheroot and lit it and now to business youll find a map in that locker paul as well as a false bottom under which are a couple of machine pistols and half a dozen grenades it seemed like a good idea the map unfolded to show the camargue in detail and not only the several mouths of the rhone but every lagoon every sandbank every waterway you cant go too much by this malik said the action of the tide and the current from the river combine pretty forcefully a sandbank can be there one day and gone the next and some of the waterways can silt up just as quickly we shouldnt have too much trouble though lalouette only draws two or three feet and hellgate have you managed to pinpoint it on the map darcy asked indeed i have see just a little on the marseilles side of the pointe du norde three or four miles inland is the village of chatillon hellgate is marked there a couple of miles northeast of the village chavasse found it at once an island in a lagoon that was shaped like a halfmoon have you managed to find out anything of the place or montefiore naturally ive been mainly restricted to marseilles because of the time element but ive managed to produce some useful information the house is about seventy years old built in the nineties by a russian novelist called kurbsky who didnt like the czar and made it obvious his novels had quite a vogue at the time in america and europe generally and he became a wealthy man he came across the camargue on a visit to a bull farm in the area and decided to stay he had the house built where it was because he had an obsession with privacy its a wooden building and very russian in style what happened to him he returned home after the revolutiona grave error he didnt like lenin any more than he did the czar only this time he couldnt get out he died in or was killed off none of this required any genius by the way there is an excellent library in marseilles i had a friend in the provincial landrecords office telephone through to arles to see who owns the place now it was used as a base by german troops during the war afterward it was empty until four years ago when it was purchased by someone named leduc leduc chavasse frowned that was the name on the register chavasse nodded slowly all right id better fill you in on the details then you know where you stand when he had finished malik looked thoughtful a strange business this man rossiter for example on the one hand a bungling amateur who leaves himself wide open on the other a ruthless coldblooded killer without the slightest scruples and ho tsen nastyvery nasty whats a real pro doing mixed up with people like that thats what weve got to try and find out chavasse said although ive got my own ideas on that subject you know how difficult it is for the chinese where espionage is concerned the russians dont have anywhere near the same trouble because they can pass off their own people as nationals of most other countries the chinese obviously cant do that which explains why theyre willing to use a man like rossiter amateur or no amateur mind you that still doesnt explain how someone like montefiore fits in malik nodded and what happens afterward eliminationtotal and absolute and the girl darcy put in what about her if we can we get her out but only if we can exactly now lets get going with most of the afternoon left we can get a hell of a lot done before nightfall agreed jacob malik nodded ill take her out of the harbor i know what im doing with this engine we should make it in a little over three hours allowing for the weather of course which i must say doesnt look too good he went out on deck and chavasse followed him he stood at the rail looking back at marseilles as they moved out to sea an old citythey had all been here phoenician greek roman beyond cape croisette the sky was dark and ominous and as they lifted to meet the swell from the open sea rain spotted the deck in great heavy drops from the sea the camargue was a line of sand dunes drifting into the distance and as they moved in great banks of reeds and marsh grass lifted out of the water as if to greet them with them came the heavy pungent odor of the marshes compounded of salt and rotting vegetation and black gaseous mud a smell that hinted at a darker more primeval world a place that time had bypassed the bad weather had not developed as expected and the rain had held off except for intermittent showers as they moved in toward the land malik once more took the wheel and chavasse and darcy stood at the rail a half dozen white horses stood on a sandbank and watched them as they went by and beyond hundreds of flamingos paced through the shallows setting the air aflame with the glory of their plumage what happens now paul malik asked do we stop at the village or keep going no harm in calling in chavasse said you can visit the local store see what you can find out darcy and i had better stay in the background just in case all right malik nodded to pass through without stopping would probably engender an unhealthy interest about our identity and business anyway small communities are the same the world over and chatillon was certainly that two primitive wooden jetties standing just out of the water an assortment of small boats and a couple of dozen houses malik took lalouette to the extreme end of one of the jetties and chavasse tied up darcy stayed below the pole limped away and chavasse lounged in the stern fiddling with a fishing rod part of the general equipment malik had provided there didnt seem to be a great deal of activity on shore about fifty yards away a man worked on a boat and two old men sat on the other jetty mending wildfowling nets malik returned in fifteen minutes carrying a paper bag loaded with various provisions typical french provincials he said as chavasse helped him over the rail suspicious as hell of all strangers but wanting to know every last detail of your business and what did you tell them that i was from marseilles with a friend to do some birdwatching and a little fishing as i told you before they get people like that in here all the time and they accepted your story completely it was an old woman in her seventies and her idiot son i got out the map and asked her where there was a good place to tie up for the night which gave me an excuse to put my finger on hellgate amongst other places what was her reaction nothing very exciting its private nice people but they dont encourage visitors fair enough chavasse said lets get moving itll be dark soon thunder rumbled menacingly in the distance and malik pressed the starter as chavasse cast off darcy didnt come on deck until they were well away from the village and proceeding along a narrow channel reeds pressing in on either hand chavasse scrambled up on top of the cabin and opened the map at first it was relatively simple to chart a course but it became progressively more difficult the deeper into the marshes they went they had deliberately avoided staying with the principal waterway that gave direct access to hellgate and kept to the northeast so that in the end they were approaching it from the rear it was almost dark when they turned into a small lagoon and he called softly okay well make this do malik cut the motor and darcy heaved the anchor over the side into eight or nine feet of water suddenly it was quiet except for the croaking of bullfrogs and the occasional stirring of a bird in the thickets how far darcy asked quarter of a mile no more chavasse said well go on in the rubber boat at first light and take a look at the place an interesting prospect malik said oh it should be that all right above them thunder cracked the sky wide open and as darkness fell rain fell with it in a sudden drenching downpour that sent them running to the shelter of the cabin hellgate it was a cold gray world that chavasse stepped into when he went on deck at fourthirty on the following morning rain hammered into the waters of the marsh with a thousand voices and yet life stirred out there in the gloom birds called and wild geese lifted into the rain he was wearing waterproof nylon waders and a hooded anorak and a pair of binoculars hung around his neck darcy preston joined him wearing a similar outfit and was followed by malik who sheltered under a large black umbrella the last place god made the pole shuddered id forgotten there was such a time of day good for the soul jacob chavasse hauled in the dinghy we shouldnt be longa couple of hours at the most i just want to size things up thats all just make sure you know how to find your way back malik said its not too easy in a place like this darcy preston took the oars and pulled away and in a few moments lalouette had faded into the murk chavasse used the map and compass and charted a course for hellgate that took them in a straight line through mud and reeds and narrow waterways penetrating deeper and deeper into a lost world this is how it must have seemed at the beginning of time darcy said nothings changed there was a rustle in the reeds on their left they parted and a young bull plowed through he stopped in the shallows and watched them suspiciously just keep going chavasse said thats a fighting bull with a pedigree as long as your arm they dont take kindly to strangers darcy pulled harder and the bull faded from view i certainly wouldnt like to be on foot with one of those things on my tail he said what in the name of good sense are they doing running around loose this is where they raise them this is bull country darcy they just about worship the damn things were the interlopers not the bulls they emerged into a large lagoon and the towers of the house loomed out of the mist fifty yards away chavasse made a quick gesture and darcy pulled into the shelter of the reeds on the right there was a patch of high ground beyond and they beached the dinghy and got out chavasse crouched and focused the binoculars as malik had said the house was very russian in style and constructed of wood with a fourstory tower at each end and a verandah at the front the whole was surrounded by pine trees that had probably been specially planted when it was first built but what had originally been the garden was now an overgrown jungle there was something curiously false about the place it was too much like the real thinga film set for a hollywood version of a chekhov play chavasse couldnt see the landing stage which presumably was on the other side from an approach point of view the house couldnt have had a better strategic situation the lagoon was halfmoon shaped and about a hundred yards wide and two hundred long there was no possibility of an approach under cover during daylight he passed the binoculars to darcy what do you think the jamaican had a look and shook his head i dont see how anyone could get any closer during daylight without being spotted at that moment a dog barked and two men came running round the corner of the house they jumped into view when chavasse focused the binocularstwo chinese men each clutching an assault rifle the dog joined them a moment later an alsatian who ran backward and forward rooting in the undergrowth i dont know what hes looking for but he wont get much of a scent in this rain thats for certain darcy said i wouldnt be too sure chavasse watched intently through the binoculars it takes a lot to fool a german shepherd there was a sudden commotion over on the right a heavy splashing as something forced its way through the reeds at first chavasse thought it might be another bull but he pulled out the walther ppk just in case there was a groan of pain then a splash followed by a cry for help in french chavasse and darcy pushed through the reeds and emerged on the other side of the sandbank as a head broke the water in the channel beyond and a hand clutched feebly at air chavasse plunged forward the water reaching to his chest and grabbed for the outstretched hand as the man went under again their fingers met and he went back slowly the thick black bottom mud reluctant to let him go darcy gave him a hand and they laid him on his back in the rain a thin grayhaired emaciated man of seventy or so he wore pyjama pants and a sleeveless vest and his body was blue with cold his eyes rolled wildly he gibbered with fear then passed out poor devil chavasse raised one sticklike arm ever seen anything like that before darcy examined the multiple tiny scars and nodded soberly a heroin addict from the look of it and pretty far gone i wonder who he is chavasse started to take off his anorak last time i saw him was in a photo mallory showed me though i must say he was looking considerably healthier montefiore darcy said blankly in person chavasse raised the unconscious man slipped the anorak down over his head and picked him up now lets get out of here before he dies on us on the return journey chavasse sat in the stern enrico montefiore cradled in his arms he was in a bad way there was little doubt of that and moaned restlessly occasionally crying out he never fully regained consciousness there was the sound of the alsatian barking uncomfortably close somewhere and then the harsh chatter of an outboard motor shattered the morning chavasse sat with the compass in his free hand relaying precise instructions to darcy who was putting his back into the rowing at one point they got stuck in a particularly thick patch of reeds and he eased montefiore to the floor and went over the side to push it was coldbitterly cold for by this time the water had managed to get inside his nylon waders and without his anorak the upper part of his body had no protection at all the dog barked monotonously much nearer now the sound of the outboard motor coming in relentlessly chavasse pushed hard and scrambled aboard as the dinghy moved again a few moments later they broke from cover and drifted into clear water and lalouette loomed out of the mist jacob chavasse called and then as they moved closer saw that malik was sitting in the stern his black umbrella shielding him from the rain the dinghy bumped gently against the side of lalouette chavasse stood up and looked straight into maliks face beneath the black umbrella which he now realized was lashed to the stern rail with a length of rope maliks eyes were fixed in death his left ear was missing and there was a small blue hole just above the bridge of his nose good morning chavasse welcome aboard rossiter moved out of the cabin smiling pleasantly as if really delighted to be meeting him again colonel ho tsen stood in the background one side of his face covered in surgical tape he was holding an ak assault rife and looked grim and implacable every inch the professional one of my men took a photo of you as you came in last night rossiter said we always like to check on new arrivals in this part of the camargue you may imagine my surprise when he showed me the print you took your time getting here chavasse said youre not too efficient this wretched weather old man we got here just after you left so we decided to wait actually our time wasnt wasted your friend was quite forthcoming after the colonel had a few words with him oh yes i now realize that you know all about us chavasse on the other hand we know all about you how nice for you and what about montefiore a problem hes done this before which simply isnt good enough i must have a word with the person who was supposed to be looking after him he went to the door produced a whistle and blew three blasts as he turned darcy preston said harshly who put him on heroinyou it keeps him amenable most of the time rossiter said as a living vegetable why dont you let him die but who on earth would sign all the checks rossiter demanded in a halfhumorous manner as if trying to be reasonable about the whole thing which explained a great deal and then several things happened at once montefiore started to groan thrashed his limbs wildly and sat up and a dinghy powered by an outboard motor appeared from the mist carrying two chinese men and the alsatian the two men came aboard leaving the dog in the dinghy ho tsen spoke sharply to one of them in chinese so rapidly that chavasse could not hear what was said the man replied in a low voice eyes down and ho tsen slapped him across the face have they got a dose with them rossiter demanded in chinese one of the men put down his assault rifle and produced a small leather case he opened it took out a hypodermic and a glass ampoule rossiter filled the hypo and nodded to the chinese man who held montefiore down by the shoulders rossiter gave him the injection that should hold him montefiore stopped struggling and went very still all tenseness leaving him and then a strange thing happened his eyes opened and he looked up at rossiter and smiled father leonard he said father leonard is that you and smiling the breath went out of him in a quiet sigh and his head slipped to one side there was a sudden silence rossiter gently touched his face it was ho tsen who moved first he pushed rossiter out of the way and shook montefiore roughly then he turned his eyes angry hes deaddo you understand youve killed him i warned youi told you you were giving him too much he struck out at rossiter sending him back against the other bunk one error after another youll have a lot to answer for when we reach tirana for a moment all attention was focused on the englishman chavasse sent one of the other chinese men staggering turned and jumped for the door he went over the rail surfaced and struck out for the shelter of the reeds he threw a quick glance over his shoulder and saw darcy struggling with the two chinese men at the rail ho tsen appeared clubbed the jamaican with the butt of his rifle and raised it to his shoulder as he started to fire chavasse went under the water and swam for the reeds safely in their shelter he turned and looked back the two chinese men were already in the dinghy and casting off the alsatian howling like a wolf chavasse started to push through the reeds halfswimming halfwading and then another sound rent the morning the engine of lalouette as she got underway he came to a waterway so deep that his feet failed to touch bottom he swam across to a graygreen wall of palm grass and forced his way through he paused after a few minutes treading water the sound of lalouettes engine was fading presumably it was returning to hellgate but the outboard motor of the dinghy was popping away in the vicinity and the alsatians mournful howl echoed eerily through the rain like a voice from the grave he started to swim again pushing his way through the reeds and suddenly the sound of the outboard motor ceased abruptly and the dog stopped barking which wasnt good whichever way you looked at it because now he didnt have the slightest idea where they were his feet touched bottom and he plowed through thick black mud and moved out of reeds and grass to relatively firm ground the compass still hung around his neck enabling him to check his direction and he concentrated hard trying to recapture a pictorial image of the map it was an old trick and surprisingly effective the island would be the only one of any size in the vicinity of lalouettes anchorage a couple of hundred yards in diameter and a quarter of a mile southwest of hellgate he started to run then came to a dead stop as a bull loomed out of the mist to confront him the animal held its head high and stared him right in the eye steam drifted from its nostrils and chavasse backed away slowly there was a movement to his right as another bull appeared like a dark shadow flanks glistening it pawed the ground nervously its head dipped the great curving horns gleaming viciously and then another appeared beyond the first and yet another six or seven of the great beasts in all fighting bulls reared for their courage and heart bred to fight in the ring he took a deep breath and walked through them very slowly passing so close between two of the outer circle that he could reach out and touch them he kept on going stumbling through tussocks of marsh grass and emerged on a sandy shore there was a sharp cry followed by two shots close together and sand fountained into the air on his right the dinghy drifted out of the mist perhaps twenty yards away in a single frozen moment of time he saw clearly that the alsatian was muzzled but not for long the ak assault rifle cracked again and as chavasse turned to run the alsatian took to the water he didnt have longa minute or a minute and a half at the most before it ran him down he tugged feverishly at his belt as he stumbled on there was a technique for handling big dogs but its successful application depended entirely on keeping calm and having a hell of a lot of luck in the first few seconds of attack the belt came free he looped it around each hand then turned and waited holding his hands straight out in front of him the belt taut the alsatian came out of the mist on the run and skidded briefly to a halt in almost the same moment he moved in mouth wide chavasse pushed the belt at him and the old trick worked like a charm the alsatian grabbed at it teeth tearing at the leather chavasse jerked with all his strength bringing the dog up on its hind legs and kicked it savagely in the loins the alsatian rolled over and he kicked it again in the ribs and the head it howled terribly writhing in the mud and he turned and moved on as the two chinese men arrived another shot followed him and from somewhere near at hand there was a roar of pain the bulls in the heat of the moment he had forgotten about the bulls there was a sudden trampling and one of them appeared blood streaming from a wound in the shoulder chavasse dived for the shelter of a clump of reeds and dropped on his face as heavy bodies crashed through the mud there was a cry of dismay a shot was fired and someone screamed when he raised his head he saw an old bull lurch out of the rain one of the chinese men hanging across his head impaled on the right horn the bull shook the man free and started to trample him there were two more shots somewhere in the mist and then a terrible cry chavasse had heard enough he moved out of the reeds quickly and took to the water a few moments later he reached another patch of dry land checked his compass and started to move southwest toward hellgate it took him the best part of an hour to reach the vantage point from which he and darcy had viewed the house that morning he crouched in the reeds and peered across the lagoon if anything the mist had thickened and everything was indistinct ghostlike more than ever a sad russian landscape by now lalouette would be tied up at the landing stage on the other side of the island at the rear of the house and if anything was to be done it would have to be from here to his left reeds marched out into the gray water providing plenty of cover for perhaps half of the distance the final approach would be in the openno other way he was still wearing the nylon waders malik had provided and now he sat down and pulled them off underneath he was wearing a pair of slacks so wet that they clung to him like a second skin he moved round toward the line of reeds and waded into the water crouching low for the first time since his jump for freedom on lalouette he felt coldreally coldand shivered uncontrollably as the water rose higher and then his feet lost touch with the bottom and he started to swim he paused at the extreme end of the reeds and trod water there were about fifty yards of clear water left to cover he took a couple of deep breaths sank under the surface and started to swim when he sounded for air he was halfway there he surfaced as gently as possible turned on his back to rest for a brief moment then went under again in a very short time his body scraped the black mud off the bottom as he neared the island he came to the surface and floundered ashore into the shelter of a line of bushes he crouched there in the rain sobbing for breath then got to his feet and moved on cautiously through the derelict garden to the house there was no sound not a sign of lifenothing and a strange kind of panic touched him what if they had left what if rossiter had decided to get out while the going was good and then famia nadeem appeared at the end of the overgrown path he was following she wore rubber boots to the knees and an old naval duffle coat the hood pulled up she was the same and yet not the same in some strange way a different person she walked on hands thrust into the pockets of her duffle coat face serious chavasse waited till she was abreast of him then reached out from the bushes and touched her shoulder her expression was something to see the eyes widened the mouth opened as if she would cry out and then she took a deep shuddering breath i couldnt believe it when rossiter said you were alive hes here youve seen him she nodded they came back in the other boat about an hour ago with mr jones though he isnt mr jones anymore is he chavasse put a hand on her shoulder how bad has it been bad she seemed almost surprised thats a relative term i guess but we mustnt stand here talking like this youll get pneumonia through those trees is a derelict summer house wait there ill bring some dry clothes and then well decide whats to be done she faded like a ghost and he stood watching her through the quiet rain conscious of the stillness drained of all strength god knew what rossiter had done to her but she had been used harshly must have been for such a profound change to have occurred so quickly the summer house reminded him of childhood the roof leaked and half the floorboards were missing and he slumped down against the wall underneath the gaping window he used to play in just such a place a thousand years ago he closed his eyes tiredness flooding over him and a board creaked when he looked up rossiter stood in the doorway famia at his side her face was calm completely impassive pure as a painting of a medieval madonna the cellar into which two more chinese guards pushed him was so dark that he had to pause for a couple of moments after the door was closed waiting for his eyes to become accustomed to the gloom darcy are you there he called softly over here paul there was a movement in the darkness and chavasse reached out what happened when i jumped the boat are you all right a knock on the head thats all what about you i thought youd be long gone chavasse told him when he had finished the jamaican sighed he certainly must have got through to that girl chavasse nodded it doesnt make sense she knows what happened on the leopard how can she possibly believe anything he says there could be a very simple explanation darcy pointed out shes fallen in love with him you mean could be more than that might be one of those strong sexual attractions that some people have for each other its possible i suppose so immaterial now anyway chavasse moved through the darkness hand outstretched until he touched the wall have you explored not really i was still unconscious when they first dumped me in here chavasse moved along the wall feeling his way cautiously he touched some kind of flat board felt for the edge and pulled it came away with a splintering crash and light flooded in the window was barred the glass long since disappeared it was at ground level and the view was confined to a section of what had once been the lawn stretching down to the landing stage that chavasse had been unable to see from the other side of the island the landing stage had definitely seen better days and half of it had decayed into the lagoon the rest was occupied by a fortyfoot seagoing launch that had obviously once been a motor torpedo boat and lalouette four men passed by carrying boxes between them and went toward the launch they certainly werent chinese and chavasse strained forward and managed to catch the odd word as they passed by albanian he whispered to darcy which makes sense remember the incident on lalouette when ho tsen took a swing at rossiter he told him hed have a lot to answer for when they reached tirana the only european communist nation to ally itself with red china rather than russia it certainly explains a great deal the men from the launch returned a few minutes later they reappeared carrying a couple of heavy traveling trunks looks as if somebody is moving house darcy commented chavasse nodded destination albania theyve got to get out now that weve been nosing around theyve no guarantee that others wont follow but why keep us in one piece darcy said i wouldnt have thought theyd want excess baggage but we arent ive had dealings with the albanians before and the chinese theyd love to have me back and you might be useful too they cant tell until theyve squeezed you dry the bolt rattled in the door it opened and the two chinese men appeared one of them held a machine pistol threateningly the other came forward grabbed chavasse and pushed him roughly outside they locked the door and shoved him along the corridor they passed through a large entrance hall mounted a flight of uncarpeted stairs and knocked on the first door it was opened after a slight delay by rossiter who was wearing a dressing gown he looked as if he had just pulled it on and was certainly naked to the waist he tightened the cord and nodded bring him in beyond him another door stood open and chavasse caught a glimpse of a bed the covers ruffled and famia stepping into her skirt in front of a mirror rossister closed the door and turned you do keep popping up dont you of course now we know what you are it isnt really surprising whats happened to the man from peking chavasse asked doesnt he want to put his two cents worth in indeed he does but at the moment hes busy packing thanks to you and your friend were obviously going to have to leave in something of a hurry for albania rossiter smiled you really are on the ball theyll love you in tirana and all points east naturally rossiter produced a cigarette case and offered him one a friendly warning the colonel will want a few words with you when he arrives dont get awkward you saw what he did to your friend he only asked him once then started carving your man talked fifteen to the dozen when he had one ear gone i would have thought you could have done better than him he was an old man chavasse said trying to make a little extra money there was no need to do that to him rossiter shrugged all over the world thousands of people die every day your friend malik was just one more if his death helps our cause then he lived and died to some purpose word perfect chavasse said they must have done a good job on you back there at nom bek you just dont understandyour kind never does rossiter was grave and serious i was like you once chavasse until i was helped to find a new answer a truer answer a new meaning for life so now its all right to kill people old men and women for the cause dont you see that whats one life more or lessmine or yours were all expendable how many men have you killed in your career ten twenty i dont notch my gun if thats what you mean chavasse said feeling strangely uneasy have you ever killed a woman chavasses mouth went dry and for a brief moment a face floated to the surface the face of a woman he would have preferred to forget rossiter smiled the strange saintly face touched with something very close to compassion i thought so the difference between us is only in kind the first and most important lesson to learn is that it isnt what we do that is so important as why we do it i serve a causefreedom for every man justice equality can you say as much what do you defend chavasse imperialism capitalism the church decay everywhere the people crushed and strangled unable to breathe god when i think of the years i spent serving corruption with all its faults id rather have my way than yours how many have the chinese butchered in tibet in the last five years half a million give or take a few all for the sake of the cause rossiter looked slightly exasperated you just dont see do you no one mattersno person or persons were working for tomorrow chavasse not today which significantly was the exact opposite of the teachings of the creed in which he had been raised and educated to serve chavasse knew now that he really was wasting his time but kept probing so anything goes even feeding poor old montefiore heroin i first met enrico montefiore when i returned to europe after the korean war was over my superiors had sent me to vienna because they had decided that i was in need of psychiatric treatment to overcome the effects of what they were pleased to call chinese brainwashing montefiore had been on drugs for years one evening we received a call from a private sanatorium where he was a patient and extremely ill he thought he needed a confessor and you were sent rossiter nodded the start of a fruitful friendship he came tohow shall i put itdepend on me when i finally decided to give up holy orders i persuaded montefiore that he needed quiet and isolation so he bought this place under an assumed name he was badly in decline by then ive had to look after him like a baby for the past three years in between assignments for your bosses in peking tirana chavasse lets get it right albania has proved a very useful european foothold for us of course the chinese have found me invaluable for obvious reasons theyre in rather a difficult position as a rule an englishman can pass as a russian if he speaks the language but what can a chinese do there are hong kong and malayan chinese living in britain these days indexed and filedprobably checked regularly by mi or the special branch much better to be there and yet not there if you follow me which is where your service for immigrants came in exactly only it wasnt my serviceit was jacauds there he was running these people across the channel by the boatload west indian pakistani african indianit was perfectly reasonable to have the odd hong kong chinese in there as well it was a bright idea and chavasse nodded full marks for using your wits so ho tsen wasnt the first if i told you how many youd feel sick he smiled cheerfully chavasse shrugged but no more theyre not going to be too pleased about that when you get back to headquarters oh i dont know it couldnt go on forever and i do have you after alla very useful prize there was nothing chavasse could say that would erase the faint superior smile from rossiters face and then for some reason he recalled his conversation with father da souza i was almost forgettingive a message for you he lied with complete conviction from da souza the effect was shattering rossiter seemed to shrink visibly father da souza thats right he has a parish near the east india docks in london when i wanted information about you he seemed the obvious person to see how is he rossiters voice was a whisper fine he asked me to let you know that there isnt a day in which he doesnt remember you in his prayers he was rather particular that i should tell you that rossiters face turned pale and he spoke through clenched teeth i dont need his prayers do you understand i never did and i never will the bedroom door opened and famia emerged she was wearing a raincoat and headscarf and carried a small suitcase she ignored chavasse and spoke to rossiter im ready shall i take this down to the boat for a brief moment they might have been alone for all the attention they paid chavasse trapped by that curious intimacy that only belongs to people hopelessly in love with each other for chavasse this was the most interesting discovery of all that rossiter obviously genuinely cared for the girl he put a hand on her arm and guided her to the door yes you take your bag down to the boat well be along later one of the guards opened the door she looked through chavasse briefly her face blank as if he werent really there and went out as the door closed chavasse said calmly what did you do put something in her tea rossiter swung round the look on his face terrible to see his hand dipped into his pocket and emerged clutching the madonna there was a sharp click and the blade jumped into view chavasse crouched arms up expecting an attack at any moment the door opened and ho tsen entered trouble he inquired in chinese rossiter seemed at a loss for words in some way a different person the awkward pupil caught out and having to justify himself to the schoolmaster for the first time ho tsen showed some evidence of emotion a kind of contempt appeared on his face he walked toward chavasse hands behind his back and kicked him in the stomach when he was close enough it was expertly done the work of someone who knew his karate chavasse was able to appreciate that much at least before he keeled over he rolled around a couple of times and fetched up against the wall he lay there concentrating on recovering his breath while the voices droned somewhere in the distance indistinct meaningless the colonels foot had not caught him in the crotch where such a blow could have had a permanently crippling effect but in the lower abdomen obviously by design chavasse had at least been able to tense his muscles to receive it the result was that although sick and sore he was already capable of some kind of movement when the two chinese guards picked him up he played it to the hilt dragging his feet on the way out and groaning softly they took him down the stairs across the hall and descended to the basement when they reached the cellar they dropped him to the floor the one who had carried a machine pistol over his shoulder now unslung it holding it ready in his hands while the other got out a key and unlocked the door the man with the machine pistol leaned down and grabbed chavasse by the collar pulling him to his feet chavasse drove the stiffened fingers of his left hand under the chin into the exposed throat a killing blow when expertly delivered the man didnt even choke simply sagged to the floor like an old sack dropping his machine pistol chavasse came to his feet and lifted his elbow into the face of the man behind the surprised chinese man gave a stifled cry and went backward into the cell a strong hand jerked the man around and darcy preston hit him once in the stomach and twice on the jaw in the silence chavasse picked up the machine pistol and grinned id say were in business again whats next on the agenda darcy asked chavasse held up the machine pistol even with this we dont stand much of a chance against rossiter ho tsen and those albanians if we could get on board lalouette things could look a little different those hand grenades and the machine pistols malik hid in the false bottom of that locker could more than even things up what about the girl she sold us out didnt she as a matter of interest your hunch was right she and rossiter cant keep their hands off each other as far as im concerned shes had it he cut off any further discussion by leading the way outside and tried the other end of the passage the first stairs they came to had a door at the top which was not locked when chavasse opened it cautiously he looked into the kitchen a large square room with a fire burning on an open hearth at that moment a door opened and two of the albanians entered he closed the door gently put a finger to his lips and he and darcy retreated at the far end of the passage more steps took them to a door long disused darcy wrestled with the rusted bolt and it finally opened to reveal a small walled garden that was as much a jungle as everything else they went out through an archway at the far end and ran for the shelter of the trees they made it and kept on going chavasse in the lead following one of the overgrown paths the undergrowth pressing in so closely on either side that it brushed against them without warning the path emptied into a clearing on the edge of the lagoon in which stood the ruins of a fake greek temple famia nadeem was standing there staring up at the broken columns hands in the pockets of her duffle coat she swung round startled and an expression of real alarm appeared on her face chavasse dropped the machine pistol and grabbed her cruelly clamping a hand across her mouth listen to me you silly little bitch your boyfriend is an agent of the chinese communist government hes responsible for the deaths of a great many people including old hamid and mrs campbell do you understand she gazed at him wideeyed and he took his hand away immediately she opened her mouth a scream rising in her throat and he struck her on the jaw with his clenched fist he lowered her to the ground and turned to preston sling her over your shoulder and make for the landing stage get as close as you can and wait in the bushes what are you going to do create a diversion if i can draw them off it will give you time to board lalouette and get moving what about you ill swim out from here and join you on your way past and if im not there in time dont start getting all heroic on me just get out of here youre in charge the jamaican picked up the girl slung her over one shoulder and moved away into the undergrowth chavasse hurried back toward the house he already had a plan of sorts the house was wholly constructed of timber with the right encouragement it should go up like a torch and there was one obvious place to start he moved back through the tangled garden and entered the basement again this time when he cautiously opened the door at the top of the second flight of stairs the kitchen was empty he went in removed the glass chimney from the oil lamp on the table and scattered its contents across the floor he made a brief search through the cupboards and found a halffull can of paraffin in one of them he emptied it to good effect then moved toward the fire behind him the door opened and colonel ho tsen entered if he was armed it didnt show and in any case the machine pistol already had him covered ho tsen actually smiled no sporting chance mr chavasse in a pigs eye chavasse said the breton half of mes in charge at the moment and we always pay our debts this is for jacob malik the first burst caught ho tsen in the right shoulder spinning him around and the second shattered his spine driving him out through the open door as he fell chavasse picked a burning log from the hearth and tossed it into the center of the room there was a minor explosion and he only just made it to the cellar door flames reaching out to engulf him as he went out through the garden he could hear cries of alarm from the other side of the house the albanians from the sound of it running to see what had gone wrong just as he had hoped he gave it another minute then ran for the trees as he reached their shelter lalouettes engine roared into life so darcy had made it after all behind him there was a sudden crackling as flames burst through the windows blowing out the glass a bullet splintered the trees above his head and he swung round and emptied the machine pistol in a wild burst that sent the albanian who had fired at him in a headlong retreat round the corner of the house chavasse ran head down and shots chased him through the undergrowth slicing through the pine trees above his head he burst from cover and plunged headlong into the lagoon as lalouette appeared round the point about fifty yards out as he started to swim lalouette altered course toward him slewing to a halt broadside on as darcy spun the wheel and cut the engine the jamaican ran for the rail and pulled chavasse over with easy strength get going for christs sake chavasse said with a gasp as darcy vanished into the wheelhouse a bullet ricocheted from the rail as the first albanian arrived at the waters edge chavasse turned and saw rossiter appear from the trees with the other three men the engines of lalouette roared and darcy took her away in a burst of speed bullets chopping into her hull chapter once around the southern tip of the island they were out of the direct line of fire and safe the girl lay on her face near the stern rail where darcy had dropped her when chavasse picked her up she groaned and her eyelashes fluttered he took her into the cabin laid her gently down on one of the seats then opened the map locker and removed the false bottom he unbuttoned his wet shirt stuffed the grenades inside for ease of carrying picked up the two machine pistols and went on deck darcy was giving the engine all it had and chavasse shook his head youre wasting your time that mtb has four times our speed weve got maybe five minutes to get ready for them so throttle down what do we do flight the best way we know how first of all ill show you how to use one of these things he went over the finer points of the machine pistol briefly then quickly primed the grenades i want them to go off in a hurry three seconds is all youve got from the moment you release the handle and dont you forget it you take threeill take three you can carry them inside your shirt he looked back through the mist to where smoke drifted sluggishly through the heavy rain i shouldnt think there will be much of hellgate left after that little lot has burned itself out cut the motor somewhere not too far away the engine of the mtb roared like an angry lion they had entered a smaller lagoon and lalouette moved broadside toward the entrance of the narrow waterway at the far end she drifted to a halt her prow in the reeds and chavasse nodded this is as good a place as any now lets have the girl up here and ill tell you what we do next her speed considerably reduced in the narrow waterway the mtb was moving slowly when she entered the small lagoon and the albanian stationed in the prow submachine gun at the ready saw lalouette and cried out the engines of the mtb died and she moved on carried by her own momentum drifting past the place where darcy preston stood waist deep among the reeds holding famia securely a hand clamped across her mouth chavasse waited on the other side of the lagoon on a piece of relatively high ground soft black sand surrounded by marsh grass two grenades lay on the ground beside him another was ready in his hand he caught a glimpse of rossiters flaxen hair in the window of the wheelhouse and then the mtb was abreast she was perhaps twenty or thirty feet away from him when he tossed the first grenade it bounced on the stern deck rolled into the water and exploded the mtb rocked in the turbulence and there was a cry of alarm as the man in the prow went headfirst into the water on the other side of the lagoon darcy pushed the girl away from him took a grenade from inside his shirt pulled the pin and tossed it it had farther to go than he had realized and fell short sending a fountain of water skyward as he took out another one the girl screamed and flung herself on him just as he tossed the grenade it fell into the water no more than fifteen feet away and the blast flattened the reeds and blew them both over darcy surfaced reaching for the girl and found himself under heavy fire from two of the albanians who crouched by the rail of the mtb with submachine guns in the wheelhouse rossiter gave the engines full power and spun the wheel and in the same instant chavasses second grenade exploded under the bow blowing most of the stern away and taking the propeller with it the mtb shuddered and bucked like a live thing as she slowed chavasse tossed his last grenade it landed amidships and exploded with shattering force rossiter was at that very moment emerging from the wheelhouse and the blast blew him into the water the mtb heeled over black smoke pouring from the engine hatch two of the albanians still crouched at the rail firing toward darcy chavasse moved a few yards to one side to a place where he could get a clear view and drove them both over the side with a long burst from his machine pistol there was some kind of explosion in the engine room and flames burst through the hatch the entire boat seemed to lurch to one side rolled over and started to sink it was all over in the sudden quiet the only sound was famias hysterical cries as she floundered through the shallows trying to pull free from darcy prestons restraining hand chavasse slung his machine pistol and swam toward them when he was close enough to their side of the lagoon he started to wade reaching for the girls left hand she struggled fiercely with a strength that was frightening in its power for a moment the three of them were caught in a mad tableau chavasse hanging on to one hand darcy preston the other at the same time trying to hold his machine pistol out of the water under the mistaken impression that it would cease to function if wet and then it happened like something out of a nightmare out of the water from amongst the floating wreckage rossiter rose like some terrible phoenix his body soaked in blood that strange aesthetic face was calm devoid of all expression the wet flaxen hair plastered into a skullcap the girl screamed his name tore herself free and plunged toward him in the same moment his right hand went back there was a click a flash of steel in flight everything seemed to happen at once the girl still frantically trying to tear herself free floundered across chavasses path and the knife buried itself in her heart the ivory madonna protruding from beneath her breasts rossiter gave a terrible cry reaching out toward her and darcy preston emptied the machine pistol into him driving him under the surface of the water chavasse caught the girl as she swayed a look of complete surprise on her face he held her close to him and gently eased out the knife in the same moment that it left her body the life went out of her also she hung for a moment in his left arm and then he released her and she sank from sight he turned and darcy cried is this what we came for this butchers shop he threw the machine pistol into the water turned and waded through the shallows to lalouette chavasse went after him and when he scrambled over the rail darcy was already in the wheelhouse the boat started to move pushing its way through the narrow waterway emerging a few moments later into the main channel beyond through the rain the smoke drifted up from hellgate chavasse crouched there by the rail very cold trembling slightly drained of all emotion and then he realized a strange thinghe was still clutching rossiters knife in his right hand the channel widened as they moved through the estuary out to sea and he stared down at the ivory madonna and how many men have you killed in your career chavasse the words seemed to whisper in his ear as if rossiter himself had spoken with a sudden gesture of repugnance chavasse flung the knife from him it glinted once then sank beneath a wave somewhere overhead geese called as they moved out to sea and he got to his feet wearily and went to join darcy in the wheelhouse
