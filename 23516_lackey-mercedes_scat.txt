scat the four skitty stories appeared in cat fantastic anthologies edited by andre norton im very very fond of skitty it might seem odd for a bird person to be fond of cats but i am so there it is i was actually a catperson before i was a birdmother and i do have two cats both siamesemix both rather old and very slow just if the other local cats poach too often at my bird feeders they can expect to get a surprise from the gardenhose noooooowowowow the metal walls of dicks tiny cabin vibrated with the howl dick white ignored it as he injected the last of the four contraceptionbeads into skittys left hind leg the blackcoated shipscat did not move but she did continue her vocal and mental protest mean she complained as dick held the scanner over the right spot to make certain that he had gotten the bead placed where it was supposed to go mean mean dick indignation showing in every line of her she sat up on his folddown desk and licked the injection site it hadnt hurt he knew it hadnt hurt for hed tried it on himself with a neutral bead before he injected her nice nice dick you should be saying he chided her one more unauthorized litter and biotech would be coming to take you away for their breeding program youre too fertile for your own good skittys token whine turned into a real yowl of protest and her mate now dubbed scat joined her in the wail from his seat on dicks bunk not leave dick skitty shrilled in his head not leave ship then no more kittensat least not for a while he responded no more kittens means skitty and scat stay with dick skitty leapt to join her mate on the bunk where both of them began washing each other to demonstrate their distress over the idea of leaving dick skittys real name was lady sundancer of greenfields and she was the proud product of biotechs masterful genesplicing shipscats those sturdy valiant hunters of vermin of every species betrayed their differences from terran felines in a number of ways biotech had given them the hands of a raccoon the speed of a mongoose the ability to adjust to rapid changes in gravity or no gravity at all and greatly enhanced mental capacity what they did not know was that lady sundanceraka dick whites kitty or skitty for shorthad another invisible enhancement she was telepathicat least with dick thanks to skitty and to her last litter the catseye company trading ship brightwing was one of the most prosperous in this end of the galaxy that was due entirely to skittys hunting ability she had taken swift vengeance when a persistent pest native to the newlyopened world of lacuun had bitten the consort of the ruler killing with a single blow a creature the natives had never been able to exterminate that and her own charming personality had made her kittenstobe most desirable acquisitions so precious that not even the leaders of lacuun owned them they were held in trust for the world thanks to the existence of that litter and the need to get them appropriately pedigreed biotech mates skittys own matecalled prrreet by skitty and unsurprisingly dubbed scat by the crew for his ability to vanishhad made his own way to skitty stowing aboard with the crates containing more biotech kittens for lacuun where he came from only he knew although he was definitely a shipscat his tattoo didnt match anything in the biotech register too dignified to be called a kitty this handsome male was dick whites cat and thanks to scats timely arrival and intervention an attempt to kill the entire crew of the brightwing and the terran consul to lacuun in order to take over the trading concession had been unsuccessful scat had disabled critical equipment holding them all imprisoned so that they were able to get to a com station to call for help from the patrol while skitty had distracted the guards scat had never demonstrated telepathic powers with dick for which dick was grateful but he certainly possessed something of the sort with skitty and he was odd in other ways dick would have been willing to take an oath that scats forepaws were even more handlike than skittys and that his tail showed some signs of being prehensile there were other secrets locked in that wide blackfurred skull and dick only wished he had access to them dick was worried for the brightwing was in space again and heading towards one of the major stations with the results of their yearlong trading endeavor with the beings of lacuun in their hold shipscats simply did not come out of nowhere biotech kept very tight control over them denying them to ships or captains with a record of even the slightest abuse or neglect and keeping track of where every one of them was from birth to death they were expensivetraders running on the edge could not afford them and had to rid themselves of vermin with periodic vacuumpurges skitty claimed that her mate had heard about her and had come specifically to find herbut she would not say from where scat had to come from somewhere and wherever that was someone from there was probably looking for him they would very likely take a dim view of their fourlegged romeo heading off on his own in search of his juliet any attempt to question the tom through skitty was useless scat would simply stare at him with those luminous yellow eyes then yawn and skitty would soon grow bored with the proceedings after all to her the important thing was that scat was here not where he had come from behind dick in the open door of the cabin someone coughed he turned to find captain singh regarding dick and cats with a jaundiced eye dick saluted hastily sircontraceptive devices in place and verified sir he affirmed holding up the injector to prove it the captain a darkly handsome gentleman as popular with the females of his own species as scat undoubtably was with felines merely nodded we have a problem white he pointed out the brightwings manifest shows one shipscat not two and we still dont know where number two came from i know what will happen if we try to take skittys mate away from her but i also know what will happen if anyone finds out we have a second cat origin unknown biotech will take a dim view of this dick had been thinking at least part of this through we can hide him sir he offered at least until i can find out where he came from oh captain singhs eyebrows rose just how do you propose to hide him and where dick grinned in plain sight sir look at themunless you have them sidebyside you wouldnt be able to tell which one you had in front of you theyre both black with yellow eyes and its only when you can see the size difference and the longer tail on scat that you can tell them apart so we simply make sure theyre never in the same compartment while strangers are aboard the captain hazarded that actually has some merit the spirits of space know that people are always claiming shipscats can teleport no one will even notice the difference if we dont say anything and theyll just think shes getting around by way of the access tubes how do you intend to find out where this one came from without making people wonder why youre asking about a stray cat dick was rather pleased with himself for he had actually thought of this solution first skitty is fertileunlike ninetenths of the shipscats that is why we had kittens to offer the lacuun in the first place and was why we have the profit we do even after buying the contracts of the other young cats for groundside duty as the kittens mates the captain made a faint grimace youre stating the obvious humor me sir did you know that biotech routinely offers their breeding cats free choice in mates that otherwise they dont breed well as the captain shook his head dick pulled out his trump card i amostensiblygoing to do the same for skitty as long as we find her a biotech mate that she approves of biotech will be happy and we need more kittens for the lacuun we have no reason to buy them when we have a potential breeder of our own but we got mates for her kittens the captain protested wont biotech think theres something odd going on dick shook his head youre thinking of housecats shipscats arent fertile until theyre four or five at that rate the kittens wont be old enough to breed for four years and the lacuun are going to want more cats before then so ill be searching the biotech breeding records for a tom of the right age and appearance solid black is recessivethere cant be that many black toms of the right age and once youve found your group of candidates singh asked both eyebrows arching you look for the one thats missing he did not ask how dick was supposed to have found out that skitty preferred a black tom shipscats were more than intelligent enough to choose a color from a set of holos dick shrugged the information may be in the records once i know where scats from we can open negotiations to add him to our manifest with biotechs backing they wont pass up a chance to make skitty half of a breeding pair and i dont think theres a captain willing to go on biotechs record as opposing a shipscats choice of mate i wont ask how you intend to make that particular project work singh said hastily just remember no more kittens in freefall dick held up the nowempty injector as a silent promise ill brief the crew to refer to both cats as skittymost of the time they do anyway the captain said carry on white you seem to have the situation well in hand dick was nowhere near that certain but he put on a confident expression for the captain he saluted singhs retreating back then sat down on the bunk beside the pair of purring cats as usual they were wound around each other in a knot of happiness i wish my lovelife was going that well hed hit it off with the terran consul well enough but she had elected to remain in her groundbound position and his life was with the ship once again romance took a second place to careers which in his case meant no romance there wasnt a single female in this crew that had shown anything other than strictly platonic interest in him if he wanted a career in space he had to be very careful about what he did and said as most junior officer on the brightwing he was the one usually chosen for whatever unpleasant duty no one else wanted to handle and although he could actually retire thanks to the prosperity that the lacuun contract had brought the whole crew he didnt want to that would mean leaving space leaving the shipand leaving skitty and scat he could also transfer within the company but why change from a crew full of people he liked and respected with a good captain like singh to one about which he knew nothing that would be stupid and he couldnt leave skitty no matter what she was his best friend even if she did get him into trouble sometimes he also didnt have the experience to be anything other than the most junior officer in any ship so transferring wouldnt have any benefits unless of course he parlayed his profitshare into a small fortune and bought his own ship then he could be captain and he might even be able to buy skittys contractbut he lacked the experience that made the difference between prosperity and bankruptcy in the shaky world of the free traders he was wise enough to know this as for the breeding projecthe had some ideas the brightwing would be visiting lacuun for a minimum of three weeks on every round of their tradingroute surely something could be worked out things didnt get chancy until after the kittens were mobile and before skitty pottytrained them to use crew facilities before they were able to leave the nestbox skitty took care of the unpleasant details if they could arrange things so that the period of mobilitytoweaning took place while they were on lacuun well hed make that jump when the coordinates came up right now he had to keep outsiders from discovering that there was feline contraband on board and find out where that contraband came from dick smart skitty purred proudly dick fix everything well he thought wryly at least i have her confidence if noone elses it had been a long time since the brightwing had been docked at a major port and predictably everyone wanted shore leave everyone except dick that is he had no intentions of leaving the console in cargo where he was doing his matehunting unless and until he found his match the fact that there was nothing but a skeleton crew aboard once the inspectors left only made it easier for dick to run his searches through the biotech database available through the station this database was part of the public records kept on every station and updated weekly by biotech dick had a notion that hed get his hit within a few hours of initiating his search he was pleasantly surprised to discover that there were portraits available for every entry it might even be possible to identify scat just from the portraits once he had all of the black males of the appropriate age sorted out that would give him even more rationale for the claim that skitty had chosen her mate herself with an interested feline perching on each arm of the chair he logged into the stations databases identified himself and gave the station his billing information then began his run there was nothing to do at that point but sit back and wait i hope you realize all of the difficulties im going through for you he told the tom who was grooming his face thoughtfully im doing without shoreleave to help you here i wouldnt do this for a fellow human scat paused in his grooming long enough to rasp dicks hand with his dampsandpaper tongue the computer beeped just at that moment to let him know it was done he was running all this through the cargo dumbset he could have used the brightwings expertsystem ai but he didnt want the ai to get curious and he didnt want someone wondering why he was using a megabrain to access feline familytrees what he did want was the appearance that this was a brainstorm of his own an attempt to boost his standing with his captain by providing further negotiable items for the lacuun contract there was something odd about all of this something that he couldnt put his finger on but something that just felt wrong and made him want to be extracautious why he didnt know he only knew that he didnt want to set off any telltales by acting as if this matesearch was a priority item the computer asked if he wanted to use the holotable a tiny square platform built into the upper right hand corner of the desk he cleared off a stack of hardcopy manifests and told it yes then the first of his feline biographies came in hed made a guess that scat was between five and ten years old shipscats lived to be fifty or more but their useful lifespan was about twenty or thirty years all too often their job was hazardous alien vermin had poisonous fangs or stings sharp claws and teeth cats suffered disabling injuries more often than their human crewmates and would be retired with honors to the homes of retired spacers or to the big assisted living stations holding the very aged and those with disabling injuries of their own shipscats were always welcome anywhere in space and i can think of worse fates than spending my old age watching the stars with skitty on my lap he gazed down fondly at his furred friend and rubbed her ears skitty purred and butted her head into his hand she paid very little attention to the holos as they passed slowly in review scat was right up on the desk however not only staring intently at the holos but splitting his attention between the holos and the screen you dont suppose he can read suddenly scat let out a yowl and swatted the holoplate dick froze the image and the screenbiography that accompanied it he looked first at the holoand it certainly looked more like scat than any of the others had but scats attention was on the screen not the holo and he stared fixedly at the modest insignia in the bottom right corner patrol he looked down at scat dumbfounded you were with the patrol he whispered it you did not invoke the patrols name aloud unless you wanted a visit from them yellow eyes met his for a moment then the paw tapped the screen he read further type mf designation lightfoot of sun meadow patrol id fx standard military genotype standard military training well that explained how he had known how to shut down the pirate equipment now dick wondered how much else the cat had done outside of his sight and a military genotype he hadnt even known there was such a thing assigned to patrol ship dia out of oklahoma station designated handler major logan greene oklahoma stationthat was this station drug interdiction he whistled softly then a date followed by the ominous words ship missing all aboard presumed dead all aboardexcept the shipscat the cat himself gave a mournful yowl and skitty jumped up on the desk to press herself against him comfortingly he looked back down at scat did you jump ship before they went missing he wasnt certain he would get an answer but he had lived with skitty for too long to underestimate shipscat intelligence the cat shook his head slowly and deliberatelyin the negative his mouth went dry are you sayingyou got away a definite nod your ship was boarded and you got away he was astonished but how for an answer the cat jumped down off the desk and walked over to the little escape pod that neither he nor skitty ever forgot to drag with them he seized the tether in his teeth and dragged it over to an access tube it barely fit he wedged it down out of sight then pawed open the door and dropped down hidden and now completely protected from what must have happened he popped back out again and walked to dicks feet dick was thinking furiously there had been rumors that drugsmugglers were using captured patrol ships this moreorless confirmed those rumors disable the ship take the exterior airlock and blow it whoever wasnt suited up would die then they board and finish off whoever was suited up they patch the lock restore the air and weld enough junk to the outside of the ship to disguise it completely then they can bring it in to any port they care toeven the ships home port this station which is where scat escaped can you identify the attackers he asked scat the cat slowly nodded they know he gone he run they chase he try get home they stop he hear of me on dock go hide in ship bringing mates they kill he get chance skitty put in helpfully he could picture it easily enough scat being pursued cut off from the patrol section of the stationhiding out on the dockscatching the scent of the mates being shipped for skittys kittens and deciding to seek safety offworld cats even shipscats did not tend to grasp the concept of duty he knew from dealing with skitty that she took her bonds of personal affection seriously but little else so once his people were dead scats personal allegiance to the patrol was nonexistent and his primary drive would be selfpreservation wonderful i wonder if theywhoever they arefigured out he got away on another ship another more alarming thought occurred to him i wonder if my fishing about in the biotech database touched off any telltales no matter there was only one place to go nowstraight to erica makumba the legal and security officer he dumped a copy of the pertinent datafile to a memory cube then scooped up both cats and pried their lifesupport ball out of its hiding place then he ran for ericas cabin praying that she had not gone off on shoreleave the spirits of space were with him the indicator outside her cabin door indicated that she was in there but did not want to be disturbed he pounded on the door anyway erica might kill himbut there were people after scat who had murdered an entire patrol dia squad after a moment the door cracked open a centimeter white ericas flat expressionless voice boded extreme violence this had better be an emergency he said the one word that would guarantee her attention hijackers the door snapped open she grabbed him and pulled him inside cats supportball and all and slammed the door shut behind him she was wearing a short robe tying it hastily around herself and she wasnt alone but the man watching them both alertly from the disheveled bed wasnt one of the brightwings crew so dick flushed but tried to ignore him i found out where scats from he babbled dropping one cat to hand the memorycube to her read thatquick she punched up the console at her elbow and dropped the cube in the receiver the biotech file minus the holo scrolled up on the screen the man in the bed leaned forward to read it too and whistled erica swiveled to glare at him you keep this to yourself jay she snapped then she turned back to dick spill it she ordered scats ship was hijacked probably by smugglers he said quickly he hid his supportball in an access tube and he was in it when they blew the lock they missed him in the sweep and when they brought their prize in here he got away but they know hes gone and they know he can id them and theyll be giving the hairy eyeball to every ship with a black cat on it she bit her knuckleand jay added his own two credits worth i hate to say this but theyve probably got a telltale on the biotech data files so they know whenever anyone accesses them its not restricted data so anyone could leave a telltale the mans face was pale beneath his normally dusky skintone if they dont know youve gone looking by now they will shortly they all looked at each other whos still on board dick asked and gulped ericas mouth formed a tight thin line you me jay and the cats the cargos offloaded and regs say you dont need more than two crew on board instation theoretically no one can get past the security at the lock jay barked a laugh and tossed long dark hair out of his eyes honey im a comptech trust me you can get past the security you just hack into the system tell it the ship in the bay is bigger than it really is and upload whoever you want as additional personnel erica sworebut jay stood up wrapping the sheet around himself like a toga and pushed her gently aside what can be hacked can be unhackedor at least i can make it a lot more difficult for them to get in and make those alterations stick give me your code to the ai erica hesitated he turned to stare into her eyes i need the ais help you two and the cats are going to get out of hereget over to the patrol side of the station im going to hold them off as long as i can and play stupid when they do get in but i need the speed of the ai to help me lay traps youve known me for three years you trusted me enough to bring me here didnt you she swore again then reached past him to key in her code he sat down ignoring them and plunging straight into a trance of concentration come on erica grabbed dicks arm and put the supportball on the floor skitty and scat must have been reading her mind for they both squirmed into the ball which was big enough for more than one cat theyd upgraded the ball after skitty had proved to be sofertile erica shoved the ball at dick and kept hold of his arm pulling him out into the corridor where are we going he asked to get our suits then to the emergency lock she replied crisply if we try to go out the main lock into the station theyll get us for certain so were going outside for a little walk a little walk all the way around the station outside he could only hope that they hadnt thought of that as well they reached the suitingup room in seconds flat he averted his eyes and climbed into his own suit as erica shed her robe and squirmed into hers how far is it to the patrol section he asked not as far as you think she told him and theres a maintenance lock just this side of it what i want to know is how you got all this detailed information about the hijacking he turned and saw that she was suited up with her faceplate still open staring at him with a calculating expression this is probably not the time to hold out on her he swallowed and sealed his suit up leaving his own faceplate open inside the ball the cats were watching both of them heads swiveling to look from one face to the other as if they were watching a tennismatch skittys telepathic with me he admitted i think scats telepathic with her she seems to be able to talk with him anyway he waited for erica to react either with disbelief or with revulsion telepaths of any species were not always popular among humankind but erica just pursed her lips and nodded eyeah i thought she might be and telepathys one of the traits biotech doesnt talk about but security people have know for a while that the mf type cats are bred for it maybe skittys momma did a little wandering over on the miltech side of the cattery hmm skitty made a silent meow and he just shrugged relieved that erica wasnt phobic about it and equally relieved to learn that telepathy was already a trait that biotech had established in their shipscat lines so they wont be coming to take skitty away from me when they find out that shes a path but right now hed better be worrying about making a successful escape he pulled his faceplate down and sealed it fastening the tetherline of the ball to a snaplink on his waistband he warmed up his suitradio and she did the same i hope you know what youre getting us into he said as erica sealed her own plate shut and led the way to the emergency lock she looked back over her shoulder at him so do i she replied soberly the trip was a nightmare dick had never done a spacewalk on the exterior of a station before it wasnt at all like going out on the hull of a ship there were hundreds of obstacles to avoidwindows antenna instrumentpackages maintenance robots any time an inspection drone came along they had to hide to avoid being picked up on camera it was work hard work to inch their way along the station in this way and dick was sweating freely before a half an hour was up it seemed like longer every time he glanced up at the chronometer in his faceplate hud he was shocked to see how little time had passed the suitfans whined in his ears as the lifesupport system alternately fought to warm him up when they hid in the shade or cool him down when they paused in full sunlight stars burned down on them silent points of light in a depth of darkness that made him dizzy whenever he glanced out at it the knowledge that he could be lost forever out there if he just made one small mistake chilled his heart finally erica pointed and he saw the outline of a maintenance lock just ahead the two of them pulled themselves handoverhand toward it reaching it at the same instant but it was erica who opened it while dick reeled the cats in on their tether with all four of them inside erica sealed the lock from the inside and initiated pressurization within moments they were both able to pop their faceplates and breathe stationair again something prompted dick to release the cats from their ball before erica unsealed the inner hatch he unsnapped the tether and was actually straightening up empty ball in both hands when erica opened the door to a hallway and dropped to the floor as the shrill squeal of a stungun pierced the quiet of the lock erica without thinking he ran forward and found himself facing the businessend of a powerful stunner held by a nondescript man who held it as if he was quite used to employing it he was not wearing a stationuniform the man looked startled to see him and dick did the only thing he could think of he threw the supportball at the man as hard as he could it hit cleanly knocking the man to the floor as it impacted with his chest he clearly was not aware that the supportballs were as massy as they were the two cats flashed past him heading for freedom and dick tried to follow their example but the man was quick to recover and as dick tried to jump over his prone body the fellow grabbed his ankle and tripped him up then it turned into a brawl with dick the definite underdog even in the suit the stranger still outweighed him within a few seconds dick was on his back on the floor and the stranger held him down easily the stungun was no longer in his hands but it didnt look to dick as if he really needed it in fact as the mans heavy fist pounded into dicks face he was quickly convinced that he didnt need it pain lanced through his jaw as the mans fist smashed into it his vision filled with stars and red and white flashes of light more agony burst into his skull as the blows continued he flailed his arms and legs but there was nothing he could dohe was trapped in the suit and he couldnt even get enough leverage to defend himself he tasted blood in his mouthhe couldnt see bad man there was a terrible battlescreech from somewhere out in the corridor and the blows stopped then the weight lifted from his body as the man howled in pain dick managed to roll to one side and stagger blindly to his feet with the aid of the corridor bulkheadhe still couldnt see he dashed blood out of his eyes with one hand and shook his head to clear it staring blindly in the direction of the unholy row get it off get it off me human screams mixed with feline battlecries telling him that whichever of the cats had attacked they were giving a good accounting of themselves but there were other soundsthe sounds of running feet approaching and dick tried frantically to get his vision to clear a heavy body crashed into him knocking him into the bulkhead with enough force to drive all the breath from his body as the zing of an illegal neurogun went off somewhere near him skitty but whoever was firing swore and the catwail faded into the distance it got away said one voice over the sobbing of another a third swore as dick fought for air you go after it the third man said and there was the sound of running feet meanwhile footsteps neared where dick lay curled in a fetal bundle on the floor what about this the second voice asked the third voice cold and unemotional wrote dicks death warrant get rid of it and the woman too and dick could not even move he heard someone breathing heavily just above him sensed the man taking aim then patrol freeze drop your weapons now something clattered to the deck beside him as more running feet approached and with a sob of relief dick finally drew a full breath there was a scuffle just beside him then someone helped him to stand and he heard the hiss of a hypospray and felt the telltale sting against the side of his neck a moment later his eyes clearedjust in time for him to catch skitty as she launched herself from the arms of a uniformed dia officer into his embrace so the bottom line is youll let us take scats contract captain singh sat back in his chair while dick rubbed skittys ears she and scat both burdened dicks lap as they had since scat the captain the dia negotiator and erica had all walked into the sickbay where dick was still recovering erica was clearly nursing a stunheadache the captain looked a little frazzled the dia man as most of his ilk looked as unemotional as an android the dia had spent many hours with a humanfeline telepathic specialist debriefing scat apparently scat was naturally only a receptive telepath it took a human who was also a telepath to talk to him theres no reason why not the dia agent said you civilians have helped materially in this case both you and he are entitled to certain compensation and if thats what you all want then hes yours with our blessingthe fact that he is only a receptive telepath makes him less than optimal for further patrol duties the agent shrugged we can always get other shipscats with full abilities according to the records the only reason we kept him was because major logan selected him skitty bristled and dick sent soothing thoughts at her then the agent smiled making his face look more human major logan was a good agent but he didnt particularly care for having a cat talking to him i gather that lightfoot and he got along all right but there wasnt the strong bond between them that we would have preferred it would have been just a matter of time before that squad and ship got a new catagent team besides we arent completely inhuman if your skitty and this boy here are happily mated who and what in the patrol can possibly want to separate them judging by the furrows skitty left in that jackers face and scalp it isnt a good idea to get between her and someone she loves captain singh said dryly hes lucky she left him one eye the agents gaze dropped briefly to the swath of black fur draped over dicks lap believe me he said fervently that is a consideration we had taken into account your little lady there is a warrior for fair and we have no intention of denying her anything her heart is set on if she wants lightfoot and he wants her then shes got him well see his contract is transferred over to brightwing within the hour his eyes rose to meet dicks youre a lucky man to have a friend like her young man she put herself between you and certain death dont you ever forget it skittys purr deepened and scats joined with hers as dicks hands dropped protectively on their backs i know that sir he replied through swollen lips i knew it before any of this happened skitty turned her head and he gazed into amused yellow eyes smart dick she purred then lowered her head to her paws smart man mate happy here mate stay everything good love you and that as far as skitty was concerned was the end of it the rest were simply minor human matters he chuckled and turned his own attention to dealing with those minor human matters while his best friend and her mate drifted into wellearned sleep
