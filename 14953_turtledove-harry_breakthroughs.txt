harry turtledove breakthroughs klaxons hooted the call to battle stations george enos sprinted along the deck of the uss ericsson toward the onepounder gun near the stern the destroyer was rolling and pitching in the heavy swells of an atlantic winter storm freezing rain made the metal deck slick as a boston common iceskating rink enos ran as confidently as a mountain goat bounding from crag to crag ice and heavy seas were second nature to him before the war sucked him into the navy hed put to sea in fishing boats from bostons t wharf at every season of the year and gone through worse weather in craft a lot smaller than this one the thick peacoat was warmer than a civilian slicker too petty officer carl sturtevant and most of his crew were already at the depthcharge launcher near the onepounder the other sailors came rushing up only moments after enos took his place at the antiaircraft gun he stared every which way though with the weather so bad he would have been hard pressed to spot an aeroplane before it crashed on the ericsson s deck a frigid gust of wind tried to yank off his cap he grabbed it and jammed it back in place navy barbers kept his brown hair trimmed too close for it to hold in any heat on its own whats up he shouted to sturtevant through the wind somebody spot a periscope or think he did british french and confederate submersibles all prowled the atlantic for that matter so did us and german boats if a friendly skipper made a mistake and launched a spread of fish at the ericsson her crew would be in just as much trouble as if the rebs or limeys had attacked dont know the petty officer scratched at his dark kaiser bill mustache shit you expect em to go and tell us stuff all i know is i heard the hooter and i ran like hell he scratched his mustache again long as were standing next to each other george happy new year same to you enos answered in surprised tones it is today isnt it i hadnt even thought about it but youre right back when this damn war started who would have thought itd last into not me ill tell you that sturtevant said me neither george enos said i sailed into boston harbor with a hold full of haddock the day the austrian grand duke got himself blown up in sarajevo i figured the fight would be short and sweet same as everybody else yeah so did i sturtevant said didnt quite work out that way though the kaisers boys didnt make it into paris we didnt make it into toronto and the goddamn rebs did make it into washington and almost into philadelphia nothin comes easy not in this fight aint it the truth enos agreed fervently i was in river monitors on the mississippi and the cumberland i know how tough its been the snappingturtle fleet sturtevant said with the goodnatured scorn sailors of the oceanic navy reserved for their inland counterparts having served in both branches george knew the scorn was unjustified he also knew he had no chance of convincing anyone who hadnt served in a river monitor that that was so lieutenant armstrong crowder came toward the stern a pocket watch in one hand a clipboard with some increasingly soggy papers in the other seeing him thus made enos relax inside though he did not ease his vigilant posture lieutenant crowder took notes or checked boxes or did whatever he was supposed to do with those papers after he was done writing he said men you may stand easy this was only an exercise had the forces of the entente been foolish enough to try our mettle i have no doubt we would have sunk them or driven them off he set an affectionate hand on the depthcharge launcher it was a new gadget until a few months before ashcans had been launched by rolling them off the stern crowder loved new gadgets and depth charges from this one actually had crippled a confederate submarine with a fishermans ingrained pessimism george enos thought that going from one crippled boat to a sure sinking was a long leap of faith eventually lieutenant crowder shut up and went away carl sturtevant rolled his eyes he had even less faith in gadgets than enos did if that first torpedo nails us he said odds are were nothing but a whole raft of the navy department regrets telegrams waiting to happen oh yeah george nodded the allclear sounded he didnt leave the onepounder right away even so as long as he had reason to be here by the rail he aimed to take a good long look at as much of the atlantic as he could just because the call to battle stations had been a drill did not mean no enemy submarines lurked out there looking for a target quite a few sailors lingered by the rail despite the rain and sleet riding the wind dont know why im bothering carl sturtevant said half the royal navy could sail by within a quartermile of us and wed never be the wiser yeah enos said again well this makes it harder for the submersibles to spot us too i keep telling myself that the petty officer answered sometimes it makes me feel better sometimes it doesnt what it puts me in mind of is playing blindmans buff where everybodys got a blindfold on and everybodys carrying a sixshooter a game like that gets scary in a hurry cant say youre wrong enos replied riding the deck shifting under his feet with automatic ease he was a good sailor with a strong stomach which got him respect from his shipmates even though unlike so many of them he wasnt a career navy man could be worse thoughwe could be running guns into ireland again or playing hideandseek with the limeys around the icebergs way up north youre rightboth of those would be worse sturtevant agreed sooner or later we will cut that sea bridge between england and canada and then the canucks will be in the soup sooner or later george echoed mournfully before the war the plan had been for the german high seas fleet to break out of the north sea and rendezvous with the us atlantic fleet smashing the royal navy between them but the royal navy had had plans of its own and only the couple of squadrons of the high seas fleet actually on the high seas when war broke out were fighting alongside their american allies sooner or later enos went on ill get some leave and see my wife and kids again too but im not holding my breath there either christ george jr turns seven this year its hard sturtevant said with a sigh that made a young fogbank grow in front of his face he peered out at the ocean again then shook his head hellfire im only wasting my time and trying to fool myself into thinking ill be able to spot anything anyhow that was probably true george shook his head no that was almost certainly true it didnt keep him from staring at the sea till his eyelashes started icing up if he saw a periscope at last he concluded he wasnt going to see a periscope not even if a dozen of them were out there reluctantly he headed back toward the bulkhead from which hed been chipping paint one big difference hed discovered between the navy and a fishing boat was that you had to look busy all the time in the navy regardless of whether you were smoke poured from the ericsson s four stacks no one had ever claimed beauty for the destroyers design there were good and cogent reasons why no one had ever claimed beauty for it some people did claim she looked like a french warship a claim that would have been vicious enough to start barroom brawls during shore leave if it hadnt held such a large measure of truth enos picked up the chisel hed set down when the exercise began he went back to workchip chip chip he spotted no rust under the paint he was removing only bright metal that meant his work was essentially wasted effort but hed had no way of knowing as much in advance he went right on chipping he couldnt get in trouble for doing as he was told a chief petty officer swaggered by he had less rank than any officer but more authority than most for a moment he beamed around his cigar at georges diligence then as if angry at letting himself be seen in a good mood he growled you will police up those paint scraps from the deck sailor his gravelly voice said hed been smoking cigars for a lot of years oh yes chief of course enos answered his own voice dripping virtue since he really had intended to sweep up the paint chips he wasnt even acting propitiated the petty officer went on his way george thought about making a face behind his back then thought better of it long tours aboard fishing boats even more cramped than the ericsson had taught him he was always likely to be under somebodys eyes whether he thought so or not another strip of gray paint curled against the blade of his chisel and fell to the deck it crunched under his shoes as he took half a step down the corridor his hands did their job with automatic competence letting his mind wander where it would it wandered inevitably back to his family he smiled at imagining his son seven years old that was halfway to mansized by god and mary jane would be turning four he wondered what sort of fits she was giving sylvia these days shed hardly been more than a toddler when he went into the navy and of course he thought about sylvia some of his thoughts about his wife were much more interesting than chipping paint hed been at sea a long time but he didnt just imagine her naked in the dark with him making the mattress in their upstairs flat creak shed been different distant the last time hed got leave in boston he knew he never should have got drunk enough to tell her about being on the point of going with that colored whore when his monitor got blown out of the water but it wasnt just that sylvia had been different ever since shed got a job in the fishpacking plant more on her own less his wife he frowned as he tapped the chisel yet again he wished she hadnt had to go to work but the allotment she took from his salary wasnt enough to keep body and soul together especially not with the coal board and the ration board and all the other government bureaus tightening the screws on civilians harder every day to support the war then he frowned again in a different way the throb of the engines changed he not only heard it he felt it through his shoes the ericsson picked up speed and swung through a long smooth turn a few minutes later the chief petty officer came back down the corridor whyd we change course enos asked him which way are we heading now why damned if i know the chief sounded as if the admission pained him but i know which way were heading by jesus were heading south private first class jefferson pinkard sat in the muddy bottom of a trench east of lubbock texas staring longingly at the tin coffeepot above the little fire burning there the wood that made the fire had been part of somebodys fence or somebodys house not so long before pinkard didnt give a damn about that he just wanted the coffee to boil so he could drink it a few hundred yards to the south a couple of yankee threeinch field guns opened up and started hitting the confederate lines opposite them god damn those sons of bitches to hell and gone pinkard said to anybody who would listen what the hell good do they think theyre going to do theyll just kill a few of us and maim a few more and thatll be that theyre not going to break through shitfire theyre not even trying to break through nothin but throwin a little death around for the fun of it is all the nearest soldier happened to be hipolito rodriguez the stocky little farmer from the state of sonora was darning socks a useful soldierly skill not taught in basic training he looked up from his work and said this whole war it dont make no sense to me why you think any one part of it is supposed to make sense when the whole thing dont damn good question hip pinkard said wish i had me a damn good answer he overtopped rodriguez by nearly a head and could have broken him in half hed been a steelworker in birmingham till conscription pulled him into the army and had the frame to prove it not only that he was a white man while hip rodriguez like other sonorans and chihuahuans and cubans didnt fit neatly into the confederate states scheme of things rodriguez wasnt quite black but he wasnt quite white eitherhis skin was just about the color of his butternut uniform what he was pinkard had discovered was a fine soldier the coffee did boil then and jeff poured some into his tin cup he drank it was hotter than the devils front porch in july and strong enough to grow hair on a little old ladys chest but that suited him fine winter in texas was worse than anything hed known in alabama and hed never tried passing an alabama winter in a soggy trench either rodriguez came over and filled his cup too sergeant albert cross paused on his way down the trench line he squatted down by the fire and rolled himself a cigarette dont know where the dickens this war is getting to he remarked as he held the cigarette to the flames pinkard and rodriguez looked at each other sergeant cross was a veteran one of the trained cadre around whom the regiment had been formed he wore the ribbon for the purple heart to show hed been wounded in action that was about all that kept the other two men from braining him with the coffeepot pinkard couldnt begin to remember how many times over the past few weeks cross had made the same weary joke wearily pinkard pointed north and east town of dickens is over that way sarge he said christ i wish wed run the damnyankees back toward lubbock a ways just to get us the hell out of dickens county and make you come up with somethin new to say godalmightydamn cross said put a stripe on somebodys sleeve and listen to how big his mouth gets but he was chuckling as he sipped his coffee he knew how often he said the same thing he just couldnt stop himself from doing it and then with flat harsh unemphatic bangs us artillery began shelling the stretch of trench where pinkard and his comrades sheltered his coffee went flying as he dove for the nearest dugout the shells screamed in they burst all around blast tried to tear the air out of pinkards lungs and hammered his ears shrapnel balls and fragments of shell casing scythed by lying next to him in the hole scraped under the forward wall of the trench sergeant cross shouted leastways it aint gas yeah pinkard said he hadnt heard any of the characteristic duller explosions of gas shells and no one was screaming out warnings or pounding on a shell casing with a rifle butt to get men to put on their masks aint seen gas but once or twice here even as they were being shelled cross managed a chuckle with real amusement in it sonny boy this front aint important enough to waste a lot of gas on it and you know what else i aint a bit sorry neither before pinkard could answer rifles and machine guns opened up all along the line captain connolly the company commander shouted up get up and fight damn it everybody to the firing steps or the damnyankeesll roll right over us shells were still falling fear held pinkard in what seemed a safer position for a moment but he knew connolly was right if us troops got into the confederate trenches theyd do worse than field guns could he grabbed his rifle and scrambled out of the dugout yankee bullets whined overhead if he thought about exposing himself to them his bowels would turn to water doing was better than thinking up to the firing step he went sure enough here came the us soldiers across nomansland all of them in the world seemingly headed straight toward him their greengray uniforms were splotched with mud the same as his butternut tunic and trousers they wore what looked like round pots on their heads not the britishstyle iron derbies the confederates called tin hats pinkard reached up to adjust his own helmet not that the damned thing would stop a direct hit from a rifle bullet he rested his tredegar on the dirt of the parapet and started firing enemy soldiers dropped one after another he couldnt tell for certain whether he was scoring any of the hits a lot of bullets were in the air not all the yankees were falling because theyd been shot either a lot of them went down so they could advance at a crawl taking advantage of the cover shell holes and bushes offered sometimes a few us soldiers would send a fusillade of rifle fire at the nearest stretch of trench line that would make the confederates put their heads down and let the yankees pals move forward then the pals would bob up out of whatever hiding places theyd found and start blazing away in turn firing and moving the us troops worked their way forward pinkards rifle clicked harmlessly when he pulled the trigger he slammed in a new tenround clip worked the bolt to bring a cartridge up into the chamber and aimed at a yankee trotting his way he pulled the trigger the man in greengray crumpled pinkard felt the same surge of satisfaction he did when controlling a stream of molten steel back at the sloss works hed done something difficult and dangerous and done it well he worked the bolt the spent cartridge casing leaped out of the tredegar and fell at his feet he swung the rifle toward the next target in the fighting that made the headlines in southern kentucky or northern tennessee on the roanoke front or up in pennsylvania and maryland attackers had to work their way through enormous belts of barbed wire to close with their foes it wasnt like that in west texas however much jefferson pinkard might have wished it were hereabouts not enough men tried to cover too many miles of trenches with not enough wire a few sad rusty strands ran from pole to pole they would have been fine for keeping cattle from straying into the trenches against a determined enemy they did little good a roar in the air a long hammering noise screams running up and down the confederate line the us aeroplane zoomed away after strafing the trenches from what would have been treetop height had any trees grown within miles pinkard sent a bullet after it sure the round would be wastedand it was that aint fair he shouted to sergeant cross who had also fired at the aeroplane not many flying machines out here any moren theres a lot of gas why the hell did this one have to shoot up our stretch of trench damned if i know cross answered must be our lucky day stretcher bearers carried groaning wounded men back toward aid stations behind the line another soldier was walking back under his own power what the devil are you doing stinky pinkard demanded christ i hate that nickname christopher salley said with dignity he was a skinny precise little pissweed whod been a clerk before the conscription bureau sent him his induction letter he was at the moment a skinny precise wounded little pissweed he held up his left hand to display a neat bullet hole in the flesh between thumb and forefinger blood dripped from the wound i really ought to get this seen to dont you think go ahead go ahead pinkard turned most of his attention back to the yankees a minute or so later though he spoke to sergeant cross in tones of barely disguised envy lucky bastard aint it the truth cross said hes hurt bad enough to get out of the fight but thatll heal clean as a whistle shit they might even ship him home on convalescent leave that appalling prospect hadnt occurred to jeff he swore the idea of stinky salley getting to go home while he was stuck out here god only knew how far from emily then he forgot about salley for the us soldiers were making their big push toward the trench line the last hundred yards of savage fire proved more than flesh and blood could bear instead of storming forward and leaping down in among the confederates the soldiers in greengray broke and ran back toward their own line dragging along as many of their wounded as they could the firefight couldnt have lasted longer than half an hour pinkard felt a year or two older or maybe like a cat that had just used up one of its lives he looked around for his tin cup there it was where hed dropped it when the shelling started somebody had stomped on it for good measure it had a bullet hole in it too probably from the aeroplane he let out a long sigh amen sergeant cross said wonder when theyre going to start bringin nigger troops into line pinkard said wouldnt mind seein it i tell you save some white men from getting killed thats for damn sure you really think so cross shook his head to show he didnt half o those black bucks aint nothin but the red rebels who were trying to shoot our asses off when they rose up i think id sooner trust a damnyankee than a nigger with a rifle in his hands damnyankees you know theyre the enemy pinkard shrugged i was one of the last white men conscripted out of the sloss works so i spent a deal of time alongside niggers who were doin the work of whites whod already gone into the army treat em decent and they were all right besides we got any hope of winning this war without em albert cross didnt answer that at all iron wheels screaming against steel rails the train slowed to a halt the conductor worked his way through the cars calling out the destination philadelphia all out for philadelphia flora hamburgers heart thudded in her chest until this train ride she had never been out of new york statenever come to that been out of new york city but here she was arriving in the de facto national capital as the newly elected socialist member of the house of representatives for her lower east side district she wished the train had not come into the broad street station at night blackout curtains on the windows kept light from leaking out of the carsand kept her from seeing her new home the confederates night bombers were not hitting philadelphia so hard as the aeroplanes of the united states were punishing richmondthey had to fly a long way from virginiabut no one wanted to give them any targets at which they might aim her lip curled she had opposed the war from the beginning and wished her party had been more steadfast in opposing it after once supporting war loans the socialists had been unable to avoid doing it again and again no one sharing the car with her knew who she was several young officersand a couple of older men in business suitshad tried to strike up a conversation on the way down from new york city as was her way in such situations shed been polite but resolutely distant most of them were likely to be democrats and few if any were likely to be jews she wondered what living outside the crowded and solidly jewish neighborhood in which shed grown up would be like so many changes she got up put on the overcoat shed removed as soon as she boarded the car and filed off with everyone else be watching your step maam a porter with a face like a freckled map of ireland said as she descended to the platform broad street station was an impressive pile of brick terra cotta and granite it would have been more impressive without the cloth awnings that helped shield the electric lights inside from the air it would also have been more impressive had more of those lights been shining as things were walls and doors and windows barely emerged from twilight shadows leaped and swooped wildly as people hurried by how crowded it is someone behind her exclaimed she had to smile whoever said that had never seen the lower east side a man walked slowly along the platform holding a square of cardboard with a couple of words printed on it in large letters peering through the gloom she finally made them out congresswoman hamburger she waved to catch the mans attention then called here i am youre miss hamburger he asked at her nod his eyes widened a little with a shrug he tossed the sign into the nearest rubbish barrel his laugh was on the rueful side i knew you were young i didnt expect you to be quite so young he was probably twice her age an erect but portly fellow in his early fifties with a gray mustache and gray hair peeping out from under a somber black homburg i dont know what you expected she said a little more sharply than shed intended i am flora hamburger she held out her hand manfashion that surprised him again he hesitated a moment before shaking hands if hed paused any longer she would have grown angry his grip though proved pleasantly firm i am pleased to meet you he said and tipped his hat im hosea blackford oh she said now surprised in her turn the congressman from dakota she felt foolish shed expected the socialists to have someone waiting to meet her at the station but shed thought the fellow would be a local ward captain or organizer that a us representative another us representative she thought with more than a little pridewould come here had never crossed her mind i do have that honor yes he said shall we collect your baggage i have a motorcar outside ill take you to the flat weve found for you it happens to be in the building where i have my own flat so there is some method to the madness youve got your claim tickets i trust yes flora knew she sounded dazed it wasnt just because congressman blackford was meeting her here the idea of having a flat to herself was every bit as astonishing back in new york shed shared one with her father and mother two sisters a brother her other brother having gone into the army not long before and a nephew what would she do with so much space to herself what would she do with so much quiet a porter with a dolly wheeled floras trunks out to blackfords automobile a small sedate ford and heaved them into it the congressman tipped the fellow who thanked him in italianaccented english despite the chilly breeze floras face went hot she should have tipped the man herself but she hadnt thought of it till too late till now she hadnt been in a lot of situations where she was supposed to tip blackford cranked the engine into life it started readily which meant it hadnt been sitting long the headlamps had masking tape over most of their surface so they cast only the faintest glow out ahead of the motorcar congressman blackford drove slowly and carefully so as not to run into anything before he knew it was there thank you for taking all this trouble over me flora said above the fords grunts and rattles and squeaks dont make it out to be something bigger than it is blackford answered im not just taking you home im taking myself home too and believe me the socialist party needs every representative and senator it can lay its hands on if you have a strong voice you will be able to make yourself heard i promise you yes but how much good will it do flora could not hide her bitterness the democrats have such a majority they can do as they please blackford shrugged we do what we can lincoln didnt quote the scripture that says as your father in heaven is perfect be ye also perfect because he wanted people to truly be perfect he wanted them to do their best yes flora said and no more blackfords comment went over less well than hed no doubt intended for one thing the scripture lincoln had quoted was not floras and for another while lincoln had made the socialist party in the usa strong by bringing in his wing of the republicans after the fiasco of the second mexican war socialism in new york city stayed closer to its marxist roots than was true in most of the country blackford said i met lincoln oncemore than thirtyfive years ago it was did you now flora put more interest in her voice whether or not she agreed with all of lincolns positions without him the socialists likely would have remained a splinter group instead of overtaking the republicans as the chief opposition to the democratic party he nodded it changed my life id been mining in montana with no better luck than most i was taking the train back to dakota to farm with my kin and i happened to have the seat next to his we talked for hours till i came to my stop and got off he opened my eyes miss hamburger without him i never would have thought to read law or go into politics id still be trying to coax wheat out of the ground out west he inspired a lot of people flora said after losing the war of secession and having to yield independence to the confederate states hed inspired a lot of people to hate him too the ford stuttered to a stop in front of a fourstory brick building hosea blackford pointed west liberty hall is just a couple of blocks over that way its an easy walk unless the weather is very bad theyll swear you in day after tomorrow and the new congress will get down to business a doorman came over to the motorcar he nodded to blackford then spoke to flora you must be congresswoman hamburger very pleased to meet you maam im hank whatever you need you let me know right now i expect youll want your bags taken up to your flat dont you worry about a thing ill handle it and he did with efficiency and dispatch she remembered to tip him and must have gauged the amount about right for he touched a forefinger to the patentleather brim of his cap in salute before he vanished flora was amazed she remembered anything the flat was astonishing beyond her wildest flights of fancy all for herself she had twice the room her entire family enjoyedor sometimes did not enjoyon the lower east side congressman blackford stood in the doorway careful of convention he did not go into her flat he said im straight across the hall in c if hank cant help you with something maybe i can good night good night flora said vaguely she kept staring at all the space she was somehow supposed to occupy by herself she had thought the congressional salary of a yearfar far more than her entire family madethe most luxurious part of the position now she wasnt so sure opening the trunk in which shed packed her nightgowns she put on a long wool flannel one and went to bed tomorrow she told herself she would explore philadelphia the day after tomorrow she would go to work for all her good intentions she was a long time falling asleep not long after she did she woke up to the distant pounding of antiaircraft guns and the roar of aeroplane engines right overhead no bombs fell nearby so those engines probably belonged to us pursuit aeroplanes not confederate raiders when morning came she discovered the kitchen was stocked with everything she might want after coffee and eggs she found a shirtwaist and black wool skirt that werent impossibly wrinkled put them on along with a floral hat threw on the coat shed worn the night before and went downstairs hank was already on duty ill see that everything is pressed for you maam he promised when she inquired dont you worry about a thing ill take care of it you look like youre going out enjoy yourself i vote socialist too you know i hope you keep coming back to philadelphia for years and years she nodded her thanks more than a little dazed shed never had so much attention lavished on her no one in her family had ever had time to lavish so much attention on her out she went to see what philadelphia was like it struck her as being a more serious more disciplined place than new york city big forthright foursquare government buildingssome of them showing bomb damage others being repaireddominated downtown they were all fairly new having gone up since the second mexican war not only had the government grown greatly since then but philadelphia had taken on more and more of the role of capital washington though remaining in law the center of government was hideously vulnerable to confederate gunsand had in fact been occupied by the csa since the earliest days of the fighting liberty hall was another pile of brick and granite rather less impressive than the broad street station it looked more like the home of an insurance firm than that of a great democracy down in washington the capitol was splendidor had been till confederate cannon damaged it liberty hall stood near one of the many buildings through which the war department sprawled men in uniform were everywhere on the street far more common than in new york new york at most accepted the warreluctantly sometimes angrily philadelphia embraced it seeing that sobered flora she wondered how parochial her opposition would seem she stayed out all day when she got back she found her clothes unpacked pressed as promised and set neatly in closets and drawers nothing was missingshe checked seven cents in change lay on the nightstand it must have been in one of her trunks she dressed in her best tailored suit a black and white plaid for her first trip to the house despite her businesslike appearance a functionary in semimilitary uniform tried to keep her out of the house chamber saying the stairs to the visitors gallery are on your right maam i am congresswoman flora hamburger she said in a wintry voice and had the satisfaction of seeing him turn pale another uniformed aide took her down to her desk she looked around the immense chamber which was filling rapidly the only other woman in the house was a democrat an elderly widow from outside of pittsburgh whose husband had held the district for decades till he died a few days before the war broke out flora didnt expect to have much in common with her she didnt expect to have much in common with the plump prosperous men who were the majority here either though she did wave back when hosea blackford waved to her then she was on her feet with her right hand raised in a different fashion i flora hamburger do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of representative of the united states and will to the best of my ability preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states when she sat down again her face bore an enormous smile she belonged here it was official now to set this place to rights she muttered under her breath winter nights up in southern manitoba were long arthur mcgregor wished they were longer still if he lay in bed asleep he would not have to think of his son alexander executed by the us occupiers for sabotagesabotage he had not committed sabotage mcgregor was convinced he had not even planned he stirred in bed wishing he could sleep a big strong hardfaced scots farmer in his early forties his dark hair grayer than it had been before the war started grayer than it would have been had the yankees stayed on their own side of the border damn them his mouth silently shaped the words maude stirred beside him you cant bring him back arthur she murmured as if hed shouted instead of soundlessly whispering all you can do is make yourself feel worse rest if you can i want to he answered the harder i chase after sleep though the faster it runs away it didnt used to be like this maude lay quiet its because im right mcgregor thought before the americans came hed fallen asleep every night as if he were a blownout lantern farm work did that to a man it did that to a woman too maude hadnt lain awake beside him now worry and anguish fought their exhaustion to a standstill we have to go on maude said we have to go on for the sake of the girls julias turning into a woman he said in dull wonder thirteen god where does the time go and mary he didnt go on what hed started to say was mary would kill every american in manitoba if she could that wasnt the sort of thing you should say about an eightyearold girl even if it was truemaybe especially if it was true arthur maude began she fell silent again and then spoke once more whatever you do arthur be careful i dont know what youre talking about he answered stolidly been a goodish while since i let the horse kick me thats not what i meant maude rolled over turning her back on him she was angry she would have been angrier if she hadnt had to tell him that though he was sure of it eventually he slept when he went downstairs the next morning julia had oatmeal ready and fried a couple of eggs while he ate it the oatmeal and the eggs came straight from what the farm produced the coffee julia poured however hed bought in rosenfeld the nearest town he made a face when he drank it im sorry father didnt i make it right julia asked anxiously its as good as it can be he answered its about one part coffee to ten parts burnt roots and grain is all i expect the americans think theyre goodhearted for letting us have any of the real bean at all are you sure its all right julia said mcgregor was a serious man in a practical way as farmers have to be julia was serious too but more thoughtfully so shed been outraged at the lies the yankees were having the schools teach and even more outraged because some of her classmates accepted those lies for truth now she seemed to wonder if her father was trying to deceive her about the coffee im sure he told her your mother couldnt have made it any better that did reassure her mcgregor went on and no matter what else its hot the yanks cant take that from usunless they rob us of fuel too that is i wouldnt put it past them julia said darkly mcgregor wouldnt have put it past them either as far as he was concerned the americans were nothing but locusts eating their way through everything he and the rest of the canadians whose land they occupied had spent yearssometimes generationsbuilding up whatever fragments they happened to leave behind the canadians could keep his mouth twisted in what was not a smile he hoped such generosity wouldnt bankrupt them after finishing breakfast he put on his coat mittens earmuffs and a stout felt hat he was already wearing two undershirts under a wool shirt and two pairs of long johns under jeans thus fortified against the weather he opened the door slamming it behind him as fast as he could as always the first breath of outside air made him feel as if hed inhaled a lungful of knives and saws his work boots crunched in the snow as he made his slow way toward the barn the second breath wasnt so bad by the third the air was just cold hed felt it much colder he doubted it was any more than ten below this sort of winter weather came with living in manitoba a northsouth dirt road marked the eastern boundary of his farm most winters it would have been all but empty of traffic not this one nor the two previous big snorting white trucks painted greengray growled over the frozen ground hauling men and supplies toward the front south of winnipeg not far enough south of winnipeg mcgregor said under his steaming breath canadian and british troops still held the united states out of the link between the west and the more densely populated provinces to the east but the sound of artillery from the front was no more than a low mutter on the horizon not the thunder it had been the summer before when for a while hed hoped the yanks would be driven from his land horsedrawn wagons and columns of marching men supplemented the trucks mcgregor hoped the marching soldiers would all come down with frostbite some of them surely would the united states did not have winters to match these other trucks carried soldiers south away from the fighting ambulances with red crosses painted on their greengray side panels carried soldiers away from the fighting too probably for good any man hurt badly enough to need treatment so far away from the front was likely to be in bad shape mcgregor hoped so he went into the barn and tended to the livestock he didnt have so much livestock to tend as hed had before the war started us requisitions had made sure of that he milked the cow and fed it and the horse and the pigs he shoveled dung when spring came hed manure his acres as best he could he gathered eggs from under the chickens who squawked and tried to peck he put corn in a trough for them glad he still had corn to give before too long the work with the animals was done he could have gone back to the house and its warmth but it wasnt so cold in here the enclosed space and the body heat of the livestock brought the temperature up a good deal he took off his mittens and stuffed them into a coat pocket along with the animals he kept all sort of tools and supplies in the barn most of those tools were openly displayed hung on pegs above his workbench near the workbench lay an old wagon wheel a couple of wooden spokes broken the iron tire streaked with rust the color of old blood it looked as if it had lain there for a long time it was supposed to look as if it had lain there for a long time with a grunt he picked it up and leaned it against the wall a rake swept away the dirt under it the dirt that concealed a board which he heaved up and leaned against the wagon wheel under the board was a hole in which sat a wooden crate about half full of sticks of dynamite a couple of mediumsized wooden boxes and a small cardboard box of blasting caps a long coil of fuse and carefully greased against rust a fuse cutter and crimper mcgregor looked down into the hole with considerable satisfaction if captain hannebrink ever finds out ive got this stuff he puts me against a wall the same as he did alexander he said he whistled a couple of bars of god save the king to which the americans had written their own asinine lyrics well one fine day captain hannebrink will find outand wont he be surprised he laughed then contemplating revenge on the us officer who had arrested his son and later ordered the youths execution was one of the few things that could take the scowl off his face these days he picked up a blasting cap a couple of sticks of dynamite and the crimper and carried them over to the workbench a case waited for them there one more box made from scrap lumber and carefully varnished and smeared with petroleum jelly to keep moisture from getting in before he got to work on loading the explosives into it he blew on his hands till his fingers were as warm and supple as they could be when he was done working he set the bomb in the hole along with the crimper he put the board over the top of the hole then raked and swept dirt and straw onto it till it looked no different from the surrounding ground with another grunt he put the old wagon wheel back where it had been while it was there no searcher would step on the board and hear the hollow sound a footfall made he put on his mittens again then left the barn the tracks in the snow he had made coming from the house were still unchanged he grimaced as he started back as long as snow lay quiet he couldnt go out and use any of his toys not without leaving a trail that would lead captain hannebrink and his chums straight back to the farmhouse a blizzard he whispered hoarsely give me a blizzard god if the snow was falling fast and blowing hard it would hide his tracks almost as soon as he made them and if he did come across a yankee sentry then he would have bet on himself in the snow against any yankee ever born hed known canadian winters all his lifeand hed served his hitch as a conscript soldier too half a lifetime before he knew the tricks of the business businessinstead of going straight back to the house he made a detour to the outhouse he did his business there as fast as he could during winter a man thanked god if he was constipated the fewer trips you made the better the only advantage to winter was that it held down the stink he set his clothes to rights in jig time then started back to the farmhouse he was halfway there when he realized hed forgotten the milk in the barn cursing under his breath he went back and retrieved it when he went into the farmhouse the first breath of warm air inside was almost as shocking as going the other way had been what took you so long pa mary asked i was working he told his youngest daughter marys gingery eyebrows rose she knew how long his chores should have taken he didnt care not at the moment turning to his wife he asked what smells so good blackberry pieour own berries from down by the creek maude asked him no questions about why hed worked so long in the barn she never asked him any questions about things like that he didnt think she wanted to know but she never told him to stop either along with a good part of greenville south carolinas populationboth white and blackscipio spent a sunday afternoon in city park watching negro recruits for the confederate army practice marching and countermarching over the broad expanse of grass ho there jeroboam called one of the colored men who worked at the same textile mill as did scipio how you is is middlin he answered how you is titus jeroboam was a safer name than his own as scipio he had a price on his head the government of the confederate states and the government of south carolina would both hang him if they caught him hed been a leader in the revolutionary congaree socialist republic one of the many black socialist republics that had flared to life in the great uprising at the end of and been crushed one after another the following year bayonets glittered on the black recruits tredegars scipio wondered how many of those soldiers who now wore butternut had worn the red armband of revolution a year earlier without a doubt some had why were they serving the government they had tried to overthrow to learn what they had not known before what they would need to know to make their next uprising succeed or titus came up alongside scipio like scipios his hair had some gray in it he said wish i was young enough to jine up my own self them sojers when they gets out they be as good as white in the eyes of the law de gummint say so scipio answered dubiously de gummint need we niggers now de gummint don need we no mo what happen den his accent was thicker and richer than titus the accent of the swamp country down by the congaree river south and east of greenville when he chose he could also speak like an educated white before he unwillingly became a revolutionary hed been the butler at anne colletons marshlands plantation if god was kind he would never have to talk like a white man again if god was very kind he would never see anne colleton again titus said they git to vote dont they once theys done bein sojers they git to sit on juries dont they once theys out o the army de gummint say so scipio repeated i hopes de gummint tell de truth but it de gummint that got through to titus maybe so jeroboam maybe so they make a law today say one thing they make another one tomorrow say somethin else he pointed but the law they make today it give em niggers with guns niggers with guns they aint so easy to trifle with scipio nodded titus couldnt read and signed his name with an x but he wasnt stupid black men whod carried rifles and shown they could fight would be harder to cheat after the war was over maybe it was only because the negro had shown he could fight in the red uprisings that the confederate government had decided to put him into the line against the united states if the usa crushed the csa the confederate way of life was wrecked forever if the negro helped save the csa change would also come but perhaps less of it a white drill sergeant put the black troops through their paces by the right flank harch he barked and they went as one man to the right to the rear harch the recruits turned back on themselves by the left flank harch they changed direction once more eyesright their heads swung so that they looked into the crowd as they marched past scipio and titus count cadencecount onetwothreefour the negro soldiers shouted in unison calling out a number at every other step then they doubled the pace of the count one two three four one two three four companeeehalt the drill sergeant shouted his men might suddenly have turned to stone he nodded then looked angry at himself for betraying the slightest hint of approval presentarms the tredegars that had been on the negroes shoulders leaped in front of their faces held by both hands shoulderarms the rifles returned to the mens shoulders forard harch like a welloiled machine the company went back into motion after a few minutes scipio said is goin on home see you in de mornin titus nodded absently the soldiers seemed to entrance him the room scipio rented was large and cheap he kept it scrupulously clean that was a leftover from his days at marshlands though he didnt think of it as such all he knew was dirt annoyed him he bathed more often than most of his fellow boarders too he wished he had a bathtub in his own room the one down at the end of the hall would have to do though he read under the gaslight till six oclock then went downstairs to supper it was a stew of rice and carrots and turnips and okra and a little chicken a cook at marshlands who turned out such a stingy supper would have been looking for a new situation the next morning scipio ate a big plateful and said not a word since the illfated black revolt broke out hed learned a full belly however obtained was nothing at which to sneer his cheap alarm clock jangled far too early the next morning he shaved in cold water at the sink in his room put on wool pants and a collarless cotton shirt threw a cotton jacket over the shirt and plopped a flat cap on his head coffee and rolls were waiting downstairs the coffee was brewed from about as much chicory as the real bean but it made his eyes come open which counted for more the only word he had for the rolls was delicious thus fortified he made his way to the mill where he worked the morning was brisk but not so chilly as to make walking unpleasant he fell in with a couple of other negro men who worked at the same mill one of his friends told a lewd improbable and highly entertaining story about his exploits with several womenjust how many kept changing from one minute to another black faces streamed in at the entry gate only a few whites put salt among the pepper most of the white faces belonged to women the rest to men either unfit for service or too badly injured to go back into the military befo the war one of scipios friends said niggers couldnt get these here jobs cept maybe the dirtiest ones an the hardest ones they was all fo the buckra but nowadays the buckra all off fightin the yankees if us niggers dont do the work the work dont get did thats a fac scipio said he never expressed an opinion of that sort on his own to have done so might have drawn attention to him the more nearly invisible he was the better agreeing with what someone else said though seemed safe enough he punched the time clock and went to work throwing heavy bolts of butternut cloth onto a low cart with tiny wheels and pushing the cart from the enormous room where the cloth was woven to the equally enormous one where it was cut into uniforms he got three dollars a day up from the the mill had paid when he first hired on part of the increase was because wages were rising along with prices though not so fast the rest came simply from his staying on the job a lot of men started lasted a couple of days or a couple of weeks and quit some got better work elsewhere while others left the factory for the service at fortyfourgive or take a yearscipio was too old to join the service he wasnt particularly interested in better work either the job he had was hard but not too hard he had better wind and a slimmer waistline than hed owned back at marshlands he also had work that he did and did well without anyone giving him orders every other minute he hadnt learned what a luxury that was till his first factory job in columbia after hed managed to escape the collapsing congaree socialist republic before then all hed ever known were anne colletons endless commands and those of her brothers and in earlier days those of her father now all he had to do was shove this cart across fifty feet of bumpy floor unload the bolts of cloth and then pull the cart back and fill it up again he had plenty of time to think while he worked and his natural pace was fast enough to keep the foreman happy had the foreman pushed him he could easily have worked half again as hard the fellow never would have lasted as an overseer in the marshlands cotton fields at noon the lunch whistle blew scipio clocked out hurried to one of the many little greasy spoons across the street from the mill and bought a ham sandwich on freshbaked bread with homemade mustard sharp enough to bring tears to his eyes then it was back to the mill and an afternoon just like the morning his replacement on the evening shift a fellow about half his age named midas got there a couple of minutes before the shift whistle blew scipio was pleasantly surprised this was the first time in several days midas had been early they gossiped till the whistle screeched then scipio said see you in de mornin and headed for the boardinghouse supper that evening was another starchy watery stew this one eked out with bits of salt pork scipio wolfed it down as if he never expected to eat again then took the stairs to his room two at a time that got him into the bathtub ahead of any of the other four people on his floor feeling clean and contented he went back to his room to read and relax for an hour or two before he had to go to bed about half past eight someone knocked on the door when he got up and opened it he found two large white men outside they did not look friendly one of them pointed a large heavy revolver at his chest which seemed anything but friendly in a flat voice the other one said you are a nigger named scipio had scipio been white he would have turned pale no suh he shook his head violently is jeroboam is had de name all my born days passbook the white man holding the revolver said now were scipio white he would have flushed aint got none he admitted he put the best face on it he could hell of a lot of niggers aint got no passbook no mo de war de nasty uprisin frantically he wondered who had recognized him and turned him in titus one of the soldiers whod marched past him in the park he doubted he would ever know liar the white man with the pistol said his comrade whispered something to him reluctantly he nodded when he spoke again his tone was grudging we do want to make sure you really are scipio the red so we know were killin the right nigger and not letting him run loose to make more mischief so i aint gonna get rid of you now not unless you do somethin stupid like try and run so well take you to somebody who damn well knows who you are once were certain sure then we stretch your goddamn neck whoever say i aint jeroboam he a liar scipio declared anne colleton aint no he the white man without the gun said scipio had the presence of mind not to betray that he knew the name that helped now it wouldnt help for long the tough guy with the gun gestured come on the other one growled numbly scipio came sergeant chester martin wrinkled his long rather beaky nose as he made his way up the muddy zigzag of the communications trench toward the front line hed lived with mud and the stink of rotting meat and shit and garbage from the us invasion of the roanoke valley when the war was new till he got wounded the autumn before convalescing in toledo hed almost managed to forget the nature of the stench but it came back in a hurry he rubbed his chin which was as pointed as his nose now the united states were getting ready to invade virginia again this time from the north rather than the west in the early days of the fighting the csa had overrun maryland and southern pennsylvania before being halted on the line of the susquehanna the grinding war since then had driven the rebels back toward their own border now now the united states had bridgeheads south of the potomac on confederate soil martin trudged past a wrecked barrela confederate model with treads all around the hullfrom which army engineers were scavenging whatever they could a shell burst a couple of hundred yards to martins left he didnt bother ducking going home to heal hadnt made him lose the knack for knowing when an incoming round was dangerous and when it wasnt rifle and machinegun fire told him he was getting very close to the front the shooting was sporadic almost desultory neither side was pushing hard here not right this second a grimy tiredlooking fellow with several days growth of beard was leaning against the wall of the trench while he smoked a cigarette martin paused the soldier studied him he could read the fellows thoughts nearly clean uniforma point against new purple heart ribbona point for maybe even a point and a half because it explained the clean uniform sergeants stripesthree points against without a doubt but the stripes also meant the fellow couldnt safely ignore him sure enough after another drag on the handrolled cigarette the soldier asked you lookin for somebody in particular sergeant b company st regiment martin answered they told me back at division hq it was up this way they gave you the straight goods the soldier said with a nod matter of fact im in b company myself names tilden russell chester martin martin said russell looked him over again this time with more interest you dont mind me askin sarge whered you pick up your grapejelly ribbon there what kind of soldier are you the question meant what kind of action have you seen roanoke front martin answered crisply spent two years there till i took one in the arm in the rebs big counterattack last fall two years on the roanoke front russells eyebrows rose toward the brim of his helmet come on ill take you up to the line myself god damn you can play on my team any day of the week thanks martin hid a smile if hed come from arkansas or say sequoyah tilden russell wouldnt have wanted to give him the time of day let alone escort him up to the forward trenches compared to this front the fighting out west wasnt anything to speak of the fighting in the roanoke valley though didnt take a back seat to anything captain cremony russell called as he came into the frontline trenches and then to a soldier in a greengray uniform you seen the captain eddie this heres our new sergeantspent two years on the roanoke front he sounded as proud of that as if hed done the fighting himself yeah eddie looked impressed too he pointed to the nearest vertical jog in the horizontal trench he ducked into that traverse there last i saw him thanks come on sergeant russell led martin down the firebay toward the traverse some of the trench floor was corduroyed with wood some was just mud into which martins boots sank with wet squelching noises he rounded the corner on tilden russells heels russell let out a pleased grunt and said hey captain i found our new sergeant comin up to the line his names martin sirhe was on the roanoke front before he got wounded in spite of a fearsomely waxed upthrusting kaiser bill mustache captain cremony couldnt have seen his twentyfifth birthday he was skinny and swarthy and looked more like a clerk than a soldier but clerks didnt commonly have two oakleaf clusters under their purple heart ribbons roanoke eh he said youll know what its all about then i hope so sir martin answered you ought to fit in well the company commander said you mark my words sergeantwhen the weather clears up this front will see movement like nothing since the early days i hope so sir martin said again in the early days the confederates had been doing all the moving on this front he was willing to assume that wasnt what captain cremony meant about time too cremony said weve owed these bastards for two wars and fifty years now were going to get our own back yes sir martins voice took on real warmth my grandfather lost a leg in the war of secession he died before we got to pay the rebs back for that and for everything else next to what he got thishe waggled his armisnt anything worth talking about he listened to himself in something close to amazement after two and a half years of what surely came closer to hell than anything else man had managed to build on earth he could still sound like a patriot if that didnt mean he was crazy it did mean the united states had owed a hell of a big debt for a hell of a long time a debt of pain a debt of humiliation and if they won this time they would pay it back in the same coin martin didnt look forward to the fighting that lay ahead but the repaymentoh yes he looked forward to the repayment captain cremony said russell take him down the line to the section hell be leading the sooner he fits himself into the scheme of things the better for everybody yes sir tilden russell said you come with me sergeant its not far as soon as he and martin were out of earshot of captain cremony he added the one youre going to have to watch out for sarge is corporal reinholdt hes been running the section since sergeant kelly stopped a tredegar round with his ear and he was steamed when they didnt give him his third stripe ill take care of that martin said he didnt blame reinholdt for being steamed if you were doing a threestripers job you deserved a third stripe a file card with martins name on it must have popped up in the war department at just the wrong moment for reinholdt either that martin thought or the guy doesnt deserve two stripes let alone three hed have to see about that too quietly russell said here we are sarge then he raised his voice heads up you lugs this here is sergeant martin hes off convalescent leavespent the whole damn war till now on the roanoke front one of the men martin would be leading was stirring a kettle of stew a couple were on the firing step though they werent shooting at the rebels one was dealing from a battered deck of cards for himself and three friends a couple were cleaning their rifles one was repairing a tunic using a needle and thread with what martin could see at a glance was extraordinary skill a few were asleep rolled in blankets everybody who was awake gave martin a onceover he was a stranger here and so an object of suspicion and in a clean uniform and so doubly an object of suspicion he looked the men over too the tailor or whatever he was in civilian life was a kid so were one of the fellows on the firing step a cardplayer and one of the men working with gun oil and cleaning rod the rest martin guessed had been in the fight longer he looked around for corporal reinholdt and found him glowering at the cards he was holding reinholdt looked like somebody who spent a lot of time glowering martin decided to try it the smooth way first corporal i hope youll give me a hand getting to know people by way of answer reinholdt only grunted his eyes went back to his hand but kept flicking toward martins face martin sighed the smooth way wasnt going to work sooner or later hed have trouble with the disgruntled corporal he resolved to make it sooner and to pick the time himself holding in his temper martin spoke to the men of the section tell me who you are ill get it wrong for a while but not for long names washed over him willie and parker and zeb and cal and two guys named joe and one the fellow with needle and thread who seemed to be called hamburger that a first name or a last name martin asked and got a laugh from everybody except corporal reinholdt hey dont get him mad at you one of the joes said his sisters a congressmancongressladywhatever the hell they call her yeah and im queen of the may martin said that got more laughter but the soldiers said things like were not shitting you sarge she really is we aint lyin martin still didnt believe it pointing at the kid named hamburgerdavid his first name turned out to behe asked listen if your sisters in congress what the hell are you doin here she dont like you or somethin she likes me fine hamburger said through more laughter his swarthy face flushed she just doesnt think its right to use her job to make things soft for her family thats not why the working people elected her socialist martin thought from the way the kid said working people it didnt faze him about one soldier in three voted that way new york city he asked yeah hamburger nodded you can tell from the way i talk i bet right the first time martin said he would have tagged the kid for a dago from his looks but with that last name he was likelier to be a jew your old man a peddler nohe sews for a living same as me same as my other two sisters that explained the deft hand with a needle how about you sarge i was a steelworker in toledo before the war like my pa still is martin answered he makes the stuff and we throw it at the rebs that works out pretty good hey david hamburger nodded again martin thought hed get on here well enoughexcept he didnt like corporal reinholdts eyes thegreatwar breakthroughs anne colleton paced back and forth like a caged lioness in the little room shed rented in st matthews south carolina i will not go any farther from marshlands she snapped as if someone had insisted that she should a wisp of dark blond hair escaped from its pin and tickled her cheek she forced it back into place without breaking her furious stride the red uprising of had sent the marshlands mansion up in flames her brother jacob an invalid after the damnyankees gassed him died then too shed been in charleston when the negroes rebelled and unlike so many white landowners returned to her plantation after the revolt was quelled shed even managed to bring in a cotton crop of sorts and then god damn you cassius she said softly in the days before the war hed been the chief hunter at marshlandsand a secret red when shed thought the negroes there had no secrets from her in the rebellion hed headed the murderous outfit that styled itself the congaree socialist republic he still led a ragtag band of black brigands who skulked through the swamps eluding the authorities and calling murder and thievery acts of revolution they had friends among the negroes whod gone back to work at marshlands they had more friends among them than anne had imagined a month or so earlier on christmas night theyd come horrifyingly close to killing her i will have my revenge she said as shed said a hundred times since managing to escape i will have a knock on the door interrupted her she stormed over to it and threw it open what is it she demanded even though the delivery boy for the confederate wire service wore a uniform close in color and cut to that of the army he couldnt have been a day above fifteen years old the sight of a tall fierce beautiful blond woman twice his age glaring at him unstrung him altogether he tried to stammer out why he had come but words failed him after a couple of clucks a hen would have been ashamed to claim he dropped the envelope he carried and incontinently fled feeling triumph over so lowly a male would have demeaned anne she bent scooped up the envelope tore it open and unfolded the telegram inside regret no confederate troops available to aid south carolina forces in hunting down bandits hope all otherwise well gabriel semmes president of the confederate states she crumpled up the telegram and flung it into the wickerwork wastebasket that had come with the room you stingy son of a bitch she snarled i poured money into your campaign the niggers burned down marshlands and i still twisted arms to help get your bill for negro troops through congress and now you wont she broke off some of her rage evaporated the only reason semmes had wanted to arm negroes was that the war as it was presently being fought was going so badly it hadnt gone any better lately maybe the president of the csa really couldnt spare any decent soldiers to help the lame the halt and the elderly of south carolinas militia go after cassius and his guerrillas if they cant handle the job ill damn well have to take care of it myself she said somehow that didnt surprise her cassius had made the fight personal when he burned the mansion where her family had lived for most of a century hed made it even more personal when he tried to give her a bullet for christmas if thats how he wants it thats how hell have it she walked over to the closet slid the door on its squeaking track and scowled at the few sorry dresses and skirts and shirtwaists that hung there she was used to ordering gowns from paris and london and in peacetime new york what shed been able to buy in st matthews was to her eye one short step up from the burlap feed sacks poor negroes and shiftless whites used to cover their nakedness but after shed pushed aside the clothes she smiled against the back wall of the closet leaned a tredegar her surviving brother tom had sent on learning of her escape it was a snipers rifle with a telescopic sight shed been a tomboy as a girlgood training for competing against men as an adult she knew how to handle guns during the red rebellion the authorities hadnt let her fight against the negroes of the congaree socialist republic now now she picked up her handbag which held among other things a revolver to replace the one shed lost when cassius burned her cabin and went downstairs it was cool not cold whatever winter might do up in the usa it rested lightly on low country south carolina she headed for the haberdashers st matthews had been a cotton town before the war it was still a cotton townof sorts most of the nearby plantations were either corpses or crippled remnants of their former selves most of the white men in town were gone for soldiers or gone to the grave most of the black men were gone too drafted into labor battalions fled into revolt or now wearing butternut themselves only a little of the damage done when confederate forces recaptured the town from the congaree socialist republic had been repaired no labor for that and no money either by what sort of luck anne could scarcely imagine rosenblums clothes had escaped everything one of the bricks near the plateglass window bore a bright bullet scar other than that the place was untouched inside aaron rosenblum clacked away on a treadlepowered sewing machine as hed been doing for as long as anne could remember when the bell above the door jangled he looked up over the tops of his goldframed halfglasses seeing anne he jumped to his feet and gave her a nod that was almost a bow good day to you miss colleton he said good day mr rosenblum as always anne hid the smile that wanted to leap out onto her face whenever she heard him talk his accent half low country drawl half guttural yiddish was among the strangest shed ever encountered and what can i do for you today rosenblum asked running a hand over his bald head he would never go into the army he had to be nearer seventy than fifty i want half a dozen pairs of stout trousers of the sort men use to go hunting in the swamps of the congaree she answered he nodded these would be for your brother aftergod willinghe comes home safe from the war shall i alter them thinking he will be the same size he was when he went into the army im sorry anne said you misunderstand mr rosenblum these trousers are for me foryou his eyes went wide the lenses of his spectacles magnified his stare even more you are joking with me instead of staring he really looked at her no you are not joking butwhat would a woman want with trousers to go hunting in the swamps of the congaree she repeated patiently i cant very well do that in gingham or lace can i what would you hunt he asked still not believing reds anne colletons voice was flat and determined i will want these trousers as soon as you can have them ready they shouldnt be hard to alter to fit me im as tall as a good many men well yes but he blushed to the crown of his head then blurted my wife is visiting our daughter in columbia who will measure you again anne didnt laugh out loud go ahead mr rosenblum being so careful you wont take any undue liberties im sure of it and if you try ill give you such a licking you wont know yesterday from next week he coughed and muttered then blushed once more if you do this thing miss colleton will you wear a corset while you are doing it anne felt like giving herself a licking shed defied a lot of conventions but some she didnt even notice till someone reminded her they were there she dashed into the dressing room yanked the curtain shut and divested herself of boning and elastic when she came out she was so comfortable she wondered why she wore the damn thing fashion made a harsh mistress aaron rosenblum still hawed instead of hemming in the end though he did as she wanted in the end almost everyone did as she wanted he looked a little happier when she set two butternutcolored twentydollar bills on his sewing machine but only a little i still do not know if this is decent he muttered ill worry about that she answered by which she meant she would not worry in the slightest the telephone rang a few minutes after she got back to her room hello she said into the mouthpiece whatreallyyes bring him here well see greenville you sayyou should have him here by evening of course ill pay for train fare i want to get to the bottom of this too she hung the mouthpiece on its hook then let out a long sigh that was also a name scipio after hed fled columbia hed gone up into the northwestern part of the state had he now he was found out there too he knew how to get things done did scipio a butler who didnt know how to get things done wasnt worth having from things shed heard scipio had been cassius righthand man in the congaree socialist republic and a big reason it held together as long as it did what did she owe him for that after what the reds revolutionary tribunals had done to so many white landowners how many times did any official of the congaree socialist republic deserve to die waiting was hard even though she knew scipio was coming from more than a hundred miles away shed lighted the gas lamps before a knock sounded on her door she opened it the two whites who stood in the hall had the look of city policemen middleaged rugged wary wearing suits that would have been fashionable about but were dowdy now miss colleton one of them asked in an up country accent when she nodded the policeman pointed to the negro who stood hands manacled behind his back between him and his partner this boy the scipio you know maam she carefully studied the black man then slowly and regretfully shook her head im sorry but im afraid not there must be some mistake ive never set eyes on this man before in my life both white policemen stared at her in astonished dismay scipio stared too in equal astonishmentthough not dismaybut only for an instant then very smoothly he went back to playing the innocent wronged you see he shouted to the policemen i aint dat bad nigger i tol you i aint dat bad nigger shut up god damn you one of them growled perfunctorily he added sorry maam then he and his partner put their heads together anne looked at scipio he was looking at her shed known he would be you are mine she mouthed silently do you understand me his head moved up and downonly a little but enough you are mine she repeated and watched him nod again major abner dowling slogged through freezing tennessee mud from his tent toward the farmhouse where the general commanding the us first army made his headquarters dowling supposed the mud couldnt have been quite freezing in that case it would have been hard it wasnt when the generals adjutant lifted one booted foot out of the muck pounds of it came up stuck to the sole and sides for one of the few times in his life dowling wished he were seventyfive pounds lighter far more often than not hed found being fat mattered little and he dearly loved to eat but his bulk made him sink deeper into the ooze than he would have had he been thin puffing his way up onto the porch he paused to knock as much mud off his boots as he could cornelia the colored housekeeper the general had hired after first armys attack on nashville stalled the winter before would not be happy if he left filthy tracks in the hall and parlor even if she was a mulatto she was such a goodlooking young woman he didnt want her glaring at him delicious frying odors filled the air when he went inside he sighed not only was cornelia a finelooking wench she could cook with the best of them too neat in a white shirtwaist and long black skirt she came sweeping out of the kitchen mornin major she said the general and his missus they still finishin breakfast you want to sit yourself down in the parlor i bring you some coffee while you wait he knew he could have gone straight into the kitchen had he had anything more urgent than the usual morning briefing but he also knew the general would not appreciate being disturbed at his ham and eggs and hotcakes or whatever other delicacies cornelia had devised coffee will be fine he said she made good coffee too the parlor window gave him a good view of a couple of antiaircraft guns sitting out there in the mud and of the wet cold miserable soldiers who served them the rebs had stepped up bombing attacks against first army lately more pursuit aeroplanes were supposed to be coming but every army commander screamed for more aeroplanes at the top of his lungs cornelia brought him his coffee pale with cream andhe sippedvery sweet just the way he liked it thank you my dear he said she smiled at him but he was wise enoughwhich wasnt too far removed from saying old enough to recognize it as a smile of service not one of invitation dowling had taken only a couple of sips when the general commanding first army came out of the kitchen and made his slow way into the parlor his adjutant set the coffee on the arm of the sofa and heaved himself to his feet saluting he said good morning general custer good morning major lieutenant general george armstrong custer said as he returned the salute for a man of seventyseven custer was in fine fettlebut then most men of seventyseven were dead and had been for years locks peroxided a brassy gold spilled out from under the hat custer habitually wore to hide his bald head his drooping mustache had also been chemically gilded with a wheeze he sank into a chair then produced a gold cigar case from a breast pocket of his fancy uniform dowling had a match ready to light the cigar he took from it here you are sir he said custer drew on the cigar coughed wetly a couple of times and then settled down to happy puffing he blew out a cloud of fragrant smokeas a general he could get hold of far finer tobacco than the average us citizen no sooner had he done so than his wife came into the parlor that miserable thing stinks autie elizabeth bacon custer snapped now libbie its a fine cigar custer said in placating tones around his wife if nowhere else he took a soft line dowling understood that down to the ground libbie custer intimidated him more than the confederate army did tooand he thought she thought well of him cigars she said with a scowl on her round face taking the name of the lord in vain the scowl got deeper liquor now she looked ready to bite nails in half scuse me miz custer maam cornelia swept by round hips working under the skirt heres that coffee you asked for general she laid the cup on the table in front of custer then left the room with that rolling stride custers eyes followed her hungrily so did dowlings he couldnt help it and so did libbie custers when cornelia was out of sight libbie glared at her husband even more fearsomely than she had when she spoke of spirits she didnt speak now maybe because she couldnt find a word a lady could say that would express her feelings instead short and plump and determined she stomped out of the room herself custer sighed she will come up toward the front he said that made it harder for him to do what he wanted to do with cornelia dowling didnt know if hed done anything with the housekeeper before libbie arrived for that matter dowling didnt know if he could do anything with the housekeeper being after all seventyseven the only answer the adjutant gave was a shrug no matter what sort of crimp having libbie around put in custers plans dowling didnt mind it a bit hed noticed first army fought better when she cohabited with her husband the conclusion hed drawnthat she owned more than half the familys brainshe kept to himself looking around to make sure he was not overseen custer drew a flat silver flask from a hip pocket and poured some of its contents into his coffee magnanimously he held it out to dowling want an eyeopener major dont mind if i do sirjust a wee one dowling tasted the improved coffee ahh thats mighty good brandy isnt it though custer gulped down half his cup well lets get down to business shall we soonest begun soonest done yes sir dowling said custer didnt like minutiae which made dowling take a certain acerbic pleasure in giving him a bellyful our trench raids by cotton town brought in twentyseven prisoners last night sir the rebs tried to raid us near white house we beat them back pretty smartly only lost a couple of men and machinegunned a couple of theirs retreating through nomansland they threw some gas shells at us farther west north of greenbrier that could be trouble theyve brought fresh troops into the area and theyre liable to be planning a spoiling attack god damn them to hell custer growled thereby making a clean sweep of libbies shibboleths god damn the whole entente to hell and god damn president theodore goddamn roosevelt to hell too for sticking me here against the rebs when he knows id sooner pay the limeys and canadians back for what they did to tom yes sir abner dowling said resignedly he wondered how many times hed heard that from the general commanding first army often enough to be sick of it anyhow custers brother was thirtyfive years dead now slain in montana territory during the second mexican war custer and roosevelt hadnt got along with each other in the past thirtyfive years either each suspecting the other of stealing some of his glory he tried to steer custer back to the front where he commanded not the one where he wished he led if we could return to planning sir planning faugh custer made a disgusted noise once we smash through this line nashville falls because well be able to shell it to kingdom come one more push theyve stopped all the pushes weve tried so far sir dowling reminded him a sentence that covered thousands of dead and wounded and burning barrels by the score custers favorite strategy now as always in a career that stretched back to the war of secession was the headlong smash now the general commanding first army looked sly which alarmed abner dowling i think ive finally found a way to break through custer said really sir dowling hoped he kept all expression from his voice because if he didnt the expression that would have been there was horror generals on both sides in americaand on both sides in europe toohad been chasing breakthroughs since the war began with the same persistence and same success as men dying of thirst chasing mirages in the desert custer beamed which made his cheeks sag and his jowls wobble yes by jingo he leaned forward and set a liverspotted hand on dowlings knee much as he would have liked to do with cornelia and youre going to help me youll give me a combat assignment sir dowling asked eagerly hed longed for one since the war began the war department thought he was more useful as custers adjutant it was a nasty job but someone had to do it and dowling from long practice had got good at it but if custer himself wanted to put his adjutant into action evidently custer didnt he shook his head which made those lank locks of hair flip back and forth dowling coughed a little at the stink of the cinnamonscented hair oil custer liked nobody else dowling knew had used the nasty stuff since the turn of the century no no no custer said youre going to help me keep things straight with philadelphia ill be happy to edit your correspondence sir dowling said the generals correspondence needed editingmore than it commonly got custer was a firm believer in a variation on the ptolemaic theory he was convinced the world revolved around him anything good that happened anywhere near him had to redound to his credit and no one elses nothing bad was ever his fault in that as in few other things libbie aided and abetted him he was shaking his head again no no no he repeated i have something important in mind and i dont want those dunderheads with gold and black piping on their caps to get wind of it and tell me i cant do it because it runs against the way they read the bible exactly what is it you have in mind sir dowling asked with a sinking feeling gold and black were the branchofservice colors of the general staff whatever custer was thinking about it was something he already knew the war department brass in the city of brotherly love wouldnt love one bit ill tell you what i have in mind major custer said i have in mind the biggest goddamn barrel roll the world has ever seen thats what well i might have guessed dowling thought the tracked armored motorized forts called barrels were the best thing anyone had yet found for breaking the deadly stalemate of trench warfare they could smash barbed wire clearing paths for infantry and they could bring machinegun and cannon fire down on the enemy from pointblank range they also broke down about every five minutes and even when they were working didnt move any faster than a man could walk the adjutant chose his words with care sir doctrine specifically orders that barrels be spread out evenly along the front to assist infantry attacks wherever they may be carried out and what a lot of poppycock that is too custer declared as if he were the pope speaking ex cathedra the right way to use them is to build a whole great whacking column of them smash a hole in the rebs line you could throw a cow through and send in the infantry on their heelsa breakthrough qed when brigadier general macarthur came up with a similar plan sir you cited doctrine dowling reminded him you wouldnt let him do as hed planned daniel macarthur cares for nothing but his own glory custer said which was true but which applied in even greater measure to custer himself he knew the attack was weaker than it should have been but went ahead anyhow he deserved to fail and he did yes sir dowling said resignedly custer had done more than his share to weaken macarthurs attack because he did not want the youngest division commander in the whole army getting credit for the victory he might have won besides custer went on i aim to launch an armyscale assault not one on the scale of a division i intend to concentrate all the barrels in first army and hurl them like a spear at the confederate line it will break by god sir the war department will never let you get away with flouting doctrine like that dowling said if you try theyll confiscate your barrels and ship em to other fronts where the commanders are more cooperative i know the sly look returned to custers face thats where you come in me whatever was coming next dowling didnt think hed like it he was right in the reports first army sends to philadelphia custer said all the barrels will be lined up exactly as the idiots with the high foreheads say they should be youll vet corps and divisional reports tooin the interest of greater efficiency you know meanwhile we shall be readying the blow that will wreck the confederate position in tennessee once and for all abner dowling stared at him in dismay my god sir theyll courtmartial us both nonsense my boy custer told him youre safe as houses any which way because youre acting under my direct orders but even i need fear only if we lose if we win i shall be forgiven no matter what i do victory redeems everything and we shall win major my god sir dowling said again but then he paused hed dreamt for years of seeing custer ousted from the command of first army and replaced by someone competent now custer was greasing the skids of his own downfall and the general was righthis adjutant would only be obeying orders slowly thoughtfully dowling nodded all right sir lets see what we can do stout fellow custer exclaimed he winked at dowling stout fellow indeed dowling forced a smile the big white truck rumbled through the streets of covington kentucky toward the loading area by the ohio river wharves cincinnatus knew the streets of covington as well as he knew his name hed driven a delivery truck through them back in the days before the war started covington had changed since us forces wrested it from its confederate defenders but its streets hadnt one symbol of the change was the flag flying from the city hall as the negro drove past it for the past two and a half years the stars and stripes had fluttered there not the stars and bars if the usa won the war the stars and stripes would fly there forever kentuckyless a few small chunks in the south and southeast still in confederate handshad been readmitted to the united states after more than half a century out of the union guards in greengray stood guard in sandbagged machinegun positions in front of the city hall not everyone in kentucky was happy with its separation from the confederate states not even close to everyone in kentucky was happy with that separation cincinnatus sighed he knew that only too well damn i wish i never wouldve got sucked into all this crazy shit he muttered as the truck jounced over a pothole and his teeth clicked together confederate diehards black redswere kentucky still in the csa they would have been at each others throats as things were they both hated the occupier worse than they hated each other cincinnatus cursed his luck and his own generosity for making him part of both groups if only he hadnt hidden tom kennedy when the yankee soldiers were after his old boss but he had and so a soldier playing traffic cop held up a hand cincinnatus trod on the brake and shifted the white into neutral an officer in a chaufferdriven motorcar rolled past the soldier waved the truck convoy on again cincinnatus drove on up to the riverside pulled into the loading area and stopped the truck the engine ticked as hot metal began to cool he opened the door and climbed down onto the paving stones the air was thick with the exhaust of a lot of trucks in a small space he coughed a couple of times at the harsh stink more trucks rolled south on the bridge over the ohio between covington and cincinnati the confederates had dropped it into the river as soon as the war began but it was long since not only rebuilt but widened a stream of barges crossed the river too carrying the sinews of war from us factories toward the fighting front negro laborers unloaded the barges and hauled their contents over to the trucktransport unit of which cincinnatus was a part hed been one of those laborers till the head of the transport unit discovered he could drive since then hed made more money for less physical labor but his hours were longer and more erratic than they had been now that the front reached down into tennessee it was most of a days drive from covington he didnt like sleeping in a tent away from elizabeth and their baby boy achilles but nobody cared what he liked come on lieutenant straubing shouted get yourselves checked off you dont get checked off you dont get paid that blunt warning from their boss got the drivers moving into the shed to make sure the payroll sergeant put a tick by their names on his sheet about half the drivers were white the other half colored if a man could do the job straubing didnt give a damn what color he was for a while cincinnatus had thought that meant straubing had a better opinion of blacks than did most whites from either the usa or the csa he doubted that now more likely straubing just grabbed the tools he needed without worrying about the paint job they had even that attitude was an improvement on what most whites in the usa and the csa thought about blacks the line in front of the payroll sergeant formed solely on the basis of who got there first cincinnatus fell in behind a white driver named herk and in front of another white who because he wore his hair cropped close to his skull got called burrhead a lot they chatted amiably enough as the queue moved forward black or white they had work in common god only knows when poor smitty gonna get in cincinnatus said saw him pull off with another puncture that man go through more patchesn a ragpicker he aint lucky and thats a fact herk said hed be a hell of a lot luckier if the damn rebs didnt keep throwin nails in the road burrhead added course wed all be a hell of a lot luckier if the damn rebs didnt keep throwin nails in the road ill tell you whos lucky herk pointed at cincinnatus heres the lucky one cincinnatus had rarely heard a white man call him that but herk went on you and me burrhead well sleep in the barracks tonight hes going home to his wife that aint bad burrhead agreed cincinnatus collected five dollarstwo days pay herk got the same burrhead who hadnt been in the unit so long got four and a half some of the white drivers had grumbled because experienced blacks got more than they did some had tried to do more than grumble they were spending time at hard labor lieutenant straubing tolerated nothing that got in the way of his units doing its job a trolley line ran from the wharves to the edge of covingtons negro district over by the licking river on the east side of town cincinnatus set a nickel in the fare box without hesitation when hed been working on the wharves making a dollar or a dollar and a half a day hed almost always walked to and from his house by his standards of comparison being able to sit down in the colored section at the back of the trolley was affluence the trolley ran past the charred ruins of a general store cincinnatus wondered if conroy had been able to rebuild somewhere else the white storekeeper was one of the stubborn confederates still working against the us occupiers if he did get back in business cincinnatus expected hed hear from him he looked forward to that as much as he did to smallpox he might hear from conroy even if the storekeeper didnt get back into business he looked forward to that even less than he did to smallpox the fire that had gutted the store hadnt been an accident when he got off the trolley car he did not immediately hurry home as hed thought he would instead he paused and sniffed a delicious spicy odor hung in the air sure enough around the corner came the horsedrawn delivery wagon from the kentucky smoke house apicius barbecue palace apicius son lucullus was driving the wagon he waved to cincinnatus sell you some ribs tonight he called white teeth gleaming in his black face no thanks cincinnatus answered elizabeths got some chicken stew waitin for me when i get home lucullus waved again and drove on cincinnatus let out a small sigh of relief had lucullus asked him if he wanted redhot ribs that would have been an instruction to show up at apicius place all sorts of redhot things went on there apicius and his sons being reds themselves but not tonight tonight cincinnatus was free to be simply a man not a political man as neighborhoods in the colored part of town went his was one of the better ones the clapboard house in which he lived was neat and well kept as best he could given his color hed been a man on the rise before the war as best he could given a great many complications he remained a man on the rise now when he opened the door he grinned the chicken stew smelled as goodwell almost as goodas the barbecue lucullus hadnt called redhot tonight in the kitchen elizabeth exclaimed thats your pa dadadadada achilles came toddling out toward him on stiff legs spread wide an enormous grin spread over his face wide enough to show he had four teeth on top and two on the bottom cincinnatus picked him up and swung him around achilles squealed with glee then squawked indignantly when cincinnatus set him on the floor again his father swatted him on the bottom so softly that he laughed instead of crying elizabeth came out too and tilted her face up for a kiss you look tired she said she was still in the shirtwaist and skirt in which she cleaned house for white covingtonians so do you he answered they both laughedtiredly aint life bully he added they laughed again he had a pretty good notion of how the rest of the night would go theyd eat supper shed wash dishes while he played with the baby they would sit and talk and read for a little whilethey both had their letters unusual for black couples even on what had been the northern edge of the confederate states then theyd get achilles to bed and then theyd go to bed themselves maybe they would make love odds were better theyd fall asleep as soon as their heads hit the pillows though through the first half of the evening things went very much as hed expected the stew was delicious and cincinnatus said so your mother gits half the creditshe kept an eye on it and the baby while i was workin elizabeth said after dinner cincinnatus chased achilles around the house hoping to tire him out so hed fall asleep in a hurry sometimes it worked sometimes it didnt elizabeth was just drying the last dish when somebody knocked on the door whos that she asked frowning curfews comin id better find out cincinnatus strode to the door and opened it tom kennedy stood there as he had on the horrible night when his mere presence dragged cincinnatus all unwilling into the confederate resistance against us forces in kentucky as his former boss had then he gasped you got to hide me cincinnatus theyre right on my heels the sons of bitches who cincinnatus demanded christ if kennedy had led the yankees to him before the white man could answer a rifle shot rang out my god i am hit kennedy cried he clutched at his chest before he could fallas he surely would have fallenthe rifle cracked again the left side of his head exploded spraying cincinnatus with blood and brains and bits of bone behind him elizabeth screamed tom kennedy went down now like a sack of peas blood poured from him in a wet sticky flood over cincinnatus front porch in the barrel yard behind the us first armys front in northern tennessee mechanics swore sulfurously as they worked in the twin white engines that sent their enormous toys rumbling forward other mechanics were on their knees in the mud tightening the tracks that let the barrels go down into shell holes and trenches and climb out the other side armorers carried belts of machinegun ammunition and crates of twoinch shells for the guns of the traveling fortresses each one mounted not only a cannon but also half a dozen machine guns on a chassis twentyfive feet long and more than ten feet high they needed a lot of ammunition to fill them up lieutenant colonel irving morrell walked slowly along a path through the mud corduroyed with fence posts and house timbers and whatever other scraps of wood the folks who had made the path had been able to come up with he was a lean fit man in his midtwenties with a long face pale eyes and sandy hair he wore short when he wasnt paying attention to the way he walked he limped a little a reminder of the leg wound hed taken not long after the start of the war whenever he caught himself doing it he stopped and made himself walk straight the farther he went into the barrel yard the slower he walked and the more noticeable the limp became finally he stopped altogether and stood and stared in complete fascination he might have stood there for quite a while had a soldier coming up the path with a roll of tent cloth on his shoulder not found him in the way and in lieu of cursing him inquired may i help you sir thus recalled to himself morrell said yes if you please im looking for colonel ned sherrard that tent right over there sir the soldier answered pointing to one erection of greengray among many now if youll excuse me more slowly than he should have morrell realized hed been given a hint sorry he said and stepped aside the soldier trudged on he was shaking his head and muttering under his breath morrell had no doubt what sorts of things he was muttering either no corduroyed track ran toward the tent to which the soldier had directed morrell without hesitation he stepped off the path and tromped through the mud a couple of mechanics looked up as he squelched past them he caught a snatch of what one of them said to the other ficer not too proud to get his boots dirty he had been walking straight before he heard that he walked straighter afterwards as he neared the tent the flap opened and an officer came out a mediumtall wideshouldered fellow with a graying kaiser bill mustache and morrell saw eagles on his shoulder straps colonel sherrard sir he asked thats right the other officer answered and youd be lieutenant colonel morrell eh yes sir morrell saluted reporting as ordered sir among the other service ribbons above sherrards left breast pocket he noticed a blackandgold one showing the colonel had been on the general staff morrell had that same ribbon on his tunic sherrards service badge though was not the general staffs eagle on a star instead he wore a barrel pierced by a lightning bolt he was scanning the fruit salad on morrells chest as morrell looked over his morrell got the idea that what he saw didnt altogether please him and had trouble figuring out why without false modesty he knew he had a good record along with general staff service hed fought in sonora where he was wounded in eastern kentucky and in the canadian rockies hed distinguished himself in each of the latter two theaters too so why did sherrard look as if he smelled sour milk with what looked like a deliberate effort of will sherrard made his face altogether blank come inside lieutenant colonel he said lets get you settled in and see how we can best use you yes sir morrell ducked through the tent flap ahead of colonel sherrard who introduced him to his adjutant captain wallace and his clerk typist corporal norton either one of them might have been a power behind the throne off his first impression of sherrard morrell was inclined to doubt that the colonel to whom hed been ordered to report seemed to need no one to prop him up morrell accepted a tin cup full of muddy coffee then sat down with colonel sherrard to drink it sipping from his own cup sherrard asked so how did you happen to come down from general staff headquarters just now the question was so elaborately casual morrell knew it held more than met the eye for the life of him though he couldnt figure out what as he would have anyway he answered with the simple truth the more ive looked at things sir the more important barrels have looked to me i thought i ought to see some action with them besideshis grin made him look even younger than he wasrunning down the enemy in something as big as a house sounds like a hell of a lot of fun that got him the first smile hed seen from sherrard as a matter of fact it is when the damn things feel like running and when the rebs dont have a cannon handy and dont chuck a grenade or a whiskey bottle full of burning gasoline through one of your hatches if you knew beforehand whod win you wouldnt have to fight the war morrell replied with a shrug since you dont you take your chances that got him another smile a wider one youll have studied barrels some then i take it even if you havent served in them sherrard said after morrell nodded the older officer asked whats your opinion of our current doctrine on barrel deployment spreading them out widely along the line do you mean sir morrell said now he waited for sherrard to nod when the colonel did morrell went on sir i dont like it for beans the barrels give us a big stick as long as weve got it we ought to shellack the rebels with it ned sherrard set down his cup and folded his arms across his chest lieutenant colonel i will have you know that i was one of the people involved in designing barrels and that i am also one of the people responsible for formulating the doctrine in use for most of the past year if i ask you that question again will you give me a different answer no sir morrell said with a small sigh you asked my opinion and i gave it to you if you want to transfer me out of this unit thoughwell i wont be happy but ill certainly understand sometimes he wished he didnt have the habit of saying just what he thought sherrard kept his arms folded as if hed forgotten they were isnt that interesting he said more to himself than to morrell maybe i was wrong sir morrell said never mind colonel sherrard told him if you dont get it you dont need to know if you do get it you already know and youre sandbagging sir morrell said again now though he didnt really expect to get an answer he had a notion of what hed stumbled over an argument among the brass about how best to use barrels but doctrine was doctrine and the army clung to it as tightly as the catholic church did sherrard though turned out to be more forthcoming than morrell had thought he would you may be interested to learn that you and general custer have similar views about how barrels should be employed really sir that was interesting custer wasmorrell didnt know how old he was but he had to be older than god surprising he had any ideas of his own off what morrell had seen in philadelphia of his performance he didnt have many he just went straight at the rebs and slugged till someone eventually had to take a step back ill tell you something else you may find funny sherrard said morrell raised a questioning eyebrow in a halfshamefaced way the colonel whod served on the general staff went on god damn me to hell if i havent started thinking hes right too which also means i think you may be right lieutenant colonel as you put it if weve got a big stick we ought to clout the bastards with it really sir morrell knew he was repeating himself again but couldnt help it that eyebrowboth eyebrowswent up again this time in astonishment have you let the war department know youve changed your mind ive sent them more memoranda than you can shake a stick at sherrard sighed have you ever dropped a small stone off a tall cliff and waited for the sound it makes when it hits the ground to come back to your ears yes sir morrell replied the sound never comes back not if its small enough and the cliff is high enough he paused dealing with the war department can be a lot like that aint it the truth the colloquialism from sherrard surprised morrell yet again thats one of the reasons ive stayed in the field since i shepherded the first barrels down to this front the cliff isnt so tall here in the field theres less space between me and the enemy if you know what i mean oh yes sir i know exactly what you mean morrell answered sometimes i think our boys in the field have worse enemies in philadelphia than they do in richmond again he wished he hadnt been so forthright again it was too late he waited to see how colonel sherrard would respond sherrard didnt show much he got the distinct impression sherrard seldom showed much after a thoughtful pause the colonel said well you were crazy enough to want to serve in barrels lieutenant colonel now that youre here dont you think you ought to go for a ride in one so you can see how big a mistake you made yes sir morrell said enthusiastically i hear its quite something so it is a kick in the teeth is quite something too sherrards voice was dry general custer calls it the biggest sockdologer in the history of the world my father god rest his soul used to use that word i think it fits here come on you will too they left the tent and squelched through the mud to a barrel sherrard happened to know was in running order along the way the colonel commandeered a driver and a couple of engineers in case it doesnt feel like staying in running order sherrard explained in a real fight wed have two men on each machine guntheyre from the infantryand two artillerymen at the cannon with the barrel commander that made a crew of eighteen from three different branches of the army not efficient morrell remarked i know that toonow sherrard said here we are he stopped in front of a barrel done up in camouflage paint except for a fierce eagles head on the side and the name or motto remembrance above it one of the hatches was open climb on up into the cupola sherrard told morrell you will be the commander drive around a square and come back here morrell scrambled up into the small metal box atop the barrel he took the seat forward and to the right the one unencumbered by controls the driver sat in the other one when the engineers shouted that they were ready the driver stabbed the red button of the electric starter the engines grumbled then came to roaring life the driver yelled something to morrell he had no idea what the din was terrific incredible if the engines had mufflers they didnt work exhaust fumes promptly filled the barrel morrell coughed his eyes smarted what combat would be like in here with the machine guns and cannon blazing away adding their racket and the stink of burnt smokeless powder he didnt want to think hell seemed a reasonable first approximation after checking to make sure both reverse levers behind his seat were in the forward position the driver got the barrel moving by stepping on the clutches to both engines putting the beast in gear and opening the throttle on the steering wheel he knew the course he was supposed to steer if he hadnt hand signals would have been the only way to give it to him he couldnt have heard shouted orders the barrel rode as if its springsif it had anywere made out of rocks morrell bit his tongue twice and his lower lip once with the window slits open he could see a little with them closed he could see next to nothing a cough a groan a wheeze silence into it the driver said were back sir what do you think get me the devil out of here sprang to mind morrell suppressed it he had after all volunteered for this he said we need better controls and signals in the barrel the driver nodded agreement only a maniac would have disagreed on the other hand only a maniac would have wanted to climb into a barrel in the first place for the first time since the summer of the army of northern virginia was fighting in northern virginia not in pennsylvania or maryland these days instead of threatening philadelphia the fighting force whose ferocious onslaught had brought the confederacy more glory than any other was reduced to defending the state for which it was named against the endless grinding pressure of the us army sergeant jake featherston had his battery of the first richmond howitzers well positioned just in front of the little town of round hill about fifteen miles south of the potomac the hill on which round hill sat had looked out on prosperous farming country all around prosperous farming country still lay to the south to the north lay the infernal landscape of war shell holes and trenches and barbed wire in great thick rusting belts and shattered trees a scrawny fiercely intent man featherston stalked from one of the halfdozen quickfiring threeinch gunscopies of the famous french she commanded every other battery commander in the regiment was a lieutenant or captain as far as jake knew every other battery commander in the cs army was a lieutenant or captain hed die a sergeant even if he died at the age of bastards he muttered under his breath as he relentlessly checked guns and carriages and limbers and stored ammunition and horses and men fucking bastards hed warned against captain jeb stuart iiis negro body servant his former superior had protected the colored man whose main color turned out to be red the war department had never forgiven jake for being right now that stuart had thrown his life away in battle to atone for the disgrace the war department never would not when jeb stuart jr jeb iiis father sat behind a richmond desk with a generals wreathed stars on his collar featherston had taken command of the battery when jeb stuart iii died hed kept it because he was obviously better at the job than the officers who led the rest of the batteries in the regiment but was that enough to get the stripes off his sleeve and a bar or two or three on his collar he spat in the mud not likely he went back to his own gun the one whose crew hed led since the first richmond howitzers got word of the declaration of war and started throwing shells across the potomac into washington dc it was the same gun only in the sense that george washingtons axe was the same axe after four new handles and three new heads it had gone through several barrels a new breech block and even a new elevation screw he didnt care it was his all the men who served it were new except for him too a devastating yankee barrage up in pennsylvania had killed or maimed everybody in the original crew but him nobody here was green though not any more the loader the gun layers the shell heavers had all had plenty of time to get good at what they didplenty of time and the not so occasional prod of the rough side of jakes tongue michael scott the loader looked up from a cigarette he was rolling hows it going sarge he asked it aint ever gonna be what you call great featherston answered even in his own ears he sounded harsh and uncultured that was yet another reason he hadnt been promoted he sounded like a man whose father had been an overseer till the csa manumitted its negroes a proper officer now had an accent almost as fancy as an englishmans thats what the war department thinks anyway he scowled far as theyre concerned how a man sounds is more important than how he acts bastards scott got the cigarette rolled and struck a match hed been a freshfaced kid when he came into the battery he wasnt a freshfaced kid any more he had hollow eyes and sallow cheeks and he hadnt shaved for a couple of days pointing north he said looks like the damnyankees are building up for another go at us featherston looked in that direction too i see what you mean he said slowly he couldnt see as much as he would have liked not without the fancy field glasses that were in such chronically short supply in the cs army but the naked eye was plenty to catch the bubble and stir behind the yankee lines something was going on sure as hell scott sucked in smoke the inhalation made him look even more gaunt than he really was heard anything he asked nary a word featherston shook his head you got to understand they aint gonna tell me first no matter what only way i hear about it first is if theres shit on the end they give me to grab yeah sarge i know about that scott allowed the whole battery knew about that still and all though youve got that pal over in intelligence so i was just wondering if hed said anything nary a word jake repeated and major potter isnt a palnot exactly anyhow as far as he could see the only thing he and the bespectacled major had in common was an unbounded contempt for the bluebloods who because of who their grandfathers had been got higher rank and a bigger arena in which to display their blunders than they deserved all right the loader eased off the whole battery also knew not to get featherston started or he was liable to go on for hours scott looked around what worries me is that it doesnt look like were building up to match em sure the defense has an advantage but still yeah featherstons voice was rough we kill two damnyankees for every one of us they get thats bully but if they send three or four at us for every one weve got holdin em back sooner or later they run us out of our position thats the truth scott said they got more o those damn barrels than we do too and they scare the infantry fit to shit themselves wish i could see some barrels over yonder jake said if i could see em we could try hittin em or if we couldnt reach we could send word back to division hq and let the big guns have a go at em he spat again then asked your gas helmet in good shape sure as hell is scott slapped the ugly hood of gasproofed canvas he wore on his left hip yankees fight dirty as the devil you ask me throwing gas shells at us when they start a barrage and making us fight while were wearing these goddamn things i aint gonna argue with you on account of i reckon youre right jake said course now that they went and thought of it for us we do the same to them every chance we get if we had any brains back there in richmond wedve figured it out for our own selves but you look at the way this here wars been run and youll see what a sorry hope that is he would have gone onthe idiocy of the war department roused him to repeated furious tiradesbut the sound of marching men heading north up the dirt road from round hill toward the front made him break off and look back over his shoulder michael scott looked up toward the crest of the hill too relief on his face they are giving the line some reinforcements the loader said i thank you jesus ill sing hallelujah come sunday over the hill and down toward the guns of the battery came the head of the column jake started to look away hed seen any number of infantry columns moving up toward the battle line here though his head snapped back toward the oncoming soldiers he stared and stared that the troops were new and raw that their uniforms were a fresh butternut as yet clean as yet unfaded and unwrinkled from too many washings in harsh soap and too many delousings that didnt workthat didnt matter hed seen raw troops before and knew the edges would rub off in a hurry but these men all save their officers and noncoms had skins darker than their uniforms some coffee with cream some coffee without some almost the black of midnight or a black cat on they tramped tin hats on their heads tredegars on their shoulders packs on their backs gas helmets bouncing against their hipbones they were big rugged men and marched well a couple of them turned their heads for a better look at featherstons field gun noncoms screamed abuse at them the same sort of abuse they would have screamed at raw white troops foolish enough to turn their heads without permission only when the whole regiment had marched past could jake bring himself to speak even then he mustered nothing more than a whisper hoarse with anger and disbelief jesus god were going to have nigger infantry in front of us what in blazes are they gonna do the first time a barrel comes at em shit on a plate barrels scare white troops niggersll run so fast theyll leave their shadows behind and then there wont be nothin between the barrels and us i dont know sarge scott said i dont reckon they wouldve put em in the line if they didnt reckon theyd get some fighting out of em i dont reckon they wouldve put em in the line if they had any white men they could use instead jake retorted to which his loader gave a rueful nod he went on oh some of emll fighti expect youre right about that some of em not so long ago they was fightin under red flags so yeah theyll fight only question is whose side will they fight on do you reckon the yankees want those black sons of bitches any moren we do scott asked that gave featherston pause but not for long anything thatll take us down a pegll be fine by the yanks i expect he answered if wed known itd come down to this we never wouldve gotten into the war in the first place i reckon after its done those niggersll have the right to vote i tell you did you ever imagine in all your born days that niggers in the confederate states of america would have the right to vote no sarge never once scott said wars torn everything to hell the war featherston agreed the war and the boneheads down in richmond running the war oh and the niggers tootalk about tearing things to hell when they rose up they almost tore the csa to hell and now the boneheads in richmond are putting rifles in their hands and saying yeah youre as good as white men why the hell not well therell be a reckoning for that too he sounded eerily certain you mark my wordstherell be a reckoning for that too shivering in a trench outside jonesboro arkansas a us soldier grumbled where in the goddamn hell did i leave my gloves thou shalt not take the name of the lord in vain groome sergeant gordon mcsweeney said sharply uh right sergeant groome answered sorry sergeant he was eighteen a big tough beeffed kid from the plains of nebraska rank though had very little to do with why he backed down from mcsweeney you need to make your peace with god not with me mcsweeney answered his voice still stern groome nodded hastily placatingly had he been a dog he would have rolled over on his back to expose his throat and belly with a grunt mcsweeney went back to making his flamethrowers trigger mechanism more sensitive that he took a flamethrower into combat was not the reason he got instant unthinking obedience from the soldiers in his section that he was the sort of man who carried a flamethrower into battle with not a thought in his mind but the harm he could wreak on his enemies had more to do with it he scowled as he worked his face was made for scowling being almost entirely vertical lines a narrow rectangle with a hard chin a long nose and a vertical crease between pale eyes that didnt seem to blink as often as they should his hands large and knobbyknuckled manipulated a small screwdriver with surprising delicacy a shadow fell on the disassembled trigger mechanism he looked up with a deeper scowlwho presumed to stand in his light when he saw captain schneider he relaxed the company commander could do as he pleased at least when it came to gordon mcsweeney sir mcsweeney asked and started to get to his feet as you were schneider said mcsweeney obediently checked himself as far as he was concerned captain schneider was too lenient with all the men in his company mcsweeney himself included but the captain had ordered him not to come to attention and so he did not division headquarters wants some captured rebs tonight for interrogation schneider said yes sir ill go mcsweeney said at once captain schneider frowned i didnt mean you in particular sergeant he said i meant for you to tell off a party to go into nomansland and come back with prisoners sir ill go mcsweeney repeated the men gideon took with him to fight the midianites chose themselves i shall do the same the lord will protect meor if it be his will that i fall here i shall go on to my glory for i know in my heart that i am numbered among the elect he was every bit as uncompromisingly presbyterian as his features suggested schneiders frown did not go away i dont want to lose you sergeant he said youre too valuable a fighting man and your courage is not in question it hardly could be with that on your chest even on his combat uniform mcsweeney wore the small whitestarred blue ribbon of the congressional medal of honor hed earned it the year before destroying a confederate barrel with his flamethrower and then slaying rebel foot soldiers whod sought to follow the barrel into the us lines sir he said now snaking out prisoners is a job im better suited for than anyone else in the company why endanger somebody else when i can do it right how many times have you done it though sergeant schneider persisted how long can you go on being lucky as long as god wants me to be mcsweeney answered he did get to his feet then so he could look down at the company commander whom he overtopped by several inches sir you must understand i want to do this how better can i help the lord punish the confederate states for their iniquities had schneider had a good response to that he would have given it at once when he didnt mcsweeney smiled at him mcsweeney knew most men did not find his smile delightful schneider was no exception he flinched away from it as from the screech of an incoming confederate shell have it your way then sergeant he muttered and went walking down the trench in a hurry mcsweeneys smile changed to the somewhat softer one any successfully stubborn soldier might have worn he squatted down and got back to work on the trigger mechanism by the time ben carlton shouted that he had supper ready the trigger was nearly as smooth as mcsweeney wanted it he made a horrible face at his first mouthful of stew what is it he demanded is it donkey or cat dammit its beef carlton said offended dont blaspheme mcsweeney told him how is it that youve been a cook since the war started and still do no better than this because paul mantarakis did it till he got killed last summer and he was a better cook than ill be if i live to be ninetyfive which aint what youd call likely carlton retorted stinkin shame hes dead too he was a good man for a papist mcsweeney admitted from him no small concession he werent no catholic the company cook said he was greek whatever the devil you call it the devil has him now i fear mcsweeney said mantarakis had fiddled with beads so what else could he have been but a papist with grim resolution mcsweeney finished his bowl of stew with luck the confederates he captured would have rations worth taking he didnt crawl out over the parapet of the trench till a little before midnight before he went he blacked his face and hands with mud so that he looked like a performer in some disastrous minstrel show he had an officers pistol on his belt but hoped he wouldnt have to use it he put more faith in his knife and entrenching tool getting under and through the few strands of barbed wire in front of the us trenches was easier than it should have been the united states didnt take the war west of the mississippi so seriously as he thought they should have the us advance south from the missouri line had proceeded at a snails pace because too many resources went into the fighting closer to philadelphia a parachute flare went off overhead bathing the hellish chaos of nomansland with a pure white light that might have come straight from heaven mcsweeney froze as the light slowly sank and dimmed and reddened confederate and us gunners blazed away at what they thought were targets bullets whined and occasionally screamed as they ricocheted from rocks none came close to him mcsweeney waited till darkness was complete before moving again when he did move he moved fast or as fast as he could taking advantage of the little while before mens eyes forgot the light by the time he flopped down in a shell hole not far from the confederate wirewhich was hardly thicker than that protecting his linehe was filthy and wet he was also satisfied he settled down to listen and to wait the rebs were far noisier than he let the men in his charge get they would have pickets up near the line he knew about where the foxholes were if all else failed he would go in there and bring a couple of those men back through he didnt want to do that being coldbloodedly aware of the risk it entailed but hed been ordered out to return with prisoners and he would he waited a while longer maybe the confederates would send out a wiring partyalthough they had as much trouble getting supplies as did their us opponents so they might not have any fresh wire to string up wiring parties made easy meat they were so intent on what they were doing they paid less attention than they should have to whoever might be sneaking close to them above mcsweeney stars slowly spun now in plain sight now hidden by scudding clouds at about half past two several rebs crawled northwest toward the us lines they passed within twenty feet of him never knowing he was there in a thin thread of whisper one of them told the others remember we catch ourselves a damnyankee or three then we get the hell back home this aint the mission for foolin around mcsweeneys smile was enormous predatory the lord hath delivered them into my hands he thought they were very quiet as they slid toward the position hed left he was silent as he followed them or so he thought till their rearmost man hissed hush whats that mcsweeney froze as he had for the parachute flare after a couple of minutes in which no one seemed to breathe the rebel said must have been a rat christ i hate them fatbellied sons of bitches i know what they eat with a faint rustle of cloth he crawled on again mcsweeney followed trying to be even more quiet than before the confederate raiders took up a position almost identical to the one hed used in front of their trenches before they could scatter along the line mcsweeney spoke in quiet but conversational tones hold it right there boys weve got you dead to rights if you want to keep breathing throw down your toys throw up your hands and go on through the wire that weve had the desired effect it made the rebels think they were outnumbered by their captors instead of outnumbering their captor one of them started to whirl another one grabbed him and said no you goddamn fool weapons clunked and thudded to the ground coming in with prisoners mcsweeney called captain schneider was awake and waiting for him he stared when he saw the halfdozen men coming in ahead of mcsweeney god damn me to hell sergeant but youve done it again he said mcsweeney nodded though he disapproved of the blasphemous sentiment when the confederates found out one man had taken them their curses were far fouler than schneiders gordon mcsweeney smiled thegreatwar breakthroughs do you see lucien galtier asked his horse as he drove the wagon into the town of riviereduloup on the southern bank of the st lawrence the quebecois farmer gestured to the macadamized road along which the wagon traveled had this been an earlier year you would have labored through ice and mud and you would have complained even more than you do now the horse snorted a paved road even a paved road largely free of snow impressed it very little one of the reasons the road was largely free of snow was that it was an important highway for the us forces who occupied that part of quebec south of the st lawrence a big square ugly white truck came growling up behind the wagon the driver squeezed the bulb on his horn just enough shoulderfrozen hard herehad been cleared to let lucien pull off for a moment so the truck and three more in its wake could roll past kicking up little spatters of ice hey frenchy called one of the soldiers huddled under the greengray canvas top on the last truck he waved after a couple of seconds hesitation galtier touched the brim of the thick wool cap he wore he flicked the reins do not think you can rest here all day you lazy creature he told the horse which flicked its ears to let him know it would think whatever it pleased and needed no advice from the likes of him a greengray ambulance with red crosses on the sides and roof sped south past galtier the military hospital to which it was going was built on land that had been his till the yankees appropriated it because hed politely declined to collaborate with them how fury had burned in him at the injustice and now and now the eldest of my daughters assists at the hospital he said to the horse and one of the american doctors by no means a bad fellow is most attentive to her life can be most peculiar nestce pas he patted his own leg dr odoull had sewn that up too when hed tried to chop it instead of wood it had healed well too better and faster than hed thought a wound of twentyone stitches would the breeze shifted so that it came out of the north it brought to luciens ears the rumble of artillery from the other side of the broad river the americans having forced a crossing in better weather the year before had bogged down in their drive south and west toward quebec city tabernac galtier muttered under his breath quebecois cursing ran more to holy things than to the obscenity englishspeakers used but hed learned englishstyle swearing in his stint as a conscript more than twenty years before while the americans here sometimes seemed to go out of their way to curse experimentally he let an english swear word roll off his tongue fuck he shook his head it lacked flavor like rabbit cooked without applejack a handful of fresh muddy craters just outside of riviereduloup marked a bombing raid the night before by canadian and british aeroplanes he didnt see that theyd done any particular damage they did keep trying though pockmarks in the snow cover showed where other earlier bombs had fallen so did a couple of graveled patches in the paving of the roadway in town galtier drove the wagon to the market square near the church he quickly sold the potatoes and chickens hed brought from the farm and got better prices than hed expected angelique the prettiest barmaid at the loupdunord who for once did not have an american soldier on one arm or on both arms bought a chicken his eyes traveled her up and down as they dickered marie his wife would not have approved but she hadnt come with him because angelique was so pretty he might have given her the chicken for a few cents less than someone else would have paid marie would not have approved of that either in her breathy little voice angelique said have you heard the wonderful news how can i know until you tell me lucien asked reasonably father pascal is to be consecrated sunday after next angelique exclaimed riviereduloup after so long is to be a bishopric an episcopal see is it not marvelous yes galtier said though what he meant was yes it is not marvelous father pascal was plump and pink and nearly as clever as he thought he was he had welcomed the yankee invaders with arms as open as angeliques had he been a woman he would no doubt have welcomed them with legs as open as angeliques and here he came now perhaps drawn by the sight of angelique even if a priest even if a collaborator he was a manof sorts or perhaps by that of poultry the latter it proved he did not haggle so well as his housekeeper lucien roundly cheated him angelique bless her stood by and said never a word feeling mellow with an extra thirty cents in his pocket galtier said do i understand you are to be congratulated father the priest looked too modest to be quite convincing they honor me above my humble deserts how did it happen that you were raised to this dignity lucien asked before father pascal answered his eyes flicked for a moment to the sidewalk close by the market square then still smooth still modest he said my son in truth i have no idea i felt when i heard the news as if a thunderbolt had struck me i was so astonished but that brief glance had given him away along the sidewalk his greengray uniform neat as if it had just been issued strode major jedediah quigley who administered riviereduloup and the surrounding area for the us army somehow or other lucien was sure quigley had pulled the wires behind father pascals promotion that might even have involved moving riviereduloup and the rest of eastern quebec south of the st lawrence out of the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the archbishop of quebec city who assuredly would never have raised a collaborator to the episcopal dignity major quigley saw lucien look toward him the american officer waved as if he had not been the man who confiscated the land that had been in luciens family for more than two hundred years to build the military hospital on it i hope all goes well with you monsieur galtier he called in fluent parisianaccented french that seemed almost as out of place in riviereduloup as english did assez bien galtier answered grudgingly quigley waved again and walked on you will excuse me father pascalsoon to be bishop pascalsaid off he went carrying the chicken by its feet angelique went off with him their heads were close together as they chatted watching her walk away was more interesting than eyeing father pascals backside even if she too was a collaborator of sorts a horizontal collaborator galtier thought and smiled at his own wit he looked longingly at the loupdunord beer or whiskey or applejack would have helped chase away the cold but no the loupdunord these days was an american soldiers saloon he might get his drink and get out without trouble on the other hand a tableful of drunken yanks might decide to stomp him into the floor when i get home he told the horse i can have a drink on his way back to the farmhouse down the fine paved road the americans had built he had to pull off a couple of times to let ambulances race past far more than that of the big stolid trucks their speed made him wonder what traveling in a motorcar was like hed taken train rides but this seemed as if it would be differentas if he would be riding in a wagon somehow equipped with wings when he got to the farm he drove the emphatically unwinged wagon into the barn he unharnessed the horse brushed it down and fed it before going into the farmhouse he did not begrudge the delay it gave him the chance to think of more uncharitable things to say about father pascals elevation and then when he went inside he found he could not say most of them nicole had brought dr leonard odoull home for supper odoull a skinny sandyhaired man with eyes as green as a cats was a good fellow but he was also to some degree an outsider your leg it goes well he asked galtier after they shook hands he spoke parisian french like major quigley unlike the major he tried to adapt his tongue to that of the folk among whom he found himself it goes very well thank you lucien walked around to show how well he could move i have not even a limp not unless i am on it for the whole day when i went into riviereduloup today i did not take the stick you gave me and the leg held me as if it had never been hurt i am in your debt not for that odoull said it is i who am in your debt for your friendship to me when after all my country occupies yours you speak straight said galtiers elder son charles that is good of course he does nicole said indignantly lucien and marie exchanged an amused look nicole defended dr odoull because of who he was not because of what he said dr odoull youre so wonderful georges luciens younger son spoke first in worshipful tones and then wickedly imitated his sister of course he is he let out a sigh full of longing and molasses hed been an imp since he was a toddler that was the only reason lucien could find for nicoles letting him live even in the ruddy light of the kerosene lamps odoulls flush was easy to see i think supper is about ready marie said which distracted everyone better than anything else might have done like galtier himself his wife was small and dark and a good deal more clever than she often let on supper was a chicken stew enlivened by dried apples over it lucien told the story of father pascals promotion he told it dispassionately out of good feeling for the american who shared the table with him his family showed less restraint that man knows nothing of shame exclaimed denise who was only twelve and wore her feelings on her sleeve he comes to the hospital sometimes to visit the soldiers who are catholic leonard odoull said dont much care for him if he were an american priest in vermont say and the british occupied it hed suck up to them the same way he sucks up to americans here have i reason or not oui vous avez raison galtier said emphatically which side he is on that matters nothing to father pascal whether he is on top that matters a great deal odoull hefted his glass of applejack applejack especially this homemade stuff galtier had got from a neighbor was dangerously deceptivesweet and mild and with a kick like a mules and you monsieur galtier what of you the young doctor asked as he might not have were he more sober galtier thought about that for a while he was a few knocks into the applejack himself my country has been made not my country he said one word at a time should i be happy at that marie gave him a warning glance too late the words were said dr odoull considered them at last he replied if you think you were free as a chunk of the british empire no if you do not think so you may wish to see what you become after the war what do you think if it does not bother you that i ask why should it bother me galtier said lightly i need not answer and the reason he did not answer not that he would ever have admitted it was that he was no longer sure what to think nellie semphroch went outside the coffeehouse in the bitter cold of early morning and flipped the sign on the boards that covered the space where her plateglass window had been from closed to open she had connections among the confederates who occupied washington dc who could have got her more glass but saw no point in using them the next us bombing raid or the one after that would only shatter the new window as threeor was it fourwindows had been shattered already mornin ma edna semphroch said when nellie went back inside the two womenone in her early twenties the other in her early fortieslooked very much alike with long oval faces and high foreheads that seemed higher because they both wore their hair pulled back edna painted her face nellie didnt with a sneer on her red lips edna added good morning little nell although nellie had been cold her face heated and congealed like an egg left too long on a frying pan dont you ever call me that again she said in a low furious voice ever do you hear me ednas sneer got wider i hear you she visibly debated throwing kerosene on the fire but decided against it i hear you with grim determination nellie took what was left of the previous days bread off the icebox and started slicing it for the toast and sandwiches shed be serving every stroke of the serrated bread knife made her wish she were drawing it across bill reachs throat reach had been an annoyance from her past for a couple of years a former reporter he had in nellies much younger days been in the habit of putting a price down on a nightstand in a cheap hotel and partaking of her services shed escaped that life and attained modest respectability edna had never known shed been in ittill reach hideously drunk lost a quarter of a century in what passed for his mind and tried to buy her in the coffeehouse when it was packed with confederate officers edna started whistling not too loud nellie ground her teeth and sliced even more viciously than before the tune edna was whistling had come up from the confederate states the year before it was called ill do as i please edna had largely done as she pleased before that night but nellie had been able to enforce some respect for the proprieties on her nownow edna lived as fast as she chose and laughed when nellie protested nellie couldnt protest much edna at least had a fiance what had nellie had customers aint seen that reach character since that one night edna remarked wonder what the devil happened to him i hope hes dead nellie said grimly if hes not dead he ought to be if he ever shows his face in here again he will be too fast as i can kill him he didnt do anything but tell the truth edna said she was still very young too young perhaps to realize how deadly dangerous incautious doses of truth could be the door opened the bell above it jangled resplendent in butternut in strode lieutenant nicholas h kincaid the big handsome confederate officer planted a kiss on ednas smiling mouth his hands tightened greedily on her mornin darling he said when they broke apart her lipstick branded him like a wound he turned to nellie mornin maam he was polite very few confederate officers were anything but it did little to make her like him better good morning she said her own tone grudging edna looked daggers at her kincaid was not a man to notice subtleties his smile reminded nellie of a happy stupid dogs she sighed against such an amiable idiot what hope had she sighing she asked what can i get you today couple of scrambledegg sandwiches with tabasco on em and a big cup of coffee he answered nellie made the eggs and toasted the bread while kincaid and edna sat at a table and gazed into each others eyes nellie was convinced that had edna gazed into one of his ears she could have gazed out the other there being nothing but empty space between the two but she did not want him for his brains nellie knew that she wanted him for the bulge hed had in his pants when theyd separated after their embrace nicholas kincaids eyes widened when he took his first bitenellie had plied the tabasco bottle with vigor he gulped scalding coffee nellie smiled but then enthusiastically he wheezed good the smile vanished edna said ma he wants us to tie the knot on the twentyfifth of march its the first sunday of spring aint that romantic are the confederates still going to be in washington on the twentyfifth of march nellie asked fighting sounds closer every day youd best believe well still be here maam kincaid sounded positive yankees wont have any luck not even a little knockin us out again just to help make sure they dont were gettin more troops whites and niggers both this here is our town and we aim to keep it the bell above the door rang again kincaid was usually the first customer but then he had an ulterior motive he rarely stayed alone with edna and nellie for long in came a couple of fieldgrade confederate officers as they ordered breakfast they chatted about the fighting off to the west in northern virginia edna had taken everything kincaid said as gospel which was a devil of a thing for a woman bent on marriage to do but nellie added together what she had heard from many different people her picture of the way the war was going didnt match his optimistic words after the morning rush of soldiers and collaborators and their sleek expensive women ebbed nellie said im going across the street to say hello to mr jacobs have fun ma edna answered in another tone of voice the remark would have been harmless nellie felt her face heat hes a gentleman edna i know its a word you may not understand but its so we dont do what you and that overgrown side of beef most assuredly do that makes you the fools not nick and me edna shot back nellie went outside without answering it was still chilly but not savagely cold as it had at dawn as it did around the clock artillery rumbled to the north every so often now nellie could hear individual shells screaming in on confederate fortifications defending the rebels grip on the capital of the united states the bell above hal jacobs door jingled instead of jangling the cobbler looked up from the confederate officers riding boot he was resoling widow semphrochnellie he said and smiled a smile that made him look young in spite of gray mustache and thinning gray hair how good to see you and you hal she answered closing the door behind her to keep the heat inside she looked around almost all the shoes in jacobs shop these days belonged to confederate soldiers some awaited his attention some their owners return nellie sighed and said the rebs have been here a long time that they have jacobs agreed that they have he sighed too casually she went on theyre going to try to hold on here too theyre bringing in reinforcementswhites and niggers both matter of fact is that so the shoemaker said how interesting nellie always passed him the gossip she picked up in the coffeehouse in that easygoing conversational way he always responded in kind and then sent the information on so the united states could get some use from it i thought so she answered now after a moment she went on my daughter and that rebel lieutenant are planning to get married here a few days after the start of spring for one of the rare times since shed begun letting hal jacobs know what she heard she was looking for information from him he understood that and did not look very happy about it at last grudgingly he said i do hope their plans wont have to be changed as could happen he wasnt going to say anything more she could see it in his eyes hed told her something anyhow she nodded brusque thanks then even more brusquely she asked what do you hear from bill reach jacobs knew bill reach along with being a humiliating piece of nellies past along with drinking like a fish he had also been the cobblers superior among the us spies in washington jacobs said since that unfortunate evening widow semphroch i have not heard from him at all perhaps the confederates have again jailed him as a thief perhaps hes frozen to death in a gutter nellies voice was full of fierce hope i never knew what he did to offend you so greatly jacobs said never mind but he did nellie thought jacobs was lying about his ignorance if he wasnt she didnt intend to enlighten him im sorry he said im sorry because since you have been angry at him you have not brought so many pieces of useful information to meand you must hear a great deal because your coffeehouse is so popular with the confederates and those who deal with them jacobs and his friendsabout whose identities nellie had carefully not inquiredhad helped keep her coffeehouse in coffee and food when both were in short supply in occupied washington she probably would have gone out of business without their help i am sorry too she said i do pay my debts or try to but that mani want to pay him backoh yes very much the cobbler held up a hand i had not finished i am also sorry because with you angry at bill reach i dont get to see you as often as i would like ive missed you you know nellies mouth fell open she wasnt used to having men say such things to her ednas father had been decent enough to marry her when she found herself in a family way it was one of the few decent things hed ever done after he died shed been contentmore than contentto live as a widow now how you do go on hal she said trying to make light of it he didnt want to make light of it i meant what i said he told her and she could hear the truth in his voice you are a fine womana finer woman i think than even you know maybe you have been a widow too long to remember these things but you must believe me here for i know what i am talking about well good day mr jacobs nellie said i really have to get back to the coffeehouse now she fled from the shoemakers shop as if a hundred confederate spycatchers were on her trail her heart thudded a man who said he missed her a man who thought her a fine woman was to her a more frightening apparition than all the confederate spycatchers in the world commander roger kimball let out a long lugubrious sigh as the css bonefish sailed away from habana standing atop the submarines conning tower he peered back toward the red tile roofs and brightly painted plaster walls of the capital of the confederate state of cuba damn he said with all due respect that sure as hell is one fine town for a shore leave isnt it yes sir agreed senior lieutenant tom brearley his executive officer both men were recently promoted after their successful raid on new york harbor the fresh gold stripes on the sleeves of their dark gray uniform coats were easy to tell apart from the duller ones theyd worn for a while brearley went on i thought i was a whiskeydrinking man but i expect i could get used to rum he grinned i expect i did get used to rum hot and cold running whores too kimball said with a reminiscent leer black ones brown ones white oneswhatever you happen to feel like cheap too cubas a damn sight cheaper than charleston and you can have a better time tooalthough i had me some pretty fair times in charleston now that i think about it anne colleton naked on a bed had been worth a dozen habana whores his blood heated at the memory shed been a tigress between the sheetsand shed wanted him for himself not for the money he laid down and she was a rich lady an influential lady to a man whod gone from a backwoods arkansas farm to the confederate naval academy at mobile a connection like that was worth its weight in rubies kimball didnt intend to go back to that miserable farm when his navy days were over the only direction he intended to head was up weathers a lot better here than up in the north atlantic brearley said seas a lot calmer too im just as glad they sent us down here far as the bonefish goes so am i kimball agreed hell of a lot easier hell of a lot more fun where the sea doesnt try to throw your boat away or tear it in half whenever youre on the surface but i dont care for what the move south says about the way the war is going brearley shrugged if england doesnt get the bread and meat she needs from argentina shes out of the war if shes out of the war the kaiser runs roughshod in europe and the damnyankees do the same thing in america if the united states are starting to try and take a bite out of the route from pernambuco to dakar weve got to stop em kimball clicked his tongue between his teeth his exec was a good kid but you needed to give him the c and the a if he was going to spell cat yeah tom weve got to stop em but if things were going better farther north they wouldnt be able to turn ships loose to go after this shipping route oh i see what youre saying sir brearley answered no doubt he did too he wasnt stupid only a little slow weve got them beat hollow when it comes to logistics good thing too kimball said otherwise this war would be within shouting distance of over but theyll need coal and fuel oil if theyre going to operate for long in those waters from out of boston or new york or philadelphia we want the supply ships as much as we want the warships he took his binoculars out of their leather case and scanned the horizon for plumes of smoke he knew that was foolish if he spotted enemy ships less than an hour out of habana the war wouldnt just be within shouting distance of the end it would be history anything sir brearley asked he had to be jumpy too if he thought there might be something so close to the cuban coast damn all kimball told him he put the binoculars back in the case im going below tropical sun calm water and a mild breeze smelling of the salt sea made the top of the conning tower a pleasant even a delightful place to stand and pass the time going down into the long steel tube of the bonefish was like descending into another world perhaps one found in the infernal regions instead of the illimitable confines of the ocean roger kimball found himself in confines as severely limitable as any in the world confines where space for machinery was a sine qua non and space for men a distinct afterthought he banged his head on a pipe fitting he hit about every other day and he was not an especially tall man dim orangetinted electric lamps replaced bright sun slowly slowly kimballs eyes adjusted he knew he would squint like a blind thing when he went topside again hardest of all though was the transition from fresh sea air to the horrible stuff inside the bonefish even with the hatches open even with a refit in habana she stank an unforgettable mixture of bilgewater and diesel fuel and food and sweat and the reek of the heads kimball knew what she would be like when she came back from her cruise like this only magnified a hundredfold a landlubber boarding a submersible just into port was like as not to add vomit to the reek kimball didnt like the stink but held it in wry affection it was the smell of home ben coulter had the helm steady on sir the veteran petty officer said in response to kimballs unspoken question listen to her doesnt she sound good those greaser mechanics did a hell of a job kimball cocked his head to one side the engine did sound unusually smooth greasers are loyal he said its the goddamn niggers you got to watch out for not in cuba coulter said niggers didnt hardly rise up at all in cuba what i hear tell never was so many reds in cuba like there is back home the unlit cigar he clenched between his teeth twitched as he talked sad state of affairs when the greasers keep their niggers quiet and white men cant do it kimball said sad state of affairs when they think theyve got to give niggers guns or the whole country goes under too anybody wants to know president semmes is out of his goddamn mind ben coulter nodded so did most of the other crewmen within earshot and then kimball remembered that anne colleton had favored creating negro military units and also favored making negroes confederate citizens after their service he thought as much of her brains as he did of her body which said a great deal if after what shed gone through at the hands of the reds she still thought the csa needed negro troops shes still wrong dammit kimball thought the bonefish moved steadily east toward the rectangle on the chart through which the submersible was supposed to sweep till her patrol was done kimball drilled the crew hard regaining whatever edge theyd lost in the fleshpots of habana when the boat slid below the surface of the atlantic in less than thirty seconds he pronounced himself satisfiedprivately to tom brearley as far as the crew was concerned he was never satisfied navigating aboard a submersible wasnt easy but repeated sights and hard work with the tablesmuch of it by brearley who had a fine head for mathematicsbrought the bonefish into the box between fifteen and seventeen degrees north latitude thirty and thirtythree degrees west longitude her assigned area for this patrol kimball chafed at working a set zone instead of hunting freely back and forth back and forth the bonefish prowled like a shark in a tank this isnt what war is supposed to be about kimball grumbled to his executive officer this is hideandseek nothing else but orders brearley said placidly as far as he was concerned that made everything right he had more imagination than a fence post but not a whole lot if he ever got his own boat kimball was sure he would command it competently he was also sure his exec would never do anything spectacular kimball was frustrated not least because he doubted whether any yankee ships would come into his search zone a patrol with a log book essentially empty of action was not what he had in mind he was in his bunkwhich however tiny and cramped was the only one the bonefish boasted everyone else sleeping in hammocks or in odd places amongst the gear and machinery in the pressure hullwhen the lookout on the conning tower spotted a plume of smoke to westward roused by the shouts he put on his shoes and cap the only items hed taken off and hurried up for a look of his own his first order was to bring the bonefish up to fifteen knots so he could approach and get a better idea of what he was hunting he could do that with little or no risk because the submersibles diesels produced less exhaust than the coalburner up ahead he shouted a course change down to the helmsman one that would put the bonefish in front of whatever ship had presumed to steam south through the territory he patrolled submerged the boat was slow he needed to be in front to close for an attack he peered through the binoculars willing himself to get a clear look at the vessel making that smoke if it was a warship it was dawdling through the water it couldnt be making more than eight or nine knots as he drew near he made out the dumpy superstructure of a freighter tom brearley came up alongside him when he told the exec what hed found brearley asked shall we sink her with the gun sir kimball was tempted the bonefish carried far more threeinch shells than torpedoes gunfire was the cheap easy way to sink enemy shipping after a moment though he shook his head no well feed her a couple of fish shes liable to be one of those gunboat freighters the yankees fit out to slug it out with submarines on the surface why take a chance he shouted the order to dive to periscope depth brearley scrambled down the hatch kimball was right behind him the captain of the bonefish dogged it shut if hed waited more than a few seconds longer he would have let the sea in with him he raised the periscope and peered through it one of the prisms had condensation on it the image was foggy give me five knots he said and crawled closer on the electric engines that powered the submarine underwater the freighter had no idea he was there or that any submersibles might be nearby it didnt change speed it didnt zigzag it went on its way so resolutely normal it made kimball suspicious as hell as he got inside a mile he and brearley and coulter were all working out the torpedo solution the bonefish s course the freighters course the subs speed the freighters the torpedos and the distance at which hed shoot all went into calculating the angle at which to shoot a couple of degrees to port he murmured at about yards and then murmuring no more fire one fire two compressed air hurled the fish out of the forward torpedo tubes they took about half a minute to reach the freighter it tried to turn away from them but far too late one struck near the bow the other near the stern the rumble of the explosions filled the bonefish the crew cheered kimball watched the freighter capsize and sink like a stone the sailors aboard it had no time to launch boats a couple of heads bobbed in water unnaturally calm shes leaking a hell of a lot of oil there kimball said likely she was carrying it for the us goddamn navy well theyll go hungrier now and have to go home sooner easiest one weve had in a while brearley said just like practice tom they wont make us throw it back on account of it was easy kimball answered after a moment he went on with a grim certainty besides odds are the next one wont be nothing in this goddamn war stays simple long captain jonathan moss unit of fighting scouts was doing what it had done through most of the late fall and winter outside the hamlet of arthur ontario not much the weather was too bad for flying about six days out of seven and marginal the seventh hed run up an astonishing bar tab at the officers club beside him at the table there first lieutenant percy stone looked down into his whiskeyandsoda nothing in this goddamn war stays simple long the aeroplanes i trained on are as obsolete as last years newspaper and it wasnt that long ago moss had a whiskeyandsoda too only the soda being omitted from the recipe next time you want to keep a sense that things do go on steadily instead of by jerks try not to get shot so you have to spend the better part of a year on the sidelines thats good advice ill make a note of it stone really did make as if to write it down youre a good fellow percy moss said laughing stone a photographer in civilian life had been his observer when he was piloting a reconnaissance aeroplane in theyd been put together as much because of the way their names matched as for any other reason but theyd always got on famouslytill stone stopped a machinegun bullet for a long time after that moss had thought he was dead but hed proved to be very much alive and wearing a pilots twowinged badge instead of the one wing that marked the observer he raised his glass on high to hell with the sopwith pup he declared now everyone who heard him drank with him only a handful of the new british machines had got to this side of the atlantic but they made every american who met them wish that handful were none at all having lost friends who flew outmoded martin onedeckers against pups that could outclimb outdive outrun and outmaneuver them moss poured down his own drink hed flown a martin onedecker himself from the day hed gone from observation aeroplanes to fighting scouts until he came here to train on the new machines that were supposed to be able to contend on even terms with the best the limeys and canucks had to offer he got up walked rather unsteadily to the bar and bought himself another drink with the glass of whiskey in his hand he lifted it and said heres to the new biplanes thatll tie tin cans to the pups tails that toast drew both cheers and laughs he went back to the table when he sat down percy stones longjawed handsome face was thoughtful even worried in a low voice stone asked do you think theyll really be able to do the job theyre a hell of a lot peppier than anything i ever flew before but ive been out of circulation for quite a while he patted his side what with the entry and exit wounds of the bullet that had got him and the incisions the surgeons made to patch him up he owned as spectacular a collection of scars as anyone could wanta more spectacular collection of scars than anyone in his right mind would want we ought to have a good fighting chance moss answered with a ponderous deliberation fueled by both thought and alcohol this new twodecker can climb with anything ever made and its maneuverable as all getout i dont think its quite as fast a bus on the straightaway as the pups are but damn close how fast you can turn counts for more in a dogfight a lot of times anyhow thats what everybodys saying sure enough stone nodded now the next interesting question is will we get a chance to fly our birds before theyre obsolete too and the war department decides to train us up on the next new model whatever that turns out to be take that one up with the chaplain or maybe take it straight to god weathers not my department moss said then he slowly started thinking again wouldnt be surprised if these twodeckers are damn near obsolete in europe thats where the real air action is our new buses are just copies of the ones albatros makes for the germans that had been true through most of the war maybe because they were in a tougher fight in the air german manufacturers kept cranking out new and improved models of which the albatros biplane was but one some of the plans made the journey by submersible to the usa some got sunk trying to make the journey too which was why the new fighting scout was slower getting out of the blocks than it should have been just as the british did their best to keep the canadians in aeroplanes and fresh plans a lot of fliers wore their pocket watches on wrist straps when in the air bulky flying clothes made a watch impossible to check otherwise like some others moss knew percy stone had taken to wearing his on his wrist all the time looking at it now he yawned and said i think im going to hit the hay ill pretend tomorrow will be a bully day for flying even though i know damn well itll snow and itll be colder than a witchs tit duty moss said approvingly responsibility remembrance he looked down into his own glass and whiskey dont forget whiskey he made sure the glass had no whiskey left in it to forget then rose and accompanied stone to the tent they shared with the other two men in the flight pete bradley and hans oppenheim an iron stove glowed redhot in the middle of the tent that meant the four cots all piled high with thick greengray wool blankets were cold to sleep in but didnt quite feel as if the north pole had moved down to a couple of miles north of the aerodrome this was moss third winter in ontario so far as he knew nobody in the world could strip down to his drawers and slide under the covers faster than he could reveille came at halfpast five which was in his opinion a couple of hours too early his head pounded he dryswallowed a couple of aspirinsamerican imitations of aspirins actually they worked well enough and when he poked his head out of the tent he blinked and whistled in surprise it was cold the breath he exhaled whistling made a little frosty cloud in front of his face but it was clear in the east the sky glowed salmon before too long the sun would rise in december it hardly showed its face now that february was here it began to remember it did have some business up in canada after all he stuck his head back inside i think we may be able to get some flying in after all that would be good oppenheim said seriously he seldom was anything but serious when they sent us up from london after they trained us on these new twodeckers the idea was that we should fly them we are after all an operational squadron his parents had come from germany he didnt have an accent but the language hed spoken around the house as a kid influenced the way he put his sentences together the fliers went to the mess tent and shoveled down bacon and eggs and pancakes and bad coffee the squadron commander major julius cherney nodded to them can we go up along the line sir and see if the limeys send anyone out against us moss asked well why the hell not cherney said meteorology says everything looks good for the next few hours he grunted yeahi knowthat and five cents buys you a beer he clapped moss on the back good hunting men with shovels and horses and mules with scoops made the airstrips usable bigger aerodromes had tractors with blades mounted in front of them to clear snow arthur boasted no such amenities moss reveled in the way his aeroplane leaped from the ground the streamlined fighting scout from the wright works in ohioa copy of the albatros diiclimbed at close to a thousand feet a minute a hell of a lot faster than his old martin could have managed and all the sky in front of him was empty he led the flight now with percy stone behind him on the right and oppenheim and bradley on the left they flew east till they came to the trench line that scarred ontario between lake ontario and lake huron west of the trenches the snow could not hide the devastation of the land the canadians and their british allies had fought so bitterly to hold east of themor at least east of artillery range from themit was simply snowy country in winter the dazzle of sun off endless miles of white made moss blink back tears behind his goggles here and there down in the canucks trenches muzzle flashes showed that soldiers were taking potshots at him and his flightmates he laughed and the chilly slipstream blew his mirth away rifle and machinegun fire reached up to about two thousand feet he was high above that danger then canadian antiaircraft guns opened up black puffs of smoke appeared in the sky as if by magic when one burst a couple of hundred yards below moss fighting scout the aeroplane bucked like a restive horse he began changing his speed and course and altitude more or less at random so the gunners could not calculate just where to place their shells the sky thank heaven was a big wide place he respected antiaircraft fire without fearing it he led his flight south and east along the line in the direction of toronto daring enemy aeroplanes to come up and fight every so often he would glance at his fuel gauge and his watch like most other fighting scouts the new wright machines could stay in the air for about an hour and a half if he and his comrades found no challengers they would have to go home when more antiaircraft shells burst in the sky south of moss they drew his eye toward the aeroplane at which they were aimed one of the avro twoseat biplanes the canadians had been using for reconnaissance work since the beginning of the war moss sped toward the avro followed close by his flightmates the canuck pilot hadnt changed course despite the archie bursting around him he was letting his observer take the photos he needed moss knew about that from his work with stone having four us fighting scouts on this tail was a different business for the avro driver he corkscrewed away from the wrights in a spinning dive sometimes speed did matter moss and his comrades had better than twenty miles an hour on the avro they closed quickly the observer started shooting at them they shot back from four directions at once four streams of tracers converged on the desperately dodging avro then it dodged no more but plunged toward the ground one of those streams of machinegun bullets must have found the pilot and left him dead or unconscious the observer kept firing till the american fighting scouts pulled away from their stricken foe a moment later the avro slammed into the frozen ground and burst into flame we only get to claim a quarter of an aeroplane apiece moss thought no way to tell whose bullet nailed the canuck he didnt care he needed a moment to get his bearings after the dizzying action when he knew which way was which he waggled his wings and pointed northwest back toward the aerodrome the flight headed for him moss looked back at the burning wreck of the avro weve earned our pay today he thought confederate soldiers tramped glumly south through the mud that clogged the roads of the state of sequoyah the red river which marked the boundary between the former indian territory and texas was only a couple of miles away private first class reginald bartlett pointed whats the name of that little town there he asked he was a big fair fellow with a comic turn of phrase that let him get away with saying outrageous things that would have got other men into trouble or into fights that theres ryan sergeant pete hairston answered the veterans harsh georgia drawl was far removed from bartletts soft almost english richmond accent reggie grinned well i want to tell you something sarge he said making his voice as deep and authoritative as he could weve got to hold this town the whole confederacy is depending on us to hold this town hairston let out a strangled snort of laughter you go to hell bartlett you goddamn smartmouth son of a bitch sarge why you cussin out reggie private napoleon dibble asked what did he say that was so bad a moment later first lieutenant jerome nicoll the company commander spoke up in deep authoritative tones of his own i want to tell you something boysweve got to hold ryan the whole confederacy is depending on us to hold ryan you son of a bitch hairston said admiringly and made as if to throw a punch at bartlett what did he say sarge nap dibble repeated his eyes wide and puzzled he said the same thing the lieutenant said so why are you getting steamed at him hairston and bartlett shared a moment of silent amusement dibble was a pretty good fellow brave and goodnatured but not a fireball when it came to brains dont worry about it napeverythings fine bartlett said he turned back to hairston weve got to hang on to any chunk of sequoyah we can you know the germans still dont have all of belgium a moment later lieutenant nicoll delivered the same sentiment in almost identical words see dibble exclaimed reggie said just what the lieutenant said so how come youre givin him a hard time about it the lieutenant said the same damn thing in front of duncan too an we got run out of duncan hairston said he said the same damn thing in front of waurika and we got run out of there just on account of we got to do somethin dont have to mean we can do it as if to underscore that point a shell screamed down and burst a few hundred yards off to one side of the road it threw up a fountain of dirt a few of the kiowas and comanches whod attached themselves to the cs army in its grinding retreat through southern sequoyah jumped and exclaimed most of them took no more notice of the explosion than did the white soldiers i hear some of these indian tribes have their own little armies in the field fighting alongside ours reggie said pete hairston nodded thats a fact but those are the five civilized tribes and they pretty much run their own affairs any which way they did anyhow till the damnyankees landed on em god knows whats happening to the poor miserable redskinned bastards now these indians here seem civilized enough bartlett said lieutenant nicoll overheard that fortunately hed missed reggies impersonation of him its a matter of law bartlett the creeks the choctaws the cherokees and whatnot have legal control over their own internal affairs the redskins hereabouts dont ryan when they trudged into it might have once boasted a thousand people then again it might not have it certainly didnt have a thousand civilians in it now most of them had fled across the red river into texas ryan lay on the edge of the red river bottomland with forests of mesquite and tamaracks and swamps with endless little streams winding through them taking the place of the prairie over which bartlett had been marching for so long at lieutenant nicolls shouted order his company joined the rest of the confederate soldiers retreating from waurika in entrenching in front of ryan flinging dirt out behind him reggie said wasnt like this on the roanoke front there if you went forward or back a quarter of a mile that was something to write home about when we pulled out of waurika we had to pull back maybe ten miles yeah well this heres the next town south of waurika too aint nothing to speak of between there and here hairston said the yankees run us out of the one place what the hells the point in stoppin till you got somewheres else worth holding on to mm maybe youve got something there bartlett admitted lot of builtup land in the roanoke valley and what isnt built up is good farm country here theres a lot of land just lying empty not doing anything in particular seems kind of funny when youre used to the way things are on the other side of the mississippi yeah hairston agreed a couple of threeinch field guns came by pulled through the mud by laboring horses and thats our artillery thats all the artillery we got for miles and miles aint like that on the roanoke front is it lord no reggie answered there the yankees and usd line em up hub to hub and whale away at each other till it didnt seem like there was a live man anywhere the guns could reach he wished there were barbed wire to string in front of the entrenchments he and his comrades were digging confederate forces had been able to use some farther north in sequoyah but had had to abandon it when the yankees forced them out of their positions nothing new had come up from texas from what reggied heard the defenders of texas had their problems too he was still digging when the us field guns opened up on his position he had to throw himself down in the mud a couple of times because of near misses after each one he got up brushed himself off and went back to work joe mopope one of the kiowas whod been fighting alongside the confederates since waurika asked how can you do that i can fight with a riflehe carried a tredegar now not the squirrel gun hed started withbut its different when the big guns start shooting they are too far away for me to shoot back at them so they make me afraid admitting fear took a kind of nerve of its own bartlett studied mopopes long straightnosed highcheekboned face all what youre used to joe he said at last more careful of the indians pride than hed thought he might be ive been under worse shellfire than this since i know what it can do and what it cant first few times it damn near scared the piss out of me ah mopope was usually a pretty serious fellow now he tried out a smile as if to see whether it would fit his face this is good to know a warrior can learn this kind of fighting then the same as any other kind yeah reggie said joe mopopes father might have been a warrior of the traditional indian sort sneaking across the us border on raids up into kansas that sort of thing had gone on for years after the second mexican war finally petering out not long before the turn of the century bartlett shrugged he came from a family of warriors too both his grandfathers had served in the war of secession his father hadnt fought in the second mexican war but uncle jasper sure as hell hadand wouldnt shut up about it either not to this day from in back of the trenches the confederates field guns opened up they fired faster than their yankee counterparts joe mopopes smile got wider ah we give it back to them that is good hurting them is better than sitting here and letting them hurt us yes except for one thing reggie set down his entrenching tool and unslung his rifle if were opening up on the damnyankees that means theyre close enough for the gunners to spot em and if theyre close enough for the gunners to spot em were going to have company before long he looked north sure enough here came the men in greengray they advanced much more openly than they would have in the roanoke valley where any man outside a trench risked immediate annihilation that aside the yankee commander hereabouts seemed to assess danger by how many men the confederates in front of him knocked over on the approach some generals in butternut were like that too bartlett was glad he didnt serve under any of them rifle and machinegun fire forced the yankees to go to earth dirt flew as the us soldiers dug themselves in any man who hoped to live through the war was handy with the spade stretcherbearers carried a few wounded confederates back into ryan on the other side of the line stretcherbearers in us uniforms were no doubt doing the same thing with injured damnyankees we stopped em napoleon dibble said happily even joe mopope rolled his black eyes at that as gently as he could reggie said we stopped em for now nap we stopped em for a while at duncan and for a while at waurika too question is can we stop em when they bring up everything theyve got we have to dibble answered lieutenant nicoll said we have to if we dont the yankees get sequoyah and theyll fill it up with germans hed made that mistake before nobody bothered correcting him about it any more dusk fell reggie gnawed stale cornbread and opened a tin of beans and pork that was enough to quiet the growling in his belly though it didnt make much of a meal cold drizzle started falling rifle fire spattered up and down the lines muzzle flashes looking like lightning bugs when bartlett wanted somebody to dig a trench forward toward a good post for a picket that hed spotted he looked around for joe mopope but didnt spot him he wondered where the hell the indian had got to the kiowas and comanches were good enough in a fight but they didnt like the drudgery that went with soldiering for hell he set nap dibble digging instead nap did the job without complaint he never complained he probably wasnt smart enough to complain because he didnt he got more than his fair share of jobs nobody else wanted sergeant pete hairston launched a fearsome barrage of curses reggie hurried over to see what was going on there stood joe mopope knife in one hand a couple of objects bartlett couldnt see well in the other in tones somewhere between disgust and awe hairston said this redskinned son of a bitch just brought us back two yankee scalps reggie stared then he blurted no wonder he wasnt around when i needed him to dig very quietly joe mopope laughed as she rode the streetcar to her job at a mackerelcanning plant sylvia enos went through the inner pages of the boston globe with minute care as far as she was concerned the paper never talked enough about naval affairs a battle on land that didnt move the front a quarter of a mile in one direction or the other got pageone coverage sometimes she thought ships got mentioned only when they were torpedoed or blown to bits she saw nothing about the uss ericsson not seeing anything about the destroyer made her let out a silent sigh of relief it meantshe devoutly hoped it meanther husband george was all right most of the people on the trolley were women on the way to work many of them on the way to jobs men had been doing before the war pulled them into the army or the navy many of them were scanning the newspaper as attentively as sylvia was doing some of the ones who werent wore mourning black they no longer had any need to fear the worst theyd already met it sylvia left her copy of the globe on the seat when the trolley came to her stop she wished george were home she wished hed never gone to war and she hoped the ericsson was far out to sea nowhere near a port she loved her husband and she thought he loved her but she wasnt sure as she had been once she could trust him out of her sight she walked the short distance to the canning plant which was no more lovely than it had to be it wasnt far from the harbor and stank of fish a skinny cat looked at her and gave an optimistic meow she shook her head sorry pussycat no handouts from me today the cat meowed again piteously this time sylvia shook her head again too and walked on she grabbed her time card and stuck it in the clock the money wasnt goodit wasnt as if she were a man after allbut with it and her monthly allotment from georges pay she managed well enough good morning mrs enos the foreman said as she hurried toward the machine that stuck bright labels on cans of mackerel good morning mr winter she answered he nodded and limped on past her as a young man hed taken a bullet in the leg during the second mexican war a couple of minutes later isabella antonelli took her place on the machine next to sylvias she wore black her husband had been killed fighting in quebec she nodded shyly to sylvia set down her dinner pail and made sure her machine was in good working order with a rumble of motors and several discordant squeals of fan belts the line started moving sylvia had to pull three levers taking steps between them to bring bare bright cans into her machine squirt paste on them and affix the labelswhich made the mackerel whose flesh went into the cans look remarkably like tuna being a fishermans wife she knew what a lie that was people who bought the cans in ohio or nebraska wouldnt though some days stepping and pulling levers could be mesmerizing so that half the morning would slip by while sylvia hardly noticed any time passing this was one of those mornings the only time she got jolted out of her routine was when her paste reservoir ran dry and she had to refill it from the big bucket of paste under the machine before she could put on more labels as it did sometimes the lunch whistle startled her jerking her out of the world in which she was almost as mechanical as the machine she tended the line groaned to a stop sylvia shook herself as she might have done coming out of the bathtub at the end of the hall in her apartment building she looked around there was her dinner pail of blackpainted sheet metal like the one a riveter might have carried to the boston navy yard isabella antonellis dinner pail might have been identical to her own the two women sat on a bench near a wheezing steam radiator sylvia had a ham sandwich in her dinner pail leftovers from the night before isabella antonelli had a tightly covered bowl that also looked to hold leftovers long noodles that looked like worms smothered in tomato sauce she brought them to the factory about three days out of five sylvia thought they were disgusting though shed never said so for fear of hurting her friends feelings mr winter limped by a cigar clamped between his teeth he was carrying his own dinner pail looking for a place to sit down his eyes lingered on isabella as he walked past you can go with him if youd like sylvia said i will sit with you today the italian woman said she smiled which made her look younger and not so tired he should not take me too much for granted dont you think she and the foremana widower for yearshad been lovers for a couple of months they were discreet about it both at the factory and with their own families winter had aimed a few speculative remarks at sylvia since shed started working at the canning plant she was just as well pleased to see him attached to someone else to his credit he hadnt aimed any of those remarks at her since taking up with isabella sylvia said anybody who takes anybody else for granted is a fool she didnt realize with how much bitterness shed freighted the remark till isabella antonelli a worried look on her face asked but all is well with your giorgio yes hes well yes sylvia replied which was by no means a complete answer isabella obviously realized it wasnt a complete answer she also obviously realized it was all the answer she would get the rest of the halfhour lunch passed in uneasy silence for once sylvia was glad to go back to her machine to lose herself in the routine of pulling and stepping pulling and stepping of watching cans bright with their tinning go into the machine and cans gaudy with their labels stream out the machine asked no questions she would sooner not have answered the machine asked no questions at all as she had at the lunch whistle sylvia started when the quitting whistle screamed it was dark when she clocked out and walked to the trolley stop but not quite so dark as it had been earlier in the year twilight lingered in the west a harbinger of spring ahead it was the only harbinger of spring she could find the wind cut like a knife she had to stand almost all the way back to the stop by her apartment building except for lunch shed been standing since she got to the plant now that shed returned from that mechanistic world she felt how tired she was her legs didnt want to hold her up any more when she finally did get to sit down she nearly fell asleep before the streetcar got to her stop shed done that once and walked back more than a mile this time she didnt but getting up and getting off the trolley were more mind over matter than anything else she checked her mailbox in the entrance hall to the apartment building no letter from george which meant he hadnt come to port as of a few days before which meant he hadnt had the chance to get into trouble in a port he might have got into trouble on the sea but that was a different sort of trouble and one over which she worried in a different sort of way circulars from the coal board the scrap metal collection agency the ration board the victory over waste committee and the war savings and tax board helped fill the mailbox so did one from an agency new to her the paper conservation authority which informed her in the portentous bureaucratic tones of any government outfit that paper was an important war resource and should not be wasted then why do i get so much worthless paper every day she muttered tossing the multicolored sheets into the battered wastebasket there the answer to that was only too clear because one board writes this and none of the others read it thats why she went upstairs to reclaim her children from brigid coneval who after her husband was conscripted had decided to take in the children of other women who got jobs in factories instead of getting a factory job herself each flight of stairs seemed to have twice as many as the one before and each step twice as high when she came out into the hallway she walked down the hall to mrs conevals flat to get george jr and mary jane and take them back to her own apartment where she would make supper and let them play till they were ready for bedor more likely till she was ready for bed and managed to persuade them that they should lie down too they were getting harder to persuade george jr was six now heading toward seven and mary jane nearly four sylvia needed more sleep these days while they needed less it hardly seemed fair with so many children in brigid conevals flat shrieks and cries as sylvia came up were the order of the day but the shrieks and cries that sylvia heard now did not come from the throats of children fear shot through her sharp as if shed seized a live electric wire she had to will herself to knock and then had to knock twice to make anyone inside notice her the woman who opened the door was not brigid coneval though she looked very much like her seeing sylvia george jr and mary jane came running up and embraced her above them sylvia asked the question she dreaded the question that had to be asked is she is it it is that the woman doubtless brigids sister had a brogue like hers too less than an hour ago the telegram came down in virginia he was poor man and never coming back from there again thats dreadful im so sorry sylvia said feeling the inadequacy of words she knew what brigid coneval was feeling shed twice thought george lost once when his fishing boat was captured by a confederate commerce raider and once when his river monitor was blown out of the water the only thing that had saved him then was that he hadnt been aboard but on the riverbank drunk and about to lie down with a colored strumpet she couldnt even say she understood for brigids sister would not believe her then she found a new worry different but in its own way no less urgent while brigid coneval mourned who would take care of the children when she had to go to work thegreatwar breakthroughs sam carsten swabbed the deck of the uss dakota with a safety line tied round his waist the battleship pitched like a toy boat in a rambunctious boys bathtub chewing its way over and through waves that put to shame any others hed ever known he shouted to his bunkmate vic crosetti who plied a mop not far away everything they say about cape horn is true yeah crosetti shouted back through the howl of the wind only trouble is they dont say near enough the tightmouthed sons of bitches there was nothing tightmouthed about him he was a voluble italian little and swarthy and hairy and ugly as a monkey carsten by contrast was tall and muscular with pink skin and hair so blond it was almost white crosetti leered at him you sunburned yet sam fuck you carsten said amiably hed burned in san francisco christ hed burned in seattle duty in the sandwich islands and the tropical pacific had been a hell of burning and peeling and zinc oxide and half a dozen other ointments that didnt do any good either i finally find weather that suits me and what do i get a scrawny dago giving me a hard time had some men called him a scrawny dago crosetti would have answered with a kick in the teeth or a knife in the ribs when sam did he grinned carsten had a way of being able to talk without ticking people off he even had trouble starting brawls in waterfront saloons another enormous swell sweeping along from west to east lifted the dakota to its crest for a moment sam could see a hell of a long way he spotted another battleship from the us force that had set out from pearl harbor for valparaiso chile the autumn beforeexcept autumn meant nothing in the sandwich islands and was spring down in chile farther off he made out a us armored cruiser and a couple of the destroyers that guarded the big battlewagons from harm he also spied a chilean armored cruiser but for the different flag and different paint jobthe chileans preferred a sky blue to the us grayit looked the same as its american counterpart it should have it had come out of the boston navy yard pointing to it carsten said we sold the chileans their toys and england sold the argentines theirs now we get to find out whos a better toymaker hell with all of em crosetti said if argentina was on our side chiled be in bed with the limeys but argentinas keeping england fed so chile ends up playin on our team big deal you ask me hey listen if argentina was on our side wed be sailing east to west straight into all these damn waves and this stinking wind instead of riding with em howd you like that no thanks crosetti said at once carsten got a faraway look in his eyes howd you like to try sailing east to west through here in a ship without an enginei mean really sailing through here he said crosetti crossed himself sam laughed yeah thats how i feel about it too they were tough bastards in the old days vic crosetti said stupid bastards too to want to come down to such a godforsaken corner of the world before carsten could answer that klaxons started hooting a noise hideous enough to cut through the raging wind everyone on deck undid his safety line and ran for his battle station sam had no idea whether it was a drill or whether some destroyer up ahead had spotted british or argentine or maybe even french ships he knew he had to treat the noise as if shells would start dropping aroundor onthe dakota at any moment the battleship sank into the trough between waves plunging her bow steeply downward sams foot skidded on seawater he flailed his arms wildly and somehow managed to keep from falling on his face then his shoes rang on metal rungs as he went below his battle station was loader on the forwardmost starboard fiveinch gun he flung himself into the cramped sponson and waited to see what would happen next there ahead of himhe would have been astonished were it otherwisewas the commander of that fiveinch gun a chief petty officer and gunners mate named hiram kidde and more often than not called capn hed ditched his habitual cigar somewhere on the way to the sponson he couldnt have been too far from it he wasnt breathing hard and he was a rolypoly fellow whod been in the navy for years before sam got his first pair of long pants is this practice or for real sam asked damned if i know kidde answered think they tell me anything in scrambled the rest of the crew gun layers and shell jerkers they were all at their stations when commander grady who was in charge of the starboard secondary armament stuck his head into the sponson grady nodded approval he was a pretty decent sort well done men he said hiram kidde asked the same question carsten had whats the dope sir is this just another drill or have we got trouble up ahead weve got trouble up ahead sure as the sun comes up tomorrow grady answered sooner or later if they dont stop us we are going to be in position to disrupt shipments of wheat and beef from argentina to england if we can do that the limeys starve so theyll move heaven and earth to keep us away i understand that sir kidde answered patiently what i meant was have we got trouble up ahead right now grady would know whether he would tell was liable to be a different question he started to answer but then somebody in the corridor spoke to him what he said sounding surprised he hurried off damn said luke hoskins one of the shell haulers he was the right man for his job being both taller and thicker through the shoulders than carsten who wasnt small himself nobody the size of say vic crosetti could have handled fiveinch sixtypound shells as if he were about to load them into his shotgun also shelljerker wasnt the sort of job that called for much in the way of brains i think its kidde began just as the klaxons signaled the allclear you were going to say you thought it was the real thing werent you carsten said as they started filing out of the cramped sponson he expected kidde to deny everything but the gunners mate nodded hell yes i did we should have done this months ago instead of wasting time in valparaiso and concepcion like we did shit we were ready but the chilean navy aint what youd call a fireball how do you say tomorrow in spanish carsten said manana thats it i wonder how many times we heard manana up there too damn many however many it was kidde said positively wasted time wasted time he shook his head a slow mournful gesture seas wouldnt have been near so heavy if wed got moving in the middle of summer hereabouts instead of waiting till we were heading down toward fall i still dont trust our steering either wish i did but i dont carstens laugh was a noise he made to hold fear at bay whats the matter capn you dont want to do a circle toward the limeys and argentines the way we did toward the limeys and japs in the battle of the three navies kidde swore loudly and sulfurously for a couple of minutes before calming down enough to say we were lucky once which is how come we aint on the bottom of the pacific you cant count on being lucky once you sure as hell cant count on being lucky twice i expect youre right carsten went up onto the main deck made his way back to where hed been working and reattached his safety line he might as well have been starting over from scratch plenty of seawater had splashed up since hed dashed to his battle station vic crosetti resumed his place a minute or so later they were jawing back and forth when a starched young lieutenant junior grade came up and said seaman carsten when sam admitted he was himself the officer said the force commander will see you in his cabin immediately sir if sams heart didnt skip a beat he couldnt guess why he hadnt thought rear admiral bradley fiske knew he existed like any other sensible sailor hed hoped that pleasant condition would continue indefinitely in a choking voice he asked what does he think ive done sir come with me carsten the jg answered and sam a lump of ice about the size of the nearby antarctic continent in his belly had to obey out of the corner of his eye he noticed another officer bringing vic crosetti along god damn that little dago he thought whats he done and how in hell did i get in hot water for it he seldom had occasion to go up into officers country hed never had occasion to visit the force commanders quarters nor imagined that he would sure as hell vic crosetti was heading there too carsten cursed under his breath the lieutenant jg went in ahead of him then came back out and said the admiral will see youboth of younow as they went in crosetti gave sam a venomous glare christ sam thought does he figure hes in trouble on account of something i did what kind of foulup have we got here there stood rear admiral fiske a sturdy man of about sixty in the middle of a cabin that could have held half a dozen threelevel bunks so much space inside the dakota was amazing even more amazing was the bottle of medicinal brandy fiske held and that he poured three glasses from it handing one to sam and one to crosetti and keeping the third for himself congratulations you men he boomed carsten and crosetti stared at each other then at rear admiral fiske sam felt as if hed been up and down too fast on the coney island roller coaster he had to say something he knew he had to say something sir his voice was a hoarse croak fiske looked impatient he knew what was going on which struck carsten as an unfair advantage some time ago you two men reported your suspicions that a certain native of the sandwich islands one john liholiho used his position and good nature to spy for england after the usa took the said islands from her at the outbreak of the war investigation has confirmed those suspicions i am informed by wireless telegraph liholiho has been arrested and sentenced to death sir sam and crosetti said it together now in astonishment sam had almost forgotten about the affable surfriding sandwich islander hed long since assumed liholiho wasnt in fact a spy because no one had said anything to the contrary fiske was saying that now he was also saying something else you men are both promoted from seaman first class to petty officer third class effective the date of your report back pay in your new rank will also accrue from the said date he raised his glass in salute well done both of you he drank numbly carsten raised his own glass numbly he drank and discovered the rear admiral got a much better grade of medicine than did the men he commanded after the stuff went off like a bomb in his stomach he wasnt numb any more he tried on a smile for size it fit his face like a glove as scipio walked down the road toward the swamp he knew he was a dead man oh his lungs still moved air in and out his heart still beat his legs still took step after step he was a dead man even so the only questions left were who would kill him how soon and how long hed hurt before he finally died he looked back over his shoulder somewhere back there anne colleton was liable to have a scopemounted tredegar aimed at his spine shed had one slung on her back when she sent him out on his way to the swamps by the congaree by the way she handled it she knew just what to do with it too shed started following him he didnt know if she still was hed caught glimpses of her once or twice but only once or twice he got the idea shed wanted him to get those glimpses to remind him she was on his trail when she wanted him not to see her he didnt hed never dreamt she could stalk like that was she good enough to stalk cassius scipio found that hard to believe cassius had been marshlands chief hunter for years what he didnt know about the swamps of the congaree no one did hed been able to keep the raiders who were the hard core of the congaree socialist republic a going concern in the swamp for most of a year after the socialist republic was crushed everywhere else and cassius and the rest of the red holdouts were about as likely to kill him as anne colleton was if they found out he was acting as her bird dog they would kill him they might kill him simply for abandoning the cause and trying to live what passed for a normal life in the csa after the black uprising went down to defeat something rose from the roadside marsh in a thunder of wings scipios heart rose too into his throat but it was only an egret flapping away from his unwanted company when he was a boy the big white birds had been far more common than they were today the demand for plumes on ladies hats had all but caused their extermination only a shift in fashion let any survive here wherehe hopedno one could hear him he trotted out the educated white mans voice hed used while serving as butler at marshlands and what shift in fashion will let me survive for the life of himliterally for the life of himhe could think of none he looked around water rushes trees the road was turning into a muddy track everything seemed prosaic enough of course he was only on the edge of the swamp as yet the negro field hands back at marshlands had peopled the wet country with monsters with sharp teeth and glowing yellow eyes those stories were nothing but superstitious twaddle so claimed the part of him that had been so carefully educated the little boy who had listened roundeyed to the stories the grannies told wasnt so sure he looked around again more nervously this time nothing only swamp of course that meant cougars and gators and cottonmouths and rattlers andhe slappedmosquitoes and the noseeems that bit and vanished he slapped again the road forked and then forked again and then again it went in among the trees now and the oaks and willows and pines made the sun play hideandseek the road divided yet again every turn scipio took was one leading deeper into the swamp if he didnt find the men of the congaree socialist republic he wondered if hed be able to find his way out if cassius didnt kill him and if anne colleton didnt kill him the swamp was liable to do him in no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than three negroes with tredegars stepped silently out into the roadway they wore red bandannas on their left arms nigger you aint got no good reason to be here you is one dead nigger one of them said two of their rifles were bayoneted they wouldnt even have to risk the noise of a gunshot to dispose of him he licked his lips the bayonets looked very long and sharp i wants to see cassius or maybe cherry he answered in the broad patois of the congaree i is on de business ode socialist republic none of the three fighting men was from marshlands or any nearby plantation they didnt know him by sight as many of cassius men would have who you is their spokesman asked is scipio he said their eyes went wide in their dark faces they knew the name if not the man who went with it maybe you is an maybe you aint said the one who had spoken first take me to cassius take me to cherry scipio said you ask they who i is an who i aint the fighters put their heads together after a minute of lowvoice argument the one who seemed to lead handed his tredegar to a comrade took the bandanna off his arm and walked up to scipio maybe you is an maybe you aint he repeated an maybe you is an you is a spy nowadays you see cassius an cherry but you don see how to get to they he efficiently blindfolded scipio with the square of red cloth you insults me scipio said with as much indignation as he could simulate had he been rejoining the forces of the congaree socialist republic in truth he would have protested being blindfolded since he was a spy and since he was anne colletons spy which he suspected made him more dangerous to cassius than if hed merely been a spy for the confederate government he had to do his best to seem as if he werent come on the man who covered his eyes grabbed him by the arm we takes you he had no idea by what route they took him it might have been the straightest one possible or they might have spent half their time walking him around in circles he wondered if anne colleton was still following him he wondered what sort of watchers the survivors of the congaree socialist republic had posted through the swamp he wondered whether she could get past them if she was still following him that he did not know the answer to any of those questions did not keep him from wondering about all of them after about an hour his guide said stop scipio obeyed the man whod led him for so long took the blindfold off him standing side by side in front of him were cassius and cherry she wore a collarless mens shirt and a torn pair of mens trousers scipio suppressed a shudder anne colleton had worn mens trousers too though hers were elegantly tailored cassius hurried up and clasped scipios hand do jesus kip he exclaimed why fo you here las i hear you is up in greenville an de buckra dey forget you was ever borned scipio was anything but surprised cassius had kept tabs on where hed gone he had dropped out of sight of the confederate authorities but the negro grapevine was a different matter altogether with a sigh he answered with most of the truth somebody recnize me up dere dey rested me take me to st matthews to miss anne cherrys voice was flat and full of hate scipio nodded more than a little apprehensively she went on i reckon we done baked dat white debbil bitch las christmas but she git away she good cassius spoke with reluctant respect she a damn pressor but she good we caint kill she no matter how hard we tries his rather foxy features grew sharp and intent why fo she send you in after we she ask a truce i don trust no truce wid she she break it like the overseer break de stick on de back ode field hand fo to get he to pick de cotton she say de war gainst de united states mo portant than de war gainst de congaree socialist republic scipio replied nodding she say if de damnyankees licks de csa dey comes an licks de congaree socialist republic too she say we kin wait till de big war done and den we fights our own cassius and cherry and all three men whod brought scipio to this place burst out laughing she say dat cherry said with high cheekbones that told of indian blood cherrys face was made for showing scorn she outdid herself now tossing her head in magnificent contempt she say dat mighty fine mighty fine we let de pressors git rid ode big war an den dey puts all dey gots into de little war gainst we you go back to miss anne cassius added an you tell she dat when she dead den we can have a truce wid she till den we fights she aint licked we yet an she aint gwine lick we on account of we gots de dialectic wid we she go on de rubbish heap o history long wid de rest o de pressors hearing marxist revolutionary jargon in the dialect of the congaree never failed to strike scipio as bizarre cherrys eyes narrowed she have somebody follow you she demanded dat white debbil she have bloodhounds wid guns on your trail scipio spread his hands don know he answered though he had a pretty good idea i aint no huntin man back at marshlands i was de butler you recollects i aint hardly been in this swamp befo oh we recollects cassius said grinning like a catamount he had a flask on his belt he freed it swigged and passed it to scipio see if you recollects dis here scipio drank as butler hed sampled fine wines and good whiskey this was raw corn likker with a kick like a mule when he exhaled he was amazed he didnt breathe out fire and smoke he took another pull there was a roaring in his ears after a moment he realized the corn likker hadnt caused it it was real it grew rapidly and turned to a scream in the air hed heard that sound in the uprising the year before he threw himself flat he wasnt the first one on the ground either artillery shells rained down explosions picked him up and flung him about shell fragments and shrapnel balls tore up the landscape blast from a near miss yanked at his ears and his lungs someone was screaming like a damned soulthe man whod blindfolded him his belly laid open like a butchered hogs at last the shelling ended scipio thanked the god he still trusted more than marx that he was still in one piece also in one piece cassius took the bombardment in stride miss anne she do have you followed he said brushing mud from his shirt you want to go back to she now numbly scipio shook his head cassius grinned den we welcomes you to de congaree socialist republic agin not having wanted to join the uprising in the first place scipio wanted even less to join this sad ghost of it what possible fate could he have but being hunted down and killed after a moment he realized anne colleton couldnt have had anything else in mind you are mine shed told him now it pleased her to amuse herself with her possession as major abner dowling was making his way from his tent to the farmhouse where general custer and his wife were staying an enormous piercearrow limousine came snarling up the road raising an even more enormous cloud of dust it pulled to a stop alongside of major dowling excuse me is this first army headquarters the driver asked dowling was about to give him a sarcastic answerwhat the devil else would this bewhen he saw who was riding in the back of the limousine goldrimmed spectacles graying roan mustache a big grin that showed an alarming number of teethhe was so busy staring at president theodore roosevelt he almost forgot to answer the drivers question when custers adjutant admitted the fellow had brought roosevelt to the right place the president said and youre dowling arent you he got out of the motorcar and pointed at the portly soldier you come with me major ill want to speak with you also yes mr president dowling could scarcely have said anything else when his commanderinchief gave him a direct order he did not like the way roosevelt had shown up unannounced at custers headquarters the likeliest explanation he could think of for roosevelts unannounced appearance was one that put custer in hot waterand himself as well he moved his bulky frame as fast as he could to get into the farmhouse ahead of the president he hoped that would look as if he was escorting roosevelt not warning general custer of his arrival custer and libbie were in the parlor instead of studying matters military they were diligently going over newspapers intent on that neither of them had noticed the piercearrow outside dowling said general president roosevelt is here to consult with you that was the best face he could put on the presidents arrival is he custer said with a distinct sneer in his voice sure as hell he and roosevelt had loathed each other since the second mexican war each convinced to the bottom of his stubborn soul that the other had nabbed more credit in that mostly sorry fight than he deserved yes general i am here roosevelt said stepping into the farmhouse on dowlings heels awkward with age custer got to his feet and saluted his commanderinchief in montana hed been a regular army brevet brigadier general and teddy roosevelt a cavalry colonel of volunteers now their relative ranks were reversed dowling knew how much custer detested that how good to see you sir custer said looking and sounding like a man with a toothache a pleasure as always roosevelt was manifestly lying too he nodded to libbie and a pleasure to see you mrs custer i hope you will excuse me for taking your husband away but i do have some business to discuss with him and with major dowling here of course libbie shot him a look full of loathing dowling had never seen her so neatly outflanked without the tiniest doubt she wanted to stay not only to protect general custer but also because she knew at least as much about what the first army was doing as he did but she could not stay not after roosevelts blithe dismissal long black skirt flapping about her ankles she swept out of the parlor cornelia custer called when the pretty negro housekeeper came out of the kitchen the general went on coffee for me coffee for major dowlingand coffee for the president of the united states he might not care for roosevelt but he was not above using his acquaintance with him to impress cornelia and he did impress her her eyes widened she dropped roosevelt a curtsy before dashing away for the coffee the president affable enough dipped his head in reply he sat down in the chair across from the sofa where custer and his wife had been checking the papers and waved dowling to libbies place beside the general commanding first army again custers adjutant could only obey roosevelt did not wait for cornelia to come with the coffee lets get right down to brass tacks he saidlike custer he did not have patience as his long suit general the war department is of the opinion that you have not been entirely candid in the reports you have been submitting in recent weeks i have asked major dowling here to discuss this with us today as he has prepared many of these reports under your direction cornelia did come in with the coffee thencusters and dowlings as they liked it roosevelts black with cream and sugar on the side to let him fix it as he would the brief respite while the president fiddled with the cup did nothing to ease dowlings mind christ theyve got me cold he thought and wondered if his army career was about to end here because hed been so foolish as to obey his superior only discipline learned at the poker table kept him from showing his dread if custer knew dread he didnt show it either the war department has all sorts of opinions he said sneering as he had when dowling announced that roosevelt was there a few of them bear a discernible relation to the real worldbut only a few mind you have you then or have you not been less than candid in your description of how you are deploying the barrels under your command roosevelt asked there it was the question without a good answer sweat broke out on dowlings forehead though the parlor was cool verging on chilly now custer would lie and now roosevelt would crucify himand as small change in the transaction would crucify dowling too custer laughed of course ive been less than candid mr president he answered his tone inviting roosevelt to share a secret with him so has major dowling at my direct order the lads with the thick glasses in philadelphia must have been more alert than usual to notice i hope you have some good explanation for your extraordinary statement general roosevelt said dowling devoutly hoped custer had a good explanation too from long acquaintance with the general commanding first army though he knew that hope was liable even likely to be disappointed not this time laughing again custer said i have reason to believe the rebels are somehow getting their hands on the reports i forward to the war department and so i have been carefully feeding them false information for the past several weeks i hope they are less astute than our own people and fail to notice the deception roosevelt rounded on dowling major is what general custer says true if he wanted to dowling could break custer here he could not only break him he could break him and come out in the short run smelling like a rose as he did it the old fool had served himself up with an apple in his mouth and all dowling had to do was carve hed dreamt of a chance like this for yearsand now that he had it he discovered he couldnt stick the knife in that was what it would be a stab in the back he might escape custer with it but afterwards who in the army would trust an officer who laid his superior low answer me major roosevelt said im sorry your excellency dowling said general custer did not tell me why he wanted the reports to appear as if they were disguising the concentration of barrels that was a lie but no one could ever prove it was a lie i presume though that it was for reasons of security if roosevelt felt like seeing for himself how the barrels were deployed everything could still cave in like a trench with a mine touched off below it the president didnt go charging off to do that not right away anyhow rubbing his chin he asked why general do you believe the confederates may have been reading your dispatches to philadelphia just by way of example sir how could general macarthurs attack over by cotton town have failed last fall if the rebs had no advance warning of it custer askedreasonably daniel macarthur is as fine a brigadier general and division commander as the us army possesses but he failed the rebs must have prepared in advance to withstand him macarthurs attack had failed among other reasons because custer didnt give his fine brigadier general theadmittedly extravagantartillery support and number of barrels hed requested custer didnt want macarthur gaining glory any more than hed wanted roosevelt gaining glory in the second mexican war dowling had watched custer outmaneuver macarthur could he outmaneuver roosevelt too maybe he could the president coughed why have you not presented these suspicions to the war department he asked and dowling realized he was witnessing something few men had ever seen theodore roosevelt in retreat custer smiled when he heard that question he knew he had the game in hand your excellency since i have not been able to determine how the confederates are obtaining their information i did not wish to run the risk of informing them that i knew they were doing so letting them have information that is not true struck me as being more profitable more profitable you say roosevelt perked up he set a finger by the side of his nose and you have a plan to make them pay so you can reap the profit mr president i do custer answered telling the truth as far as dowling could see for the first time in the interview very well general roosevelt said till the mare drops her foal no one can tell what the creature will look like i shall judge your planand whether you were wise to conceal it not only from the foe but also from your countrymenby the result he got to his feet i thank you for your time general major dowling thank you also for your part in explaining what has occurred here good morning gentlemen without waiting for a reply roosevelt walked out to the limousine dowling stared out the window hardly daring to believe the piercearrow was really rolling away when it was out of sight he let out a long heartfelt sigh of relief my god sir you got away with it custer looked disgracefully smug of course i did major that was an inspired explanation you gave him dowling was not used to admiring custers wits doing so felt strange and wrong as if he were dabbling in some unnatural vice so it was if i do say so myself the vain pompous old fool looked more smug still dowling fought down the urge to retch libbie custer came downstairs in a rustle of skirts i saw him leave she said did he swallow it autie every morsel my dear some of the smugness hissed out of custer as if he were an observation balloon with a leak he turned back to dowling major now that the president has gone had it been a complete sentence he would have finished it with something like get the hell out of here yourself yes sir dowling left in a hurry so libbie was the one who came up with the second line of defense he thought slowly he nodded he should have known custer wouldnt have the brains to do it on his own he nodded again his faith in his own sense of how the world worked in large measure restored but custer even if he hadnt planned the deception had carried it off if he could deceive the confederates toohe hadnt had much luck doing that in any of the fighting up till now but then he hadnt tried very hard either if he did if he could it made a man hope in this war too much hope was dangerous ill believe it when i see it abner dowling said arthur mcgregor rode the wagon toward rosenfeld whenever us trucks came up behind him he delayed a little before moving off to the shoulder to let them roar past it was a tiny bit of resistance but all he could muster he had to clench the reins tightly to keep from shouting abuse at the americans when the time came he would try to take his revenge till then he had to seem as conquered as beaten down as the rest of his countrymen outside rosenfeld the occupiers had a checkpoint they were meticulous in searching the wagon and even more meticulous in searching his person they found nothing out of the ordinary there was nothing out of the ordinary to find pass on one of them said thank you sir mcgregor answered abject as a kicked dog he scrambled back up into the seat flicked the reins and rolled on toward the little town where he bought what he couldnt raise for himself rosenfeld manitoba these days was more nearly an american town than a canadian one most of the men on the streets wore greengray most of the talk mcgregor heard was in sharp american accents sour to his ears most of the money that changed hands was american money boring green banknotes coins full of eagles and stars and thunderbolts instead of bearing the images of george and edward and victoria most of the money in mcgregors pocket was american money he hated that too he had to tie up his wagon on a side street american motorcars and trucks and wagons and even bicycles dominated main street as he came round the corner a greengray ford whizzed past him he had to work hard to keep his face straight to show none of what he was thinking major hannebrink was at the wheel of that ford unusually he had none of his springfieldcarrying bully boys with him probably isnt out to murder anyone this morning mcgregor thought maybe he waits till after lunch to do his murdering the post office was only a few doors away when mcgregor went inside the familiar spicy smell of wilfred rokebys hair oil greeted his nose the postmaster used the aromatic stuff to keep his hair pasted down at either side of the precise part that ran back along the middle of his scalp good day to you arthur rokeby said his voice as prim and precise as that rulerdrawn part how are you today he asked that question cautiously as he was in the habit of doing since alexanders death ive been better wilf and thats the truth but ive been worse too mcgregor answered he sniffed in an exaggerated fashion havent you run out of that damned grease of yours yet sure as hell the plant that made it must be turning out poison gas these days rokeby glared then stared and then chuckled quietly first time ive heard you make a joke in a while arthur even if it is aimed at me what can i do for you this morning let me have twentyfive of those stamps the yanks are making us use mcgregor said here you are rokeby said thatll be a dollar even letter rate remained two cents as it had been before the war but people in occupied canada also paid a twocent surcharge for every stamp the extra money going into a fund for entertainers who amused us soldiers mcgregor had complained about the surcharge ever since it was initiated he kept quiet now save for a low sigh as he set a silver dollar on the table it was a us coin and had a bust of liberty on one side which struck him as ironic the other side showed a fierce eagle and the word remembrance rokeby quickly scooped the dollar into the cash box as if afraid leaving it where mcgregor could see it might inflame him but mcgregor seemed unable to rise to inflammation today saw hannebrink driving out of town when i was walking over here he remarked did you at the mention of the security officer wilfred rokeby grew wary again then his own expression changedto of all things amusement was he heading out by his lonesome without any wolfhounds along matter of fact he was mcgregor said he turned and looked out the window you see him as he went by rokeby shook his head i did not he said and his voice compelled belief but i have hearddont know for certain mind you but they do say iti have heard like i was tellin you hes got himself a cutiepie somewheres outside of town hannebrink arthur mcgregor stared until this moment the idea that any canadian woman might be friendlymight be more than friendlyto the yank who had murdered alexander had never entered his mind but for strumpets for whom such matters were business arrangements he hadnt heard of any of his countrywomen showing friendshipor something more than friendshiptoward the hated occupiers that of course did not mean such things failed to happen you wouldnt know who she is would you rokeby quickly shook his head silent curses echoed through mcgregors mind had he been too obvious perhaps not for the postmaster answered not sure anybody here in town does whoever the gal is dont expect its something shed want to brag on you know what i mean that i do wilf mcgregor answered pretending he didnt know what rokeby was talking about would have been an obvious lie and so more dangerous than agreeing with him the farmer picked up the stamps folded them over themselves and put them into an overcoat pocket obliged to you see you again next time i come to town i expect take care of yourself rokeby said take care of your family was that an oblique warning of the sort maude made mcgregor didnt know he didnt worry about it either with a nod to the postmaster he left the post office went back to the wagon for the kerosene tin and strode down the street to the general store anyone who needed a storekeeper for a vaudeville show could hardly have done better than henry gibbon who looked the part from bald head to leather apron over a belly that remained comfortable despite hard times storekeepers shared with farmers the ability to keep themselves fed no matter how hard times got how are you today arthur gibbon asked the same wariness in his voice as had been in rokebys not too bad not too good mcgregor said a variation on the reply hed given the postmaster he set a couple of cents on the counter im going to raid your pickle barrel gibbon nodded and plucked up the little copper coins mcgregor lifted the lid picked out a plump pickle and took a bite he chewed thoughtfully thats not bad but it doesnt taste quite the same as the ones you usually have in there cant get those any more gibbon answered these here pickles they come up out of michigan like you say they arent bad mcgregor stared at the pickle in his hand as if it had turned on him he almost threw it down but even if it came from the united states hed already bought it and he was a man who hated waste he ate it and licked the last of the vinegar off his fingers didnt come to town just for pickles gibbon said go ontell me im wrong before mcgregor could tell him anything a couple of soldiers in greengray walked into the general store and looked around as if they owned the place they were occupying this part of the province so in effect they did mcgregor bought another pickle and diligently ate it finding that preferable to having to talk to the yanks one soldier bought a spool of threadgibbon had a goodsized display of stuff that made a fair match for the us uniform his pal bought a tinplated potato peeler out they went youll be rich henry mcgregor remarked oh yeah the storekeeper said im going to take this here and retire on it to the south of franceunless the damn germans get there first now what can i do for you today need some beans mcgregor answered and my kerosene ration and white thread for maudeshe aint got any uniforms to mendand five yards of calico for her too and a new bobbin for the sewing machine youve got to give me your ration coupon for the kerosene gibbon reminded him never seen people like the yanks for dotting every i and crossing every t if you get the kerosene without i get the coupon roof falls in on me near as i can tell lifes hard enough without that lifes hard enough mcgregor said no more here you are he pulled the coupon out of his pocket and handed it to gibbon yanks sold it to me theyre willing to let me have lights in my house this month long as i havent got too many chuckling gibbon got a funnel and a bucket and filled the kerosene tin from the barrel he kept not far from the ones that held pickles and crackers you sound a mite better these days maybe a mite the farmer allowed after a short pause he went on that hannebrink almost ran me over when i was coming round the corner to the post office things must be a mite better for him too or more than a mite wilf rokeby said he was in a hurry to get down to elsie kravchuks place and see how bad her bed linens rumpled rokeby hadnt said any such thing but if anyone in town knew where major hannebrink really was going henry gibbon was the man and sure enough gibbon looked disgusted that damn rokeby all i can say is its a good thing he aint got a cold on account of hed blow out his brains if he was to bring a hanky up to his nose it aint elsie that hannebrinks laying pipe for its paulette tooker three farms over he seemed pretty sure mcgregor said doubtfully only holes wilfred rokeby knows a goddamn thing about are the ones between his stamps the storekeeper said christ on his cross arthur when have you ever known wilf to have his gossip straight well youre right about that mcgregor said damn shame i dont know the tookers what youd call well but i never heard anything bad about paulette till now id still sooner believe it was elsie she hasnt been right since her husband went into the prisoner camp believe what you want gibbons voice showed his indifference what other gossip have you got mcgregor asked spin it out and lets see how much of it i believe gibbon was happy to oblige he knew something scandalous about almost all the canadians in town about half the canadians on the farms and about maybe one american in three whether what he knew bore any relation to the truth was a different question when the storekeeper finally ran down like a phonograph that needed winding mcgregor went out brought his wagon around to the front of the store and loaded his purchases onto it he was very quiet and thoughtful all the way home when he was almost there he smiled dirt fountained up as us artillery pounded a confederate machinegun position in front of jonesboro arkansas thatll teach the goddamn sons of bitches ben carlton said gleefully as the barrage went on and on dont blaspheme sergeant gordon mcsweeney had lost track of how many times hed warned the company cook about that carlton was as stubborn in sin as he was in reproof blow em to hell and gone carlton said mcsweeney did not reprove that sentiment he agreed with it he expected carlton would go to hell too but that had nothing to do with his hatred for the confederates in their nest of sandbags and concrete they were a good crew and they were brave and they had cost the us troops across from them too many casualties at last the guns fell silent theyd been going on so long mcsweeney imagined he still heard them roaring for a few seconds after theyd quit he didnt put his head up over the parapet to see what theyd done to that position if they hadnt done enough that was asking for a bullet in the face and they hadnt defiantly cockily the confederate machine gunners squeezed off a few quick bursts to let their foes know they were still in business at the same old stand bastards ben carlton snarled god damn those bastards to the hottest fire in hell for the next million years and then think up somethin really bad to happen to em for the million years after that they could eat your cooking every day mcsweeney said for you will surely go down to that place of eternal torment yourself unless you leave off taking the name of the lord in vain every time you open your mouth carlton glared at him fine im just tickled pink them brave upstanding confederate gentlemen lived through everything we flung at em im dancin in the daisies that they get the chance to blow off the tops of some more of our heads there you satisfied mr holierthanthou no mcsweeney said in a flat voice i am not satisfied bombardment by artillery is the wrong way to put a machinegun nest out of action you might as well try to kill a mosquito with a shotgun when the mosquitoes start bitin around here well kill em any which way we can carlton said you misunderstand mcsweeney said carlton smirked mcsweeney fixed him with a paleeyed glare that made the smirk drip off his face not only that you misunderstand on purpose if that isnt sinful it is insubordinate shall we talk this over with captain schneider carlton visibly considered it whatever schneider did to him was liable to be milder than what hed get from mcsweeney finally he shook his head and ate crow no sarge im sorry sarge he didnt sound sorry mcsweeney reluctantly decided not to press the point he had other things on his mind anyhow artillery i tell you is the wrong tool to use i know the right tool his eyes blazed that was metaphorical not literal but ben carlton followed his thoughts even so how inblazes you going to get close enough to those confederatebums to toast em before they put about a belts worth of bullets through you and your gaslight there it would have to be at night mcsweeney thought aloud it would have to be at night and i would need a diversion you need your head examined thats what you need carlton went off down the trench line shaking his head mcsweeney on the other hand went off and found his company commander permission to stage a raid on the enemys trenches tonight sir he asked captain schneider nodded mcsweeney saluted sometimes things were very easy to arrange but to his annoyance schneider came up to the forwardmost trench while the men who would take part in the raid were scrambling over the parapet the company commander frowned its usual for raiders to take along an extra sack of grenades or two he remarked yes sir so it is mcsweeney agreed we have them you must have seen i saw schneider said grimly he pointed to mcsweeney it is highly unusual however for a man to go on a trench raid festooned with a flamethrower i suppose it may be sir when mcsweeney shrugged the heavy tank of jellied gasoline on his back dug into his kidneys his voice sounded more innocent than it had any business being of course there arent that many flamethrowers in action there arent that many people crazy enough to want to use the damned things either schneider said what the hell have you got lurking at the back of your mind this time sergeant sir if we always do the same thing when we fight the rebels theyll catch on and lick us if we do something different every now and again that will keep them guessing mcsweeney answered if theyre guessing even the same old thing will work better because they wont be looking for it so much captain schneider gave him a fishy stare if id wanted strategy sergeant id have talked with the general staff he waited to see if that would squeeze any more details out of mcsweeney when it didnt he grimaced sergeant if you go and get yourself killed i shall be annoyed with you i am in gods hands sir mcsweeney said so long as he bears me up i shall not fall i do not believe he is ready to abandon me yet may i go now i dont want the rest of them to get too far ahead of me and why is that schneider asked mcsweeney stood mute the captain raked him with a glance almost as hot as the flame that sprang from the nozzle of his flamethrower when that failed to have any effect schneider said go then he turned his back as if like pilate washing his hands of the whole affair mcsweeney climbed the sandbag steps out of the trench scrambled over the parapet and crawled toward the confederate lines he could hear or thought he could hear the rest of the raiders ahead their course swung a little to the right of being a straight line his swung a little to the left getting through his own wire was harder with the flamethrower on his back being quiet was harder too the tank rattled on his shoulders and banged and clanked whenever it hit a rock he wished he would have thought to wrap it in a blanket before he set out but he hadnt and it was too late he made his slow cautious way toward that machinegun position as he crawled forward he chuckled silently he had plenty of new shell holes in which to conceal himself that was an advantage if a small onethe bombardment had revised the landscape so that it didnt look as familiar to the confederate gunners as it would have before rifle fire erupted perhaps half a mile to the south by the sound the confederates were raiding us trenches there machine guns on both sides opened up the position toward which mcsweeney was advancing fired in the direction of the us line the muzzle flashes from the machine guns were stuttering bayonets of flame tracers scribed brief orange lines of death through the night none of those tracers was aimed in mcsweeneys direction he chuckled again as he scuttled forward hed sent out his party to keep the machine gunners from noticing his approach and now the rebs own raiding party was doing part of the job for him slithering under and through the confederate wire was a longer and tougher piece of work than getting through the sorry entanglements in front of his lines had been for one thing the confederates had a little more wire than his side did for another moving silently was much more important here than it had been when he was several hundred yards farther away he inched forward the concrete blockhouse that held the firing slits for the confederate machine guns was only a hundred yards offfiftythirtytwenty he stopped he could incinerate it from here but this was not the moment he wanted some chance of getting back to his own lines again if god chose not to give him onewell that was gods affair meanwhile mcsweeney would wait and hope and pray off to his right two grenades banged several others followed in short order rifles barked springfields and with a slightly different note tredegars shouts erupted and a high shrill scream that had to burst from the throat of a desperately wounded man through the din mcsweeney heard the machine guns scrape against the rims of their firing slits as their crews traversed them he heard the gunners curse his country he shook his head the lord punished those who did such things and i am his instrument he whispered the machine guns opened up more screams rose mcsweeney hoped confederates were doing all the screaming but doubted that was so he felt sorry that some of the raiders hed sent out would be hurt or killed but only so sorry god had made the world so some things simply could not be done without loss he got to his feet pointed the nozzle of the flamethrower in the direction of the firing slits and pulled the trigger the action after hed worked on it was smooth as glass flaming gasoline leaped the gap the machine guns fell silent the men who had served them though screamed like damned souls mcsweeney shook his head torments of this world were brief not eternal and satan surely had fires hotter than any of mortal devising the scotsman dropped back into the shell hole bullets creased the air half a minute later he rose again and gave the machinegun nest another taste of the lash of fire cartridges inside the blockhouse began cooking off no more screams came from it the men inside were already cooked mcsweeney dropped down once more he thought about standing again for a third dose of flame but in the end thought better of it the confederates were howling with fury bullets buzzed overhead thick as bees he wondered if the rebs would come out of the trenches after him they didnt he smiled his alarming smile few men in his section would have been happy about going after a foe with a flamethrower either he made his slow way back across nomansland to his own lines commending his soul to god all the way if a bullet chanced to strike the fuel tank on his backif god willed that a bullet should strike the fuel tank on his backhe would learn what sort of death he dealt out to others god did not so will he scrambled over the parapet and down into his own trenches hunting down captain schneider he said sir i can report that that machinegun position will not trouble us again for some time to come schneider said nothing at all he stood there in the dark shaking his head ben carlton happened to be standing not far away goddamn but youre a crazy son of a bitch sergeant he declared dont blaspheme mcsweeney answered automatically and then when he really heard what the company cook had said thank you till his latest troubles started cincinnatus had never set foot in the covington kentucky city hall before the war started a negro in the csa saw the inside of a city hall only if he was in some kind of trouble before the war cincinnatus had always stayed out of trouble but he hadnt stayed out since and now the yankees were grilling him actually luther bliss wasnt quite a yankee he was the chief of the kentucky state police in the readmitted administrationhead of the secret police in other words now then boy he said in a mild voice tell me again how that kennedy son of a bitch happened to get himself shot dead on your doorstep the only thing cincinnatus had going for him was that the authorities didnt really know how much trouble he was in i tol you an tol you suh he answered sounding as stupid as he could i dont rightly know i used to work fo the man is all a muscle in bliss right cheek jumped a scar as from a knife cut that cheek which made the tic more noticeable lots of people used to work for the rebel son of a bitch he said mildly still how come he chose you his eyes a peculiar pale brown were very intent i aint got a clue suh cincinnatus said could i please go back to workin reglar again suh if i cant do my job on account o you folks askin me questions all the time things git hard back home fo my wife an my little boy an me bliss steepled his fingers and leaned across the table toward him now lets just talk about your job shall we lieutenant kennan gives you a good character from the days when you were working on the docks and lieutenant kennan i happen to know doesnt hardly give niggers good characters atall his own accent thickened was he trying to lull cincinnatus into thinking him a fool if he was he failed cincinnatus could tell how good at his job he was stubborn as a hound and sneaky as a snake i worked hard for the man cincinnatus said i work hard every place i work thats what lieutenant straubing says too bliss agreed with a nod he says you work as hard as any man he ever saw but he also says thereve been a hell of a lot of fires and explosions in units his outfit has resupplied you want to tell me about that only thing i know is a couple times last year the lieutenant said we should all keep an eye on each other on account of trouble like that cincinnatus said dont know what ever came of it he did know they hadnt found the ingredients for the cigarshaped firebombs hed got from tom kennedy as soon as straubing made worried noises about such things hed made sure not to keep them in or near his house had the us authorities discovered them luther bliss wouldnt be asking him questions now hed be taking him apart with a hacksaw and pliers and cutting torch bliss kept tiptoeing around the edges of the truth kennedy had a pal storekeeper named conroy his place burned down last year toohell of a fire conroy hasnt been seen much since folks saw you goin into that store yes suh i did that every now and then cincinnatus saidno point denying something where the denial could be proved a lie it was on the way home from the riverside but i didnt do it a lothe had high prices an he didnt fancy black folks much black folks bliss said musingly itll be different for niggers now that kentuckys back in the usa not so hard like it was before hope so suh cincinnatus said the law probably would be different but from what hed seen most whites in the usa had little more use for negroes than did most whites in the csa and he didnt see white kentuckians changing their ways because a new flag flew over them bliss clicked his tongue between his teeth wont be illegal for niggers to be socialists even long as theyre peaceable about it he paused of course niggers likely wont get to vote right away its not like this was new england or somewhere like that no suh cincinnatus said with a sigh black kentuckians wouldnt get to vote till a majority of white kentuckians decided they should cincinnatus didnt plan on holding his breath he just hoped that oblique reference meant luther bliss was still tiptoeing around his connections with the reds too and not seeing it plain bliss glared at him with those disconcerting eyes as a coon dog might look at a raccoon it had treed in a crowded part of the woods suddenly realizing the quarry might escape from tree to tree the secret policeman looked intent cincinnatus didnt like his expression hed come up with something nasty before he could ask it the door to the room in which he was questioning cincinnatus opened bliss whirled angrily dammit i said i wasnt to be disturbed in here he said sir said the man whod bearded him in his den the president is outside and he wants to talk with you bliss pale brown eyes widened before he could say anything theodore roosevelt strode into the interrogation chamber that made cincinnatus eyes go wide too i dont have time for shillyshallying and foolishness bliss roosevelt snapped we need to purge this state of rebs get the trains mr president bliss answered get the trains and ship about two people out of three somewhere else because thats the only way youre going to purge kentucky if were lucky we can keep most of the rebs from raising too much cain behind our lines till weve won the war i think i can do that much the other go talk to a preacher because im not in the miracles game cincinnatus knew a certain reluctant respect for luther bliss telling teddy roosevelt he couldnt have all he wanted seemed much the same as telling a tornado it couldnt go where it wanted the president of the united states glared at bliss who looked back imperturbably roosevelt seemed to respect him too it will have to do he said though i hate half measures he paid attention to cincinnatus for the first time whats this negro here gone and done cincinnatus spoke for himself i havent done anything sir where hed wanted to impress bliss as being ignorant and shiftless he wanted roosevelt to see him as a bright intelligent innocent wronged the only trouble with that stratagem was bliss noticing his shifting style the secret policemans huntingdog eyes widened just for a moment to roosevelt he said hard to say your excellency fugitive confederate underground man named kennedy got his head blown off on this boys front porch cincinnatus here drove for kennedy before the war been a fair number of suspicious fires clustered around him too thinking fast cincinnatus said mr president sir one of these suspicious fires hes talking about was to conroys general store mr bliss told me conroy was one of mr kennedys friends if i was workin for mr kennedy why would i burn out one of his friends that strikes me as a fair question roosevelt said how about it bliss bliss had not an ounce of retreat in him mr president were also looking at his connections with the reds have you found any roosevelt demanded not yet the secret policeman said stolidly and im not a bit surprised either roosevelt said how in the blue blazes do you expect a man to be simultaneously aiding the confederate resistance and the marxist resistance when the marxists came as close to overthrowing the csa as weve managed ourselves sir this is kentucky bliss said everythings topsyturvy here poppycock roosevelt snorted drivel things either make logical sense or they dont and thats as true in kentucky as it is in new hampshire if youre trying to make out that this negro is a reb and a red at the same time and if you havent got any solid evidence hes either one i suggestno i dont suggest i orderthat you let him go on about his lawful occasions it wasnt poppycock it wasnt drivel cincinnatus knew it wasnt poppycock or drivel so did luther bliss who being a kentuckian understood his home state better than theodore roosevelt could ever hope to do but the president of the united states had just given bliss a direct order with a sigh he said all right cincinnatus you are free to go you keep your nose clean and you wont have any more trouble from me thank you kindly suh cincinnatus didnt think bliss meant that but he had said it and could be reminded of it at need suh could you give me a letter to lieutenant straubing to let him know im in the clear so as i can go back to makin an honest livin bliss plainly didnt want to but had no choice ill see to it he said back pay roosevelt exploded so vehemently cincinnatus jumped pay for all the days this man has not been able to work whats your daily rate cincinnatus two and a half dollars sir cincinnatus answered if thats all you make and youve missed considerable work because of this folderol you must be feeling the pinch roosevelt said bliss pay this man one hundred dollars and pay it out of your own pocket for harassing someone whos done nothing wrong cincinnatus expected the chief of the kentucky state police to do some exploding of his own at that but bliss after another moment of surprise nodded he said ill have that and the letter ready for him when he goes now if we can send him out so we can talk about a couple of things without him listening to cincinnatus disappointment roosevelt didnt object to that a couple of hardfaced guards led cincinnatus away and put him in what had probably been a small meeting room before the war but now served as a holding cell they didnt do anything but sit him down he knew how easily that might have been otherwise he waited for what had to be a couple of hours he wondered what roosevelt and luther bliss were talking about he wondered if bliss would wait till roosevelt was gone and then go back to sweating him finally a guard said come along you and led him out to the cityhall steps there stood luther bliss heres your letter he said cincinnatus checked it it was what it was supposed to be and heres your money bliss took his wallet from his hip pocket and peeled off five twentydollar bills only after cincinnatus had the money in his own pocket did he wonder who was watching and why they thought he was getting it and only after that did he realize how clever and dangerous luther bliss really was thegreatwar breakthroughs flora hamburger wished she were somewhere anywhere else than at theodore roosevelts second inauguration she wished most particularly that she were at the inauguration of president eugene v debs but socialist senator eugene v debs of indiana felt no qualms about attending the inauguration of the man who had defeated him so flora supposed she could get through it too the ceremony was held in an enormous briefing room in one of the many war department buildings that sprawled through downtown philadelphia in a normal year it would have been outdoors in a normal year of course it would have been in washington dc but that was another story to keep confederate bombers from disrupting it now it was not only indoors but also secret flora had found out where to come only the day before someone tapped her on the shoulder she turned sitting behind her was hosea blackford of dakota tell me what kind of bargain we can make to get your vote on that immigration bill he said she shook her head ask me something else half the people in my district have relatives in europe and that bill would strand them there forever if i vote for it theyll throw me out and ill deserve it he frowned the party leadership backs it you know the party leadership backed the war too right from the start flora answered were they right then before blackford could say anything she waved him to silence here come the president and the chief justice she smiled down at the floor here she was glad to see theodore roosevelt after all he wore cutaway white tie top hat and gloves all the trappings of capitalist power with him strode chief justice oliver wendell holmes his big fierce white mustache a fitting ornament for his proud hawk face holmes was only a few days away from his seventyfifth birthday but moved like a much younger man he was without a doubt a class enemy reckoning him an honest man flora granted him grudging admiration for that he and roosevelt took their places behind a podium more often used to let officers know the upcoming plan of attack after vice president kennan took the oath for his second term roosevelt did the same in a loud firm voice once the applause had died down justice holmes stepped away from the podium president roosevelt stared out over it at the senators and representatives and other assembled dignitaries the electric lights flashed off the lenses of his spectacles giving his face a curiously mechanical appearance as if a device had taken almost human form and were running the united states without the fighting edge he said no man and no nation can be really great for in the really great man as in the really great nation there must be both the heart of gold and the temper of steel his gestures were stiff adding to the industrial impression those blank shining disks that seemed to replace his eyes created in england and france said it was the duty of those two nations to mediate between the united states and the confederate states and they asserted that any americans who in such event refused to accept their mediation and to stop the war would thereby show themselves the enemies of peace even abraham lincoln regarded this as an unfriendly act to the united states but he had not the strength to withstand it and in so regarding it as in few other things lincoln was right looking back from a distance of more than fifty years we can clearly see as much such mediation was a hostile act not only to the united states but to humanity the nations that forced that unrighteous peace upon us more than fifty years ago were the enemies of mankind very many of the men and women who are at times misled into demanding peace as if it were itself an end instead of being a means of righteousness are folk of good will and sound intelligence who need only seriously to consider the facts and who can then be trusted to think aright and act aright wellmeaning folk who always clamor for peace without regard as to whether peace brings justice or injustice should ponder such facts and then should still their clamor ponder the facts and then think my way flora thought scornfully president roosevelt pounded on england and france and the cuckoos egg they planted in the american nest of freedom humiliated our great nation again a generation later and have sought to encircle us on our own continent ever since just as they and the russian tyrants have sought to encircle our partner friend and ally the german empire on the european continent they have tried and they have failed roosevelt could not go on then thunderous applause interrupted him he basked in it before raising his hands to ask for quiet i promise you this my second term will show us the victory we have longed for since those now old were young the debt we owe is old too and has accumulated much interest through the years we shall repay it in full and more besides more applause echoed from the ceiling of the briefing room we must stand absolutely for the righteousness of revenge roosevelt finished and we must remember that to do so would have been utterly without avail if we had not possessed the strength and tenacity of spirit which back righteousness with deeds and not mere words until we complete our vengeance we must keep ourselves ready high of heart and undaunted of soul to back our rights with our strength he stepped back from the podium the torrent of applause that rose up made everything that had gone before seem like a whisper in a distant room flora hamburger joined in the applause though tepidly and for politeness sake she looked around and saw that most of her fellow socialists and the handful of republicans still in congress were doing the same it mattered little the democratic majority made plenty of noise on their own roosevelt took his time leaving the hall he paused in the aisles to chat with soldiers and politicians and functionaries who came crowding up to him eager to be recognized floras lip curled at their fawning sycophancytill she saw senator debs talking amiably with the president the cooperation shed already seen between socialists and democrats in congress had surprised her this shook her it was as if a longfamiliar picture turned upside down yielded another image altogether then roosevelt caught sight of her she was easy to spot the audience held only a handful of women and she was the youngest by at least fifteen years the president smiled in her direction miss hamburger he called and beckoned her to him she could either go or staying in her place seem rude what ran through her mind as she approached theodore roosevelt was my parents will never believe im talking with the president of the united states she might not share his politics but the usa had never yet had a socialist chief executive im honored to meet you mr president she said honored being true because of his office where pleased would have stretched a point and i am honored to meet you miss hamburgercongresswoman hamburger i should say roosevelt answered and surprised her by sounding as if he meant it you showed great pluck in the campaign that won you your seat i followed it with interest and no little admiration and by all accounts you seem to be shaping well in the house thank you mr president she said you surprise me since i am not of your party andshe couldnt resist the jabi dont see much point to this war even if i know a good many of the facts about it he surprised her again by not getting angry the point is that winning it will at last let our country take its rightful place in the sun a place wrongly denied us since the war of secession my question is what price do we pay for our place in the sun flora replied how many young men will never see that place in the sun some because they are blind most because they are dead how many young working men will die so the capitalists who own the steel mills and the coal mines and the weapons plants can buy new mansions new motorcars new yachts with the profits they make selling munitions to the government now roosevelt frowned but still did not explode if the capitalists can afford new toys after the war tax weve slapped on em theyve got better bookkeepers and lawyers than i think they do you have a fine stump speech there congresswoman and i think you are sincere in it but it doesnt altogether match the way the world works a pleasure to meet you as i said if youll excuse me he shook someone elses hand flora found herself more impressed with him than shed thought she would be part of that was the office he held part of it was realizing that what she had taken for political bombast were in fact his true beliefs and part was the force with which he expressed those beliefs a force mocked in her own party but she discovered not one to be taken lightly hosea blackford came up to her in roosevelts wake his expression was somewhere between amused and curious well what do you think of the earthquake that walks like a man now that youve met him in the flesh the congressman from dakota asked hesformidable flora answered hes easy to caricature but i have the idea that taking the caricature for the man would be a mistake a dangerous mistake blackford agreed roosevelt has made a lot of people pay for doing that when he goes charging straight at something he seems to have no more brains than a bull moose but anyone who thinks they arent hiding behind that smirk ends up regretting it flora sighed he does argue better than i thought he would he met lincoln during the second mexican war i gather the same as i did blackford answered they quarreled so he was less impressed than i was theres only one kind of person roosevelt doesnt quarrel with as far as i can see flora said the congressman from dakota raised a questioning eyebrow she explained someone who already agrees with every word he says hosea blackford laughed you are dangerous arent you did you get your invitation to the inaugural ball at the powel house she nodded yes i did i hate to admit it but i thought the president was generous to invite the whole congress to his residence socialists and republicans along with the democrats stinginess isnt one of teddys besetting sins blackford said he has enough besides that are you going i was thinking of it yes flora said only weeks out of the lower east side she knew her fascination with the glamour she was encountering was unsocialist but she couldnt help it are you oh no and i wish you wouldnt either he said alarm stabbed through her was she committing some dreadful faux pas stonefaced as a judge he went on the socialists should boycott it that way if the confederate bombers get through and level the place well be ready and waiting to take over the government she stared at him then laughed so loud roosevelt looked back over his shoulder to see what was funny let me ask you again she said her voice dangerous are you going to the inaugural ball a little sheepishly blackford nodded so did flora with the air of having won a victory good as i said so am i ill see you there sergeant jake featherston sat on an upended barrel of flour atop round hill virginia hed bought a gray eagle scratchpad in the round hill general store and his pencil scraped over the paper he knew he wasnt the best writer ever born or anything close to it he didnt care so many things he hadnt been able to say to anybodyso many things he had said that nobody would hear if he got them down he would at least be able to prove hed been right all along got any makings sarge michael scott called as he walked up to featherston my pouch is empty as teddy roosevelts head yeah i got some jake answered before he pulled his own leather tobacco pouch out of a pocket he slammed the notebook shut and put a hand over the cover what was in there was his no one elses only after hed made sure it was safe did he toss scott the pouch thanks the loader said and rolled himself a cigarette he gave the tobacco back to featherston you been writin up a storm there past couple days he lit a match his cheeks hollowed as he sucked in smoke somethinto pass the time featherston said uncomfortably it was much more than that to him but he wouldnt admit as much not to scott not to anybody else barely to himself he wondered how hed managed to get through so much of the war without trying it before if hed gone much longer without setting down what he thought what he felt he was sure hed have gone crazy scott didnt seem to notice anything out of the ordinary which eased jakes mind yeah weve had some time to pass lately scott said taking another drag on the handmade cigarette yankees got down here into virginia and they havent done a whole hell of a lot since i know it that didnt make featherston any happier though nothing made featherston very happy these days every silver lining had its cloud last time they were quiet like this back in pennsylvania they were building for the push that threw us back to where were at now if they hit us another lick like that one there where the hell will we end up i dont reckon its that bad sarge scott said remember how you were all up in arms about the niggers going into line in front of us they havent done so bad and the damnyankees havent exactly given em a big kiss on the cheek to say good morning neither rifles jake said scornfully and then a little less so well hell all right machine guns too but they aint seen real artillery and they aint seen gas and they aint seen barrels till they do god damn me to hell if i think theyll make anything like proper soldiers youre a stubborn cuss sarge the loader said with a laugh bet your ass i am featherston said if i wasnt id have given up long since but i pay all my bills and i got a hell of a lot of bills to pay uhhuh scott took a last drag on the cigarette threw it down and crushed the butt under his heel he headed off perhaps a little faster than he had to featherston sighed with relief to see him go he opened the tablet and began to write again officers are fools because they wont see whats in front of their faces the country doesnt need officers like that but what other kind has it got they cant see that the n featherston the voice was sharp and precise so much so that it almost seemed a yankee voice jake jumped and slammed the tablet shut he whirled jumped to his feet and saluted major potter sir he said im sorry sir i didnt hear you come up he would have had to show respect for any officer he actually felt some for clarence potter at ease sergeant the bespectacled major from intelligence said he pointed north toward the us lines the lines that still bubbled and seethed like a pot boiling atop a stove but that to featherstons surprise had not yet boiled over what do you make of the quiet funny you should ask sir jake said my loader and i were just talking about that very same thing last time they were this quiet this long was before they hit us that first big lick up in pennsylvania so it was potter rubbed his chin thats very well reasonedreasoned like an officer i would say if i didnt think itd make you pick up that barrel and break it over my head sir i reckon your head is harder than this barrel ever dreamed of being featherston answered intending it as a compliment reckon your head is as hard as one of the damnyankees iron barrels with treads heh potter said no those really hard heads are the ones down in the war department in richmond itd take about an eightinch gun maybe a twelveinch to blow a hole through one of them and let in some light yes sir jake said one of the reasons he thought potter superior to the general run of officer in the army of northern virginia was the boundless contempt they shared for the hidebound aristocrats who held so many important posts in richmond potter said now that the colored troops have been in the line for a bit what do you think of them dont like em for hell featherston said promptly not for hell theyre in the line yeah but what happens when they really get hit we havent seen it yet like i told scott ill believe they can stand it when i see em do it potters jaws worked as if he were chewing tobacco but he didnt have a plug in one cheek heres another question for you then sergeantwhich would you rather have in front of you those full colored units or white units somewhere between a quarter and half strength those are your choices weve squeezed out about all the white manpower in the csa there is to squeeze i dont know the answer to that jake said i just dont know i have a notion of what understrength white units can do these niggerswho can guess might be better might be a hell of a lot worse in musing tones major potter said some white units without the proper experience will break and run the first time they come under truly heavy fire or the first time they have to face barrels if the black soldiers dont perform as well as veteran troops you need to remember it may be because theyre raw not because theyre black yes sir i understand what youre telling me featherston said but then again it may be because theyre niggers too hell of a choice weve got aint it sir we can lose the war without em or we can put em in the line and pray to jesus they dont turn their guns on us or go over to the damnyankees in droves fussily neat potter took out a clasp knife and scraped dirt from under a thumbnail he said you know the united states have a holiday called remembrance day coming up next month theyve been keeping a list of everything weve done to them since we fired on fort sumter to start the war of secession by now its a long list if they do lick us theyre going to pay it all back and make us start a list of our own youre saying theyd better not lick us jake said slowly we wont be happy if they do clarence potter agreed behind his spectacles his eyes missed very little he pointed to featherstons gray eagle notebook are you keeping a list of your own sergeant jakes ears got hot he was indeed keeping a list of his own if anyone besides him saw it hed be lucky to escape hard labor if major potter askedor demandedto see it he didnt know what hed do keeping his voice as light as he could he answered maybe ill do me up a book once the war is over over open sights ill call it or somethin like that what do you think sir better be a good book potter said theyll be a drug on the market when the fightings doneprovided anyones left alive to read them he had on a tin hat and tipped it as if it were a real felt derby good morning to you sergeant on down toward the front he went a businesslike man who might have been a businessman were it not for his helmet and puttees featherston let out a silent sigh of relief hed got away with not having to show what he was writing not only that hed found a title for what he was setting down in the tablet over open sights he printed above the writing on the first page he wished he had the war department over open sights close enough to blast them all without even having to bother reading the range he wished he had the negro troops in front of him over open sights too he scowled if they did run like rabbits the way he figured they were likely to do he would have them over open sights hed blast them too the only trouble was that would be too late something buzzed like an early mosquito but the sound came from farther away than a mosquitos infernal whine jake looked up tiny as a mosquito in the sky an aeroplane sauntered along above the defensive line of the army of northern virginia featherston knew what that meant the damnyankees were taking photographs when they had all they wanted when everything was set up the way they wanted hell would break loose no confederate aeroplanes rose to challenge the yankee spy belatedly antiaircraft guns over toward purcellville east of round hill opened up on the intruder the hammering of the gunsthe only cannon in the confederate arsenal that were quickerfiring than the threeinchers jake servedshattered the quiet of the latewinter morning puffs of smoke round and black as iron soup pots flecked the sky like smallpox scars on the face of an unvaccinated man the observation aeroplane flew through them straight as if it were on rails from his own observations jake knew what that meant the photographer was taking his pictures he knew the exact instant when the photographer was through taking pictures too at that instant the aeroplane stopped behaving like a locomotive on rails and started acting like a staggering drunk lurching every which way through the air to throw off the aim of the gunners on the ground wearily featherston cursed as the us observation aeroplane escaped hed seen too many others escape to be more than a little disgusted his sole consolation was that the yankees had every bit as much trouble hitting cs observation aeroplanes as if the aeroplanes getaway were some kind of signal firing from the us trenches which had been very light suddenly picked up rifles and machine guns hammered away and then as jake was about to call his men to ready themselves for the yankee onslaught the smallarms fire slackened again he let out a sigh of relief and went back to filling pages of the gray eagle tablet leading a charging column of barrels would have been more impressive if lieutenant colonel irving morrell could have seen the column he was leading he could see next to nothing the louvered vision slits were shut as tight as they could be and still let any light at all into the interior of the barrel had they been open any wider they would have let in bullets along with the light morrell kept wondering if hed died and gone to hell the reek wasnt of fire and brimstone it was fire and automotive exhaust which struck him as a reasonable approximation the two roaring truck engines in the compartment below let out enough bellows and screams and groans for an entire regiment of lost souls it was hot as hell in the barrel too this was march what the inside of the barrel would be like on a muggy august afternoon was something morrell did his best not to contemplate nor was he alone or even close to alone in his mechanical damnation along with the driver and the two engineers who labored to keep the hot metal parts working as they should he had for company the dozen machine gunners and the two artillerymen at the nose cannon an apartment buildings worth of people jammed into an ugly metal box half the size of a small flat he peered ahead he stuck his nose too close to the louvers and tried to flatten it against them when the barrel lurched over the scarred and battered ground he clutched the wounded member which fortunately was neither bleeding nor broken he peered again as closely as before if his nose got smashed again it got smashed that was all peering was rewarded shell hole he screamed big shell hole steer right what with the din of the two engines and the rattle and clanks of the tracks and all the other ancillary racket inside the barrel the driver never heard him he cursed himself for an idiot hed found out the very first time he got into a barrel that nobody could hear anything inside he remembered to use hand signals just as the barrel nosed down into the crater the driver shifted to his lowest gear the engines screamed even louder than they had before morrell wondered if the barrels pointed nose would get stuck in the dirt at the bottom of the shell hole that was its worst disadvantage when set against its british and confederate counterparts which were tracked around their entire rhomboidal hulls those babies could climb out of anything and a us barrel couldnt quite this particular us barrel though could and did climb out of this particular shell hole beyond it stood a fat man waving a large blue flag morrell held up his right hand palm out to the driver obediently the man hit the brakes took the barrel out of gear and turned off the motors everyone inside the steel hull who could reach the handle of an escape hatch opened it to let in air and lightand the rumble of other barrels behind morrell one by one the rest of the machines in the column also halted hatches and louvers also came open on them more than a few started disgorging their crews as the men seized the first chance they got to escape irving morrell wasted very little time in getting out of his barrel either he clambered down to the ground the fat man stabbed the flagpole into the ground that wasnt so bad he said looked like the end of the world coming straight at me he stuck a finger in one ear sounded that way too you had a better view of it than i did major dowling morrell answered he outranked general custers adjutant but treated him as he would have treated a superior officer his oak leaves might have been silver while dowlings were gold but the major more than made up in influence what he lacked in rank morrell went on its noisier inside a barrel than outside though far as i can tell its noisier inside a barrel than anywhere yes i think so too dowling said astounding experience riding in one of those damn things appalling experience too he looked over his shoulder here comes the general lets see what he thought of the exercise lieutenant general custer picked his way through the mud with slow mincing steps he wore fancy black cavalry boots and plainly didnt want to get them dirty with him came colonel ned sherrard sherrard had served for a good while on the general staff and general staff officers were notorious among their counterparts in the field for their aversion to filth but sherrard looked to be turning into a real live field soldier himself for he took no more notice of the chewedup terrain than he might have if hed been in the field since bully custer said this columnor rather an even grander column than thiswill simply pulverize the defenses the confederates have in front of nashville when they do the infantry goes forward sweeps up what the barrels have broken loose and we have ourselves a breakthrough yes sir morrell said i think thats exactly what will happen i want to be at the sharp end of the wedge i think well break through too sherrard said i really and truly do he sounded surprised at himself as if still unsure how custer had managed to seduce him away from the doctrine he himself had helped formulate and once the barrels have broken the way custer went on we can also send in the cavalry to complete the enemys demoralization and sweep up his shattered flying remnants morrell dowling and sherrard looked at one another none of them said a word every army east of the mississippi had a division or two of cavalry based a little behind the front waiting to exploit a breakthrough the few times the horsemen got into action they and their mounts died in droves they were up above the level of the trenches and their horses made big targets morrell didnt think that would be any different even after the barrels went in by the looks on their faces neither did sherrard nor dowling under his breath dowling said thatll be a fine planwhen they invent a bulletproof horse they did morrell murmured also sotto voce its called a barrel whats that custer said whats that speak up dammit people around me are always mumbling sorry sir morrell said custer wasnt deaf as a post but he didnt hear all that well either so nothing sounded loud to him moreover morrell got the idea that people needed to mumble around custer to make horrified comments about the outrageous things he said stubborn old fool morrell thought a man like that commonly found himself plowing ahead with bad ideas because having got them he was too pigheaded to give them up now for once custer had got a good ideaone that fit in with the aggressive way he thought generally he was too pigheaded to give that one up too but he also wanted to hang some of his bad ideas on it major dowling said sir of course we will have the cavalry in place ready to take advantage of whatever opportunities arise for using it of course we will custer said pity so many men these days carry the carbine instead of the saber i put the saber to good use in the war of secession go in wolverines he called reminiscently give em hell and we did but sir werent you carrying a carbine yourself during the second mexican war dowling asked well yes custer admitted with a frown even so gleaming steel terrifies in a way that bullets cant match morrell studied dowling in open admiration custers adjutant was plainly very good at guiding the general commanding first army away from courses that held no profit to say nothing of guiding him out of the nineteenth century and toward things that needed doing or needed doing in a particular way morrell commonly dealt with superior officers who proved difficult by ignoring them as much as he could learning other ways of handling the problem could be useful when do we move sir morrell asked he was aggressive too and wanted to lead the barrels into battle grounds still damper than id like colonel sherrard said well lose a lot fewer machines to bogging if we wait till the countryside dries out a bit more that could matter well have to move in more artillery support too dowling added that will also get easier as the roads dry out from what ive seen up in philadelphia the bombardments that go on for a week or so dont do as much good as everyone thought they would when we started using them morrell said the rebs dig in like moles and the shelling only shows right where were headed theyve come up with something new sherrard said its particularly good against enemy artillery you give them an opening barrage of phosgene gas shells make them put on their gas helmets hell of a lot of fun to try and serve a piece in a gas helmet you know theyve been harassing gunners like that as long as weve had gas shells morrell said i know ned sherrard said but theyve got a new wrinkle on it after that first round of phosgene they saturate the area with pukegas shells the antigas cartridges that protect against phosgene dont do a thing to stop it then when the reb gunners yank off their helmets so they can heave they hit em with another phosgene barrage morrell considered having considered he said thatsdevilish sir whoever thought of it was probably the marquis de sades cousin he paused its also going to tie the rebs into knots and a day and a half later itll give your artillery fits because the rebs will do it to us too abner dowling said thats the way this war has gone right from the start i dont think well be able to move till next month sherrard said when we do wed better hit hard thats true dowling agreed if we dont break through this time well never get another chance everyone will be watching how we do teddy roosevelt said as much if we dont measure up he pointed a thumb at the ground a gesture straight from a roman amphitheater well smash them custer sounded sublimely confident had his performance matched his confidence he would have been in front of mobile not nashville but confidence was never wasted on remembrance day if the weather is good well smash them on remembrance day morrell repeated major dowling and colonel sherrard both nodded morrell said it again softly on remembrance day nellie semphroch had seldom felt more out of place than she did on dismounting from a hired carriage in front of st johns church looking south across lafayette square she could see the white house still battered and sadlooking from the shell hits it had taken when the confederate states captured the capital of the usa presidents worshiped at st johns it was not normally for the likes of her but these were not normal times she turned to hal jacobs who sat beside her on the seat behind the driver well here we are she said let us make the best of it then he answered he looked like what he was a dignified man without a great deal of wealth his somber black suit black derby and wing collar with fourinhand tie were correct enough for a wedding but in no way stylish smiling at nellie he said you look lovely todaybut then i think that of you every day foosh she said his compliments never failed to make her nervous she ran her hands down the pleated skirt of her peach silk dress edna was very kind to ask that i be the one to give her away jacobs said i know it is only because she has no men who are close kin but it was very kind so it was nellie said and hoped the subject would dropwith a thud she knew why edna had asked the favor of hal jacobs her daughter was doing some heavyhanded matchmaking she also knew jacobs had accepted not least for the spying he could do among the confederate officers who made up the bulk of the wedding party they stood around in front of the whitepainted church their dress butternut uniforms shining with gold braid their kepis almost as fancy as those french officers would wear many of them with ceremonial swords belted on their hips as the driver handed nellie down from the chariot she listened to them chatting about the war no doubt hal jacobs was listening toointently but as he offered her his arm and she despite misgivings had to accept or be rude in public she knew the chance to spy was not the only reason hed so readily accepted ednas invitation he was glad of her matchmaking he wanted a match with nellie no one seemed to care what nellie herself thought nellie could not remember the last time anyone had cared what she thought as if to prove that here came lieutenant nicholas h kincaid his uniform as gaudy as a lieutenants could be the creases sharp as razors good morning maam he said beaming at her isnt it a lovely day it will do she answered if hed cared what she thought he would have let her daughter alone all he cared about though was stretching edna out naked on a bed he was a man what point to expecting anything else of him he turned to hal jacobs sir when you give her away you can be sure ill take her and you can be sure ill take good care of her too that is very good lieutenant jacobs said that is as it should be kincaid pointed into the church they must have put edna inside somewhere when she got here a couple of minutes ago my pals hustled me off though so i dont know for certain bad luck to see the bride before the wedding you know yes nellie said shabby washingtoniansand except for collaborators there was no other kind of washingtonianswalking by paused to stare at the wedding party the rebs could have public gaiety in the middle of the war for anyone else it was a distant memory i hope everything goes as it should jacobs said in his deliberate way i hope everything goes very well yes nellie sounded abstracted one of those shabby washingtonians on the other side of h streetshe lowered her voice to the next thing to a whisper mr jacobshal is that bill reach over there why jacobs raised his bushy eyebrows why i believe it is what can he be doing here i must go over and now nellie took hold of his arm with great firmness you must do nothing of the sort what you must do is come in with me and help me marry my fool of a daughter to this great rebel oaf shes chosen if you do anything elseshe played what she devoutly hoped was a trumpill never speak to you again but nellie he also spoke in low tones and in a voice full of anguish our beloved country relies upon it does no such thing nellie broke in that skunk hasnt had anything to do with you for months and our beloved country is doing just fine the wars going better than it has since it started and if that reachperson makes trouble she added i will kill him still feebly protesting jacobs let himself be led into the church edna dressed and veiled in white white she doesnt deserve nellie thought forgetting shed worn white on her wedding day after a past far more maculate than her daughters sat in a waiting room behind the veil her expression was the one the confederate general staff would have worn had the army of northern virginia captured philadelphia grudgingly trying for peace with her daughter nellie said i do hope it turns out well edna of course it will ma edna said with the unselfconscious confidence of youth well live happily ever after just like in the fairy tales nellie burst out laughing she was sorry the moment she did it but by then it was too late edna glared at her in fury burning as vitriol and then bless him hal jacobs started laughing too he said i beg your pardon miss edna truly i do but it is not so simple i wish it were my own life would have been much easier believe me well do it edna said you wait and see we will jacobs did not argue with her neither did nellie what was the use if edna didnt know a human being couldnt go through life without sorrow and anger and fear and boredom and jealousy and bitternessif she didnt know that she would find out its gonna be fine ma edna said isnt everybody gorgeous out there what would pa think if he could see it hed think you were marrying a damned rebel but nellie didnt say that either again what point the die was cast here hed think it was quite a show so he would she answered i hope it is a show that goes well hal jacobs said nellie looked at him sharply he knew something she didnt know what but he knew something before she could find a way to ask him what it was the organist began to play the lower notes seemed to resound deep within her she felt them in her bones rather than hearing them edna got to her feet and smiled at hal jacobs lets go she said and then turned to nellie is my veil on straight without waiting for an answer she adjusted it minutely the procession formed up in the back of the church like an army the wedding had a defined order of march nicholas kincaids eyes lit up when at last he was permitted to see his bridetobe animal nellie thought having seen too many mens eyes light up in dingy rooms nothing but a filthy animal up at the altar the minister waited looking almost like a catholic priest in his vestments an ushera lieutenant who was one of kincaids friendsspoke in brisk businesslike tones the bride and the gentleman who will be giving her away take the lead with a smirk edna gave hal jacobs her arm they started up the aisle together but they had taken only a few steps when bill reach burst into the church shouting people had better get the hell out of here because nellie outshouted him get this manthis robber this thiefout of here this instant she shrieked straight at reach havent you done enough to ruin me you son of a bitch words even words no lady should ever have said were nowhere near enough to satisfy her the little handbag she carried did not have much room but shed made sure shed included a stout hatpin just in case any of the confederate officers tried putting their hands anywhere they didnt belong on her she wished shed brought a knife instead but the pin would have to do snatching it out she rushed at the man whod done so much to wreck her life ushers and guestsconfederate officers allwere rushing toward him too but they would throw him out no more she wanted to hurt him she wanted to kill him hes mine she shouted furiously mine do you hear they didnt hear or didnt pay any attention they had just seized him when the first big shell landed across the street in lafayette square at the scream in the sky at that groundshaking roar half the officers in the churchlikely the half that had seen action as opposed to the half made up of occupying authoritiesthrew themselves flat between the pews another shell landed somewhere off to one side nicholas kincaid ran down the aisle toward edna shouting come on weve got to get out of here more shells were falling one crashed through the roof of st johns church and exploded just behind the altar blast picked nellie up flung her through the air and slammed her down hard the hatpin bit into her own leg she squealed she couldnt hear herself squeal she wondered if she would ever hear anything again she had trouble breathing when she wiped at her nose her hand came away bloody the explosion had tried to tear her lungs out by the roots her dress was rumpled and ripped the handbag was gone she had no idea where she scrambled to her feet one ankle didnt want to bear her weight she looked down it wasnt bleeding she could move her foot though that hurt too that must have meant it wasnt broken or so she hoped shed walk on it now and worry about it later the church looked as if a bomb had gone off inside it which was true or near enough edna and hal jacobs stumbled toward her both of them bleeding red smirching the white of the wedding dress they stepped over a body in the aisle the bodys head lay in the aisle too a few feet closer to nellie lieutenant nicholas h kincaid stared up at the ceiling that was starting to smolder his eyes would never see anything again edna saw the body saw the great pool of blood that had welled from it and then saw and recognized the head her mouth opened in a scream that was for nellie silent nellie ran to her took her by both hands and pulled her out of the church jacobs staggering along beside them more shells kept falling each one a small earthquake some people in the streets were up and fleeingfleeing in all directions for no one path seemed safe others were down some wounded or dead others sheltering against fragments and blast on the far side of lafayette square the white house burned nellie did not see bill reach he must have known this was coming from the us guns as hal jacobs might have hed tried to save people at risk to himself hed tried to save people nellie wondered if that meant she couldnt hate him any more savagely she shook her head she owed him too much for that anne colleton glared at the men who served the threeinch guns shed managed to pry loose from an armory where theyd been gathering dust you havent got rid of cassius and his fighters she said her voice suggesting that that was a sin incapable of forgiveness in her mind it was captain beauregard barksdale the militiaman commanding the little artillery unit said were doing the best we can miss colleton we arent so handy with these here guns as we might be she withered him with a glance ive seen that her voice dripped scorn she was being unfair and knew it and couldnt help it beauregard barksdale had undoubtedly been named for the famous confederate general right after the bombardment of fort sumter and might well be more familiar with the brass napoleons the little napoleon had fired than he was with the modern artillery pieces anne had obtained for him maam we are doing what we can barksdale repeated stolidly he took a deep breath then let it wuffle out through his thick gray mustache and im still not even slightly sure its legal for you to be ordering the militia of the sovereign state of south carolina around in the first place annes voice was sweet as ant syrup and no less deadly shall i wire the governor up in columbia and ask him whether hes sure shall i telephone him so he can tell you hes sure she meant it the militia captain could see she meant it behind his bifocal spectacles his eyes went wide she stared at him unblinking and implacable as a hawk he wilted shed been sure he would wilt well no maam he said i dont reckon youve got to go so far as to do that well take your orderswont we boys none of the other old men and youths serving the guns dared say no youd better anne said i havent the time to waste going through this nonsense if i have to go through it twice ill be sorryand so will you i am going to be perfectly plain with you yes i have to squat when i piss that does not mean i cant blow your heads off with a rifle at a range beyond any at which you could hit me and it does not mean i know nothing of war and am unfit to give you orders if she couldnt get them to obey her any other way shed fluster them into doing it shed never seen such a collection of red faces in her life these men and boys had gone through their whole lives never imagining a woman would remind them that she pissed let alone how she went about it if youre going to give orders just give em for gods sake captain barksdale said now not daring to meet her eye dont go on aboutother things he shuffled his feet like an embarrassed schoolboy that is what i was trying to do anne said briskly i have some reason to believe i know where the red bandits will strike next youll have to hit them harder than you did last time to do any good put us where we can hit em and i reckon well do it barksdale replied the gunnersmany of whom anne was convinced could not have hit the ground if they fell off a horsenodded i will anne said i hope she added to herself scipio was not to be trusted not any more not after shells had come crashing down around him had the shells killed cassius and cherry she would have reckoned it worthwhile as things wereas things were she contemplated scipio the exacting perfectionist huddled in the swamps and knew she had a measure of revenge with every breath he took captain barksdale said wed be even likelier to hit maam if you could get us some more shells to practice with anne rolled her eyes i count myself lucky if im able to pry loose enough shells for you to use in combat that was an understatement from the start of the war till now the threeinch field gun had been the workhorse of the confederate army it served on every front and every front screamed for shells detaching any had taken every wire she could pull the militia gunners hitched limbers and guns to horses and drove back to st matthews in town she saw two women on the street in trousers not so fine as hers but trousers she accepted that as no less than her due shed been a leader in style and fashion before the war began it was only natural that she should continue to lead now she was about to go up to her room when a messenger boy halted his bicycle with the heels of his boots telegram for you maam he said she took the envelope he hurried away after pocketing a tencent tip ripping apart the flimsy paper was not an adequate substitute for settling cassius and cherry for good but it had to do when anne was done reading the wire she tore it to shreds threw them in the air and let the wind blow them away none of the news from her brokers had been good lately the markets in richmond and london and paris were faltering the investments that had sustained her even after the ruin of marshlands faltered too she could not imagine when marshlands would recover she had trouble imagining when her investments would recover either if they didntif they didnt she wouldnt be the leader around these parts much longer she had trouble imagining that too but less trouble than she would have had in the spring of and ever so much less than she would have had in the spring of a train pulled into the station a couple of blocks away the fire engine might not have been replaced after the red uprising but labor gangs some working at gunpoint had put the railroads back together in a hurry those iron rails bound the csa together as nothing else could from the direction of the station someone called her name her head turned coming her way was a tall man in a butternut uniform tom she yelped in glad surprise and ran toward her older brother lieutenant colonel tom colleton stared at anne as she drew near good god sis what are you wearing he said she put her hands on her hips and glared at him he didnt flinch as he would have before the war in a way that made her proud hed gone from an overage boy a useless drone to a man on the battlefield in another way it irked her more than ever even as a man he thought women should be useless toys with precision that showed how tightly she was holding her temper in check she replied i am wearing the clothes i need to wear to go hunting bandits in the swamps of the congareeor did you want that rifle you sent me to gather dust in the closet tom took a deep breath then decided not to make a scene all right he said you sure as the devil took me by surprise though i never would have reckoned the day would come when women showed off their shapes that way really she asked as if in innocence what sort of joints do you go to when youre on leave but you dont come home she had the satisfaction of watching a blush climb from his throat to his hairline deciding to let him down easy she asked how are things at the front he grimaced but in an impersonal sort of way not so well weve lost just about all the ground we took back from the yankees in the counterattack last fall were shoved away from big lick and the roanoke river back toward the blue ridge mountains dammit its not that theyre better soldiers than we are the trouble is there are more of them than there are of us what about the black troops anne asked her brother shrugged theyre starting to come into the line theyre raw god only knows how theyll do when push comes to shove and even with em there are still more damnyankees than there are of us defending is cheaper than attacking thank god if were lucky sooner or later the usa will get tired of throwing away men against us and against the canucks and theyll make some kind of peace we can stand and if were not lucky anne said quietly tom didnt answer for a while when he did it was obliquely weve made the usa eat a lot of crow since south carolina stopped flying the stars and stripes i wonder what the bird tastes like and how theyd serve it up they remember every morsel and thats a fact he dug in his pocket found a coin and tossed it to anne it was a us quarterdollar on one side it bore a bust of daniel webster whom confederate schools vilified for opposing secession anne turned it over the other side showed arrows and lightning bolts superimposed on a star with the word remembrance stamped across it she handed the coin back to her brother till this war we hadnt fought them for more than thirty years she said foolish for them to keep on harping on things when the last war was over and done with so long agobefore either one of us was born when you lose sis the last wars never over and done with tom answered scratching the scar that seamed his cheek ive questioned a lot of prisoners the yankees remember ever single slight from the day this state seceded all the way up to the day theyre captured the thing to do then is to make sure they dont have the chance to make us eat crow anne said as if stating an axiom of geometry yes that would be the thing to do tom colleton said anne chose to ignore the incompleteness of his agreement as she would have before the war she took charge of him she took him to st matthews only functioning hotel checked him in and then led him to the better of the towns cafes with only two open in st matthews it rated merely the comparative not the superlative it wasnt that good either a third one likely would have been the best with an air of bigbrotherly amusement he let her do all that he didnt depend on her to do it though as he would have before the war he ordered a beefsteak that proved less tender than it might have stuck a fork in it and let out several piercing brays anne was chewing a bite and almost choked from laughing he gave her a peck on the cheek after supper saying well talk more in the morning sis they did and had plenty to talk about the night was enlivened when the reds brought a machine gun out of the swamp and fired several belts of ammunition into st matthews from long range before melting away under cover of darkness anne had a window shot out and was nicked on the hand by flying glass is it like this all the time tom asked they havent done that in a while anne said but they can till we hunt down the last of them were having trouble with that though because so much of everything goes straight to the front wed have worse trouble yet if it didnt tom replied annes mouth twisted in something less than a smile she had no good answer for that sam carsten peered out of the narrow vision slit in the sponson that housed his fiveinch gun as the uss dakota inched her way forward what he saw was endless choppy ocean the south atlantic swells were slapping against the battleships full armored length which made her roll unpleasantly as if also noticing the motion hiram kidde said dont nobody puke in here anybody pukes in here hes in big trouble with me you got that aye aye capn the gun crew chorused i wish wed put some more turns on the engines carsten said that would help smooth things out oh that it would by jesusthat it would the chief of the gun crew answered whats the matter with you sam you think you could stash your brains in your bunk once they promoted you to petty officer that aint how it works much as i hate to tell you carstens ears heated have a heart capn thats not what i meant and you know it its what you said goddammit kidde said sure bend some more turns on the engines why the hell not what the hell we got better to do than charge right into the mine belt the limeys and the argentines laid between argentina and the falklands whats it cost us so far just a cruiser and a destroyer why the hell not put a battleship on the list maybe we should have swung wide around the goddamn falklands now sams voice was an embarrassed mumble hiram kidde having scented blood wasnt about to let him off the hook thatd be good wouldnt it tack an extra six or eight hundred miles onto the cruise we dont have that much margin ourselves and our supply ships have even less shit the argentines who didnt dare stir out of harbor against us are going to come right after our tenders and their escorts even now look capn why dont you forget i ever said anything sam suggested and believe me he thought itll be a cold day in hella damn sight colder than thisbefore i open my mouth again he retreated from the vision slit and went back toward the breech of the cannon as long as he stayed at his station and kept his mouth shut nothing too bad could happen to himhe hoped to his relief kidde started peering out at the atlantic everybody kept doing that although there wasnt anything to see but graygreen ocean the mines hid below the surface no one would see them till too late luke hoskins spoke to sam in a low voice dont let kidde get you down were all edgy these days weve been torpedoed and we came through it and weve been shelled and we came through that too but if we hit a mine likely we cant do nothin about itexcept sink i mean yeah except sink carsten said sourly you do so ease my mind luke but hoskins was right the ship was engaged in hard slow dangerous work work in which the men who served the secondary armament could take no direct part if all went well they would live if not they would dieand which it would be was not in their hands no wonder tempers flared kidde turned away from the vision slit things could be worse he said perhaps trying to make amends for ripping into sam we could be in one of those destroyers up ahead of us amen everyone in the sponson spoke at the same time more smoothly than the sailors would have responded to the chaplain of a sunday morning sooner or later somebody was going to say something more than that usually that somebody would have been carsten not this time sam having been raked once sulked in his metaphysical tent luke hoskins said what the whole gun crew had to be thinking youve got to be crazy to clear mines in a destroyer nope hiram kidde shook his head all youve got to do is get your orders then you say aye aye sir and do as youre told crazy hoskins repeated only way to clear the mines youre supposed to get rid of is to steam past em without blowing yourself out of the water you do lose points if that happens luke kidde agreed cant argue with you there goddammit capn it isnt funny the shelljerker said that damn weighted cable between the fourstackers is supposed to catch on the mines mooring cables and yank em up to the surface so we can shoot the hell out of em but if they find the mines the hard way or if they miss em his voice trailed away nobody said anything for a while after that sam knew what kind of pictures he was seeing inside his own mind the rest of the crew couldnt have been imagining anything much different turn and turn about four hours on four hours off when the other crew replaced carsten and his comrades he hurried to the galley and shoveled down pork and beans and fried potatoes and sauerkraut and lemonade and coffee he was amazed how much he ate these days to hold cold and exhaustion at bay the coffee wouldnt keep him from sleeping nothing would keep him from sleeping not even the highly charged air in the cramped bunkroom after everybody had been messing on pork and beans and sauerkraut climbing out of his bunk was more like an exhumation than anything else he shook his head in bewilderment hadnt he just lain down he put on his shoes and cap grabbed the peacoat hed set on top of his blanket and staggered blankfaced toward the galley for more coffee to help him remember who he was and what the hell he was supposed to be doing he went up on deck to let the chilly breeze clear some more cobwebs from his poor befogged brain walking forward he nodded to the two minehunting destroyers that cleared the way for the dakota so far theyd done their job perfectly they hadnt blown up and neither had the battleship that thought had hardly made its slow way through sams stillfuzzy thoughts when one of the destroyers did go up in a great dreadful gout of smoke and fire across half a mile of water the roar was loud enough to stagger him oh sweet jesus he moaned half of that was simple horror the other half was guilt for jinxing the destroyer by thinking how well shed been doing her job she was sinking fast now going down by the bow her stern rising higher and higher until only a couple of minutes after she was hit she dove for the bottom of the sea she never had a chance to lower boats a handful of heads bobbed in the cold cold water in water like that a man might stay alive for an hour maybe even a little more if he was very strong rescue party to the boats a lieutenant shouted sam stood not twenty feet from one he was in it along with several other men and dangling his way down toward the surface of the atlantic less than two minutes later he plied an oar with a vigor that made him sweat even in that nasty weather his was not the only boat in the water the dakota had launched several others as had the destroyers partner they all raced to pick up the scattered survivors back oars sam called as the boat drew near one feebly paddling man he dropped his own oar leaned out and caught hold of the sailors hand the fellow almost pulled him into the water but a couple of other men in the boat grabbed him around the waist and also helped him pull in the survivor thank you the sailor said through chattering teeth christ i reckoned i was dead i believe you sam said saw you go up godawful thing one second you were just going along and the next one felt just like somebody took a twobyfour and hit me in both feet the sailor said grimacing he went on bet somethings busted in there cause they sure as hell hurt saw we didnt have a prayer everybody was screaming abandon ship made it to the raili was half walking half crawling made it over the side and started swimming hard as i could on account of i didnt want to get sucked under when she went down and i didnt not quite figured my ticket was punched but youve got to keep trying you know what i mean here pal try this somebody pressed the bottle of brandy the boat carriednothing near so fine as what rear admiral fiske drankinto the sailors hands he took a long pull marry me he exclaimed blissfully his rescuers laughed he raised the dark bottle to his lips again dont drink it all sam warned were going to try and get some of your pals too he pointed toward a man floating on his back not far away then grabbed up his oar and helped pull the boat toward the other sailor the man wasnt moving when they got to him they saw he was dead poor bastard somebody said quietly it was all the memorial service the sailor got sam stood up in the boat to see farther one of the boats from the other destroyer was already heading toward the last swimming man he spied the others had either been picked up or had sunk beneath the waves forever well we got one he muttereda tiny victory snatched from the jaws of death he sat on the bench again then spoke once more to the sailor hed pulled out of the south atlantic i take it back pal you might as well get drunk god bless you the man from the destroyer said instead of drinking he stuck out his hand you ever need anything im your man names gus hardwig sam carsten carsten said and shook the proffered hand believe me i was glad to do it we were all glad to do it the men in the boat with him nodded he pointed back toward the dakota now wed better take you home they rowed over alongside the battleship whose cranes effortlessly lifted the boat out of the water gus hardwig put a cautious foot on the dakota s deck then jerked it away as if the steel were redhot cant make it he said orderlies whisked him away in a stretcher carsten stood on the deck staring north only a few floating bodies and an oil slick showed where the mineclearing destroyer had gone down sams shiver had nothing to do with his wet tunic and the sharp breeze the mine could have blown up the dakota as readily as it had sunk the escort vessel that could have been him floating in the water as readily as gus hardwig or more likely him going down with the ship he shivered again thegreatwar breakthroughs going home going home going home the rails sang a sweet song in jefferson pinkards ears as the wheels of the train clicked over them hed been away too long too far he couldnt wait to see emilys smiling face now that hed finally got himself enough leave time to escape the front and travel back to birmingham for a few days he couldnt wait to see all of her every inch stretched out bare on their bed he couldnt wait to feel her underneath him on that bed or on her hands and knees as they coupled like hunting hounds or on her knees in front of him redgold hair spilling down over her face as she leaned forward and he shifted on the hard secondclass seat he was hard himself and hoped the little old lady reading a sentimental novel next to him didnt notice he couldnt help getting hard when he thought about emily christ she loved to do it so did he with her when hed got short leaves in texas he hadnt felt any great urge to visit the whorehouses that did not officially exist but emilyemily was something very special in the line of women shed probably kick his legs out from under him as soon as he walked in the door shed gone without as long as he had from her letters she might have missed it even more than he did very special he muttered the woman beside him looked up from her novel realized he hadnt been talking to her and began to read again pinkard had the seat closer to the window he found the mississippi countryside more interesting than a book here away from the front the war seemed forgotten hed seen that as soon as the first train hed boarded got more than an hours travel away from the trenches farmers were plowing in the fields actually more farmers wives were in the fields than he would have seen before the war that was a change but only a small one when set against the absence of trenches and shell holes and artillery pieces everything was so green and freshlooking the way a landscape got to be when it wasnt drastically revised every few days or every few minutes when the train rolled through a town factory smokestacks sent black plumes of smoke into the air the first time jeff saw those plumes he was alarmed they put him in mind of fires after bombardments but he quickly stopped worrying about that industry got to seem normal in a hurry past columbus mississippi and into alabama the train rolled here and there pinkard did note scars on the landscape in this part of the countryside halfhealed ones from the negro uprisings the year before this was cotton country with many negroes and few whites somebody a couple of rows in front of pinkard said i hear tell the niggers is still shootin at trains every now and again ought to do some shootin at them with the biggest guns we got the strangers seatmate answered remembering his own train ride into georgia and the bullets that had slammed into the cars from out of the night pinkard understood how that fellow felt hed been a new raw soldier then his uniform a dark proper butternut not faded to the color of coffee with too much cream the fire from the red negroes had seemed intense deadly terrifying he wondered what it would seem like now probably not so much of a much darkness fell as the train rattled through the centralalabama cotton fields jeff revised his thinking if black diehards had fired a couple of belts of ammunition at this train he would have been terrified all over again if somebody was shooting at you and you couldnt shoot back terror made perfect sense he leaned back in the hard uncomfortable seat and closed his eyes he was only going to relax for a little while so he told himself but the next thing he knew the conductor was shouting birmingham all out for birmingham he pushed past the grayhaired woman who was going on farther east as soon as he stepped out on the platform he knew he was home again the smoky sulfurous air that poured from the foundries mingled with the fog that so often stole through jones valley to yield an atmosphere with density and character damp and heavy and smelly a mud bath for the lungs flame poured from the tops of the chimneys of the sloss works out toward the eastern edge of town back before the warback before the conscription bureau had dragged him out of the foundry and into the trencheshed thought of that sight as hell on earth now that hed seen war he knew better but the memory lingered before he could get off the platform he showed his papers to a military policeman who had to be counting his blessings at having a post hundreds of miles from the real war the fellow inspected them then waved him on trolley lines ran close by the station taking travelers wherever they needed to go in the city pinkard stood at the corner and waited for the sloss works car he could ride out to the company housingyellow cottages for white men and their families primerred for negroessurrounding the sloss works themselves he yawned he was still sleepy despite the nap but figured the sight of emily would wake him up in short order when he got home the trolley driverwhod leaned crutches behind his seat and had one empty trouser legworked the brake and brought the car squealing to a halt at the edge of the company town he nodded to jefferson pinkard as the soldier got off jeff nodded back he felt the drivers eyes on him as he walked away did the fellow hate him for his long smooth strides how could anyone blame him if he did everything was quiet as jeff headed home most of the cottages were dark with men away for the war or working the evening shift or asleep if they worked days or nights here and there lamplight yellow as melted butter spilled out of windows a couple of dogs barked as pinkard passed their houses one of them chained in the front yard rushed at him but the chain kept the bigmouthed skinny brute from reaching the sidewalk jeff turned onto his little lane he felt swept back in time to the days before the war how many times hed walked this way with bedford cunningham his nextdoor neighbor and best friend both of them tired and hot and sweaty in their overalls after a long days work alabama had been dry for a few years but homebrew beer never got hard to come by a couple of bottles out of the icebox went down sweet no doubt about it there stood the cunningham house dark and still pinkard sighed bedford had gone to war before he did and had come back without an arm as the trolley driver had come back without a leg a onearmed man could do a lot of things but going back on the foundry floor probably wasnt one of them bedford and fanny had hard times jeff wondered how long theyd be able to stay in company housing if bedford wasnt in the army and couldnt work for the company any more lamplight shone from the curtained window of pinkards own house just past the cunninghams he kicked at the sidewalk in mild disappointment hed expected emily would already be asleep come morning shed have to head downtown toward her munitionsplant job hed hoped he could take off his uniform in the front room slip naked into bed beside her and startle her awake the best way he knew how even knowing she was awake he went up the walk on tiptoe if he couldnt give her the best surprise possible hed still give her the biggest surprise he could his thumb and palm closed on the doorknob gently gently he turned it the door swung open without a squeak he was glad emily had kept the hinges oiled in birmingham anything that didnt get oiled rusted the lamplight glinted off emilys shining hair seeing that before he saw anything else jeff began hey darlin imhome what had started as a glad cry ended as a hiss like air escaping from a punctured inner tube emily half sat half knelt on the floor in front of the divan on the divan his legs splayed wide lolled bedford cunningham neither of them wore any more than theyd been born with her face had been in his lap till she pulled away at the sound of jeffs voice a thin bright line of saliva ran down her chin from a corner of her lower lip oh jesus christ cunningham said oh jesus christ oh jesus christ the short stump of his right arm jerked and twisted as if hed tried to make a fist with a hand hed forgotten he didnt have oh jesus christ close the door jeff emily said her eyes were wide and staring she sounded eerily selfpossessed like somebody whod just staggered out of a train wreck mechanically pinkard did he was stunned too and said the first thing that popped into his mind you sneak out of fannys bed to come over here bedford cunningham shook his head shes workin second shift these days his face was pale as skimmed milk before he was hurt hed been as big and strong and ruddy and bold as pinkard now he looked thinner older his face lined as it hadnt been when he was a whole man jeffs wits began to work get your clothes on get the hell out of here i aint gonna lick a crippled man he didnt say a word about what hed do or wouldnt do to emily bedford cunningham put on drawers and trousers and shirt onehanded with a speed that showed both practice and desperation he hadnt been wearing shoes he darted out the door a few seconds later the door to his own cottage opened and closed why jefferson pinkard asked the ageold question of the husband betrayed naked still emily shrugged her breasts firm and pinktipped bobbled briefly she was jeff saw over the jaundice that troubled some munitions workers who handled cordite too much why she echoed and shrugged again you werent here i missed you i missed it finally i missed it so much i couldnt stand it any more and so yet another shrug but bedford my best friend was another husbandly howl as old as time emily got to her feet in a smooth graceful motion jeff couldnt possibly have imitated she walked up to him and took his hands in hers he knew what she was doing he could hardly have helped knowing what she was doing he was here thats all darlin she said if youd been here too i never wouldve looked at him you know thats so but you was in georgia and texas and all them damn places and she shrugged one more time her nipples barely brushed the breast of his tunic no he could hardly have helped knowing what she was doing that didnt mean it didnt work his breath caught in his throat his heart thuttered hed missed it too but he hadnt realizedhe hadnt had the faintest notionhow much till she stood bare before him she took a step backwards still holding his hands he took a step forward after her she took another step and another leading him back to the divan when he sat it was where bedford cunningham had sat before him she sprawled beside him she had two hands to undo his belt buckle and the buttons of his fly she didnt kiss him on the lips that might have reminded him where her mouth had just been instead she leaned over and lowered her head he pressed her down on him his hands tangling in her thick hair she gagged a little but did not pull away moments later he exploded he let emily pull back far enough to gulp convulsively then unasked she returned to what shed been doing he stiffened again faster than he would have believed he could when he was hard she got up on her knees and swung her right leg over him as if she were mounting a horse she impaled herself on him and began to ride her cries of joy must have wakened half the neighborhood then throatily she added i never made noise like that for bedford jeffs hands clutched her meaty buttocks till she whimpered in pain and pleasure mixed he drove deep into her again and again and as he groaned and shuddered in the most exquisite pleasure hed ever known he wished with all his soul he were back in a muddy trench in texas under artillery bombardment from the yankees sweat ran down george enos face the sun stood higher in the sky than it had any business doing at this season of the year at least to his way of thinking the uss ericsson was down in the tropics now nosing around after the submarines making life miserable for the warships and freighters that were trying to strangle the trade route between argentina and england what do you think he asked carl sturtevant are we after english boats or are the rebs out here giving their pals a hand damned if i know answered the petty officer who ran the depthcharge launcher damned if i care either knowing who they are doesnt change how i do my job we keep them too busy either going after us or trying to get away from us they arent going to be able to do anything else yeah enos said just between you and me id sooner see em trying to get away than going after us sturtevant looked him up and down any fool can see you aint a career navy man he said after a brief pause for thought screw you and the destroyer you rode in on enos returned evenly ive been captured by a confederate commerce raider ive sailed on a fishing boat that was nothing but a decoy for rebel subs and helped sink one of the bastards i was on the bank of the cumberland when my river monitor got blown skyhigh and i was right here when the damn snook damn near torpedoed us to my way of thinking ive earned a little peace and quiet everybodys earned a little peace and quiet and in the end everybody gets it too the petty officer said nice plot of ground about six feet by three feet by six feet under till then i want my time lively as can be enos grunted then went back to what hed been doing watching the ocean for signs of a periscope or anything else suspicious everyone who didnt have some other duty specifically assigned came up on deck and stood by the rail scanning the ocean for the telltale feather of foam following a submersibles periscope a shadow on the watergeorges pulse raced was that the top of an enemy conning tower hiding down there below the surface of the sea he relaxed for the shadow was far too small and far too swift to be any such thing he raised his gaze from the ocean to the sky sure enough a frigate bird with a wingspan not much smaller than that of an aeroplane glided away several sea birdsgulls and terns and more exotic tropical types enos had had to have named for himhung with the ericsson scrounging garbage they seemed perfectly content hundreds of miles from land in any direction george peered and peered a man could only watch the ocean for a couple of hours at a stretch after that his attention started to wander he saw things that werent there which wasnt so bad and didnt see things that were which was miss a periscope and the sea birds would pick meat from your bones after your corpse floated up to the surface what was that there off the port bow more likely than not far more likely than not it was just a bit of chop he kept watching it it wasnt moving in the same direction as the rest of the chop nor at quite the same speed he frowned hed spent as much time on the ocean as any career navy man he knew how far from smooth and uniform it was still he pointed what do you make of that he asked sturtevant the petty officer had been looking more nearly amidships now his gaze followed enos outthrust finger where out about a mile his pale eyes narrowed he shielded them from sun and glare with the palm of his right hand yeah about that george answered thats a goddamn periscope or im a rebel sturtevant started pointing too and yelling at the top of his lungs an officer with binoculars came running he pointed them in the direction sturtevant gave him after a moment he started yelling like a man possessed at his yells klaxons started hooting george enos and carl sturtevant sprinted for their battle stations at the stern of the ericsson the destroyer shuddered under them as the engines suddenly ran up to full emergency power great gouts of smoke belched from the stacks torpedo in the water somebody screamed the ericsson had begun a turn toward the submersible which meant that george could not see the wake of the torpedo as it sped toward the destroyer he couldnt have done anything about it had he been able to see it but being ignorant of whether he would live or die came hard time stretched the torpedo couldnt have taken more than a minutea minute and a half at the mostto speed from the submersible to the destroyer but how long was a minute or a minute and a half with his heart thudding in his chest every breath a desperate gasp enos had no sure grasp tom sturtevant pointed as enos had when he spotted the periscope there it goes the goddamn son of a bitch sturtevant shouted sure enough the pale wake of the torpedo stretched out across the blue blue water of the tropical atlantic sturtevant stepped over to george beside his onepounder and slapped him on the back hard enough to stagger him if you hadnt spotted the scope the bastard wouldve been able to sneak in closer for a better shot you made him fire it off too quick good enos patted the magazine of nicely heavy shells hed loaded into the onepounder he remembered what theyd done to the conning tower of the snook and to a couple of confederate sailors whod got in the way of them now weve got the ball yeah sturtevant said as the ericsson slowed not far from the point whence the torpedo had been launched now we start dropping ash cans on his head and see if we can put him out of business for good at the side of the depthcharge launcher lieutenant crowder said lets give him a couple shall we mr sturtevant set them for a hundred and fifty feet a hundred and fifty feet aye aye sir the petty officer answered he commanded the rest of the men at the launcher with effortless authority a depth charge flew through the air and splashed into the atlantic a moment later another followed somewhere down under the ocean a boatful of men whod just done their best to sink the ericsson were listening to those splashes george felt a weird sympathy for the submersibles crew the only thing a submersible had going for it was stealth it couldnt fight on the surface against a warship it couldnt outrun a warship either all it could do was sneak close try for a kill and then try to sneak away if that didnt work sympathy had nothing whatever to do with whether george hoped the submariners would be able to sneak away after trying to kill him and in his own mind incidentally everyone else on the ericsson he didnt come on you bastards he said while the depth charges sank come on fifty yards below the surface of the atlantic the depth charges went off one after the other a few feet apart water on the surface bubbled and boiled after the explosions though nothing more happened no rush of air bubbles proclaiming a ruptured pressure hull no oil slick telling of other damage no boat hastily surfacing before it sank forever turning the ericsson moved slowly to the southeast hydrophone bearing a sailor called back to lieutenant crowder the underwater listening device had two drawbacks where along that bearing the submersible lay was anybodys guess also when the destroyers engines were running they drowned out most of the noise the submarine was making nevertheless after a couple of minutes a messenger hurried back to crowder from the bridge the young lieutenant listened nodded and spoke to carl sturtevant two more depth charges set the fuses for a hundred feet a hundred feet aye aye sir sturtevant said off flew the charges two bangs in quick succession the wait this time wasnt so long the atlantic bubbled and boiled again no evidence that the charges had done any good appeared is the launcher in proper working order crowder demanded it had damaged a submersible the last time they used it enos thought along with the officer if it didnt force a boat to the surface this time something surely had to be wrong with itunless the skipper down below was laughing up his sleeve which struck george as a hell of a lot likelier yes sir carl sturtevant gave the distinct impression that hed talked with a hell of a lot of young officers in his day no doubt the reason he gave that impression was that he had he went on its working fine sir its just that theres a hell of a lot of ocean out there and the ash cans cant tear up but a little bit of it at a time we got good resultsdamnation we got outstanding resultsthe last time we used it crowder said fretfully yes sir but life aint like a roebucks catalogue sir sturtevant answered it dont come with no moneyback guarantee that was good sense as a fisherman enos knew exactly how good it was lieutenant crowder pouted for all the world like george jr something must be wrong with the launcher he said confirming georges guess sturtevant sent another pair of depth charges flying into the ocean and another and another and after that last pair a thick stream of bubbles rose to the surface as did a considerable quantity of thick black oil that spread over the blue blue water of the atlantic thats a hurt boat down there sir carl sturtevant breathed hurt or else playing games with us he turned to the launcher crew now we hammer the son of a bitch ash can after ash can splashed into the water more air bubbles rose so did more oil the boat from which they rose however remained submerged i wonder how deep the water is down there crowder said musingly if weve sunk that submersible were liable to never ever know it thats so sir sturtevant agreed but if we think weve sunk him and were wrong well find out like a kick in the balls george enos nodded a fisherman who wasnt a born pessimist hadnt been going to sea long enough the ericsson held her position till sundown lobbing occasional depth charges into the sea well report this one as a probable sinking lieutenant crowder said no one argued with him no one could argue with him he was the officer commander roger kimballs head pounded and ached as if with a hangover and he hadnt even had the fun of getting drunk the air inside the bonefish was foul and getting fouler in the dim orange glow of the electric lamps he struck a match it burned with a fitful blue flame for a few seconds then went out adding a sulfurous stink to the astonishing cacophony of stenches already inside the pressure hull he checked his watch two in the morning a few minutes past quietly he asked how much longer can we stay submerged three or four hours left in the batteries sir provided we dont have to gun the engine tom brearley answered also quietly after checking the dials he inhaled then grimaced air wont stay good that long though im afraid and im afraid youre right kimball shifted his feet which set up a faint splashing the pounding the boat had taken had started some new leaks none of them fortunately too severe damnyankee destroyer was throwing around depth charges like they were growin their own crop on deck yes sir brearley said the exec looked up toward the surface next interesting question is have they stalked us kimball finished for him im hoping they think they sank us we gave em enough clues before we slunk away only way we could have been more convincing would have been to shoot a couple of dead bodies out the forward tubes and since we didnt have any handy yes sir brearley said and a couple of sailors nodded but if theyre anywhere close when we surface were done for thats a fact kimball agreed but its also a fact that were done for if we dont surface pretty damn soon he came to a sudden abrupt decision well bring her up to periscope depth and have a look around even that was risky if the us destroyer waited close by bubbles on the surface might betray the bonefish the submersible rose sluggishly kimball had expended a lot of compressed air in feigning her untimely demise when the periscope went up he peered through it himself not trusting anyone else with the job slowly carefully he went through a complete circuit of the horizon nothing no angular ship silhouette far off against the skynor menacingly close either no plume of smoke warning of a ship not very distant kimball went through the circuit again to make sure he hadnt missed anything still nothing all hands prepare to surface he said adding a moment later bring her up mr brearley well get fresh air into the boat well fire up the diesels and cruise for a while to recharge the batteries well flush the heads ben coulter said everyone in earshot fervently agreed with the petty officer as to the desirability of that the pigs on the arkansas farm where kimball had grown up wouldnt have lived in a sty that smelled half as bad as the bonefish after the boat had surfaced kimball climbed up to the top of the conning tower to undog the hatch ben coulter climbed up behind him to grab him around the shins and keep him from being blown out the hatch when it was undogged the air inside the hull was under considerably higher pressure than that on the outside and had a way of escaping with great vigor out streamed the stinking air like the spout of a whale somehow the stench was worse when mingled with the first fresh pure breezes from outside when altogether immersed in it the nose mercifully grew numb after the first taste of good air though the bad got worse still a few lungfuls of outside air went a long way toward clearing kimballs fuzzy wits his headache vanished from below came exclamations of delight and exclamations of disgust as fresh air began mingling with the nasty stuff inside the bonefish the diesels rumbled to life all ahead half kimball called down tom brearley relayed the command to the engine crew the wake the bonefish kicked up glowed with a faint pearly phosphorescence brearley mounted to the top of the conning tower he looked around and let out a long sigh that was as much a lungclearer as a sound of relief we got away from them sir he said i didnt want to get away from them roger kimball growled i wanted to sink the yankee bastards i would have done it too but they must have spotted the periscope soon as i saw em pick up speed and start that turn i launched the fish but the range was still long and it missed were still in business brearley said were in the business of sending us ships to the bottom kimball answered we didnt do it now that destroyers either going to go on south and try to strangle the british lifeline to south america or else hell hang around here and try to keep us from going after his pals either way he wouldnt be doing it if wed sent him to the bottom like we were supposed to kimball kept on fuming his exec didnt say anything more the darkness hid kimballs smile which was not altogether pleasant he knew he alarmed tom brearley it didnt bother him if he didnt alarm the tom brearleys of the world he wasnt doing his job right when the sun rose he halted the boat and allowed the men to come up and bathe in the warm water of the atlantic with lines tied round the middles of those who couldnt swim they put on their old filthy uniforms again afterwards but still enjoyed getting off some of the grime and then the bonefish went hunting kimball had got used to patrolling inside a cage whose bars were lines of latitude and longitude he supposed a lion would have found cage life tolerable if the keepers introduced a steady stream of bullocks on which it could leap trouble was he wasnt a lion battleships were lions he was a snake in the grass he could kill bullocksfreighters he could kill lions too hed done it even in their very lair but if they saw him slithering along before he got close enough to bite they could kill him too and easily they could also kill him if he struck and missed as he had at that nasty hunting dog of a destroyer so much of patrol duty was endlessly mindnumbingly boring more often than not kimball chafed under such boredom today for once he welcomed it it gave the crew a chance to recover from the long tense time theyd spent submerged it gave the diesels a chance to recharge the batteries in full if that damned destroyer had stumbled across the boat too soon she couldnt have gone underwater for long or traveled very far a submarine that had to try to slug it out on the surface was a dead duck a quiet evening followed the quiet day the crew needed to recharge their batteries too a lot of them spent a lot of time in their hammocks or wrapped in the blankets they spread next to or more often on top of equipment the odor of fried fish jockeyed for position among all the other smells inside the pressure hullben coulter had caught a tuna that had almost ended up dragging him into the atlantic instead of his being able to pull it out you know what kimball asked his exec theyd both had big tuna steaks kimball wished for a toothpick he had a shred of fish stuck between a couple of back teeth and couldnt work it loose with his tongue whats that sir tom brearley asked you know the japs kimball said you know what they do they eat tuna raw sometimes either they dip it in horseradish or bean juice or sometimes both of em together or else they just eat it plain dont that beat hell youre making that up brearley said youve told me enough tall tales to stretch from the bottom of the ocean up to here ill be damned if youll catch me again solemn fact kimball said and raised his hand as if taking oath his exec still wouldnt believe him they both started to get angry kimball because he couldnt convince brearley the exec because he thought the skipper kept pulling his leg harder and harder at last disgusted kimball growled oh the hell with it and stomped back down to the solitary albeit cramped splendor of his bunk he and brearley were wary with each other the next morning too both of them speaking with military formality usually ignored aboard submersibles in every navy in the world then the lookout let out a hollersmoke off to the eastand they forgot about the argument kimball hurried up to the top of the conning tower the lookout pointed sure enough not just one trail but several smudged the horizon kimball smiled a predatory smile either those are freighters or else theyre warships loafing along without the least little idea were anywhere around any which way were going to have some fun he called down the hatch give me twelve knots and change course to lets get in front of the bastards and take a look at what weve got the bonefish swung through the turn kimball peered through his binoculars what are we after brearley asked from below looks like supply ships kimball answered cant be sure they havent got one of those disguised auxiliary cruisers sneaking along with em though well i dont give a damn if they do weve still got plenty of fish on board and im not talking about that damned tuna skippers who paid attention to nothing but what was right in front of their noses did not live to grow old while kimball guided the bonefish toward her prey he kept another lookout up on the conning tower with him to sweep the rest of the horizon he jumped when the sailor tapped him on the shoulder apologetically the fellow said i hate to tell you sir but theres smoke over on the western horizon and whatevers making it looks to be heading this way in a hell of a hurry thanks caleb kimball turned hoping the sailor was somehow mistaken but he wasnt whatever was making that smoke was heading in the general direction of the bonefish and heading toward her faster than anything had any business traveling on the ocean he raised the binoculars to his eyes almost as he watched the ship crawled over the horizon he counted stacksone two threefour cursing he said go below caleb and then bawled down the hatch all hands prepare to dive take her down to periscope depth the bonefish had no trouble escaping the us destroyer depth charges roared but far in the distance tom brearley said we spotted her in good time thats not the point goddammit kimball growled the point is she made us break off the attack on those other yankee ships theyll get away clean while were crawling along down here she did what she was supposed to do and she kept us from doing what were supposed to do nobody does that to me his voice sounded the more menacing for being flat and quiet nobody does that to me do you hear i hope that destroyer hangs around this part of the ocean cause if she does ill sink her sylvia enos felt like a billiard ball caroming from one cushion to the next she got off the trolley not by her house but by the school a couple of stops away after brigid conevals husband stopped a bullet with his chest sylvia had had to enroll george jr in kindergarten he was enjoying himself there that wasnt the problem neither was his staying on the school grounds till she got out of work a lot of boys and girls did that the school had a banner out front we stay open to support the war effort the problem wascome on george sylvia said tugging at his hand weve still got to pick up your sister george didnt want to go benny hit me a while ago and i havent hit him back yet ive got to mama do it tomorrow sylvia said george jr tried to twist free she whacked him on the bottom which got enough of his attention to let her drag him out of the schoolroom and back toward the trolley stop they missed the trolley anyhowit clattered away just as they hurried up sylvia whacked george jr again that might have made him feel sorry then again it might not have it did make sylvia feel better twilight turned into darkness mosquitoes began to buzz sylvia sighed spring was here at last she slapped too late fifteen minutes after they missed the trolley the next car on the route came by sylvia threw two nickels in the fare box and rode back in the other direction to the apartment of the new woman shed found to watch mary jane im sorry im late mrs dooley she said rose dooley was a large woman with a large square jaw that might have made her formidable in the prize ring try not to be late again mrs enos if you please she said but then softened enough to admit your daughter wasnt any trouble today im glad sylvia said i am sorry blaming george jr wouldnt have done any good she took mary janes hand lets go home im hungry mama mary jane said so am i george jr agreed by the time they got back to the apartment building it was after seven by then the children werent just saying they were hungry they were shouting it over and over if you hadnt dawdled on your way to the trolley weve have been home a while ago and you would be eating by now sylvia told george jr that got mary jane mad at her big brother but didnt stop either of the children from complaining they both complained some more when sylvia paused to see if any mail had come mama were starving george jr boomed mary jane added shrill agreement hush both of you sylvia held up an envelope feeling vindicated here is a letter from your father you wouldnt have wanted it to wait would you that did quiet them at least until they actually got inside the flat george enos had assumed mythic proportions to both of them especially to mary jane who hardly remembered him at all one corner of sylvias mouth turned down she wished her husband had mythic proportions in her eyes if you read it to us mama will you make supper right afterwards mary jane asked her brothers bluster hadnt worked maybe bargaining would and it did ill even start the fire in the stove now so it will be getting hot while im reading the letter sylvia said her children clapped their hands she fed coal into the firebox with care people at the canning plant said the coal board was going to cut the ration yet again apparently intent on making people eat their food raw for the rest of the war glancing in the coal bin she thought she probably had enough to keep cooking till the end of the month as soon as she walked back into the front room from the cramped kitchen george jr and mary jane jumped on her like a couple of football tackles read the letter they chanted read the letter some of that was eagerness to hear from their father more was likely to be eagerness to get her cooking she opened the envelope with a strange mixture of happiness and dread if george had come into port to mail the letter who could guess what he was doing besides mailing it as a matter of fact she could guess perfectly well the trouble was she couldnt know when she saw a scrawled line at the top of the page she let out a silent sigh of relief a supply ship bound for home came alongside just after i finished this george had written so it will get to you soon that meant he hadnt set foot on dry land she could relax at least for a while dear sylvia sylvia read aloud and little george who is getting big and mary jane too im getting big mary jane said i know you are and so does your father sylvia said shall i go on the children nodded so she did i am fine i hope you are fine we are down here in the why did you stop mama george jr asked theres a word thats all scratched out so i cant read it sylvia answered censors she thought as if im going to tell anybody where georges ship is she resumed we are doing everything we can to whip our enemies a sub tried to torpedo us but we got away with no trouble at all wow george jr said sylvia wondered how much more dangerous that had been than george was making it out to be in his letter like any fisherman he was in the habit of minimizing mishaps to keep his loved ones from worrying we went after him and weoh here are more words scratched out she said they say we either damaged him or sunk him and i hope they are right what does damaged mean mary jane asked hurt sylvia answered i have chipped more paint than i ever thought there was in the whole wide world the chow is not half so good as yours or what charlie white used to make on the ripple but there is plenty of it tell little george and mary jane to be good for me i hope i see them and you real soon i love you all and i miss you george she set the letter on the table in front of the sofa now make supper george jr and mary jane yelled together ive got some scrod and ill fry potatoes with it sylvia said even though george was in the navy she still had connections among the dealers and fishermen down on t wharf the transactions were informal enough that none of the many and various rationing boards knew anything about them as long as she was content to eat fishand she would have been a poor excuse for a fishermans wife if she werentshe and her family ate pretty well fishermans children george jr and mary jane ate up the tender young cod as readily as sylvia did and they plowed through mountains of potatoes fried in lard and salted with a heavy hand sylvia wished she could have given them more milk than half a glass apiece but she didnt know anybody who had anything to do with milk rationing after she washed the supper dishes she filled a big pitcher from the stoves hotwater reservoir and marched the children down to the end of the hall for their weekly bath they went with all the delight of rebel prisoners marching off into captivity in the united states they were as obstreperous as rebel prisoners too by the time she had them clean they had her wet in dudgeon approaching high she marched them back to the apartment and changed into a quilted housecoat they played for a whilemary jane was alternately an adjunct and a hindrance to george jrs game which involved storming endless ranks of confederate trenches when he pretended to machinegun her and made her cry sylvia called a halt to the proceedings she read to them from hiawatha and put them to bed but then it was nearly nine oclock shed have to get up before six to get george jr off to kindergarten and mary jane to mrs dooleys silently she cursed brigid conevals husband for getting shot if hed had any idea how much trouble his death was causing her he never would have been so inconvenient twenty minutesmaybe even half an hourto herself with no one to tell her what to do seemed the height of luxury had george been here she knew what he would have wanted to do with that time and she would have gone along not only was it her wifely duty he pleased her most of the timeor he had after a long day at the canning plant after a long day made longer by missing the trolley when she was trying to retrieve mary jane wifely duty didnt have a whole lot of meaning left to it if she felt like making love she would make love if she didnt ill damn well go to bed thats what she said and yawned and if george doesnt like it if george didnt like it hed go out and find himself some strumpet and then one day hed drink too much and hed let her know and then then ill throw him out on his twotiming ear she muttered and yawned again if she didnt intend to fall asleep on the sofa which shed done a couple of times she needed to get ready for bed she made sure she wound and set the alarm clock if she didnt she wouldnt wake up on time not tired as she was she put on her nightgown went and brushed her teeth at the sink by the toilet and then walked into the bedroom turned off the lamp and lay down despite weariness sleep did not want to come sylvia worried about what would happen on the sea and about how much george hadnt told her she worried about what would happen if he didnt come home and almost equally she worried about what would happen when he did come home he would expect things to be the same as they had been before he went into the navy and she went to work and she didnt see how that was possible she saw trouble ahead with no more effort than she needed to see snow ahead in a boiling gray sky in february she writhed and stretched and wiggled and at long last went to sleep when the alarm clock exploded into life beside her head she had to clap a hand over her mouth to keep from screaming only after that did she recover enough to turn off the clock oh god she groaned another day she got out of bed lucien galtier stared at the envelope in some perplexity it bore no postage stamp not even one of the peculiar sort the united states had prepared for occupied quebec where the stamp should have been was a printed phrase in both english and french under the permit of the us occupying authority penalty for unauthorized use marie had not opened the envelope instead shed sent denise to get charles and charles to bring lucien to the farmhouse from the fields what sort of trouble are you in his wife demanded glaring from the envelope to lucien and back again as if unable to decide which of them she despised more in the name of god i do not know he answered i have done nothing to make the occupying authorities dislike me not for some time then why do they send this to you marie said confident he had no answer as indeed he had none having reduced him to silence she snapped well why do you hesitate open it that we may see what sort of injustice they aim to inflict on us now this i will do galtier replied once i open it at least i will know what the trouble is and no longer be plagued by wild guesses marie ignored that as beneath her dignity when charles who had accompanied his father presumed to smile she froze the expression on his face with a glance muttering under his breath galtier tore the envelope open inside was a single sheet of paper again printed in both english and french marie snatched it out of his hands and read it aloud all citizens of this occupation district are cordially invited to gather in the market square of riviereduloup at two in the afternoon on sunday the fifteenth of april to hear an important announcement and proclamation attendance at this festivity is not required but will surely prove of interest there do you see i am not in difficulty with the authorities for any reason whatsoever lucien said triumphantly it is not a letter to me or even about me it is a general circular like a patentmedicine flyer marie took no notice of his tone shed had more than twenty years practice taking no notice of his tone when that suited her purposes as it did now she said for what reason do they send this out they have never done anything like it before she regarded the paper with deep suspicion charles nodded vigorously they cordially invite us he said they call this a festivity they say we do not have to come to it they have never done anything like this since they overran our country galtiers elder son was probably the quietest member of the family and also the least reconciled to the us occupation it could be lucien said that nicole will know more of this working as she does at the hospital with so many americans for now and until she comes home i do not intend to worry about it as i have plenty to do in the fields if we are to put in any sort of crop this year yes go on get out of the house marie said i also have plenty to do and who called me to the house he asked but he might as well have been talking to the air even as he worked though he wondered about the peculiar announcement from the us occupiers it was the most nearly civil thing they had done in the nearly three years since theyd invaded quebec up till now civility had not been their long suit he wondered why they were changing course like marie like most quebecois he was suspicious of change as likely being for the worse despite that suspicion of change he would have been glad if nicole had brought dr odoull home for supper but she returned to the farmhouse by herself and proved to be as startled by the flyer as the rest of the family how are we to find out what it means she asked georges spoke up as innocentsounding and sarcastic as usual it could beand i know it is only a foolish notion of minewe might even stay in town after we go to mass and hear this announcement and proclamation for ourselves his older sister glared at him he beamed back mild as milk which only made her more furious before the row could go any further lucien said that is exactly what we shall do marie gave him a look that was anything but altogether approving once he had made his intention so plain though not even she saw any chance of getting him to change his mind the highway up to riviereduloup was more crowded than usual that sunday morning as many families from the outlying farms came in to the town to go to church and then stay the big snorting us trucks always on the road had to use their horns again and again to clear the slowmoving wagons from their path many of the men in the wagons took their own sweet time about getting out of the way too splendid in his new vestments bishop pascal officiated at the mass please stay for the afternoons announcements he urged his flock you will find it of interest i assure you he said no more than that which both surprised lucien and set him scratching his head the pascal he knew could hardly open his mouth without falling in it was another change to mistrust when galtier emerged from the church with his family he found one more change the market square had been draped with bunting some red white and blue some simply white and blue the colors of quebec what are they going to say he asked the air what are they going to do are they going to say we are now a part of the united states if they say this i say to them that we shall be a troubled part of the united states we are here marie said let us wait let us see what else can we do there lucien found nothing with which to disagree they waited and chatted with neighbors and with folk who did not live close by the farm and whom they saw but seldom at precisely two oclock major jedediah quigley and bishop pascal ascended to a buntingdraped platform a squad of us soldiers had set up not far from the church an expectant hush fell into it major quigley spoke in his eleganthis tooelegantfrench my friends i should like to thank all of you for coming here today and becoming a part of this great day in the history of your land as others are announcing elsewhere at this very same moment the government of the united states from this time forth recognizes the sovereignty and independence of the republic of quebec the what lucien frowned there is no such thing there is now someone behind him said he nodded he did not know what to feel joy fury bewilderment bewilderment won quebecois were a separate people yes assuredly were they a separate nation if they were what sort of separate nation would they be quigley was continuing i am pleased to announce that the sovereign and independent republic of quebec has already been accorded diplomatic recognition as a nation among the nations of the world by the german empire the empire of austriahungary the ottoman empire the kingdom of bulgaria the kingdom of poland the republic of chile the republic of paraguay the government of the republic of liberia and the governmentinexile of the republic of haiti in philadelphia many other governments i am certain will soon recognize your new and thriving nation from this citizens of the republic of quebec you can see that your welldeserved independence from the british creation of canada is popular throughout the world from this lucien thought we can see that the united states and their allies recognize this socalled republic and that no one else does that left him anything but surprised the entente powers would hardly acknowledge that one of their own would be could be torn asunder the entente powers did not recognize the poland the germans had erected on soil taken from russia either as if on cueafterwards but only afterwards galtier wondered if it was on cuea soldier came running up to the platform waving a pale yellow telegram quigley took it read it and stared out at the buzzing crowd a wide smile spread across his narrow face he waved the telegram too my friends he cried his voice choked with emotion either genuine or artfully portrayed my friends word has just reached me that the kingdom of italy and the kingdom of the netherlands have also recognized the republic of quebec that made the buzzing even louder and changed its note lucien did not buzz but he did raise an eyebrow italy was a member of the quadruple alliance with the usa germany and austriahungary but a backsliding member she had been neutral since the war began and the netherlands though bordered on her entire land frontier by germany and germanoccupied belgium still carried on what trade with england she could she was a true neutral and she had recognized this republic i am greatly honored to congratulate quebec on achieving her independence even if it was far too many years delayed by british contempt major quigley said and i am privileged to offer this salute to you quebecois free at last vive la republique de quebec vive la republique not everyone in the square shouted it not even a majority of the people in the square shouted it but a surprising numbersurprising at any rate to lucien who kept silent with his familydid shout it everyone looked around to see who shouted and who did not would feuds start because some had shouted and some had not jedediah quigley stepped back and bishop pascal stepped forward vive la republique de quebec he echoed not inviting anyone else to shout the phrase but making clear where he himself stood i say to you it is long past time that we should be free free from the indignities the british have heaped on us for so long how many of you men when you were conscripted into the army of the canada that was and when you tried to speak your beautiful french language were told by some ugly english sergeant talk white he dropped into english for those two words which doubled their effect galtier chuckled uncomfortably hed heard sergeants say that plenty of times he was not the only man chuckling uncomfortably eitherfar from it bishop pascal knew how to flick where it was already raw he continued how many times have we had our sacred faith mocked by the protestants in ottawa men who would not know piety and holiness if they came knocking on their doors how many times must we be shown we are not and cannot be the equals of the english before we decide we have had a sufficiency soon i pray the republic of quebec will embrace all the quebecois of la belle province de quebec until that time comes though which god hasten we have begun go with god my friends and pray with me for the success of la republique de quebec go in peace he finished as he had finished the mass not long before what do we do now father it was georges who asked the question his voice and his expression both unwontedly serious i do not know lucien answered and he could hear that he was far from the only man saying je ne sais pas in the square at that moment slowly he went on it is plain to see that this republic socalled is to be nothing but a creature of the united states but we were not altogether our own men in canada either so i do not know we shall have to see what passes it is too soon to tell what this all means where lucien had groped for words marie spoke with great finality they both said the same thing though in the end they usually did seeing as much their children for once forbore to argue remembrance day soon captain jonathan moss remarked to lieutenant percy stone as the two fliers rode battered bicycles along a dirt road not far from the aerodrome near arthur ontario both men wore s on their hips trouble wasnt likely hereabouts but it wasnt impossible either ontario remained resentful about occupation itll be a good one stone answered his breath still steamed when he spoke though spring by the calendar was almost a month old it didnt steam too much though it wasnt the great cloud of frost it would have been at the equinox here and there a few green blades of grass were poking up through the mud though snow might yet put paid to them a good one itll be the best one ever moss said everything weve remembered for so long were finally paying back but stone shook his head the best remembrance day ever will be the one after the war is over and weve whipped the rebs and the canucks and the limeys everything till then is just a buildup moss considered then nodded all right percy youve got me there stone looked around this road could use some building up come to that this whole countryside could use some building up well youre right about that too moss said of course you could say the same thing about just about any piece of ontario were sitting on if we havent ironed it flat to use it for something in particular its had the living bejesus shot out of it as if to prove his point he had to swerve sharply to keep from steering his bicycle into a shell hole that scarred the road as smallpox scarred the face and as smallpox could scar more than the face shell holes and bomb craters scarred more than the road they dotted the whole landscape by what had to be a miracle a twentyfoot stretch of wooden fence still stood next to the road not much farther on moss dug his heels into the dirt to stop his bicycle he studied the fence with astonished fascination how many bullet holes do you suppose that timbers got in it percy he asked more than i feel like counting ill tell you that stone answered at once we should have brought hans along hed count em and tell you how many were our caliber and how many the the limeys and canucks were shooting back at us you only think youre joking moss said his friend shook his head he wasnt joking and they both knew it hans oppenheim would do the counting and was liable to try to figure out how many men on each side were firing captured weapons too then jonathan moss stopped worrying about bullet holes and for that matter about hans oppenheim too moving slowly across a battered field by the side of the road was a fairhaired woman of about his own age she led a couple of scrawny cows toward a little creek that meandered through the field percy stone was also eyeing the young woman he and moss stopped their bicycles at the same time as if they had turned their aeroplanes together up above the trench line youre a married man moss murmured to stone i know that his flightmate answered then he raised his voice miss oh miss the womans head came up like that of a deer when a hunter steps on a dry twig she looked back toward the distant farmhouse from which shed come then toward the much closer americans plainly her every urge was to flee but she didnt quite dare what do you want she demanded her voice like her face wild and wary and hunted and what will percy say to that moss wondered something like will you take a couple of dollars for a roll in the hay moss didnt think that approach would work moss didnt think any approach would work not with a woman who had trouble even holding still in their presence percy stone didnt even smile at her he said if youd be so kind could we buy some milk from you youre a genius moss breathed stone did smile then one of his little selfdeprecating grins the young woman stared at the cows as if shed never seen them before as if they betrayed her merely by being there visibly gathering her courage she shook her head no she said i havent anythingnot one single thingthat id sell to you yanks moss and stone looked at each other that was the reaction the us occupiers got from almost all the canucks in ontario from everything moss had heard it wasnt like that everywhere in canada if it had been the usa never could have set up the republic of quebec farther east we dont mean you any harm miss he said but my friend is right some fresh milk would be good and wed gladly pay you for it if you dont mean any harm the woman said why dont you get out of my country go back to yours and leave us alone her head came up in defiance if she wasnt going to run away from a couple of yanks shed give them a piece of her mind instead if you want to argue like that why did england invade my country from canada during the second mexican war moss returned why did you yanks try invading us during your revolution and again during the war of she said you cant blame us for not trusting you youve never given us any reason to trust you and youve given us plenty of reason not to did we invade canada back then moss whispered to stone stone shrugged dont know if we did we didnt win so you cant expect the history books to say much about it moss grunted in that case the history books wouldnt have much to say about anything thats happened since the war of secession but it wasnt the same thing and he knew it since the war of secession the usa had been put upon everybody knew that if the united states had been trying to do the muscling in the earlier days and had got licked too that wasnt just defeat it was embarrassment which was worse you dont even believe me the young woman jeered your schools have filled you so full of lies you dont believe the truth when you hear it if you want to know what i think thats pretty sad what makes you so sure youre preaching the gospel moss said getting angry in turn i never once heard of a canuck who wouldnt lie he didnt care about milk any more he wanted to wound the young woman to his surprise she laughed how do i know im telling the truth because my maiden name is laura secord thats how im named after my fourtimesgreat aunt who went through twenty miles of woods in the dark to let the british soldiers know you yanks had invaded and do you know what else laura secord was born in massachusetts up here any school child knows about her like paul revere stone muttered and moss ruefully nodded maybe you won that time he said to laura who had been born secord but were here to stay now you may as well learn to like it go on your way yank she said tossing her head youll be older than methuselah before we learn to like it and dont be too sure youre here to stay either were still in the fight the slight scots burr that distinguished the canadian accent from the american made her sound very determined indeed where is your husband percy stone demanded his voice suddenly harsh too where where do you think in the canadian army where he belongs the young woman answered i told you oncenow i tell you again go on your way she spoke with an odd authority as if she owned the land and were entitled to give commands on it the breeze picked up her yellow hair which hung uncurled and unconfined and threw it out behind her like a flag her eyes granite gray blazed if her husband was anywhere near as formidable as she moss thought hed be one dangerous canuck with a rifle in his hands just for a moment she put the flier in mind of a viking and made him wonder only a little less than seriously if shed charge down on him and stone she did take a step toward the two americans it was not a charge though her face crumpled tears ran down her cheeks her voice choked she said go on can you not have at least the simple human decency to let me be is that too much to ask without answering her without looking at percy stone moss started riding again a moment later the former photographer from ohio joined him quite a lot of woman there stone remarked after a bit jonathan moss nodded quite a lot of lady there too he said after a while you forget the difference between the one and the other till it up and stares you in the face stone nodded a woman like that he sighed she makes you wish she liked the usa better if we could win over that kind of people wed win the war and the peace both i wonder what they do in canada instead of remembrance day moss said theyve been on top so long they dont know what its like to be on the bottom andhe tried to forestall his friendi dont give a damn about what the first laura secord did a hundred years ago why not stone said not about to be forestalled if she hadnt made it through those woods back then maybe canada would have been part of the usa the past hundred years and we wouldnt have to worry about beating the canucks now if im going to play the game of mighthavebeens id sooner play it with the war of secession thanks if wed won that and kept the damn rebs in the united states with us maybe fat chance percy stone said they had england and france on their side and lee and jackson for generals jackson licked us again twenty years later too and what did we have president abraham lincoln his lip curled contemptuously moss sighed and nodded mighthavebeens was a stupid game when you got right down to it look back on things and you couldnt help but see theyd come out the way they had to come out thegreatwar breakthroughs everything squelched that was private first class reginald bartletts overwhelming impression of the red river bottomlands if you put a foot down on the boggy ground it squelched if you dug a spade into it threw away the dirt and turned your back for a minute the hole would be half full of water when you turned around again we have to dig in men first lieutenant jerome nicoll said over and over as he was in the habit of saying things over and over we have to hold on to whatever corners of sequoyah we can same as the british and the belgians are keeping some of belgium free from the huns boot theyre entrenched in the muck of flanders same as we are here we have to hold on good thing the british and the belgians are helpin us keep the huns out of sequoyah aint it napoleon dibble said sure as hell is reggie agreed gravely and its just as much a factgod damn me to hell if its notthat what were doing right here nap is keeping the damnyankees from pouring troops into belgium for true nap dibbles eyes got big and round i didnt know that he started digging like a man with a mission dirt flying from his entrenching tool as if from a steam shovel then this heres important business i reckon sergeant pete hairston coughed a couple of times then pinned reggie under his gaze as an entomologist might have pinned a butterfly to his specimen board god damn you to hell is right the veteran grunted in a low voice so bartlett would hear and the still furiously digging dibble wouldnt have a heart sarge reggie said also quietly i wasnt telling him anything that wasnt so now was i maybe not sergeant hairston answered but you sure as hell werent telling him anything he could use neither he slapped at himself and cursed ill tell you what i could use i could use one of those goddamn flamethrowing gadgets theyre starting to issue thats what you dont want to just shoot the damnyankees reggie asked you want to toast em instead fuck toasting the damnyankees hairston answered you got to be crazy to want to get up close enough to em to use one o them flamethrowers nah what i want to do is i want to wave that damn thing around and toast me about a million billion mosquitoes he slapped again ah now i get you sarge reggie bartlett was slapping too and not having much luck and after you toasted that million billion thered only be about a jillion million billion of the sons of bitches left and that doesnt count the chiggers or the ticks or the leeches dont remind me not only did hairston slap he scratched too and fleas and cooties and all the other little bastards back in richmond i was a druggists helper bartlett said wistfully seems like a hundred years ago now this time of year wed sell camphor candles by the dozen to keep the mosquitoes away and zincoxide ointment and little bottles of kerosene with perfume in it to kill lice and nits some pretty highclass folks would buy that stuff too always knew there was a bunch of lousy bastards runnin things in richmond hairston said just goes and proves things dont it joe mopope came mooching along what he was looking to see reggie knew was whether the entrenchments had got big and deep enough for him to scramble down into them without doing any digging of his own the kiowa was a hell of a fighting man he enjoyed fighting what he didnt enjoy was the work that went into making sure you stayed alive in between fights hey joe reggie called you got any secret indian tricks for keeping the mosquitoes and things off you you got to do two things the kiowa answered his long face was serious to the point of being somber all the white men in earshot leaned forward to hear his words of wisdom seeing that he had everybodys attention he gave a dramatic pause as good as anything on a vaudeville stage then went on you got to slap like hell and you got to scratch like hell and you got to go to hell joe sergeant hairston said but he was laughing joe mopope never cracked a smile hairston added you got us good that time but im gonna get you back i know just how too hop down here whip out a spade and set yourself to diggin damnyankees wouldnt treat me this way mopope said he did start entrenching although without much enthusiasm maybe i should have stayed in town and let them come along oh yeah hairstons nod was venomously sarcastic that would have been really great joe the csas let you indians do pretty much like you please up here in sequoyah aint been like that in the usa after we licked em in the war of secession they took out after the sioux and they been takin out after their redskins ever since they purely dont fancy your kind of people and i dont reckon theyd give you a big kiss now joe mopope exhaled through his nose not quite a snort but close oh yeah the president in richmond treats us halfway decent cause he likes us come on its cause he can use us against the yankees and everybody knows it hairston stared at him so did reggie bartlett little by little the kiowa was making him realize a red skin didnt mean the fellow wearing it was stupid reggie glanced over at nap dibble who was still working away like a machine a white skin didnt turn somebody into a college professor all by itself either maybe if hed had the chance to think about it he would have wondered what having a black skin meant he might even have wondered if it meant anything more than a red one or a white one but at that moment rifle fire broke out to the north us troops prodding at the confederate position he stuck his entrenching tool in his belt grabbed his tredegar off his shoulder and squatted down on the damp ground to see how bad it would get the soldiers in greengray didnt come swarming and rampaging toward him only mosquitoes swarmed hereabouts machine guns started hammering reggie watched the yankees who were on their feet go flat some wounded some prudent enough to try to make sure they wouldnt be he fired a couple of rounds but had no idea whether he hit anyone one of the us field guns opened up the shells tore up the swampy bottom country but not so badly as they would have had the ground been harder and drier and much of their explosive force went down into the muck or straight up rather than out in all directions all the things that made reggie glad when the us troops were shelling the confederates made him sorry when his own gunners returned the fire they didnt hurt the damnyankees nearly so much as he thought they should but the us soldiers did not press the attack instead they began to dig in where they lay maybe that was all theyd intended to do push their own lines a little farther forward with this attack so they could try pushing the confederates back with the next one or the one after that if they had a lot of artillery theyd ruin us or drive us down into texas pete hairston said gloomily theyd shoot up all the river crossings so we couldnt move supplies into sequoyah any more and thatd be that but they havent got much more in the way of supplies than we do so well hang on a while longer damned if i know how to push em back though mebbe theyll all drown in the mud an never be seen no more sarge nap dibble suggested had anyone else said it it would have been a joke and everyone would have laughed the trouble was nap meant it and that was painfully plain to his comrades in a more gentle voice than he would have used to speak to most of his soldiers hairston said only trouble with that is nap were down here in the mud with em and wed likely drown first oh thats right sarge dibble nodded brightly i wonder how come i didnt think of that funny thing about that aint it hairston said he wasnt mocking dibble not in the least he got the most he could from a man who was willing without being very bright reggie bartlett admired the way the sergeant handled nap he doubted he would have had the patience to match it lieutenant nicoll came by inspecting the part of the line his company was digging he nodded this is how you do it men dig in well and the yankees can never dislodge you dig in well men reggie echoed after nicoll had gone on his way dig in well and they cant drive you out of waurika dig in well and they cant drive you out of ryan dig in well and youll have your own grave all nice and ready for those damnyankee sons of bitches to plant you in it joe mopopes grunt was evidently intended for a laugh you face this the way one of my people would he said what will be will be whatever it is you move toward it you cannot help moving toward it it is there it waits for you you cannot escape it i joined up as soon as the war started bartlett answered ive spent too damn much time in the trenches since a lot of time when i wasnt in the trenches i was in a damnyankee prison camp because the bastards nabbed me when i was up at the front ive seen enough now that nothing i see from here on out is going to surprise me a whole hell of a lot the other soldiers nodded they were grimy and unshaven and tired and wet and full of bites pete hairston said whatever happens i reckon im ready for it the soldiers nodded again joe mopope studied them you are warriors all of you he said at last you are not just soldiers you are warriors whatever the hell we are it isnt worth gettin into an uproar about it bartlett said more nods he fished through his pockets and found a scrap of paper that had stayed dry more fishing revealed a tobacco pouch but it was empty anybody have some makings im plumb out i got some sergeant hairston said reggie held out his hand with the paper in it hairston poured tobacco onto the paper nodding his thanks reggie rolled the cigarette after a couple of drags he felt better sergeant chester martin envied us army engineers they always seemed to know exactly what they were doing he knew that wasnt always so but it was so often enough to leave him impressed his own part in the war he strongly felt he was making up as he went along he also envied the engineers because they were cleaner than he was a lot of them wore boots that almost reached their kneescavalry bootswhich kept their trousers from getting as filthy as his they worked now with fussy precision laying out lengths of white tape from one stick to another whats all this about david hamburger asked they laying out the route for the remembrance day parade couple days too early for may day martin said with a grin needling the private with a socialist congresswoman for a sister besides if it was for that the taped be red and then youd get up and march along it and get yourself shot funny sarge the hamburger kid said funny like a crutch but he was grinning even laughing a little he hadnt seen much actionthings had been quiet since martin crossed the potomac to join b company of the stbut he fit in as well as if hed been wearing greengray since tilden russell said if he was paradin for may day the rebs wouldnt shoot at him not with all the colored troops theyve got in their trenches those smokes are better trueblue reds than any socialist from outta new york city even if he does have his sister in congress tellin teddy roosevelt how to run things i dont know why you expect roosevelt to listen to flora david hamburger said he hasnt listened to anybody else since he got elected martin laughed corporal reinholdt on the other hand scowled shut up he said in a flat hostile voice nobodys gonna make fun of the president of the united states while im here to kick his ass hey take it easy bob martin said nobodys getting in an uproar about this oh now youre gonna undercut me are you sarge reinholdt growled must be another goddamn red yourself had he left off the adjective and smiled he might have got by with it as things were martin couldnt ignore it hed been waiting for this moment since he got here it had held off longer than hed expected but it wouldnt hold off any more his right hand went into a trouser pocket and came out in a fist get up he snapped at reinholdt who was hunkered down over a tin coffeepot yeah the corporal said as he got to his feet he was shorter and stockier than chester martin they probably weighed within five pounds of each other by the way reinholdt leaned forward he knew the time was here too he took a step toward martin come in here and take the slot that shoulda been mine will you a seasons worth of resentment boiled in him i ought to oh shove it up your ass or ill in the middle of the sentence without warning martin threw a left reinholdt ducked with a scornful laugh martin laughed too he hadnt expected much from that left the arm still wasnt so strong as it should have been not after the wound hed taken his right thoughthe uppercut caught bob reinholdt square on the point of the chin reinholdt didnt fall over he was made of stern stuff but the punch he had on the way ran out of steam before it got near martin and was hardly more than a pat when it connected with his ribs reinholdts eyes stayed open but they werent seeing much martin had the luxury of deciding whether to kick him in the crotch he kicked him in the belly instead with precisely measured viciousness reinholdt folded up like a sailors concertina martin hit him in the face again for good measure as he was going down he didnt need that last one tilden russell said sudden respect in his voice over and above that to which martins three stripes entitled him he studied reinholdt who lay unmoving he wasnt going anywhere anyway maybe not martin shrugged you ever get in a saloon brawl though one of the first things you learn is never let the other guy think he could have licked you if you hadnt got lucky sarge i dont think you need to worry about that david hamburger said martin wondered whether the kid was right when the real fighting started would he be able to trust reinholdt behind his back with a rifle hed have to do some thinking there for now though hed taken care of what needed taking care of throw some water in his face he told hamburger hes got no business sleeping on the job his hand went back into his pocket the short fat steel cylinder he stashed there was just about as good as a set of brass knuckles and a hell of a lot less conspicuous such toys were commonplace in the saloon fights among steelworkers in toledo martin gave hardly more thought to having one than he would have to a box of matches reinholdt groaned and spat blood when david hamburger flipped water on him after a while the battered corporal sat up his eyes still didnt want to focus he spat again this time the red had a couple of white flecks in it he looked up at martin what the hell you hit me with this martin showed him his right fist he didnt show him the steel cylinder hed had in it he went on in a pleasant tone of voice you better pay attention to what im telling you now bob you try messing around with me again and one of us is liable to end up dead im going to tell you one other thing tooit wont be me now you got all that i got it reinholdt said maybe he was even convinced martin couldnt tell the battered corporal tried to get to his feet on the second try he made it his legs were still wobbly he rubbed his jaw shit feels like i got bounced with a rock he spoke like a man with considerable knowledge of such things just remember that next time is all martin said reinholdt nodded then winced martin had caught a couple on the buzzer in his time too he knew reinholdt had what felt like the worlds worst hangover without even the fun of getting drunk first oh yeah the corporal said ill remember shit tomorrows remembrance day he turned and walked down the trench privates made a point of getting out of his way as fast as they could later that day captain cremony summoned martin to the dugout where he was filling out ammunition requisition forms the company commander looked up from the forms and said i hear you and reinholdt had a little talk about the weather this morning sir had martin looked any more innocent a halo would have sprung into being above his head i dont know what youre talking about sir of course you dontand if pigs had wings wed all carry umbrellas cremony said with heavy irony if pigs had wings theyd be generals sir martin answered and youre right wed all carry umbrellas cremony stared at him then started to laugh if youd said captains youd be on your way back to the guardhouse this minute his eyes narrowed but youre not going to distract me with a joke since that was what martin had hoped to do he stood still a serious expression on his face as if the idea had never entered his mind hed had plenty of practice looking opaque for officers captain cremony grunted dammit martin i understand why this happened but the timing was very bad yes sir im sorry sir martin said i couldnt really take care of that as well as i might have though if a fellow wants to talk about the weather right then and there sometimes you just have to listen to him sergeant if theres no more talk of the weather between the two of you i will forget this discussion the company commander said if there is ill have to remember it after all tomorrow is remembrance day and well have all sorts of things to remember then oh yes sir martin said i know that sir in a way im just as glad bob and i had this little talk now instead of waiting till later we might have said sharper things to each other later if you know what i mean as i said im not remembering any of this and id better not have a reason to remember it im telling that to you and ill tell it to reinholdt if i do have reason to remember it youll both be sorry dismissed sergeant martin tromped over boards and through mud back to his section when he got there he found bob reinholdt drinking coffee out of the side of his mouth he didnt say anything to reinholdt about captain cremonys warning that would have made him into the teachers pet hed seen that cremony knew what he was doing the company commander would get the message across reinholdt didnt say anything to him either that suited him fine an engineer came along the trench every so often he would pause get up on the firing step and peer through binoculars south toward round hill virginia and the confederate lines in front of it then hed scribble something in a notebook go on a little farther and look south again you dont mind me saying so sir thats a hell of a good way to get yourself shot chester martin remarked do tell the engineer said as if the notion had never crossed his mind chance i take thats all have to hope the niggers in those rebel trenches over yonder cant shoot havent seen any sign of that sir have to tell you martin said they dont seem much different than white troops far as that goes they throw a lot of lead around and every so often somebody gets hit the bullet doesnt care who shot it only where its going chance i take the engineer repeated and worked his way down the trench line not making a fuss just doing his job no cries of alarm rose nor shouts for stretcherbearers so martin supposed he got away with it dusk fell martin rolled himself in a blanket against the chill and against mosquitoes both he fell asleep right away he almost always fell asleep right away he woke up every bit as fast too commonly grabbing for a weapon sometime in the middle of the night a horrible clatter and rumble had him on his feet with his springfield halfway to his shoulder before he realized that whatever else it was it wasnt gunfire it wasnt cs bombing aeroplanes overhead either what the hell he said what the hell its the barrels coming up sarge david hamburger said in the darkness remembrance day today thats right martin breathed remembrance day today in philadelphia flora hamburger discovered shed had only the vaguest notion of what remembrance day meant up till then shed lived her whole life in new york city her home town observed remembrance day of course how could it be otherwise april the day marking the end of the second mexican war had been a national day of mourning ever since but new york city did not observe remembrance day the way the rest of the united states did oh there were always military parades and speeches the same as there were elsewhere in the country but there were also always socialist counterdemonstrations and hecklers in new york city flora had been caught up in the remembrance day riots of the socialist party was not about to let remembrance day steal its may day thunder in philadelphia though the socialist party maintained a much smaller presence philadelphia was a city of government and therefore overwhelmingly a city of democrats it was also far more than new york a city of soldiers no one mocked here no one heckled here people crowded along the parade route to cheer the soldiers and the soldiers circle men of prewar conscription classesnot so many of them left not with the guns so hungry these past nearly three yearsand the graying veterans of the second mexican war and the aged veterans of the war of secession and even riding along in a motorcar a pair of ancient veterans of the mexican war the last war against a foreign power the united states had won church bells pealed flora knew the churches were packed too packed with people lamenting past us defeats and praying for future victory someone in the crowd on the far side of chestnut street from the platform where flora sat with the rest of congress and other government dignitaries held up a placard that seemed to sum up the mood as well as anything it s our turn this time aeroplanes buzzed overheadu s fighting scouts flying in swarms to make sure the csa did not interrupt the days observances flora craned her neck to watch them they put her in mind of dragonflies and were far more interesting than the endless parade of soldiers and marching bands and veterans as he had a way of doing at functions hosea blackford sat close to her seeing her looking up into the sky he said it was even more interesting a couple of years ago when the confederates stood on the susquehanna then there were dogfights above the parade and the cs bombers dropped their toys not far from the parade route it was more interesting in new york city too flora said i was there for the riots that year blackford frowned i wish they had never happened they did the party a great deal of damage around the country damage from which it has not entirely recovered even now flora said nobody knows to this day who threw the bomb that started the riot whether it was a socialist or a mormon who sympathized with the rebellion in utah thats true the congressman from dakota said but its also true that socialists did most of the rioting no matter how the trouble started what if it is flora said what if it is we were trying to do something to stop this useless senseless war its more than anyone else in the country was doing its more than anyone else in the socialist party was doing too she added pointedly how could anyone stop the war by then hosea blackford said we were fighting the confederate states from the gulf of california to the atlantic against canada heavily from winnipeg east and here and there farther west too and against england and france and japan on the high seas it was too big to stop it still is it should never have started flora said a hapsburg prince wasnt reason enough to throw the world on the fire maybe youre even right blackford said but when roosevelt called on us to vote for war credits what would have happened if we had said no i would not be in congress now you would not be in congress now none of us would be in congress now my brother would not be in virginia now flora said my sister would not be a widow now my nephew would not be growing up without ever having the chance to know his father now if you think i would not go back to new york and make that bargain mr blackford you are mistaken you shame me he said quietly i think the party needs shaming flora answered i think the partyespecially outside of new york cityhas become too bourgeois for its own good and forgotten the oppressed workers and peasants of the world if the socialist party in the usa goes to war against the labour party in england and the socialist party in france where is the international solidarity of socialism ill tell you wheredown in the trenches with a rifle thats where blackford did not reply instead he made a small production out of lighting a cigar before he had to say anything more a rumbling clanking rattle and ecstatic shouts from the crowd farther up the parade route made flora forget about the conversation at least for a little while like everyone else she was staring at the enormous mechanical contraptions lumbering along chestnut street president theodore roosevelts voice rose above the racket from the snorting monsters bully roosevelt shouted as enthusiastic as a small boy over a tin motorcar by george what a bully pack of machines they are they were impressive if size and noise were the criteria for impressiveness each had a cannon at the snout and bristled with machine guns they were the deadliestlooking things flora had ever seen the fighting scouts in the sky were killing machines too but graceful and elegant killing machines the barrels were as graceful and elegant as so many rhinoceri each of them had in it a man standing up so that the top half of his body was outside the square cupola in the middle of the machines roof each of those soldiers saluted the platform and roosevelt in particular as his barrel waddled past now go into the fight roosevelt shouted to one barrel after another now go into the fight and teach all those who dare trifle with the might of the united states the error and folly of their ways he was indeed like a boy playing with tin motorcars and lead soldiers and aeroplanes carved from balsa wood but his toys really burned and bled and crashedand made other similar toys with different markings and colors burn and bleed and crash he seemed not to understand that flora wondered how such a blind spot was possible she turned to hosea blackford with a question that had on the surface little to do with their previous argument roosevelt fought in war how can he take it so lightly because he is what he seems i suppose blackford answered because he really does believe everything he preaches and not least i suppose because he enjoyed himself and won glory when he went to war but hes been in the trenches now flora persisted he knows there is no glory in fighting against cannon and machine guns my brothers sergeant helped him take cover when the confederates shelled the part of the line he was visitingdavid has written me about it how can he not see he sees the country going forward he doesnt see the suffering hes creating to make it go in the direction he wants blackford said slowly thats the best answer i can give you and i doubt he could give you a better one flora wondered about that roosevelt was a good deal more eloquent than shed expected him to be but he was hardly an introspective man so perhaps blackford had a point after all the clank and rattle and rumble of the barrels faded in the distance so more slowly the noise of the crowd faded too a sort of muted thunder remained flora had heard it whenever things grew quiet along the parade route she wondered what it was it put her in mind of the roar of the sea by the oceanside but more by its steadiness than by the sound itself up at the front of the platform president roosevelt approached a microphonewhich was flora thought irreverently like a fat man approaching a chocolate cake for the president had no more need of the one than the fat fellow did of the other listen roosevelt called to the crowd pointing to the south he went on do you know what that is flora realized the low reverberations were coming from that direction tell us somebodyprobably a paid shillcalled from the crowd i will tell you roosevelt said that is the sound of our heavy guns shelling the forces of the confederate states still on us soil we are also shelling them on their own territory and the canadians and british opposing us in the north this is a remembrance day they shall remember forever yes remember with fear and trembling how the people cheered listening to them sent a chill through flora the war was not popular in her home district nor anything about it the war itself was probably unpopular in philadelphia too but victory and what victory would bringthose were popular floras district was full of immigrants newcomers to the united states who didnt bear the full weight of a half centurys resentment and hatred and humiliation on their shoulders it was different here the army of northern virginia had occupied philadelphia at the end of the war of secession as it had come so close to doing in this war the government had fled here in the second mexican war and the present struggle philadelphians didnt merely want peacethey wanted revenge wanted it with a brooding desire frightening in its intensity lost in her own thoughts shed missed some of what roosevelt was saying and if we have suffered he thundered now our foes have suffered more if they have overrun some of our sacred soil we stand in arms on more of theirs if our cities have suffered from their bombing aeroplanes their cities have suffered more from our mighty bombers and we advance my friends we advance everywhere on the continent of north america the foe is in retreat so i say to you stand fast the enemys hope is that our resolve will falter they pray in richmond they pray in canada that we shall weary of the struggle they pray that we shall throw in our hand our winning hand and give them at the table what they cannot win on the field of battle will we fall into their trap my fellow citizens of the united states no the crowd cried a great and angry roar hosea blackford leaned toward flora now you see the danger of opposing the war effort too strongly no i dont she answered i only hear a lot of wind blackford shook his head its worse than that suppose we do everything we can to end the war and teddy roosevelt goes ahead and wins it anyhow who would ever take us seriously again if lincoln had somehow won the war of secession dont you think the republicans would have tarred the democrats with the brush of peace dont you think roosevelt would do the same to usand enjoy every minute of it that was a larger political calculation than flora had ever tried to make do you really imagine a victory like that is possible she asked as the president reached another rhetorical crescendo through the bellowed applause of the crowd congressman blackford gave an answer that chilled her though the day was warm and sunny i begin to think it may be lieutenant colonel irving morrells barrel rumbled and clattered south across nomansland toward the confederate defenses east of white house tennessee it bucked and bounced over the broken ground like a toy boat in a stormy sea or perhaps more as if morrell were riding a threelegged horse no one had ever bothered breaking for the saddle now he used hand signals almost as automatically as he breathed right then straight he ordered the driver and the ungainly vehicle steered around a shell hole that might have made it bog down there just ahead stood the first barbedwire belt in front of the enemys trenches an obstacle as deadly to infantry as flypaper to flies straight morrell signaled and the barrel crushed the barbed wire under better than thirty tons of metal with a noise like heavy hail on a tin roof machinegun bullets started slapping the armored front of the barrel some of them ricocheted off the cupola too none fortunately hit the armored vision louvers even with those louvers closed down tight lead splash was dangerous there straight ahead was the reinforcedconcrete box from which the machine gun was spitting death halt morrell signaled to the driver and the barrel stopped take it out morrell screamed to the two artillerymen at the nose cannon he didnt know whether they heard him or not what he wanted though was plain enough the cannon bellowed inside the barrel the report was hard to hear over the noise of the two white truck engines the cordite fumes from the explosion made morrell cough but peering through the vision slits he watched the machinegun position crumble to rubble straight he signaled to the driver and the barrel crushed another belt of wire by hook or by crook general custer had managed to assemble a striking column of more than three hundred barrels every one of themevery one of them that hadnt broken down or bogged down before it got this farwas chewing a path through the wire for the infantry that was following another last belt of wire surmounted ground down into the mud and nothing more stood between the barrel and the foremost confederate trench here and there a few brave men who had withstood the short fierce preliminary bombardment and who were not overwhelmed by fear of the oncoming barrels popped their heads above the parapet and blazed away with their tredegars morrell needed to give no orders there the two machine guns on either side of the barrel started chattering they could not bear straight ahead but the nose cannon could and other barrels were advancing side by side with morrells their machine guns helped sweep out the space in front of his traveling fortress just as his swept the space in front of them as he bore down on the confederate soldiers some of them broke and fled bullets sent most of those spinning and writhing to the ground the rest fought on in place till they too were slain over the parapet climbed the barrel the machine gunners inside pounded enfilading fire up and down the trench as far as each traverse the advance had given them a target of which men of their trade could normally but dream then the barrel was over the trench almost falling into it crushing the ground underneath the tracks helping to level its own way down and forward shells had damaged the far wall of the trench engines screaming the barrel climbed over onto the ground between the first trench and the second one of the machine gunners was holding a hurt wrist from that awkward descent he kept feeding ammunition into the gun for his partner to fire though all six machine guns even the pair in the rear were blazing away now making things lively for any confederate soldiers unlucky enough to be nearby keep moving morrell shouted to the driver weve got to keep moving the young fellow at the barrels complicated controls raised both eyebrows to show he didnt understand straight morrell signaled resignedly but he couldnt keep from talking even if he couldnt hear himself let alone make anyone else hear weve got to keep driving them if we hit them hard enough now we can crack this line and if we crack this line nashville isnt worth anything to them any more because well shell it flat left he signaled the driver waggling his hand to show he didnt need a whole lot of left he saw a way over the next trench line one not quite so drastic as the barrel had used in its first descent they went down a ways they came back up and the machine guns kept hammering he wondered how the rest of the barrels were doing and the us infantry moving forward with and after them he couldnt tell not stuck inside the way he was wireless telegraph he thought we need barrels with wireless telegraph sets inside so we can keep track of whats going on all over the field he shrugged if it didnt happen in this war it would in the next whenever that came along meanwhile he realized he did have a way to find out what was going on around him he undogged the roof hatch threw it open stood up and looked ahead and to the rear bully he said softly oh bully a few of the barrels had bogged down in trenches and shell holes others had taken hits from artillery or were otherwise disabled some pouring pillars of greasy black smoke into the sky to mark their pyres but most like his were still rumbling forwardrumbling forward and driving all before them the artillerymen fired the barrels nose cannon out here in the open air the noise was terrific like a clap of doom the highexplosive shell exploded in front of a knot of confederate soldiers and knocked them flying some morrell saw were colored men that confirmed intelligence reports the shell didnt care it did its damage most impartially he took another look over his shoulder and pumped a fist in the air in delight in the wake of the barrels and coming up even with the slower ones were infantrymen in greengray swarming forward and out to the flanks to take possession of the ground the barrels cleared not all the confederate troops white or negro were breaking morrell rapidly discovered that while standing up so his head and torso were out of the barrel gave him a far better view of the field than he could have had inside the machine it also made him a far better target bullets cracked past his head others clanged and ricocheted off the cupola with assorted metallic sounds of fury after half a minute or so he decided hed be tempting fate if he stayed out there any longer he ducked back into the infernal gloom and fumes inside the barrel and slammed the hatch shut after him the driver and the rest of the crew stared at him as if convinced hed gone utterly mad his grin was compounded of excitement and triumph he stuck up a thumb to show how things were going on the battlefield as a whole then signaled to the driver straight his hands said the driver eyes wide saluted before pressing on the crew cheered loud enough to be heard over the roar and rumble of engines tracks and guns how far had they come morrell was sure theyd made better than a mile maybe even a mile and a half and noon washe checked his watchstill more than an hour away if they could keep it up theyd have a hole miles wide and three or four miles deep torn in the confederate line by the time the sun set on this most spectacular remembrance day of all time keep going he muttered weve got to keep going plenty of men in butternut were inclined to disagree with him the cs soldiers defending the line above nashville understood its importance every bit as well as did the us attackers the roar off to his left was a barrel taking a direct hit from a shell another shell struck in front of his own machine showering the armored chassis with fragments and lumps of earth speed up he signaled the driver and the barrel rattled forward as if he were in an aeroplane he went through random right and left turns to throw off the enemy gunners aim hitting a moving dodging target was not something the crews of field pieces practiced shells burst near the barrel but none hit this was not like shelling infantrymen a miss here was as good as a mile one of the two artillerymen at the nose cannon waved to him and pointed he nodded then signaled the driver to halt they fired their gun once twice in quick succession peering through his louvers morrell watched men tumble away from the carriage of one of the csas nasty threeinch guns they did not get up again straight he signaled the driver a moment later he caught sight of another barrel a little off to the right and several hundred yards ahead he snarled something he was glad no one else could hear he thought hed been one of the leaders of this assault how had that other bastard got so far ahead of him he was green with jealousy greener than his uniform then he took another longer look jealousy faded replaced by hot anticipation that wasnt a us barrelit was one of the rhomboids the csa built copying the design from the british barrels had seldom met other barrels in combat his mouth stretched wide in a grin a new encounter was going onto the list he got the drivers attention then pointed southwest till the fellow spotted the confederate barrel tanks the rebels sometimes called them which struck morrell as a silly name he clenched his fist to show the driver he wanted to engage the enemy machine the youngster nodded and turned toward it the confederate barrel had spotted him too and began making a ponderous turn of its own to bring both its sponsonmounted cannon to bear on him since neither machine could move at anything much above a walking pace the engagement developed with the leisure though hardly with the grace of two sailing ships of the line flame burst from the muzzle of one of the confederate barrels guns uselessly morrell braced himself for the impact of the shell it missed the artillerymen waved to him he signaled the driver to halt they fired they missed too straight he signaled the driver speed up perhaps unnerved by his lumbering charge the crew of the confederate barrels other cannon also missed their shot his own gunners waved again the barrel halted they fired smoke and flame spurted from the enemy hit morrell screamed we got him hatches on the sides and top of the confederate machine flew open the crew began bailing out morrell swung his own barrel sideways so his machine gunners could give them a broadside and then the command was straight again he stood up once more to look around this time for only a moment fewer us barrels were near than before more had been hit or bogged down or broken down but the survivorsand there were manystill advanced and the us infantry with them maybe they would go on all the way to the cumberland maybe the confederates with the advantage of moving on unwrecked ground would patch together some kind of line and halt them short of the river in a way it hardly mattered the big us guns would move forward miles forward from their new position theyd pound nashville to pieces breakthrough irving morrell said and ducked down into the barrel again gas shells didnt sound quite like shrapnel or high explosive they gurgled as they flew through the air and burst with a report different from those of other rounds get your gas helmets on sergeant jake featherston screamed as the shells began raining down around the guns of his battery he threw on his own rubberizedburlap gas helmet and stared through its murky glass windows toward the line above round hill virginia the line that had been quiet for so long but was quiet no more here came barrels a few widely spaced rumbling toward and then through the belts of barbed wire in front of the trenches of the army of northern virginia yankee machine guns blazed away making the soldiers in those trenches black and white keep their heads down men in greengray swarmed like ants in the barrels wake and between them as well range is yards boys featherston shouted the gas helmet muffling his voice now we make em pay their dues normally the threeinch field guns fired half a dozen rounds a minute in an emergency they could triple that for a little while they could triple it for a little while with the gun crews unencumbered anyhow in the stifling gas helmets they didnt come close even keeping up the normal rate of fire was a strain while wearing the helmets featherston felt he couldnt breathe his head pounded sweat fogged the glass portholes through which he had to watch the world all the guns in the battery were firing though jake got a blurrier view than he wanted but he shouted with glee to watch shells rain down on the damnyankees now that theyd come out of their trenches the range was too long for him to be able to see individual us soldiers ripped and torn and thrown aside like rag dolls but he could watch the shells burst and imagine the butchery they were meting out he had seen enough battlefields to know all too well what artillery did to soft human flesh he could also see that his battery and the rest of the confederate guns on round hill and farther to the rear were not going to be able to keep the damnyankees from going forward already barrels were in among the trenches of the army of northern virginia lashing them with machinegun fire at close range hitting something as small as a barrel at a range of two and a half miles wasnt a matter of precise aiming dumb luck had a lot more to do with it reserves started going forward to help stem the tide but yankee artillery was chewing up the ground behind the trenches too reinforcements took casualties long before they got close enough to the front to do any good featherston couldnt tell whether they were white troops or colored whoever they were they suffered and the us artillery hadnt forgotten about round hill either along with the gas shells the yankees flung around high explosive and shrapnel as if theyd have to pay for what they didnt use up one of jakes shelljerkers collapsed with a shriek clutching at his belly the leftmost piece of the sixgun battery fell silent featherston dashed over to its emplacement to find out why if a hit had taken out the crew but left the gun intact hed yank a man or two off the rest of the guns in the battery and keep all of them in action he discovered the crew was down but so was the gun the carriage was wrecked it had taken a direct hit from what by the size of the crater had to be a six or eightinch shell cursing fateand the us heavy artillery that overmatched its confederate counterparthe dashed back to his own gun stretcherbearers had carried away the wounded crewman jake had to stop and rest before he could do anything else his heart pounded like a sledgehammer in his chest he wanted to yank off the gas helmet but didnt dare gas shells were still falling releasing their deadly contents in bursts of oily vapor like furious machines the gun crews of his battery kept hitting the yankees as hard as they could they shortened the range again and again as the greengray infantry forced its way into and past one trench line after another bastards are going to be coming up the hill at us jake snarled trying to suck enough air into his lungs to satisfy him well give em shrapnel sarge michael scott said slamming home another shell hell weve got a few rounds of case shot well give em that the thinwalled shells of case shot were filled with lead balls in effect they converted a field piece to a giant shotgun a great roar off to the right meant a yankee shell had found the limber that carried ammunition for one of the guns there jake was a stickler for making sure his crews didnt park the limbers too close to the guns and also that they built sandbag barricades between the ones and the others in case the shells went up such precautions did only so much good he hurried over panting like a dog the gun remained intact so did the loader and the assistant gun layer the rest of the crew was down dead or wounded weve still got enough men to fight this piece even if we have to haul ammo from the dump he looked around wheres the niggers who take care of the horses and do your cookin they can carry shells titus the gun layer shouted sulla no black men emerged he shook his head maybe they got it too or maybe theyre hidin somewheres and they aint comin out or else they took off runnin when the shelling started worthless bastards featherston snarled ignoring the possibility that the black men might be hurt or dead he pointed north toward the front niggers up therell run too you wait he would have elaboratedit was a theme on which he was always ready to elaboratebut more gas shells came in just then he smelled something horrible whatever it was the absorbent cartridge in his gas helmet did absolutely nothing to keep it out his guts knotted he gulped a moment later he tore off the gas helmet and was down on his hands and knees heaving as if hed drunk too much bad whiskey he wasnt the only one eitherboth the loader and the gun layer from the shattered crew vomited beside him puke gas the loader moaned between spasms damnyankees are shootin puke gas at us featherstons reply meant really i hadnt noticed but was rather more pungently phrased another salvo of gas shells burst on round hill jake spat foultasting slime from his mouth then sucked in a long painful breath the breath proved painful not only because hed just puked his guts up and felt as if hed heave some more his lungs burned he coughed and gagged and started to choke thats phosgene he wheezed and yanked the gas helmet over his head again but then he did have to vomit again he couldnt do it inside the gas helmet so he took it off if he inhaled enough phosgene to kill him while he was heavingwell he felt like dying anyhow he might have smoked a hundred packs of cigarettes in a minute and a half he gasped and choked and wondered if he would fall over right there the gun layer had his eyes were wide and staring his face went from purple toward black as he fought for air his lungs couldnt give him jake threw on the gas helmet he started to puke again but made himself keep things down even though he thought he would explode the gas helmet did hold out the phosgene and the yankees didnt send over any more shells full of vomiting gas or none that hit near him the loader on the gun with the wrecked limber was also down choking he wasnt so bad off as the gun layer but he was in no shape to fight either slowly staggering as he walked jake went back to his own piece a couple of its crewmen were heaving and choking too but the rest no matter what sort of anguish in which they found themselves kept on fighting the gun the range had shortened again too if the yankees hadnt gained a mile of ground since the attack started featherston would have been astonished and they were still coming on too some of their barrels had bogged down some were on fire but the ones that survived still moved like broadshouldered behemoths among the advancing infantry hunting out pockets of resistance and blasting them out of existence us artillery kept on pounding not only confederate guns but also the ground across which cs reserves had to come here and there along the line men in butternut were moving back not forward flesh and blood could bear only so much as the confederate troops retreated they entered the zone the us artillery was pounding behind the line they took casualties there serves you right you bastards featherston growled but the disorder and fear spreading through the retreating soldiers also infected the reserves who had been going forward whatever chance there might have been for a counterattack dissolved in growing horror and fury jake realized the front was not going to hold the army of northern virginia wouldnt lose a few hundred yards of ground to be regained later with bayonet and grenade this was going to be a bad defeat so bad probably that the battery would not be able to stay on round hill he went over to the two guns that were out of action and removed their sights and breech blocks which he threw into the limber for his own gun the yanks would get no use from the weapons they captured then he checked the horses that would have to pull away the four surviving cannon theyd come through everything better than hed dared hope if theyd gone down he would have had to disable all six field guns in the battery before withdrawing up round hill came the confederates whod run farthest and fastest most of those faces close enough now for him to see the fright on them were black behind the shield of the gas helmet his own face twisted into a savage grin canister he shouted scott loaded the round into the gun jake twisted the elevation screw to lower the piece as far as it would go he peered over open sights at the men in butternut heading his way what are you doing sarge scott asked fire featherston screamed and the loader obediently yanked the lanyard jake whooped to watch the colored cowards blown to bits another round of the same he cried and then fire he shook his fist at the black soldiers still on their feet in front of him you wont fight the damnyankees you shitty coons you got to deal with me he brought out the four surviving guns from the battery brought them out and brought them back to the new line the army of northern virginia was piecing together behind round hill as the day ended he shelled the first yankees coming over the hill he set two barrels on fire the us infantry drew back when fighting ebbed with the light he sat by a little fire too keyed up to sleep writing and writing in the gray eagle notebook lieutenant general george custer stood at the top of the ridge in front of white house tennessee the ridge the confederates had defended so long and so tenaciously back in the distant days of peace the ridge had been wooded nownow god might have intended it as a toothpick and splinter farm custer struck dramatic poses as automatically as his heart beat he struck one now for the benefit of the military correspondents who hovered close to hear what pearls of wisdom might drop from his lips from here gentlemen i can see the waters of the cumberland and nashville across the river from them he declared bombastically from here gentlemen i can seevictory the correspondents scribbled like men possessed major abner dowling turned away so no one would have to see his face from here gentlemen he thought i can see a fat pompous old fraud whos ever so much luckier than he deserves and who hasnt the faintest inkling how lucky he is he turned back toward the general commanding first army he still felt little but scorn for custers generalship but he was having a certain amount of trouble holding on to that scorn for the sake of his own peace of mind he worked at it but it wasnt easy truth was custer had gone far out on a limband taken dowling with himbacking a doctrine directly contrary to the one coming out of the war department truth was he had won a sizable victory here by going his own way truth was he could see nashville from where he stood and the guns of first army could hit nashville from near where he stood truth was the csa had left on this side of the cumberland only battered units falling back toward their crossings truth was custer as he had done in the war of secession and the second mexican war had somehow managed to make himself into a hero general weve been using barrels for a year now a reporter said why havent they done so well for us up till this latest battle they are a new thing in the world custer answered as with any new thing figuring out how best to employ them took a bit of doing he strutted and preened like a rooster displaying before hens i came up with the notion of using them as a mass rather than in driblets tried it out and the results were as you have seen dowling turned away again the really infuriating thing was that in boasting thus custer was for once telling the exact and literal truth from the minute hed first set eyes on barrels hed wanted to line them up in a great column and send them plowing straight into the enemy everyone had told him he couldnt do thatdoctrine forbade it hed gone ahead and done it anyhowand hed forced a breakthrough where there had been no such creature in going on three years of war there would be considerable wailing and gnashing of teeth in philadelphia on account of what hed done there already had been in fact custer had rubbed the war departments nose in the fact that it hadnt had the faintest idea what to do with barrels once it got them the only way a man got away with committing such a sin was to be proved extravagantly right custer had done that too another reporter spoke up having beaten the rebels once in this way general can we lick them again we are licking them custer said not only did first army smash them here in tennessee but i understand the fighting also goes well in virginia and that our forces may soon regain our nations capital from the enemys hands he struck another pose this was a remembrance day we and our enemies shall long remember dowling listened to that in something close to amazement custer must indeed have had a surfeit of glory if he was willing to share some with generals operating on other fronts he was in his own way a patriot maybe that accounted for it dowling couldnt think of anything else that would not quite what i meant sir the reporter said can we here in western tennessee strike the confederates another blow as strong as the one we just dealt them well why the devil not custer said grandly the correspondents laughed and clapped their hands without trying hard dowling could come up with half a dozen reasons why the devil not starting with the need to refit and reinforce the barrels and ending with the geography breaking through on the other side of the cumberland would be anything but easy it wasnt so great a river as the st lawrence which had bedeviled us strategy throughout the war but it was by no means inconsiderable either dowling wished custer wouldnt be so damned blithe and breezy custers adjutant wished any number of things about him none of which looked like coming true with a sigh dowling turned away from custer in doing so he bumped into a us officer of less exalted rank beg your pardon sir he said didnt see you were there till too late no damage done major lieutenant colonel irving morrell said dowling nodded his thanks having led the column of barrels that made the breakthrough morrell was in very good odor at first army headquarters im glad i found you he went on now i have an idea i want to put to you yes sir im listening dowling said even though morrell stood perfectly still before him the man seemed to quiver slightly as if he were a telegraph wire with a great many messages speeding back and forth on it dowling suspected he didnt have an ideaodds were he had a whole great flock of them each struggling against the others to be born major morrell said i think i know how we can secure a bridgehead on the far side of the cumberland you have my attention sir dowling said that was surely the problem custer would face when he was done celebrating the victory hed just achieved tell me how you would go about it dowling did not say he would give morrell custers ear if he liked the idea a man full of so many ideas would be able to figure that out for himself and morrell started to talk he wasnt a particularly fluent talker but he was extraordinarily lucid he had no bluster in him after years at general custers side that in itself made listening to him a pleasure for dowling it was no wonder the adjutant thought that custer and bluster rhymed morrell also knew what he was talking about again dowling suppressed any invidious comparisons with the general commanding first army morrell knew what resources first army had and what reinforcements it was likely to receive he knew what part of those could be committed to his scheme and he had as good a notion as a us soldier could of what the csa could bring to bear against them when he was through dowling paid him a high compliment this is no humbug he followed it with one he reckoned even higher anyone would think you were still on the general staff but morrell pursed his lips and shook his head i enjoy serving in the field too much to be happy in philadelphia major that he had in common with custer at least before custer had got old and plump and fragile dowling had questioned a great many things about custer but never his courage that courage was one of the things that led him to go after the enemy piledriver fashion it had led lieutenant colonel morrell in a different direction abner dowling glanced back toward custer his illustrious superior had begun to run out of bombast some of the correspondents were drifting off to write up their stories and wire them to their newspapers or magazines dowling didnt feel any great compunction about leading morrell through the knot of men around custer and saying excuse me general but this officer would like your opinion on something custer looked miffed he hadnt been completely finished but then he recognized the man at dowlings side ahlieutenant colonel morrell who so valiantly headed the column of barrels again he shared glory no matter how brightly a lieutenant colonel might be burnished he would never outshine a lieutenant general custer waved to the reporters go on boys business calls any time so gallant a soldier as this brave officer seeks my ear you may rest assured i am pleased to give it to him that made the gentlemen of the fourth estate pay more attention to morrell than they would have otherwise a photographer snapped his picture a sketch artist worked on a likeness till custer waved again imperiously this time the fellow closed the notebook and went off with morrell only half immortalized now then custer said what can i do for you lieutenant colonel i trust it is a matter of some importance or major dowling would not have interrupted me in the course of my remarks he gave his adjutant a veiled stare to let him know that was not forgotten dowling had no trouble bearing up under custers stares veiled or not sometimes he did have trouble not laughing in custers face but that was a different story anyhow veiled stare notwithstanding he thought custer would forget his pique this time with a nod to morrell he said go ahead sir morrell went ahead even more precisely than he had for dowling he set forth his idea for custer dowling intently watched the general commanding first army wondering how the old boy would take itit wasnt his usual cup of tea nor anything close custer didnt show much while morrell was talking how many hours on garrison duty here and there in the west had he spent behind a pile of poker chips enough to learn to hold his face still anyway when morrell was done custer stroked his peroxided mustache i shall have to give this further consideration lieutenant colonel but i can say now that you have plainly done some hard thinking here some solid thinking too unless i am much mistaken thank you sir morrell had the sense to stop there not to push custer for a greater commitment shall i begin converting this to a plan of operation sir dowling asked yes why not custer said artfully careless thegreatwar breakthroughs all the news is bad these days arthur mcgregor complained to his wife over a supper plate of fried chicken and fried potatoes more yankee lies i expect maude answered they dont let any of the truth get loose remember how many times their papers have said toronto has fallen or paris to the germans i dont think its like that this time mcgregor said those other stories you could tell they were made up what we hear nowthat nashville place getting knocked to bits and the americans pushing ahead on the border farther eastthose are the kinds of things that really do happen in a war theyre the kinds of things you have to believe when you read them but if you do believe them it means were losing the war his daughter julia said it means our allies are in trouble anyhow mcgregor said gravely he bit at the inside of his lower lip before going on i dont think were doing any too well here in canada either you can hardly hear the cannon fire up north toward winnipeg these days ever since the yanks had overrun his farm mcgregor had used the sound of the guns to gauge how the fighting was going when they were far away the yankees were making progress a deep rumble on the northern horizon meant an anglocanadian counteroffensive he wouldnt have minded in the least had shells fallen on his land that would have meant the yanks were pushed most of the way back toward dakota but it hadnt happened he was beginning to wonder if it ever would mary his younger daughter spoke with great certainty we cant lose the war were right they invaded us they had no business doing that she was only eight years old and still confused the way things should have been with the way they were mcgregor and maude looked at each other they both knew better they can mary her mother said we have to hope they dont thats all no they cant mary repeated they shot alexander if they win that meansthat means she cast about for the worst thing she could think of that means god doesnt love us any more god does what he wants mary mcgregor said he doesnt always do what we want if he did your brother would still be here and the yanks would be down in the usa where they belong if they win theyll try to turn us into americans julia said angrily theyre already trying to turn us into americans with american coins in his pocket with american stamps on his letters with american lies in the schoolsso many american lies neither julia nor mary went any moremcgregor could hardly disagree with her instead he said what we have to do is we have to remember who we are and what we are no matter what happens around us that may be the best we can do he felt maudes eyes on him again he needed a moment to understand why when he did his mouth tightened though hed spoken indirectly hed never come so close to admitting canada and her allies were losing the war his wife looked as grim as he did so did julia who now had nearly a womans years and had been thinking like an adult for a long time anyhow if mary didnt followmaybe that was just as well of them all mcgregor thought she was the fiercest one even including himself no matter how old she got he doubted she would ever slow down to count the cost before she acted he had to he hated himself for that but he had to after supper and after the girls had gone to bed he said to maude im going out to the barn ive got some work to take care of the only question maude asked was shall i wait up for you when he shook his head she came over and kissed him on the cheek he blinked they seldom showed affection for each other outside the bedroom he slapped at mosquitoes on the way to the barn crickets chirped frogs croaked and peeped in ponds and creeks and puddles spring was here he shook his head again spring was here and with it shorter nights he could have used the long blanket of dark winter gave but winter also gave a blanket of snow and snow unless it was falling hard or unless the wind was howling meant tracks he could not afford tracks the family had already lost alexander he knew how hard a time they would have if they lost him too counting the cost he muttered he did not fear death not for himself he feared it for the sake of those he loved mary would not have feared period he felt that in his bones it shamed him it drove him on he did not light a lantern in the garage the wooden box he sought was hidden but he knew where no yankees on the road would see any light and wonder about it he had to be careful he had to be careful about that road too he couldnt travel on it not unless he wanted to be challenged the box under his arm he approached the road he didnt approach too closely not till nobody was coming in either direction then he crossed in a hurry his neighbors farm had a path leading to the road just as his did his neighbors farm also had a path leading southeast toward another road an eastwest one not so frequently traveled by americans if the dog stayed quiet it would not disturb anyone in the dark quiet farmhouse the dog was quiet it had known him for years and knew him as well as it knew anyone outside its own family down that southeastern path he strode and onto that eastwest road east he muttered he had the road to himself alone with his thoughts not a safe place to be not with the thoughts filling his mind if he set the box down and stomped on it he would be alone with his thoughts forever that was tempting but he was not the sort of man to leave a thing half done whenever he passed a farmhouse he tensed making sure it had no lamps burning he did not want any wakeful soul noting the presence of a lone man on the road no one could recognize him not from those houses but someone might note the time at which he walked by or the direction in which he was going either could prove dangerous he heard a distant rattle on the road behind him looking back over his shoulder he saw tiny headlamps rapidly getting larger he stepped into the field by the roadside and lay down a ford whizzed past a ford painted some light color not the usual black a light color like greengray for instance christ let me be lucky he whispered let me catch the whore and the murderer both he waited till the motorcar had gone a good way down the road before getting up and following it the americans installed rearview mirrors on most of their motorcars he did not want whoever was in this onemajor hannebrinks name burned in his mindspotting him on he walked gauging time by the wheeling stars if he could keep on if he did not flag or falter he might do what he had come to do the next interesting question and one of whose answer he was not quite sure was whether the tooker family owned a dog he didnt really think so if he was wrong the best thing that could happen would be a long walk in the dark for nothing possibilities went downhill in a hurry from there a lamp went out downstairs lamplight showed a moment later in a room upstairs a bedroom mcgregor thought paulette tookers bedroom that she would do such a thing with an american major was bad enough that she would do such a thing and watch or even let him watch was depravity piled on depravity what if one of her children woke in the night her son if mcgregor remembered rightly was not far from julias ageold enough and to spare to despise what his mother didunless he was a collaborator too where was her husband was he dead was he captured was he still fighting for his country farther north mcgregor didnt know he wondered if paulette knew or cared that light would not go out mcgregor muttered under his breath what the devil was hannebrink doing in there driving railroad spikes mcgregor didnt dare approach the house as hed intended doing hannebrink had parked the ford a good distance away from the place though no doubt for discretions sake mcgregor wanted the man whod ordered his son killed far more than he wanted that mans canadian whore cautious as a man could be he went up to the motorcar the night smelled of fresh damp earth he took a trowel from his belt and began to dig in the fresh damp earth in front of the fords left front tire when hed dug enough he set the box in the hole covered it over and scattered the leftover dirt its volume had displaced then he headed home himself he got back just ahead of morning twilight a light was burning in a room upstairs in his farmhouse too when he went in he found maude sitting up in bed sewing breath gusted from her when she saw him is everything all right she demanded sharply everything is fine he answered you should have slept i tried she said i couldnt she shrugged about time to get up now anyhow one way or another well stagger through the day so long as everythings all right yes he said again even as he said it though he wondered he should have been able to hear the explosion even if the bomband the fordblew up when he was almost back here what the hell had hannebrink and paulette tooker been doing back at her house how long could they keep doing it he did get through the day moving like a man of ice only slightly thawed when night came he slept as hard as he had since he was marys age he wanted to go into rosenfeld to learn what if anything hed accomplished he refrained not wanting to draw notice to himself to how many people had henry gibbon given the name of hannebrinks paramour the more the better gossip brought word before he couldnt hold back any more and made a trip to town after supper while the girls were upstairs playing with dolls maude said della from across the road tells me lou tooker stepped on a bomb and there isnt going to be enough of him left to bury he waswhatfifteen maybe sixteen a bit younger than alexander mcgregor nodded thats going to be hard for paulette to bear eh almost as hard as it was for me when the yanks murdered my son he thought he wondered how hannebrink had missed setting off the bomb maybe hed backed the ford up to get back onto the road mcgregor shrugged however the us major had escaped paulette tooker wouldnt be inclined to open her legs for him not any more she wouldnt and sooner or later mcgregor would get another chance at major hannebrink he was in no hurry doing it right counted for more than doing it no he was in no hurry at all the us bombardment had been short but ferocious now engines bellowing several barrels waddled forward toward the barbed wire the men of the army of northern virginia had strung out to protect their positions in front of aldie virginia the wire shone in the earlymorning sun it was so newly in place it hadnt even started to rust whistles blew in the us trenches come on boys captain cremony shouted time to give the rebs another dose of medicine he was the first one out of the trench and heading toward the confederate lines sergeant chester martin nodded approval as he gathered his section by eye and led them up the sandbag staircase out of the protection of their hole in the ground and onto the stretch of open country where bullets could easily find them cremony hadnt made it sound like fun and it wouldnt be but he had made it sound like something that needed doing and he was leading the way hard to ask more than that of an officer come on martin shouted echoing the company commander he pointed to one of the barrels ahead form up behind that bastard you know the drill youd damn well better by now thats the truth sarge tilden russell said wasnt for those big ugly things thered be a hell of a lot fewer of us left after we went over the top in front of round hill martin nodded doubletiming despite heavy gear to get as close to the barrel as he could hed seen too much hard fighting on the roanoke front to have any doubts how much barrels were worth with them the unit had taken casualties yes casualties were one of the things war was about without barrels thoughwithout them the advance wouldnt have got a quarter as far and would have cost four times as much not all the confederates in those new trenches had been silenced rifle bullets whipped past martin he wasnt afraid he didnt know why but he wasnt before he went over the top yes when he had a chance to rest hed be afraid again for the time being he just went on like most infantrymen whatever was going to happen to him would happen and that was all there was to it confederate machine guns started yammering too the barrels opened up on them with cannon fire and their own machine guns the cs machine guns concentrated most of their fury on the barrels they always did that and it was a mistake they had very little chance of hurting the great armored machines and withheld their fire from the soft vulnerable men they could have harmed barbed wire underfootbarbed wire crushed into the dirt by the barrel ahead since the opening days of the war since us forces first pushed their way down into the roanoke valley martin had watched friends and comradesand enemy soldiers too in confederate counterattackstrap themselves on wire like flies in a spiderweb and writhe and twist till bullets found themand then briefly and painfully afterwards that would not happen here it would not happen now there was the battered parapet just ahead a black man with a rifle in his hands popped up onto the firing step ready to shoot at martin martin shot first from the hip it was not an aimed shot and he did not think it hit but it did what he wanted it to do it made the confederate soldier duck down again without shooting at him from short range a moment later martin was down in the trench himself the black man wasnt there hed fled from the firebay into a traverse martin did not charge after him he and who could guess how many pals were waiting fingers on the triggers of their tredegars charging headlong into a traverse after the enemy was anything but smart martin pulled a potatomasher grenade off his belt yanked off the cap at the end of the handle and tugged on the porcelain bead inside that ignited the fuse he flung the grenade up over the undug ground and into the traverse at the same time as his grenade went into the air a reb in the traverse threw one of their eggshaped models at him and his comrades someone behind him yelled in pain more grenades flew more shouts rose he and the men of his section couldnt stay where they were the attack had to move forward that meant he scowled even when it wasnt smart a headlong charge was sometimes the only choice left follow me he shouted his men did if they hadnt he would have died in the next minute as things were that next minute was an ugly business with rifle and entrenching tool and bayonet and a boot in the belly or the balls more us soldiers came around the corner than the rebs in the traverse could withstand the men in butternut went down most of the men in greengray went on through a zigzagging communications trench they ran deeper into the confederate position somewhere not far from the far end of that trench a machine gun stuttered out death the barrels had taken out a lot of machinegun positions but not all of them the guns that survived could wreak fearful havoc on advancing us soldiers with one accord martin and his section went hunting that machine gun and its crew the only soldiers who didnt hate machine guns were those who served them martins lips skinned back from his teeth there was the infernal machine blazing away toward the front from a nest of sandbags one white man fed belts of ammunition into it the other tapped the side of the water jacket every little while to change the direction of the stream of bullets the sandbags kept the confederates from bringing the gun to bear on martins men who approached from the side the gun crew kept firing till the last second at the us soldiers they could reach then they threw their hands in the air you got us the trigger man said sure as hell do the reb whod been feeding ammunition agreed chester martin shot one of them corporal bob reinholdt shot the other one at the same instant as the confederates crumpled the two men who despised each other both stared in surprise reinholdt found words first those sons of bitches cant quit that easy sure as hell cant martin agreed machinegun crews rarely made it back to prisonerofwar camps for some reason they always seemed to want to fight to the death up ahead the barrel leading the us infantry exploded into flames and smoke a shell from a confederate field gun had struck home hatches flew open some of the machine gunners tried to bring out their weapons and fight on the ground most of them though went down as every cs soldier anywhere nearby turned his rifle on the stricken traveling fortress the confederates loved barrel crewmen every bit as much as ordinary infantrymen on both sides loved the men who served machine guns after brief but heartfelt curses martin said things get tougher now i wonder where the hell the next barrel is at not close enough david hamburger said we should do it like they did in tennessee put all the barrels together smash on through the rebs lines and then let us tear the hole wide open thank you general tilden russell said he was ragging the kid but not too hard hamburger had given a good account of himself since the offensive opened he didnt have a veterans bag of tricks but he was brave and willing and learned in a hurry but russell had left the obvious line unused martin used it listen david you dont like the way were doing things you write your congresswoman and give her an earful he laughed i am doing that david hamburger said martin hadnt been serious but he was weve pushed the rebs back here but we havent broken through if it hadnt been for the river theyre hiding behind in tennessee theyd be running yet shells started landing around them they dove for cover jesus tilden russell shouted holding his helmet on his head with one hand god damn rebs still have soldiers of their own in this part of the trench what the hell are they doin shelling us like this here trying to kill us i expect martin answered i bet their artillery dont care a fuck if they kill a few of their own foot soldiers bob reinholdt added theyre all white men back therehe pointed south toward the confederate gunsbut half the bastards up here in the trenches are niggers probably just as glad to be rid of em hell i would be makes sense martin agreed after a moment adding the other thing to remember is theres no guarantee those were rebel shells they might have been ours falling short nobody said anything for a few seconds all the men in filthy greengray huddled there knew only too well that such things happened you were just as dead if a shell fragment from one of your own rounds got you as from confederate artillery whoever had fired it the salvo ended come on martin said even if the barrels dead weve got to keep going they had almost reached the far end of the network of trenches when confederate reservesblack men with white officers and noncomsbrought them to a standstill some of the black soldiers in butternut fired wildly and ran somemore than would have been true of white troopsthrew down their tredegars and surrendered first chance they got counting on either though was riskyno was deadly dangerous most of the black confederates fought as hard as white confederates with the rebel reinforcements in place martin didnt need long to figure out that he and his pals werent going to push much farther forward today he got the men busy with their entrenching tools and got busy with his own too turning shell holes and bits of northfacing trench into southfacing trench sighing he said we took a bite out of their line but we didnt slam on through it we need more barrels the hamburger kid said they can really smash trenches what else can bodies martin answered lots and lots of bodies anyone whod fought on the roanoke front whether in greengray or butternut would have said the same thing barrels work better david hamburger said and martin did not disagree with him hed seen too many piledup bodies anne colleton read through the columbia southern guardian with careful thoroughness over her morning eggs and coffee breakfast wasnt so good as it might have been shed made it herself after having servants cook for her almost her entire life her own culinary skills were slender but for the time while shed languished in a refugee camp during the red uprising shed have owned no culinary skills at all she hardly noticed shed got the eggs rubbery and the coffee strong enough to spit in her eye the southern guardian took most of her attention despite censors obfuscations and reporters resolute optimism the war news was bad it had been bad ever since the damnyankees opened their spring offensives in tennessee and virginia and maryland damn them she whispered then she said it out loud damn them the paper wasnt printing maps of the fighting in maryland and virginia any more anne had no trouble understanding why maps would have made obvious how far the army of northern virginia had fallen back unless you had an atlas you couldnt tell where places like sterling and arcola and aldiewhich had just fallen after what the southern guardian called fierce fightingwere but anne did have an atlas used it and didnt like what she was seeing what had her brother tom said that there were too many damnyankees to hold back virginia looked to be the usas attempt to prove it nashville though nashville had been something different the paper went on for a column and a half about the horrors the city was suffering under yankee bombardment anne scowled at the small type what was in there might well be true but it wasnt relevant if the line that held us guns out of range of the city hadnt collapsed it wouldnt be under bombardment now but that line which had held even under the heaviest pressure since the autumn before went down as if made of cardboard when the yankees hammered it with a horde of their barrels that hammering worried anne more than it seemed to worry the confederate war department us forces werent using their barrels like that anywhere else but if they did if they do theyre liable to break through again wherever it is anne said she could see that why couldnt they see it in richmond maybe they could see it maybe they simply didnt know what to do about it that possibility also left her unreassured she looked at her plate in some surprise realizing shed finished the eggs without noticing she sighed another day shed never felt so useless in all her life as she did here in st matthews now were she back at marshlands she would be fretting about the years cotton crop but there would be no cotton crop this year she dared not go back to the plantation that had been in her family for more than a hundred years her back stiffened no that wasnt true she dared to go back even if she would not have cared to spend the night there in fact she would go backwith militiamen and with a tredegar slung over her shoulder the plantation was ravaged it was ruined but it was hers and she would not tamely yield it to anyone or anything no sooner decided than begun she did not officially command the st matthews militia but she had enough power in this part of the countryenough power through most of south carolina as a matter of factthat within an hour she and half a dozen militiamen were rattling toward marshlands in a couple of ramshackle motorcars some of the militiamen wore old gray uniforms some new butternut some of the men were old tootoo old to be called into the army even during the present crisis at the front one a sergeant of her own age named willie metcalfe was a handsome fellow when viewed from the right the left side of his face was a slagged ruin of scars he wore a patch over what had been his left eye anne wondered why he bothered in that devastation who could have said for certain where his eye socket lay a couple of his comrades were surely less than eighteen and looked younger than annes telegraph delivery boy half a dozen miles made a twentyminute ride along the rutted dirt road between st matthews and marshlands it would have been twice that long if one of the motorcars had had a puncture but they were lucky when willie metcalfewho predictably was driving in the lead automobile to avoid displaying his wrecked profile for a whilestarted to pull into the driveway that led to the ruins of the marshlands mansion anne spoke up sharply no wait stop the motorcar here and pull off to the side of the road yes maam sergeant metcalfes voice was mushy the inside of his mouth was probably as ravaged as the rest of that side of his face but he said the words as he would have said yes sir to a superior officer and obeyed as promptly too the other motorcar followed his lead because she hadnt had to shout at him as shed had to shout at so many men in her life she deigned to explain the only motorcars likely to come here will have white people in themprobably white soldiers in them what better place to hide a bomb than in the driveway there metcalfe thought for a moment then nodded that makes sense he said that makes a lot of sense linus ashworth who with his white beard looked a little like general lee and was almost old enough to have fought under him said we aint likely to be bringing niggers into the militia any time soon not when were chasin em and i dont give ahoot what the army does he got out of the automobile and spat a stream of tobacco juice into the lush grass a brown drop slid down that white beard a yellow streak in it said that sort of thing happened to him all the time anne and the militiamen advanced on the wreckage of the marshlands mansion in what metcalfe called a skirmish line he unobtrusively took the left end they all had a round in the chamber of their tredegars anne didnt expect any trouble the red rebels shouldnt have known she was on the way to marshlands she herself hadnt known she would be till not long before she was but taking chances wasnt a good idea linus ashworth spat again its a shame maam he said purely a shame i seen this place when it was like what its supposed to be and there wasnt no finer plantation in the state of south carolina god strike me dead if i lie yes anne said tightly ashworth had seen marshlands before the war but shed lived here coming back after the men of the congaree socialist republic were driven back into the riverside swamps had been hard enough coming back now now the marshlands plantation wasnt ruined as it had been then now it was dead the cabin where shed lived after the mansion burned was itself charred wreckage the rest of the cabins that had housed the negro field hands were deserted glass gone from the windows doors hanging open because nothing inside was worth stealing one door had fallen off its hinges and leaned at a drunken angle against the clapboard wall white bird droppings streaked the doors green paint anne looked out to what had been and what should have been broad acres of growing cotton weeds choked the fields no crop this year no chance of getting a crop this year even if she could find hands who would work for her and not for cassius and cherry and the rest of the redsand good luck with that too no money coming in from marshlands this year but the money would keep right on bleeding out war taxes outrageous wasnt nearly a strong enough word her investments had kept her afloat so far but they were tottering too this here is sad maam sergeant willie metcalfe said this here is really sad just for a moment he raised a hand to the black cord that held his patch this here place got hurt the same way i did yes it did anne said she would notshe would notlet him hear the tears in her voice and then she forgot about tears because something moved up ahead she was on the ground her rifle aimed before she knew how shed got there a couple of the young militiamen stood gaping for a few seconds the others the men who had seen combat of one sort or another were on their bellies like her offering targets as small as they could come out metcalfe shouted come out right now or youre dead anne wasnt even sure shed seen a human being motion where nothing had any business moving had been plenty to send her diving to the ground she wondered if theyd have to go hunting through the field hands cottages if the reds had come back for some reason that might not be any fun at all but why would the reds come back to marshlands she thought trying to reassure herself it wasnt as if she had any treasure buried on the plantation to tempt them if shed had anything like that she would long since have dug it up herself then anticlimax almost made her burst out laughing from around the corner of the nearest cabin came a pickaninny a negro girl ten or eleven years old after a moment anne recognized her what are you doing sneaking around this place vipsy she demanded you almost got shot is jus lookin fo whatever i kin find vipsy answered artlesslyso artlessly annes suspicions kindled where are you staying these days vipsy she asked theres nothing for your father and mother to do at marshlands now vipsy pointed northward toward the congaree over yonder where is at she answered how far over yonder anne wondered all the way into the swamp are your father and mother reds if they wereshe looked down at the ground so the colored girl would not see her smile all right go on your way she said when she looked up again im just glad you werent coming around sniffing after the treasure if you were we would have had to shoot you don know nothin bout no treasure vipsy said and strolled off with as much dignity as if she wore a gingham frock rather than a dress cut from a grimy burlap bag the next trick of course would be convincing the militiamen she had no treasure buried here at marshlands if she couldnt do that half the people in st matthews would be out here by day after tomorrow at the latest all of them armed with picks and shovels but if she could persuade the militiamenwell something useful might come from that gordon mcsweeney walked up to captain schneider after saluting the company commander he said sir i wish you wouldnt have done what you did schneider frowned im sorry mcsweeney but i dont see that you left me any choice in the matter but except when discussing matters of religion mcsweeney was not a particularly eloquent man he touched the top of his shoulder and the new shoulder strap sewn onto his tunic no insigne marked the strap but its mere presence disturbed him sir i dont want to be an officer he burst out believe me second lieutenants barely deserve the name captain schneider answered with a wry chuckle i was comfortable as a sergeant sir mcsweeney said i wasi was happy as a sergeant it was as far as he could recall the first time in his life hed ever admitted being happy about anything if you go on with this lieutenant mcsweeneyschneider bore down on the titleyou will make me angrybut not angry enough to bust you back to sergeant if thats whats on your mind he paused to roll a cigarette once hed sucked in smoke he went on god damn it mcsweeney look at it from my point of view what the hell am i supposed to do with you sir you could haveyou should haveleft me where i was mcsweeney answered that was all i expected that was all i wanted for some reason he did not fathom captain schneider looked exasperated seeing he did not fathom it schneider spelled it out in words of one syllable you are wearing the ribbon for one medal of honor god knows you deserve an oakleaf cluster to go with it for what you did to that machinegun position but the war department would think i was shellshocked if i put you up for it twice no matter how much you deserve it any lesser medal fails to do you justice what choice did i have but promoting you i didnt do what i did for glory sir mcsweeney answered deeply embarrassed i did it because it was my duty schneider studied him slowly slowly the company commander blew out a long gray cloud of smoke you mean that he said at last of course i do mcsweeney was embarrassed again in a different way i always mean what i say after another long pause captain schneider said you may be the most frightening man i have ever met only to the enemies of god and the united states of america sir schneider suddenly snapped his fingers i know part of whats troubling you damn me to hell if i dont if he kept talking like that mcsweeney was sure god would damn him to hell but however harsh he was to those under him mcsweeney could not and never would reprove his superiors schneider continued you dont want to give your flamethrower to anybody else mcsweeney looked down at the muddy ground under his feet he hadnt thought captain schneider would be able to read him so well now it was his turn to hesitate finally he said when i carry it i feel myself to be like the fourth angel of the lord in revelations who pours out his bowl on the sun and scorches the wicked with fire hmm schneider scratched his chin stubble rasped under his fingernails tell you what mcsweeney think of it like this youre not the only one in this war were all scorching the rebs together and it doesnt matter whether weve got rifles or s or flamethrowers hows that sir when the good book speaks of searing those who curse gods name i believe it means what it saysno more no less mcsweeney replied of course you do schneider muttered he paused to sigh and to stamp the butt of his cigarette into the dirt well were going to make it hot for the rebs all right theyre going to take us out of the line here and put fresh troops in our place to hold we shift to the right about five miles over and do what sir mcsweeney asked theres about a square mile of woods thereits called craighead forest on the map schneider answered if we can push the confederates out of it we outflank em and we may be able to shove em clean out of jonesboro so long as were fighting sir it suits me mcsweeney said well it doesnt suit me not for hell it doesnt the company commander told him we havent got the barrels to go in there and do the dirty work for us the way they do on the other side of the mississippi we have to take that forest the old way the hard way and its going to be expensive as the devil where i go my men will follow and i will go into that wood mcsweeney said positively schneider looked at him shook his head and went off down the trench still shaking it replacements began filing into the line that afternoon under desultory confederate shelling they were cleanfaced neatly shaven men in clean uniforms they seemed present in preposterous numbers for action had not thinned their ranks faster than replacements could refill them they stared at the lean grimy veterans whose trenches they were taking over gordon mcsweeney was far from the only veteran to stare back in cold contempt he led the platoon he did not want down a series of winding tracks shieldedbut not too wellfrom enemy observation a few shells fell around them a couple of men were wounded stretcherbearers carried them back toward dressing stations but for the wounded men nobody thought it anything out of the ordinary up through the zigzags of communications trenches they went mcsweeney stared ahead toward the wood of pine and oak fighting there hadnt been heavy not till now most of the trees were still standing not lying smashed and scattered like a petulant giants game of pickupsticks under those trees men in butternut waited in foxholes and in trenches much like these between the us line and the edge of the wood lay a few hundred yards of low grass and bushes all bright green tomorrow morning tomorrow morning uh sir ben carlton said to mcsweeney a lot of us are going to end up dead mcsweeney gave the cook a cold look take it up with the lord not with me i am going forward so are you god will choose who lives and dies carlton went off muttering to himself mcsweeney checked his rifle read his bible rolled himself in his blanket and slept the sleep of an innocent man the us bombardment blasted him awake a little before dawn he nodded his approval short and sharpthat was the way to do it a weeklong bombardment only gave the rebs a week to get ready and didnt kill nearly enough of them to be worth that whistles blew up and down the line come on you lugs mcsweeney shouted follow me ill be the one they shoot at first i promise you with that encouragement he led his platoon over the parapet and through the grass toward the edge of the now more battered wood from which little winking lightsthe muzzle flashes of machine guns and tredegarsbegan to appear bullets clipped leaves from bushes and stirred the tall blades of grass almost as a stick might have done by sections mcsweeney yelled fire and move half the men he led went down though only a few had been shot the ones on their knees and bellies blazed away to cover the advance of the rest after a rush the men ahead hit the dirt and fired while the former laggards rose and dashed past them they took casualties had it not been for their tacticsand for the artillery still falling in the woods knocking over trees fast enough to make paul bunyan jealousthey would have taken more but the survivors kept going forward in ragged waves several bullets cracked past gordon mcsweeney close enough for him to feel the wind of their passage one brushed at his sleeve so that he looked over to see if a comrade close by was tugging his arm seeing no one close by he realized what must have happened thank you lord for sparing me he murmured and ran on then he was in among the trees the covering barrage moved deeper into craighead forest leaving it up to the men in greengray to finish dealing with the men in butternut it had not killed or maimed the confederates were there in distressing numbers they knew as us soldiers knew how to lessen the damage artillery did that left hard hot work to do manynot allof the cs machinegun crews stayed at their guns even after us soldiers had got by them on either flank lingering to do their foes as much harm as they could before they were slain they were brave men brave as any in greengray mcsweeney knew as much hed known as much since the day he crossed the ohio into kentucky the egyptians who followed pharaoh into the opening in the red sea after the children of israel surely were brave men he muttered the lord let the red sea close on them even so because they were wicked confederates fired from behind and from under trees snipers fired from in the trees the rebels fought from their trenches they popped up out of foxholes sometimes they hid till several us soldiers had passed them then turned around and fired at their backs mcsweeney had blood on his bayonet before he was a hundred yards into the woods hed been changing clips when a confederate soldier lunged at him how the reb had screamed when the point went into his belly he would scream like that forever in hell schneiders down somebody shouted mcsweeney waited for one of the other lieutenants all of them senior to him to start directing the company none of them did maybe they were down too he shouted orders driving the men on he was loud and sounded sure of what he was doing the next best thing to being sure of what he was doing forming any firm line in the forest was impossible the confederates kept filtering past the us forward positions and raising cain they knew the woods better than their foessome of them had probably hunted squirrels and coons through these treesand did not mean to lose them here mcsweeney threw aside the bodies of two rebs from the machine gun at which theyd fallen he grabbed a couple of his own men and turned the machine gun around if you see any of those miscreants shoot them down miscrewhats sir one of them shouted at him confederates he answered which satisfied the soldier he and his pal wouldnt be so good as a properly trained crew but they would be better than nothing for as long as their ammunition held out mcsweeney did that several more times getting firepower any way he could us machine guns started coming forward into craighead forest too by nightfall most of it was in us hands though confederate cannon kept shelling the woods their side had held when day began maybe the men in greengray would be able to mount a flank attack on jonesboro afterwards maybe not mcsweeney couldnt tell he didnt care not too much hed done his job and done it well scipio squatted on his heels in the mud by the congaree river reading a newspaper one of the black fighters of what still called itself the congaree socialist republic had brought back from a fort motte park bench going into a town was dangerous actually buying a newspaper from a white man would have been suicidally dangerous do jesus scipio said looking up from the small print that gave him more trouble than it had a few years before sound like the yankees is kickin we where it hurt the most cassius was gutting catfish hed pulled out of the muddy river when they were fried they would taste of mud too cassius threw offal into the river before cocking his head to one side and giving scipio a glance from the corner of his eye them yankees aint kickin we kip he said at last scipio snorted don tell me you believes we gwine lick they any day now an we jus fallin back to fool they de papers prints de lies like that to keep de stupid buckra happy i knows it cassius answered calmly de lies makes de buckra mo and mo stupid too but kip you gots to recollectde congaree socialist republic aint at war wid de united states the confederate states they is at war but you aint no confederate citizen now is you never was aint never gwine be this here the onliest country you gots kip instead of answering scipio buried his nose in the newspaper again he did not trust himself to keep from saying what he really thought if he spoke at all since he would surely be shot the moment he did shot and tossed in the river like catfish guts he thought silence the wiser course a country a country of mud and weeds and muddy water and stinks and furtive skulking and shells falling out of the sky whenever the militia managed to lay their hands on some ammunition a country surrounded by a real country intent on wiping it from the face of the earth a country that existed more in cassius imagination than in the real world we is the free mens cassius said the pressors o de world got no power here methodically he gutted another fish cherry came striding up in her tattered trousers she moved like a free woman or perhaps more like a catamount graceful and dangerous at the same time scipio could readily understand how shed enthralled jacob colleton she didnt just smolder she blazed now she squatted down beside cassius and said what you think o dis story vipsy bring back from marshlands woman you knows what i thinks cassius answered impatiently i thinks miss anne bait a trap fo we i thinks i aint gwine be foolish enough to put this here headhe tapped it almost as if to suggest he had another one stored somewhere not far awayin de noose cherrys lips skinned back from her white teeth in a hungry smile but if it so cass if it so an we can git our hands on de treasure but it aint an you knows it aint same as i knows it aint cassius said his voice still goodnatured but with iron underneath how you know that for a fac cherry demanded you was a hunter you wasnt into the mansion all de time no moren me cassius pointed at scipio as scipio had known he would dis nigger here he know if anybody do kip you tell cherry what you done tol her before see if maybe she listen dis time damn stubborn gal scipio found himself longing for the polite precise formality of the english hed spoken as anne colletons butler he could have disagreed without offending much more readily in that dialect than in the speech of the congaree cassius he right he said as placatingly as he couldhe might have been more afraid of cherry than of cassius aint no treasure how you know dat cherry snapped how kin you know dat miss anne she one white debbil bit of a pressor but she one sly white debbil bitch too couldnt never git away from we las christmas she werent one sly white debbil bitch in the other english the english he spoke no more scipio would have talked about probabilities and about the impossibility of proving a negative he could not do that in the dialect of the congaree instead at last losing his temper he answered i knows miss annes business bettern any other marshlands nigger and i says there aint no treasure you wants to go lookin fo what aint dere go on ahead an if de buckra wid de guns blows yo stupid head off cause they layin fo you like you was a deer don you come back here cryin afterwards cherrys eyes blazed her high cheekbones and narrow delicate chin told of indian blood now she looked as if she wanted to take scipios scalp her voice was deadly an when i comes back wid de money drag you down an cut your balls offor i would if i reckoned you gots any easy gal easy cassius said sometimes scipio thought cherry alarmed the hunter who led the reds too cherry had not an ounce not a speck of give anywhere about her splendidly shaped person cassius went on you make a man fraid to tell you de truth or what he reckon de truth sooner o later you gwine be sorry you done it cherry tossed her head in a gesture of magnificent contempt scipio had seen from her many times before pointing to him she said he don need me to make he afraid he wish he was still miss annes house nigger still miss annes lapdog she spat on the ground between scipios feet scipio violently shook his head the more violently because she told nothing but the truth hed never wanted anything to do with the revolutionary movement partly because of a suspicionan accurate suspicion as things turned outthe red revolt would fail partly because he had indeed been comfortable in the life he was living at marshlands hed always assumed that if anyone in power among the revolutionaries learned as much he was a dead man but then cassius said i knows dat we all knows dat de lap dog like de sof pillow an de fancy meat in de rubber dish he caint hep it right then scipio was glad of his dark dark skin no one could see the flush that made him feel he was burning up inside he schooled his features to the impassivity required of a butler let no one know what you are thinking hed had that beaten into him in his training it served him in good stead now cassius went on but kip he keep he mouf shut he don never say boo to miss anne bout we de proletariat dey gots nuffing to lose in de revolution kip he gots plenty to lose an he wid us anyways if dat don make he a hero o de revolution you tell me what do cherry tossed her head again shit he jus too fraid to betray we he know how he pay fo dat she was right again fortunately for scipio cassius didnt think so the hunter said he have plenty chances to give we away an git away clean an he never done it he wid us cherry he aint cherry said positively miss anne spread she legs he come runnin to lick dat pussy wid de yellow hair same as he always done liar scipio shouted now a mixture of horror embarrassment and fury in his voice only after that anguished cry passed his lips did he realize she might have been using a metaphor if a crude one part of the embarrassment he realized with a different kind of horror was that anne colleton was beautiful and desirable but a black man who was found out looking on a white woman with desire in the csa was as surely dead as one who betrayed the revolutionary movement even cassius looked distressed enough cherry he said sharply you gots no cause to rip he to pieces dat way got plenty cause cherry retorted an when i comes back with the treasure cass we see who am de genl sectary o de congaree socialist republic after dat she stalked off cassius sighed dat one hard woman aint nobody gwine stop sheshe gwine try an fin dat treasure an it dont matter if it aint there she try anyways she gwine get herself killed scipio said she gwine get whoever go wid she killed too i knows it cassius said unhappily i aint no fool an i werent borned yesterday but how is i sposed to stop she if i shoot she wid my own gun she dead tooan dat bitch liable to shoot first i done told her don go but she don listen to what i say he sighed again a leader hard aground on the shoals of leadership i brings her up befo de revolutionary tribunal they liable to do like she say not like i say dere some stubborn revolutionary niggers on de tribunal i oughts to know i put em dere my ownself maybe you jus let she go then scipio said maybe you jus let she go an get herself killed his voice turned savage maybe dat jus what she deserve if he could find a way to get a message to anne colleton letting her know when cherry was going to try to plunder marshlands he would do it and it would be a true message too lettinghelpingone of the women whod made the past year and a half of his life a nightmare dispose of the other had a sweet ring of poetic justice to it but cassius was watching him with those hunters eyes somebody was watching him all the time the surviving revolutionaries did not altogether trust him they had good reason not to trust him casually as if he werent thinking at all he took from his belt a tin cup that had once belonged to a confederate soldier now surely dead he dipped up water from the river and drank the water tasted of mud too only because hed grown up in a slave cabin not far away could he drink it without having his guts turn inside out cherry and half a dozen men went treasure hunting the next day cassius watched them go with a scowl on his face if by some accident vipsy had been telling the truth if by some accident miss anne had done something of which scipio was ignorant cassius place at the head of the congaree socialist republic was indeed in danger could the red rebels survive a leadership struggle scipio had his doubts but cherry came back after sundown emptyhanded scipio had hoped she wouldnt come back at all the glower she aimed at him almost made her return worthwhile though he concentrated on his bowl of stewturtle and roots and other things he ate and tried not to think about i knows dat treasure there cherry said is gwine find it i aint done dont nobody think is done she glared at scipio at cassius at everyone but the men whod followed her scipio wore his butlers mask behind it he kept on trying to figure out how to get a message to anne colleton marie galtier held out a tray loaded with stewed chicken to dr leonard odoull odoull held up both hands palms out as if warding off attack merci mme galtier but mercy too i beg you he said one more drumstick and i think ill grow feathers marie sniffed i do not see how you could grow feathers when you do not eat enough to keep a bird alive mother nicole said reprovingly and marie relented dr odoull looked over to lucien galtier seeing how she feeds you it is to me a matter of amazement that you do not weigh three hundred pounds our father is very light for his weight georges said before lucien could answer in the same way that you my son are very foolish for your brains galtier said and managed to feel he had got a draw with his son if not a win over him serious as usual charles galtier asked is it true monsieur le docteur that us forces continue their advance against quebec city yes from what i hear at the hospital that is true dr odoull told galtiers elder son is it also true that fighting alongside the forces of the united states is a corps from the soidisant republic of quebec charles asked charles lucien murmured warningly speaking of it as the socalled republic of quebec before an american one of the people who called it that was something less than the wisest thing his son might have done but leonard odoull fortunately took no offense not a corps certainly for there are not nearly enough volunteers for a quebecois corps he replied but a regiment perhaps two regiments of quebecois from the republicyes i know they are in the line for i have treated some of their wounded being called upon to do so because i am lucky enough to speak french it was a straightforward reasonable matteroffact answer lucien waited with some anxiety to hear how his son replied to it if charles denounced the republic life could grow difficult but charles said only i do not see how quebecois could volunteer to fight quebecois in the war of secession brother fought brother in the united stateswhat was the united states odoull said it is not an easy time when such things happen but no one outside created the confederate states nestce pas charles said doggedly refusing to let go they came into being of themselves to luciens relief his son once more failed to get a rise out of dr odoull perhaps at the beginning yes the american said but england and france have helped prop them up ever since now though the props begin to totter charles could have said something like just as the united states prop up the republic of quebec but odoull made it plain he was likely to agree with a statement like that not argue with it that took halfmore than halfthe fun away from making it to his fathers relief charles kept quiet after marie nicole susanne denise and jeanne cleared the plates away from the supper table lucien got out a bottle of the homemade apple brandy that helped keep nights warm in quebec is it possible m galtier that i might talk to you alone dr odoull asked staring at the pale yellow liquid in the glass in front of him as if he had never seen it before luciens head came up alertly charles and georges looked at each other well i can tell when i am not wanted georges said and stomped upstairs in exaggerated outrage charles said nothing he simply rose nodded to odoull and left the dining room and for what purpose is it that you desire to talk to me alone dr odoull galtier said also examining his applejack with a critical eye he could without much difficulty think of one possible reason and that proved to be the reason dr leonard odoull had in mind the american physician took a deep breath then spoke rapidly m galtier i desire to marry your daughter and i would like your blessing for the match galtier lifted his glass and knocked back the applejack in one long fiery gulp no odoulls words were not a surprise but they were a shock nonetheless instead of answering straight out in brusque american fashion the farmer returned a question you have i take it had somewhat to say of this matter with nicole oh yes i have done that dr odoulls voice was dry i will tell you sir she likes the idea if you will give your approval and why would she not galtier replied you are a personable man you are a reasonable figure of a man and you are skilled in your profession as i have reason to know he patted the leg odoull had sewn up but even so before i say yes or no there are some things i must learn for example suppose that you marry her where would you live when the war ends would you take her back to the united states as a matter of fact i was thinking of setting up shop in riviereduloup odoull answered ive been asking around when i go up into town and you folks here can use a good surgeon i am a good surgeon m galtier any doctor who works in a military hospital turns into a good surgeon because he has so many chances to practice his trade he gulped down his own applejack then muttered in english damn the war you would speak french then and mostly forget your own language exceptgaltiers eyes twinkledwhen you need to swear perhaps i would odoull said i speak french better than many people who come to the united states speak english they do well enough in my country i should be able to do well enough in yours i think you have reason there galtier said that you can do this i do not doubt the question i was asking was whether you were willing to do it and i see you are and you are a catholic man that i have known for long and long yes i am a catholic man odoull said i am not a perfectly pious man but i am a catholic the only man i know who believes himself to be perfectly pious is bishop pascal galtier said bishop pascal is surely very pious as he is very clever but he is neither so pious nor so clever as he believes himself to be there i think you have reason m galtier leonard odoull said chuckling he blinked a couple of times if a man drank apple brandy when he was tired it hit even harder than usual after a moments thought he went on may i now tell you something to help you decide speak galtier urged say what is in your mind nowhat is in my heart odoull replied what i want to tell you is that i love your daughter and i will do everything i can to take care of her and make her as happy as i can well lucien galtier said and then again well he picked up the bottle of applejack and poured a hefty dollop for dr odoull and another for himself he raised his glass in salute i look forward to my grandchildren odoulls long face was normally serious almost to somberness galtier had not imagined such a wide smile could spread over it as happened when the doctor understood his words still smiling that broad smile dr odoull reached out and shook his hand the doctors skin was soft uncallused from manual labor but not smoothpoisons to kill germs had left it rough and red thank you my fatherinlaw to be odoull said thank you now you make me feel old galtier said in mock severity he raised his glass let us drink and then let us tell the rest of the familyif nicole has not already done as much in the kitchen only as the brandy slid warmly down his throat did he reflect on how after the united states had overrun his country he had been certainhe had been more than certain he had been resolvedhe would hate the invaders forever and now his daughter was going to marry an american he had just given permission for his daughter to marry an american he shook his head life proved stranger than anyone could imagine when he called his wife and daughters flew out of the kitchen and his sons came leaping down the stairs like mountain goats they might not know what he would say but they knew what he was going to talk about he got up walked over to leonard odoull and set a hand on his shoulder we are going to have in our family a new member he said simply our friend monsieur le docteur odoull has asked of me permission to marry nicole and i have given to him that permission and my blessing he remembered then that odoull had not asked for permission only his blessing he wondered what would have happened had he refused it would odoull have done something foolish would nicole he had no way of finding out now perhapsno probablythat was just as well and then he forgot about mighthavebeens because nicole squealed with joy and threw herself into his arms her three little sisters squealed with excitement and started jumping up and down charles and georges went over to odoull and pounded him on the back that charles did so rather surprising lucien and marie squeezed between them to kiss the american doctor on the cheek thank you papa thank you nicole said over and over he patted her on the back do not thank me now my little one he said if you thank me ten years from now if you thank me twenty years from now if le bon dieu permits me to remain in this world so that you may thank me thirty years from now that will be very good if i want to thank you now i am going to thank you now nicole said so there to prove it she kissed him he glanced over to odoull one eyebrow upraised see how disobedient she is he said you should know what you are getting into ill take my chances odoull said with a laugh and we will at last get our older sister out of the house georges said if the dance he and charles danced wasnt one of delight it made an excellent counterfeit galtier waited for nicole to explode into fury it didnt happen she said this is the happiest day of my life and i am not going to let my two foolish brothers ruin it for me the happiest day of my life when the usa first invaded quebec galtier had never imagined those words in connection with an american now nicole spoke them altogether without selfconsciousness and now he did not explode into fury on hearing them he poured himself more applejack to serve as a shield against strangeness thegreatwar breakthroughs well edna nellie semphroch said with a groan i wish youd married that rebel officer and moved away from here the way you were talking about so do i ma her daughter moaned oh jesus christ so do i they were not angry at each other not for the moment what sounded like a thunderstorm raged outside it was not a thunderstorm it was worse much worse if youd gone somewhere far away youd be safe now nellie said you aint safe here nobodys safe in washington not any more two candles lit the cellar under the coffeehouse from which nellie had made so much during the war every few seconds another us shell would crash down and the candlesticks would shake and the flames jerk every so oftenfar more often than nellies frazzled nerves could readily beara shell would land close by or a round from a big gun would hit a little farther off then the candlesticks would jump and the flames leap and swoop wildly a couple of times nellie had to move like lightning to keep the candlesticks from falling over and the candles from starting a fire if a big shell came down on the coffeehouseif a big shell came down on the coffeehouse it would pierce the roof and then the ceiling of the first story and then the floor every one of them as if it werent there at all those shells shed heard had special hard noses to smash their way even into concrete installations if one of them exploded in the cellarwell she and edna would never know what hit them and that she had seen was in its own way a mercy a heavy shell thudded home the ground shook as if in an earthquake or so nellie imagined shed never felt a real earthquake edna started to cry god god ma she wailed this here is the capital of the united states what the hell is the us army doing blowing the capital of their own goddamn country to pieces if the rebs would have left if they would have said washington was an open city and pulled back over the potomac into virginia this never would have happened her mother answered but they keep going on about how washington is theirs and they built all those forts on the high ground north of townbuilt em or took over the ones we madeand so this is what happens on account of it edna was not inclined to argue politics shed wanted to marry lieutenant nicholas h kincaid for his personal charms not out of sympathy for the confederate states of america falling in love with him that was what edna called it though to nellie it had never looked like anything but an itch in the privates had made her more sympathetic to the csa but not all that much more one of the candles burned out making the cellar even gloomier and filling it with the greasy stink of hot tallow edna lighted a fresh candle from the one still burning and stuck it in its candlestick the flickering flames filled her face with shadows making her look far older than her years ma she began and then hesitated what is it nellie asked warily these days that kind of stuttering led only to trouble sure enough when edna resumed it was to ask ma why do you suppose that bill reach yelled for everybody to get out of the church just when the yanksuh the armywere gettin ready to start shooting at washington i dont know nellies voice was tight i dont care i wish id never set eyes on bill reach not a long time ago and not now either she waited for her daughter to bait her about the strumpets life shed led but ednas mind for once turned in a different direction how do you suppose he knew ma how could he have known the army was going to open up on us right then i couldnt begin to tell you nellie answered that didnt mean she didnt know as she hoped edna would think it would it meant only what it said that she couldnt tell but edna despite being wild for life was not a fool in matters unrelated to large handsome emptyheaded men he couldnt have known ma she insisted not if hes just a drunken bum only thing a drunken bum cares about is his next bottle only way he could have known she drew in a sharp excited breath ma the only way he could have known is if hes a spy edna had hit the nail on the head she didnt realize that hitting the nail on the head endangered not only bill reachwho in nellies view deserved all the danger he could find and then somebut also hal jacobs and nellie herself with a sniff nellie said anyone whod hire that louse to spy for him would have to be pretty hard up if you want to know what i think that was true hal jacobs now was sober and sensiblesensible enough to stay sober too nellie could see him as a spy why reach never started babbling about what he knew to everyone around him when he got drunk was beyond her edna said but he couldnt be anything else ma he knew somebody must have told him i wouldnt want to tell bill reach anything except where to head in nellie said grimly and anybody else who would want to is a fool like i said before i dont know what he might have heard while he was laying in the gutter and i dont want to know either for a wonder edna subsided the bombardment didnt the us army seemed intent on killing every confederate in washington dc if that meant killing all the us citizens left in the tortured city too well fair enough for varietys sake perhaps bombing aeroplanes roared overhead and dropped long strings of explosives that made the candlesticks quiver as if they were in torment along with everything else in town at last hours later a lull came lets go up and cook something to eat nellie said then if they havent started up again by the time were through i think ill scurry across the street and see how mr jacobs is getting along all right ma you go ahead and do that edna said but without the viciousness that would have informed the words before the disaster of her wedding losing her fiance on what would have been their wedding day had taken a lot of the starch out of her it was dark in the coffeehouse too night outside with a few strips and circles of moonlight sliding through holes shell fragments had punched in the boards that covered the window opening the gas had gone out as soon as us shelling started which was sensible of the confederate authorities but made life no easier edna scooped coal into the firebox of the stove and got a fire going i hope this beefsteak is still good nellie muttered sniffing at it as she took it out of the icebox she sighed you may as well cook it up because it wont be any better tomorrow god only knows when well have the chance to get ice again edna fried it in an iron spider it tasted a little gamy but not too bad but when edna turned the tap to get water to make coffee nothing came out the rebs wouldnt have shut off the water she said they couldnt put out any fires if they did a shell must have broken a pipe somewhere not far away nellie said if the water doesnt come back on soon well have to carry it back from the river in a bucket and boil it that will be dangerous if the shelling keeps up like this oh well edna tried to make the best of things if there aint no water i cant very well do dishes now can i im going across the street nellie said and her daughter nodded when nellie opened the door and inhaled she coughed the air was thick with smoke a lot of the things that could burn in washington were burning here and there in the near and middle distance orange flames flickered and leaped nellie was not supposed to be on the street after dusk a confederate patrol that spied her was as likely as not to shoot first and ask questions later but she didnt think she would be spotted and she wasnt when she opened the door to hal jacobs cobblers shop the bell over it jangled as if cheerily announcing a customer jacobs looked up candlelight exaggerating the surprise on his face the two men huddled with him also looked startled one was lou pfeiffer a pigeon fancier who used his birds to carry messages out of washington the other to nellies horrified dismay was bill reach i came to check and make sure you were all right mr jacobs nellie said in a voice that might have been carved from ice i see you are good evening she turned and started back across the street widow semphrochnellieplease wait jacobs said mr reach has something he would like to say to youdont you bill he bore down heavily on the last three words reach for once wasnt obviously drunk that did not make his tone any less raspy and rough when he said im sorry as heas anything for all the trouble i caused you lituh nellie and i sure asas can be wont do anything like that ever again honest to god i wont he took off his battered black derby revealing a mat of unkempt gray hair beneath it wasnt enough it wasnt nearly enough but it sufficed to bring nellie back into the shop lou pfeiffers round head went up and down on his fat neck thats good he wheezed thats very good and then the thunder from the north that had died away started up again not only started up again but was impossibly louder and fiercer than ever shells began crashing down some very close by fragments whined off brick and stone and bit into and through rough wood to the cellar jacobs shouted nellie hesitated crossing the street to get back to her own cellar in the middle of the bombardment was nothing but madness going down into the cellar here with a man who she thought loved her a man who had used her and a man about whom she knew next to nothing she hesitated and was lost come on to the cellar jacobs bawled again he grabbed her by the arm and half dragged her down the stairs meant for one his cellar was obscenely crowded for four nellie sat in one corner of the tiny stifling chamber her skirts pulled in tight around her willing no one to come near and no one did but they all kept looking at her in the flickering light of the candle flame and they were all men so she knewshe was sure she knewwhat went through their filthy minds and then to her horror bill reach pulled from his pocket a flask and began to drink she sprang to her feet and was up the stairs and shoving the cellar door open before hal jacobs could do anything more than let out a startled bleat she slammed the door down on top of the three us spies and fled when she got back to the cellar under the coffeehouse she discovered flying fragments had sliced her skirt to shreds not one of them had touched her flesh you all right ma edna asked i heard you at the cellar door right in the middle of all the gunsbefore that i was afraid you were a goner and then i thought you were nuts coming out in that with where i was id go out among the shells again in a minute nellie spoke with great conviction in a second believe me edna shot her a quizzical glance she shuddered but did not explain far in the distance off somewhere on the west texas plains a coyote howled a wail full of hunger and loneliness and unrequited lust hipolito rodriguez let out a soft chuckle he is not very happy i dont think the way he sound he might as well be a soldier si before jefferson pinkard could answer sergeant albert cross said need some men for a raidin party on the yankee trenches tonight pinkard stuck up his hand ill go sarge cross looked at him without saying anything for a while then he remarked you dont got to kill all the damnyankees in texas by your lonesome jeff leave some for the rest of us i want to go sarge pinkard answered he had never been a particularly eloquent man instead of saying more with words he folded his big hands into fists what they done he shook his head in frustration the words clogged in his throat in the end sergeant cross shrugged well hell you want em that bad reckon you can have em who else i go hip rodriguez said quietly one by one cross got the rest of the volunteers thats good he said thats mighty fine we go out half past midnight yall grab yourselves some shuteye before then dont want any sleepy bastard yawnin out in the middle of nomansland an lettin the damnyankees know were comin see yall tomorrow mornin early tomorrow mornin after the sergeant went on his way rodriguez said ever since you get back from leave amigo you want to go on all the raids on all the attacks you never used to do nothing like that before what about it pinkard said yankees aint gonna get out of texas unless we grab em by the scruff of the neck and heave em on out somebodys got to do it might as well be me rodriguez studied him the little sonoran farmers eyes might have been black glass in his swarthy face you dont have such a good time like you think when you get back home he asked he didnt push he didnt raise his voice he let pinkard answer without making him feel he had to tell any deep dark secrets but no matter how discreet he was no matter how little pressure he applied jefferson pinkard kept on saying what hed been saying ever since he returned to the front from birmingham had a hell of a time back home in a certain sense that was even true he hadnt screwed so much on his honeymoon down in mobile emily had done everything he wanted emily had done more than hed imagined hed wakened one night to her sucking him hard and then pulling him over onto her shed been wet and waiting hed worn himself out by then and hadnt thought he could come but hed been wrong bedford cunningham had made himself scarce too after that first dreadful moment jeff hadnt seen him at all that suited jeff fine if he never saw bedford again that would suit him even better but now he was back here somewhere east of lubbock bedford cunningham remained in birmingham remained next door to emily what were they doing now that jeff was gone was she rubbing her breasts in his face was she teasing his foreskin with her tongue was she groaning and gurgling and urging him on her legs folded around his back tight as a bear traps jaws every filthy picture in pinkards mind made him wish he were dead and cunningham and emily and at the same time every filthy picture in his mind made him wish he were back in birmingham so emily could do those things to him yeah a hell of a time he repeated rodriguez plainly didnt believe him well too damn bad hip jeff thought he wrapped himself in his blanket more to keep the mosquitoes away than for warmth and did his best to sleep images of emily naked and lewd made him sweat harder than the hot muggy weather could have done by itself at last despite them he dozedand dreamt of his wife naked and lewd whether awake or asleep he could not escape herexcept when he fought sergeant cross shook him awake at midnight for a moment he thought the hand on his shoulder was emilys when he realized it wasnt he also realized he was liable to be killed inside the next hour he scrambled eagerly to his feet lets get moving sarge he said keep your britches on jeff cross answered some of our buddies are still sawing wood we got to wait on the artillery too theyre gonna lay down a box barrage for us keep the yanks from bringing reinforcements into the stretch of trench we hit that sounds pretty good pinkard said they want us to bring back prisoners or are we supposed to come back by ourselves nobody told me one way or the other cross said reckon well have to play that one by ear when we get over there seeing pinkard yawn he went on grab yourself some coffee pot on a little fire just down the way the coffee was thick and tasted like dirt and was strong enough to strip paint but it made pinkards heart beat faster and his eyes open wide he gulped it down swearing as it burned his mouth several of his comrades took cups too pretty soon the pot was empty sergeant cross passed out burlap sacks of grenades jeff took one the little round bombsbritish style not the potatomashers the yanks and the huns usedwere fine for trench fighting bayonet and entrenching tool were even better as far as pinkard was concerned one by one the men in butternut climbed out of the trench and crawled through the few pathetic lengths of wire that passed for a belt cross said this here wire reminds me of a bald fellow combin about the last three strands hes got across his shiny old dome and pretendin hes got hisself a whole head o hair he may be fooled but aint nobody else who is several soldiers chuckled in low voices pinkard didnt but he nodded at the aptness of the comparison because they had any barbed wire at all the confederate commanders in texas often seemed to think they had great thickets of the stuff as was true in virginia and tennesseenot that from the news coming west it had done the csa a whole lot of good there either a little to the north a flare rose from the yankee lines it burned in the sky a fierce white point of light under its glare the advancing confederate soldiers froze pinkard pressed his face into the dirt it smelled of dust and of dead bodies that stink of rotting flesh never left his nostrils even more than cordite and coffee and tobacco it was the definitive odor of the front as hot iron was the definitive odor of the sloss foundry after what felt like forever the flare finally faded jeff crawled on he skirted shell holes when he could but was always ready to dive into one if the us soldiers opened up on the raiding party cross muttered discontentedly sure as hell goddamn artillerys gonna open up too goddamn soon they aint gonna figure out we had to wait for the flare goddamn artillery cant figure out to grab their asses with both hands anybody wants to know he was right the confederate soldiers hadnt reached the yankee wirethicker than their own but not muchwhen the threeinch guns behind the cs line started barking shells rained down on the us position making the sides and back of a box that isolated a stretch of the forward trenches like the rest of the men in the raiding party pinkard wore a wirecutter on his belt he could crawl under most of the wire the damnyankees had laid and snipped his way through the few places where he had trouble crawling somebody in the us trench fired jeff didnt think it was an aimed shot he wanted to thank the yankee for it it told him exactly where the trench line was he yanked a grenade out of the sack pulled off the ring and chucked the bomb into the trench as close to the yankee rifleman as he could put it the report was loud and hard and short he threw more grenades so did the rest of the raiders then with a yell he scrambled forward and leaped down into the us trench hey there you the words were spoken in a sharp yankee accent jeff didnt reach over his shoulder for his rifle faster to yank the entrenching tool off his belt and swing it in a short flat arc the shovel blade struck flesh and bit deep the us soldier went down with a groan then pinkard unslung the tredegar and ran along the firebay a potatomasher grenade hurled from a traverse exploded eight or ten feet in front of him a fragment bit the back of his hand another tore through his tunic without grazing him he dashed past the place where the grenade had gone off and into the traverse a yankee yelled and fired he missed pinkard lunged with the bayonet he grunted as it penetrated the us soldiers flesh almost as he sometimes grunted when he penetrated emilys flesh the damnyankee shrieked and crumpled jeff fired and stabbed stabbed and fired till three or four more yankees were down and none left on his feet in the traverse he grunted again an oddly sated sound somebody touched him on the shoulder he whirled and would have spitted hip rodriguez if the sonoran hadnt beaten the bayonet aside with his own rifle we got to go back jeff rodriguez said the sergeant he blow the whistle you no hear consumed in his orgy of killing pinkard hadnt heard anything he shook his head like a man coming out of a dream all right hip he said meekly ill come back with you rodriguez looked down the length of the traverse muttering ten million demons from hell he crossed himself to jeff he said you fight like a crazy man amigo yeah pinkard said come on lets get the hell out of here us artillery pumped shells into nomansland as the confederate raiders crawled and scrambled back to their own line one man took a splinter in the leg one man hadnt come out of the trench even so sergeant cross reported to captain connolly with considerable pride sir we whaled the stuffing out of the sons of bitches pinkard here he was worth a regiment all by hisself good news sergeant the company commander said well done pinkard thank you sir jeff answered his voice was dull far away the red mist of slaughter had retreated from his mind he felt spent and empty emily cavorted once more behind his eyes four fat freighters slowly steamed south watching them from the deck of the uss ericsson george enos sighed and said i dont know why they bother painting themselves in camouflage colors a big bullseye with sink me alongside it in big letters would be more like the straight story carl sturtevant chuckled you arent looking at the world with the proper spirit george he said for all the world like a chaplain enos snorted and you arent looking at the world like any petty officer i ever heard of he retorted youre supposed to go goddamn right when i say something like that the chief of the depthcharge projector crew laughed i never do what im supposed to if i can help it all right enos chuckled too the ships wallowed along painted in stripes and patches and gaudy colors that were supposed to make it hard for the skipper of a submersible to gauge either their range or their course whether the camouflage job did that or not george couldnt have said it made the freighters ugly as sin though there he was certain stripes zigzagged jaggedly over the ericsson too in an effort to break up her outline and make her seem to be moving in the direction of her own stern she and a sister ship scurried around the freighter like sheep dogs around sheep doing their best to keep the flock safe from the wolves that lurked under the surface of the sea what i want to do enos said is get the bastard who almost torpedoed us a few weeks ago lord knows hes still hanging around he would have chewed up that other bunch of freighters if we hadnt run him off sturtevant raised an ironic eyebrow i swear i dont know what the hell youre talking about lieutenant crowder reported that submersible as probably destroyed and if you dont think lieutenant crowder knows everything in the world well shit just ask him yeah and rain makes applesauce enos said they both laughed then laughing at the pretensions of officers was a sailors tradition old as time hes not too bad a fellow sturtevant allowed in an astonishing display of magnanimity as long as you dont take him too serious give him a chance though and hed have half of us up in aeroplanes and the other half down under the water in deepsea diver suits tryin to catch torpedoes like they were footballs the rebs were throwing at us he does like gadgets enos agreed at least the depthcharge projector is a pretty good gadget a veteran seaman sturtevant had almost as little use for newfangled devices as he did for young officers enamored of them when he said yeah its not too bad he surely meant it as high praise and that was how george enos took it enos stared out across the blue blue water of the tropical atlantic looking for anything that might alert him to the presence of the confederate submarine that also seemed to make its home in this stretch of ocean hed spied the stinking thing oncewhy not twice ocean squawking birds sun standing higher in the sky every dayand far higher now than enos had ever seen anyway despite that fierce and brilliant light he didnt spot anything out of the ordinary he kept looking ahead of the freighters ahead and off to one side if the submersible did prowl in these waters that was the direction from which it would attack it couldnt move very fast while submerged it had to take the lead on the surface then go under and slowly sneak toward its intended prey george did his best to think like the skipper of a submersible one thing he knew the skipper of the boat that had almost sunk the ericsson had nerve and brains both hed pretended to be sunk well enough to fool lieutenant crowder and then hed gone after us freighters the first chance he got that was his job and he was going to do it come hell or high waterin fact hed probably prefer high water there ought to be a better way to find a submersible thats hunting than barenaked eyeballs george said what we needhe glanced over at carl sturtevantis a new kind of gadget heres what you need sturtevant displayed the middle finger of his right hand and for gods sake dont say that anyplace where crowder can hear you hell either order you to invent the damn thing yourselfand by day before yesterday too or youll be in dutchor else hell try and do it himself and that wont work either yeah but enos got no further than that the lead freighter blew up it was a spectacular explosion the ship must have been carrying munitions the report slapped george in the face across a couple of miles of water jesus he exclaimed klaxons started hooting men to their battle stations the ericsson s deck shuddered under enos feet as he ran the stacks belched smoke the destroyer picked up speed at the onepounder by the stern george peered about he suspectedhe fearedhe was likelier to spot a torpedo wake heading straight for the ericsson than a telltale periscope if he didnt try to spot a periscope though nothing could be more certain than his failure a runner came up to lieutenant crowder at the depthcharge projector by enos gun and said sir this is where the bastarduh the submersibleis hiding captain wants you to shake him up to the surface if you can well do that crowder said he turned back to carl sturtevant who did the dirty work of running the projector well shake those rebel bastards or their limey pals right out of their shoes give me four charges sturtevant set the fuses for two hundred feet aye aye sir four charges two hundred feet the veteran petty officer repeated tonelessly that tonelessness was itself a dead giveaway that he did not agree with his superiors order indeed as the crew loaded the first two charges onto the projector he went so far as to ask did i hear that right sir if crowder said no he could change the order without losing face by having a man of lower rank correct him but crowder crisply said yes i want them deep after he sank that freighter the skipper down there will surely have seen us coming to the attack he will try to place as much ocean between himself and us as he can two hundred feet i said two hundred feet it shall be yes sir sturtevant answered even more woodenly than before two by two the depth charges flew off the ericsson s stern and splashed into the sea that yes sir in place of aye aye sir was a telling proof of how strongly sturtevant disagreed with lieutenant crowder standing there behind the onepounder george enos found himself on the petty officers side whatever flag the boat somewhere under them flew its skipper had proved himself a tough aggressive bastard in earlier attacks george didnt think a skipper like that would lurk in the depths either his guess was that the enemy captain would come up to periscope depth as soon as he could and try to put a fish right in the ericsson s engine room in which case sending depth charges down two hundred feet would be a waste of good explosives georges eyes went back and forth back and forth looking for the feathery plume of wake that trailed and could give away a periscope he imagined he saw something a couple of times but longer looks proved him wrong astern of the ericsson water boiled and bubbled the surface mark of the depth charges explosions moments later oil floated up from far underwater flattening the waves over which it rode well dip me in shit and fry me for bacon carl sturtevant said in conversational tones either weve hurt the son of a bitch or else hes trying to make us think we did whether its the one or the other we didnt miss him by much he solemnly took off his hat to lieutenant crowder beg your pardon sir you were right and i was wrong and im man enough to admit it never mind that crowder pointed back to the oil slick lets get over it and pound that boat to death ill want half the ash cans we throw down there fused for a hundred and fifty feet the other half for twofifty aye aye sir sturtevant said and repeated back the order no back talk now his thoughts and crowders were running down the same track like any destroyer the ericsson was an agile vessel she quickly returned to the floating oil into the water splashed the new salvo of depth charges explosions underwater once more roiled the surface of the sea enos stood at his gun ready to pound away at the submarine if she had to surface in a hurry he was also ready for disappointment the submersible had tricked the destroyer before more oil came to the surface and air bubbles and bits of wreckage swept up by the bubbles the men at the depthcharge projector cheered and beat their fists against its metal sides if hes shamming this time hes a better actor than any booth ever born lieutenant crowder shouted set some for twofifty again sturtevant and some for an even hundred if weve hurt that boat bad enough itll have to surface hop to it you men hop to it they did depth charges rained into the atlantic with a kill so close crowder fired them off with reckless abandon if the ericsson didnt sink the submarine shed be all but defenseless against it george caressed the curved metal of the onepounders trigger as if it were his wifes curved flesh come on he muttered come on you son of a whore and like a broaching whale up the submarine came she rose bowfirst and was plainly in desperate straits no sooner had the boat reached the surface than she heeled over onto her side and began to sink once more though it was more nearly horizontal than vertical an officer came out of the conningtower hatch and threw something into the water the boats papers in a weighted sack george supposed he fired a tenround clip of onepounder shells at the enemy officer one struck home the officers head exploded into red fog the fellowhe was a rebel for he wore dark gray trousers not royal navy bluetumbled into the sea a moment later the submersible sank this time for good carl sturtevant pounded george on the back good shooting snapping turtle he bawled in enos ear you see the name on the boat there bon something george said she rolled over too damn fast to get more than just a glimpse bonefish had to be sturtevant said theres swarms of em in cs waters no wonder theyd name a boat after em we sent it to the boneyard by god enos answered solemnly the two men shook hands cincinnatus wished he were driving his truck inside the cab of the rumbling snorting white machine nobody was watching him here in covington he wished he had eyes in the back of his head and one on each side too did that fellow with the gray mustache waiting for the trolley belong to luther bliss kentucky state police was that redhead in overalls a member of the confederate underground that kept on doing its best to disrupt kentuckys return to the usa when he got back into the colored part of town he wondered whether the woman hawking apples reported to apicius or some other red cell leader all those groups were intently interested in keeping an eye on him and things werent simple either the colored woman selling apples might have reported to luther bliss or even to the confederate diehards cincinnatus had worked with them other negroes could too for that matter white reds could work with black reds maybe none of those people nor any others he passed on the street was interested in him at all he hoped none of those people was interested in him at all he had trouble believing it though time was when hed let out a sigh of relief coming up the walk to his house when he was home with elizabeth and little achilles nothing could bother him that was what hed thought then nowas he went up the wooden steps onto his front porch his eyes automatically dropped to look at the boards right in front of the door there was nothing to see he and elizabeth had both worked hard to get rid of every trace of tom kennedys blood no there was nothing to see but he knew the blood was there what he didnt know was who had blown off a big chunk of kennedys head he had next to no chance of finding out either because everyone thought he was in someone elses pocket and so didnt want to give him the time of day but if he didnt find out whod murdered the confederate diehard and why whoever it was might decide he needed killing too since he didnt know whom in particular to worry about he had to worry about everybody which got wearing elizabeth had got home ahead of him she must have seen him coming for she opened the door as he was reaching for the knob out toddled achilles a big smile on his face dada he said grabbing cincinnatus around the leg dada sounds more like a real word now cincinnatus said leaning forward over his son to kiss his wife not jus babble babble babble way it used to be then achilles tugged on his trouser leg and spoke imperiously up laughing cincinnatus lifted him he was a lot lighter than crated rifles and munitions and there was only the one of him not unending loads in the back of the truck when cincinnatus remarked on that elizabeth snorted may only be the one she said but it sure enough seems like theres about a hundred an ten of him sometimes cincinnatus carried the toddler into the house he paused in the front hall and sniffed appreciatively what smells so good that beef tongue i bought at the butchers the other day his wife answered your mother threw it in the pot with taters an onions while she was watching achilles and ive got some string beans and salt pork cookin up in there too i knew i married you for some reason cincinnatus said elizabeth stuck out her tongue at him when she turned to go into the kitchen he swatted her lightly on the backside they both laughed supper proved to be as good as it smelled which wasnt easy afterwards happily replete cincinnatus played with achilles while elizabeth cleaned up in the kitchen achilles liked chasing a little rubber football whenever he tried to kick it he fell on his bottom he thought that was part of the fun after a while he tried something different cincinnatus had been tossing the ball for him to chase he went and got it and did his best to throw it back it went up in the air and bounced off his head as far as he was concerned that was pretty damn funny too while he got the ball and tried again to throw it to cincinnatus his father laughed and said i wonder if thats how the yankees got the notion of throwin the ball forwards when they play football in the confederate states passes toward the other sides goal line were against the rules football in the united states though permitted forward passes that were hurled from at least five yards behind the line of scrimmage when elizabeth finished the dishes cincinnatus lighted a cigar a lousy cigartobacco had gone downhill since kentuckys forcible separation from the csa and read the evening newspaper elizabeth hadwith the white ladys permissionbrought home from one of the houses she cleaned as usual the paper claimed extravagant us german and even austrian victories had a quarter of what the papers claimed been true the forces of the quadruple alliance would have conquered the world ten times over someone knocked on the door cincinnatus and elizabeth both looked up in alarm not so long before tom kennedy had knocked on the door like thatand died on the doorstep a moment later was it a neighbor wanting to borrow some molasses or was it a ruse to get cincinnatus to open the door and expose himself to someone crouched in the dark with a rifle only one way to find out who is it cincinnatus asked warily before the war he would have opened the door without asking before the war the door might well have been open anyhow on a warm spring night or elizabeth and he might have been sitting out on the front porch a deep voice answered it sure as hell aint the easter bunny and it aint father christmas neither cincinnatus opened the door there stood apicius who was almost certainly the best barbecue cook in the usa he might have been the best barbecue cook in the csa too but the competition was stiffer there as fit his trade the big black man was big in all dimensions solid muscle lay under his fat you better come in cincinnatus said i dont reckon this is no social call and it aint apicius said squeezing past him i aint here on my business im here on the business of the workers and peasants of the state of kentucky his chuckle was wheezy and why aint you surprised cant imagine cincinnatus answered letting the cook precede him down the hall and into the front room apicius and elizabeth greeted each other then she took achilles back to the bedroom as far as cincinnatus was concerned the less she involved herself in affairs of politics and the various undergrounds with which he was entangled the better you got the fine start to a family here apicius said and nodded at his own words need yourself some more young uns but thatll come thatll come you didnt come over here to jaw about my family cincinnatus said nothins gonna pry you away from the barbecue pit if it aint important thats a fact apicius said you never was a fool cincinnatus yeah go on and baste me with that big old longhandled brush o yours cincinnatus said then you put me over the fire an turn me on the spit apicius laughed but he quickly sobered all right i wont waste your time i wont waste my time what i got to know is this whose man is you i can talk with you if you is my man i can talk with you if you is tom kennedys man i you know what happened to him cincinnatus broke in his voice harsh i know what i dunno who done it and i wish i did but he still have folks left on his side apicius waved a big thickfingered hand as if to make cincinnatus interruption disappear i can even talk with you if you is luther bliss man cincinnatus interrupted again i aint but youd be a fool to talk with me if i was you don know how dangerous that bliss is hell i dont apicius said aint no law says the forces of reaction cant have people on their side who know what theys doin but i can talk with you if you is bliss man have to watch what i say but i can talk but if i dont know whose man you is cincinnatus how can i talk with you i say somethin how do i know who hears it apicius point made perfectly good sense of all the factions still struggling in kentucky cincinnatus had more sympathy for the reds than for any otherthe reds were after all his own people but a man whod been struggling to reach what passed for the upper stratum of black society before the war didnt completely sympathize with the reds leveling aspirations either the other side of the coin was that if apicius didnt like the answer cincinnatus gave him no insurance company in the world would put a nickel on his life with a sigh cincinnatus said i never wanted to be nothin but my own man if that aint good enough for you dont talk with me at allcept to say thanks when i buy me some ribs apicius sighed too you know too goddamn much to be your own man and nobody elses you is mixed up in this cant get yourself unmixed any moren you can take the sugar out of the coffee once its in that was probably true too cincinnatus was about to say so when another knock came from the front of the house apicius had been ordinary this one was brisk authoritative whoever was out there expected to be let in right away with no backtalk from anybody who apicius whispered dont know cincinnatus whispered back apicius hand went to a trouser pocket a pistol in there no doubt cincinnatus wished he had one too for the second time that evening he went to the door and called who is it queen of the may the man outside answered everyone was giving smart answers tonight cincinnatus opened the door for luther bliss wondering if hed get caught in the cross fire between the chief of the kentucky state police and apicius a glance over his shoulder told him the red leader had that pistol out and ready but then to his amazement apicius lowered it evenin luther he said evenin apicius you damn red bliss answered amiably cincinnatus stared from one of them to the other they both laughed at him pointing to apicius luther bliss said i know who this son of a bitch is i know what he stands for because i know that he doesnt worry me too much i can handle himreckon he thinks the same about me you though cincinnatuswho the hell are you who are you really working for apicius laughed again louder this time he pointed to cincinnatus i come over here to find out the same damn thing lutherand i dont care if yous here or not he still could be one oyours only man i work for is lieutenant straubing who bosses my truck unit cincinnatus said i aint nobodys man but my own he looked from apicius to luther bliss and back again one thing was obvious neither of them believed him in the midatlantic sylvia enos read in the boston globe as she rode the trolley to work the uss ericsson engaged and sank the css bonefish a submersible that had for some time tormented shipping in the region the bonefish had previously torpedoed the ss teton a civilian steamship in us service our bold navy has valiantly swept away yet another vicious scourge of the sea that was georges ship if theyd fought a confederate submarine hed surely been in danger she folded the paper and leaned back in the uncomfortable seat he was all right now and with this bonefish sunk hed keep on being all right a while longer now that she hadnt seen him for a few months her anger was cooling he might have wanted to be unfaithful but he hadnt actually gone and done it and he was all right thank you god sylvia thought next to that simple fact the war news on the front page the mutinies in the french army and all the rest of it faded to insignificance the ericsson had fought again and nothing had happened to george the world looked good when the trolley came to her stop sylvia left the globe on the seat for whoever might want it she hoped the next person who picked it up would find as much good news as she had and not a name he recognized in the blackbordered casualty lists she had a spring in her step as she went into the canning plant it was usually missing in the morningespecially these days when she had to get george jr off to kindergarten and mary jane to mrs dooleys before she could come to work she was humming a song about coal conservation when she punched in the words were as stupid as those of most wartime patriotic songs but she couldnt get the tune out of her mind save your coal for mealways says the sailor on the seaalways she shook her head in annoyancenot just a stupid song but irritating too because it would not leave her alone mr winter the foreman followed the war news closely as befit a veteran wounded in the service of his country thats your husbands destroyer that sank that rebel submersible isnt it mrs enos he called as she walked to the machine that put labels on cans of mackerel yes mr winter george is on the ericsson thats right she answered thought so the foreman said puffing on his cigar well good for him by god im glad he came through that safe those submersibles are things we didnt have to worry about in my day ill tell you something else too im not sorry to have missed them he patted his gimpy leg i just wish the rebs had missed me im sure of that mr winter sylvia said when she got to her machine she checked the paste reservoir which was full and the label hopper which turned out to be almost empty she quickly filled it that would have been just what she needed to get caught by surprise fifteen minutes into her shift and have to hold up the line while she fed the hopper mr winter would have made some not so polite conversation with her about that isabella antonelli came hurrying up to the machine next door i saw in the paperyour husbands ship it sank a submarine she said this is good news better news would be for the dannata war to end but this is good news for you before sylvia could do anything more than nod the line which had shut down for shift changeover started again with the usual assortment of groans and creaks from the belts and gearing into the machine went the first brightly tinned can sylvia pulled a lever three lines of paste flowed onto the can she took a step and pulled a second lever on went the label with the colorful picture of the improbably tunalike mackerel on it another step a third level and the can went on its way she went back and did it againand againand again the day went smoothly she didnt have to think about what she was doing the labels didnt jam in the hopper once during the whole shift that was the machines achilles heel the most common problem that could shut down the line and bring down the wrath of mr winter not today sylvia still felt almost alarmingly fresh as she clocked out and hurried to the trolley stop to catch the next car to george jrs school the streetcar was right on time a man with a white kaiser bill mustache stood up so she could sit down everything was going so well she wondered what would happen to break the lucky streak she found out when she got to the school he wasnt in the kindergarten classroom youll have to get him at the front office his teacher miss hammaker told sylvia what did he do she gasped is he all right youll have to get him at the office the dyspepticlooking spinster repeated sylvia snarled at her and hurried away when she saw george jr she knew right away what the trouble was a clerk clacking away at a typewriter spelled it out in two wellchosen words chicken pox then she went on im afraid youre going to have to keep him home until the scabs come off the pox but that will be two weeks from now sylvia exclaimed in horror im sorry mrs enos but we cant very well let him go spreading a contagious disease now can we the clerk said primly but my job sylvia said what am i supposed to do about my job i really dont know what to tell you about that maam the clerk answered we do have the other children to look out for too you know sylvia put a hand on her sons shoulder come on george she said wearily lets go get your sister and take the two of you home and then try to figure out what to do next she had no idea what to do next once she got home she could start worrying about it the clerk started typing again now that george jr was leaving she didnt have to worry about him any more sylvia did when she got to mrs dooleys the woman looked at her with the same disapproval miss hammaker had shown mrs enos she said pointedly your daughter will not be welcome here until she gets over the chicken pox sylvia finished for her mrs dooleys eyebrows rose sylvia said just a wild guess of course she kept her arm around george jr the longer he had to stay on his feet the more pale and sick he lookedand the redder his spots got by comparison i cant have her here till shes better mrs dooley said the other women whose children i mind would have a fit if i let her stay and i wouldnt blame them one bit she turned go on mary jane go home with your mother when youre well you can come back again all right mary jane said meekly that she offered no mischief or snippy talk was a telling indication she didnt feel right she too was starting to break out in the red spots that would soon turn into blisters cautiously mrs dooley asked she is vaccinated isnt she what sylvia needed a moment to understand what the question meant oh yes she and her brother both its only chicken poxit cant be smallpox all right the older woman nodded most children are vaccinated these days but you never know well thats a relief you take them home now mrs enos and bring your daughter back when shes well nodding sylvia turned away and led the children back to the trolley stop they didnt frisk ahead of her the way they usually did she urged them to hurry but they lacked the energy to do it she counted herself lucky they didnt make her miss a streetcar they had no appetite at supper which also didnt surprise her after they were done picking at their food she gave them aspirins and put them to bed early this itches mama george jr said it itches a lot try not to scratch sylvia answered if you do itll leave scars it itches he said remembering her own bout of chicken poxshed been nine or tenshe knew how fiercely they itched do your best she said she had a pockmark on the side of her jaw one between her breasts several on her arms and legs and one or two in other places she hadnt known about till her husband found them that had amused george no end though shed been embarrassed by the time she finished the supper dishes the children were asleep she went down the hall and knocked on brigid conevals door when the irishwoman opened it she was in mourning black mrs enos she said and stepped aside do come in what might i do for you today her apartment looked more battered than sylvias and smelled of cooking grease and cabbage her children three boys ranging from george jrs size on down ran around raising hell through their racket sylvia said i was wondering if i could pay you enough to watch my children just long enough to let them get over the chicken pox brigid coneval shook her head that i cannot and that i will not she answered for one thing im taking in other peoples wee ones no more as you know and for another patrick has not had the chicken pox himself nor has michael nor billy neither ill be just as well pleased without them having em too sure and i will but what am i going to do sylvia exclaimed shed been saying the same thing to anyone who would listen ever since shed first seen george jr covered with spots how am i going to go to work well if you do you doand if you dont you dont mrs coneval said airily tell em youll not be in while the babes are after being sick thats all what else can you do theyll fire me sylvia stated the obvious will you starve while you miss a couple weeks pay brigid coneval asked reluctantly sylvia shook her head the new widow went on then be damned to the job youll get another soon enoughplenty to be had with so many men off getting killed youll have no trouble at all at all ive worked there a long time sylvia sighed but youre right in the end youre right if they fire me for staying home then they do thats all i dont want to leave that job but i can if i have to thank you mrs coneval youve made me see things clear any time at all dearie brigid coneval said behind private first class reginald bartlett artillery thundered not a lot of artillery not by the standards of the roanoke front but more than hed heard on the confederate side of the line here in sequoyah let the damnyankees keep their heads down for a change he said pete hairston nodded only trouble is once the guns stop we get to go forward and push em out the veteran sergeant said he paused and shrugged us and the niggers do goddamned if i like that joe mopope said you people are crazy giving niggers guns wouldnt never catch us kiowas giving niggers guns if those colored regiments hadnt come over the river we never would have got enough men to attack the yanks reggie said hairston nodded again thats a fact wed be holding on tooth and toenail same as we have been now we got a chance to take back some of this here state we better see that we dont waste it on account of i dont reckon well ever see another one whistles blew up and down the reinforced confederate line lieutenant nicoll shouted come on boys now its our turn out of the trenches came his company howling the rebel yell they trotted forward go nicoll roared to them go on they arent doing so well back eastweve got to show them how to play the game well get em napoleon dibble said they cant mess with the belgians and they cant mess with us reggie said nothing he didnt waste his breath yelling every time he came up above ground he felt like a turtle coming out of its shell he was vulnerable up here his time in the closequarters fighting of the roanoke front had taught him how hideously vulnerable a man was when he came up out of his trench he wasnt afraid though not in the ordinary sense of the word whatever was going to happen would happen it was largely out of his hands if he let it worry him hed be letting his pals down and he couldnt stand that not after theyd been through and suffered so much together on they came some dropped into cover to shoot while others advanced then leapfrogged past when the other group hit the dirt the bombardment hadnt taken out all the yankees bombardments never did rifles and machine guns stuttered to life men in butternut began falling not of their own volition some of those men were black the new units going forward along with the white troops who had been in the field for years the negro soldiers charged straight at the us trenches they werent skilled in the fireandmove tactics the veterans had learned by painful experience and they went down in gruesome numbers when they screamed bartlett couldnt tell their voices from those of white men he lay in a shell hole fired a couple of rounds toward the yankee line ahead and then got to his feet and ran by the men hed been supporting he dove behind a stump and started shooting again once his buddies had dashed past him and found cover he scrambled up and ran on he was about thirty yards from the yankee trench when a traversing machine gun turned its balefully winking eye upon him his first feeling was nothing but surprise one moment hed been sprinting forward his eyes fixed on the yankees in their ugly cookingpot helmets who were shooting at him and his countrymen the next he slammed to the ground on his face somebody punched me he thought somebody punched me twice god damn that joe mopope anyhowthis is no time for practical jokes then he tried to move what had been impact turned to pain stunning pain in his left shoulder and right leg someone very close by was screaming at the top of his lungs only when reggie needed to inhale did he realize those cries belonged to him machinegun and rifle fire kept right on stitching past him in what was more a roll and a wriggle than a crawl he made it into a hole in the tornup ground pulled out his wound dressing and wondered what the hell he should bandage first blood was turning the outside of his right trouser leg blackish red his left arm didnt want to do what he told it to do awkwardly onehandedly he got a sort of a bandage around his thigh and stuffed a pad of gauze into the hole in his shoulder the world kept going gray as he worked but he persevered stretcherbearer he shouted stretcherbearer his voice was hoarse and rawedged no one came the yanks didnt usually shoot stretcherbearers on purpose any more than the csa did but bullets werent fussy either reggie got out his canteen and drank it dry the day was hot and muggy before very long the anguish of thirst joined the agony from his wounds the sun beat down on him out of a brassy sky his bandages went from white to red and soggy every so often when the pain backed off a little he wondered how the attack was going he occasionally saw men in butternut going forward nobody flopped down in his shell hole he didnt think that was fair more screams rose this time they didnt come from reggie after a while those screams stopped they never started up again bartlett got the idea that the fellow whod been making them wasnt breathing any more up ahead the firing hesitated then broke out anew louder and fiercer than ever shells from the damnyankees field artillery whistled overhead some no doubt aimed to impede the confederates advance dropped down near reggie he halfwaymore than halfwayhoped one would land square on him hed never know what hit him then he knew exactly what had hit him now he moaned through dry lips slowly ever so slowly the scorching sun slid across the sky as it sank toward the western horizon men in butternut started coming back past the shell hole where reggie bartlett lay he called out to them but his voice was a dry husk of what it had been no one heard him no one saw him reach out imploringly with his good hand his comrades retreated in their wake the soldiers of the us army advanced they fired and moved as their confederate counterparts had done during the morning the sun was going more orange than gold when one of them jumped down into reggies hole the yankee had fired twice before he realized the body in there with him was not dead he had it in his power to change that on the instant reggie got a good long close look at him he was in his late twenties or early thirties dark in need of a shave and wearing what the yanks called a kaiser bill mustache it had a couple of white hairs in it reggie thought it looked stupid two stripes on the fellows sleeve a corporal he said i ought to blow your fuckin head off reb reggie shrugged a oneshouldered shrug the us corporal suddenly looked thoughtful if i bring you in though he went on thinking out loud your pals miss a chance to blow my fuckin head off and that dont make me even a little bit sorry i got news for you reggie forced a word out through parched throat water yeah the corporal said and held a canteen to his lips the water was warm and stale and tasted ambrosial then the yankee heaved him up onto his back with a bulls strength ignoring his cries of pain the us soldier started toward his own line shouting stretcherbearers got a wounded reb prisoner here a couple of us soldiers with red crosses on their helmets and on armbands took charge of bartlett how you feelin reb one of them asked not unkindly shitty he answered stick him louie the other stretcherbearer said we dont want him yellin at us all the way to the field hospital sure as hell dont louie agreed and stuck a needle in reggies arm reggie sighed as relief washed over him the pain remained but now he floated over it instead of being immersed the relief must have shown on his face for louie chuckled that morphines great stuff isnt it yeah reggie breathed the stretcherbearers hauled him through zigzagging communications trenches similar to the ones behind his own front line then they put his stretcher in the back of an ambulance daniel brought in this here reb the one who wasnt louie told the driver thought hed be worth patching might even be righthe aint pegged out on us while we were lugging him back here hate to waste the sawbones time on a rebel the ambulance driver said but what the hell the ambulances motor was already turning over he put the machine in gear and headed back toward the field hospital whose tents were out of range of artillery from the front when bartlett got there another pair of stretcherbearers took him out of the ambulance and laid him on the ground outside a greengray tent with an enormous red cross on it most of the men there were us soldiers but a few others wore butternut attendants gave him water and another shot presently a doctor in a bloodspattered white coat came by and looked him over that legs not too bad he said after cutting away bandages and trouser leg he examined the shoulder were going to have to take you into the shop to repair this one though whats your name reb he poised a pencil over a clipboard reggie bartlett i broke out of one yankee prisonerofwar camp reckon i can do it again with two shots of morphine in him reggie didnt care what he said he didnt impress the yankee doctor either after recording his name the fellow said son youre going to be a good long while healing up i dont care whether you escaped before by the time you think about flying the coop again this warll be over and well have won it bartlett laughed in his facethe morphine again thegreatwar breakthroughs captain jonathan moss looked down on the tortured canadian landscape from on high as if he were a god he knew better of course if one of the shells the americans aimed at the canadian and british troops who had blocked their way for so long happened to strike his wright twodecker he would crash the same assuredly was true of the shells the enemy hurled back at the us forces and of the archie their antiaircraft guns sent up spring was at last in full spate the land was green where shellfire hadnt turned it to mucky brown pulp all the streams flowed freely the ice had melted and the line was beginning to move too though it had been frozen longer than any canadian river below moss us troopers advanced behind a large contingent of barrels that battered their way through the defenses the canucks and limeys had built with such enormous expenditure of labor the canadians had barrels too though not so many they dueled with the american machines in a slow ugly twodimensional version of the war moss and his friendsand his foes as wellfought in the air he spied a flight of enemy fighting scouts down near the deck they were shooting up the advancing americans who grew vulnerable when they came up out of their trenches to attack but the entente aeroplanes were vulnerable too moss pointed them out to his own flightmates then took his american copy of a german albatros into a dive better suited to a stooping falcon percy stone hans oppenheim and pete bradley followed wind screamed in moss face it tried to tear the goggles off his eyes and peeled lips back from teeth in an involuntary grin the grin would have been on his face anyhow though his gaze flicked back and forth from the unwinding altimeter to the enemy aeroplanes the british or canadian pilots were having such a high old time shooting up american infantry they made the mistake of not checking the neighborhood often enough moss intended to turn it into a fatal mistake if he could his thumb came down on the firing button the twin machine guns roared spitting bullets between the two wooden blades of the prop if the interrupter gears didnt function properly as every so often they didntbut contemplating that kind of misfortune gave no better profit than thinking about ones own path intersecting that of a shell tracers let him direct his fire onto the rearmost enemy fighting scout he must have hit the pilot for the sopwith pup slammed into the ground an instant later and burst into flame thatll teach you you son of a bitch he shouted exultantly pups had been machines of terror when set against the martin onedeckers us pilots had been flying for so long so long was rightthat was what you said when you went up against a pup in a onedecker but the new wright machines had helped even the odds another pup started to burn the pilot turned for home but never got there he didnt have much altitude and rapidly lost what he had he tried to land the aeroplane but rolled into a shell hole and nosed over fire raced down the length of the fighting scout for the pilots sake moss hoped the crash had killed him the other two sopwith pups twisted away from moss flight on the level they were slightly faster than the notquitealbatroses the americans flew and succeeded in making good their escape moss led his comrades up out of that part of the sky where a lucky rifle or machinegun bullet could put paid to a fighting scout climbing was slower work than diving had been before he got out of range of smallarms fire from the ground a couple of bullets went through his wings with about the sound a man would have made by poking a stick through a tightly stretched drumhead hans oppenheim was the pilot pumping his fist up over his head so moss assumed hed brought down that second pup moss couldnt imagine anything else that would have got the phlegmatic oppenheim excited enough to show such emotion he looked at his watch theyd been in the air well over an hour he looked at his fuel gauge it was getting low he oriented himself more from the way the trenches ran than by his unreliable compass and found northwest time to get back to arthur he said and let the slipstream blow the words back to his comrades they couldnt hear him of course with their engines roaring they couldnt hear a damn thing any more than he could but they saw his gestures and in any case they knew what he was doing and why they couldnt have had any more gasoline in their tanks than he did in his the aerodrome was surprisingly busy when he and the rest of his flight bumped over the rutted fields it was the kind of activity he hadnt seen for a long time everybody was tearing things up by the roots and pitching them into trucks and wagons were moving up moss asked a groundcrew man after he shut off the wrights engine and his words were no longer his private property hell yes the mechanic answered as moss descended from the cockpit and awkward in his thick flying suit came down to the ground front is moving forward so we will too dont want you burning up too much gas getting where youre going that sounds plenty good to me moss said me too the groundcrew man pointed to the bullet holes in the fabric covering the fighting scouts wings looks like the natives were restless ground fire moss replied with a shrug but i knocked down a pup that was strafing our boys and hans got another one and we came back without a scratch bully sir the groundcrew man said whats that bring your score to six and a quarter moss answered i knew you were an ace the fellow said nodding moss laughedat himself and ill tell you something else too i was keeping track so well that they were able to give me a surprise party after my fifth victory because i didnt remember which one it was hans gets everybody drunk tonight thoughthis was his first his flightmates were down from their aeroplanes too he went over and thwacked hans oppenheim on the back he hit oppenheim a solid lick too but all the leather and wool his fellow flier had on armored him as effectively as anything this side of chainmail major cherney will not be unhappy with us today oppenheim said he had all his selfpossession back and seemed faintly embarrassed to be the object of moss boisterous congratulations percy stone shook his head cherney wont even notice were here except that we give him some more things he has to think about hes got moving the aerodrome on his mind he doesnt have to worry about moving our aeroplaneswell fly em pete bradley said i just wonder where the hell were supposed to fly em to dont let em promote you past captain stone advised jonathan moss once you get oak leaves on your shoulders you have to worry about too many other things to do as much flying as you want thats so moss said he started to add that he would be as happy not to have unfriendly strangers shooting at him up in the sky before the words came out of his mouth he realized they werent true he never felt more alive than he did two or three miles above the ground throwing his aeroplane through turns it wasnt meant to make so he could get on an enemys tail or shake a canuck off his own it was pure it was clean and it made everything else in the worldfast motorcars fast womenseem about as exciting as solitaire womenmaybe not after the flight had reported to major cherney the squadron commander said get yourselves packed up boys youre scheduled to move out bright and early tomorrow morning new aerodromes over by orangeville twenty miles up the road we have made some progress and well done to you all hansie first drinks on me tonight for losing your cherry thank you sir oppenheim said moss never would have had the nerve to call him hansie not in a million years back at the tent the flight shared moss looked over his meager belongings and said i can throw this stuff in a trunk and a duffel bag in half an hour flat i think im going to take a walk before i pack i know where youre walking percy stone said amusement glinted in his eyes ive walked that way a time or three youre wasting your time she still hates americans all right maybe i am wasting my time moss said at least ill be wasting it in betterlooking company than any of you lugs he left the tent to the jeers of his flightmates when he got to laura secords farm she was on her hands and knees in the vegetable garden weeding when she saw him she gave him the same greeting she usually did why dont you go away yank thats what i came to tell you he answered i am going away the whole base is going away i came to say id miss you she glared at him which only made him find her more attractive well i wont miss you or any other yank she answered grayblue eyes flashing then she softened a little where is the base going i wont tell you he answered if i did youd probably try to imitate your famous ancestor and let the british know where we are i dont want to wake up one night with bombs falling all over the place laura secord bit her lip she must have been thinking about doing just what hed said indeed she admitted it saying you werent supposed to see through me go on then go wherever youre going i only wish youall you yankswere going out of my country and never coming back that isnt going to happen he said in fact i will tell you were going forward because you could find that out for yourself she looked down at the ground when she raised her face again it was wet with tears damn you she whispered damn all of you however too many there are moss found himself with little to say after that it was his usual condition in conversations with laura secord but for once he did come up with something when the war is finally over i hope your husband comes back here safe most of him even meant it thank you captain moss she said you make it hard for me to hate you in particular along with the united states thats the nicest thing youve ever said to me he replied with a smile its the nicest thing im likely to say to you too she told him now go your way wherever it is that you dare not let me know with unmistakable emphasis she returned to her weeding and jonathan moss walked back to the aerodrome and landing strips that would soon be abandoned hed never seen any of laura secord but her face her hands and her ankles hed never touched her hed rarely had anything but insults from her he was whistling as he walked he wondered why he felt so good the dakota s seaplane splashed down into the south atlantic close by the battleship sailors on deck sam carsten among them waved to the pilot he waved back delighted as always to come down in one piece carsten turned to luke hoskins and said i hope to jesus hes found something worth our while to fight otherwise were going to have to turn around and head back to chile goddamn ocean is a big place hoskins said and the limeys convoys are hugging the shore now that they know were in the neighborhood weve got to hit em in argentine waters too carsten agreed unhappily if we sink half a dozen freighters inside brazilian territory its even money whether we scare dom pedro iv into coming in on our side or make him so mad hell declare for the entente i dont want to get all that close inshore hoskins said the limeys have been selling those damn little torpedo boats to argentina the last twenty years and everybody and his brothers been selling em to the empire of brazil run up against one of those babies when youre looking in the wrong direction and its liable to ruin your whole day that was more talk from the shellheaver than sam had heard for the past week those torpedo boats are one of the reasons weve got the destroyers playing tag with us he said come on sam i know thati didnt ride into town on a load of turnips luke hoskins answered here let me ask it like this are you happier knowing your neck is on the line if somebody on one of those goddamn pipsqueak fourstackers didnt polish his telescope when he should have damned if i am ill tell you that much well hell sam said when you put it like that im not either he stared over toward the nearest destroyer as if to make certain nobody on deck was asleep at the switch out swung the crane it plucked the aeroplane out of the water and hoisted it pilot and all onto the deck of the dakota as usual sam tried to get close enough to the machine to hear what the pilot was telling the officers who crowded round him as usual he failed frustrated he turned awayand almost ran into vic crosetti stickin your nose in where it dont belong aint you sam crosetti said yeah same as you are carsten returned crosetti laughed altogether unembarrassed hey everybody can tell i got a big nose right he put a hand on the organ in question which was indeed of formidable proportions you know what they saybig in the nose means big somewhere else too in the ears looking at you sam said you better watch yourself carsten crosetti said clenching a fist in mock anger pretty soon were going to sail far enough north for the sun to remember its first name and then theyll stick an apple in your mouth on account of the rest of yous gonna look like a roast pig that needs a little more time in the oven id laugh like a damn loon if only that was a joke carsten said warily eyeing the sky here below the equator fall was heading toward winter he favored winter and clouds and storms before long the dakota leaned into a long turn that swung her course to the west the rest of the joint americanchilean fleet moved with her vic crosetti clicked his tongue between his teeth pilot must have spotted a convoy sneaking along the coast he said happily i guess well go leave em a calling card id say youre likely right sam agreed using a battleship to sink freighters is like smashing a fly with an anvil if anybody wants to know what i think but nobody seems to i sure as hell dont crosetti said grinning as he planted the barb when the hooting horns summoned the crew of the dakota to battle stations hiram kidde was grinning from ear to ear as he greeted the sailors who manned the fiveinch gun just like shooting fish in a barrel boys the gunners mate said fish in a barrel sure as hell fish in a barrel dont shoot back carsten said fish in a barrel dont man torpedo boats thats right luke hoskins agreed thats just right sam and i were talking about that topside its a risk capn kidde allowed but it aint a hell of a big risk ill tell you that id sooner take my chances against those damn mosquitoes than against a real live battleship any day of the week and twice on sunday nobody quarreled with that carsten stepped away from the breech of the fiveinch gun and peered out of the sponson through the vision slit he needed a moment to realize the horizon wasnt smooth and unbroken as it was farther out to sea it had lumps and bumps on it were within sight of land he said in surprise wont be much longer before things start happening then kidde predicted if you can see it from here theyve seen it from the observation mast for a while now i wonder if the skipper aims to get in close enough to use the secondaries to sink the freighters and save the wear and tear on the big guns thatd be good sam said you get close enough to use the secondaries against a battleship and youre in more trouble than you really want we found out everything we wanted to know about that and then some in the battle of the three naviesoh lord didnt we just heads bobbed up and down as all the men in the gun crew remembered the dakota s wild and undesired ride toward first the british and then the japanese fleet hoskins said what i want to do is i want to hit a torpedo boat with a fiveinch shell god damn me if thered be anything left of the bastard but matchsticks and kindling the gun crew nodded again carsten liked the picture that made in his mind as he usually did hiram kidde thought along with the officers in charge of the dakota commander grady who was responsible for the starboard secondary armament stepped into the crowded sponson and said boys theyre going to give us the fun this time pick your target blow it to hell and gone and then hit the next one every time you send a few thousand tons of meat and wheat to the bottom you push the limeys that much closer to starving yes sir kidde said itll be a pleasure sir good grady hurried away to pass the word to the rest of the fiveinch gun crews on his side of the battleship kidde peered down into the rangefinder inside nine thousand yards he murmured and worked the elevation screw to the crew he added lets get a shell in the gun hoskins jerked one out of the magazine and passed it to sam carsten handling the sixtypound weight as if it were nothing sam slammed it into the breech and slid the block closed fire kidde shouted carsten jerked the lanyard the gun roared and bucked stinking cordite fumes filled the sponson the other guns of the secondary armament were roaring too sam worked the breech mechanism the empty brass shell casing clattered down onto the steel deck luke hoskins handed him another shell he slammed it home that one was long hiram kidde reported fiddling with the elevation screw again when he was satisfied he let out a grunt and shouted fire again he grunted once more when the shell hit short this time all rightweve got the bastard straddled give me another one this one should be right on the money sam said as he fired the cannon hit kidde screamed that was a hit bastards burning pour a couple more into him carsten right capn sam said feels good to do the shooting instead of getting shot at when the first target had taken what kidde reckoned to be fatal damage he turned the gun toward another hapless freighter but before he had the gun laid he grunted yet again this time in surprise somebodys shooting back at us he said i didnt spot any flash or smoke but a goodsized shell just splashed down forward of the bow railroad gun somewhere inland carsten asked thatd be sneaky wouldnt it the gunners mate answered you got a nasty head on your shoulders you know he peered through the vision slit still dont see anything though guns topside started firing not the titanic main armament which sam would have thought the proper response to a big gun mounted on a flatcar but the onepounders that had been bolted into place here and there on deck not long before the war began luke hoskins who had less imagination than any man carsten knew was the one who solved the riddle that wasnt a shell capnbet you anything it was a bomb off an aeroplane everybody in the gun crew stared at him dip me in shit if i dont think youre right kidde said jesus what do we do about that only way you knock down an aeroplane is by dumb fucking luck he shrugged they dont pay me to worry about it they pay me to fight this gun and thats what im going to do he finished turning it to its new target fire sam jerked the lanyard the gun bellowed a moment later came the bellow of another explosion this one on deck it was a big explosion a frighteningly big explosion bombs didnt have to survive being shot out of guns the way shells did carsten realized not needing thick walls they could carry a hell of a lot of explosive for their size another blast shook the deck under sams feet he kept on loading and firing to hiram kiddes commands as kidde had said what else could he do but then the dakota turned away from the freighters hed been shelling away from the argentine coast and ran for the open sea more bombs fell on and around her hiram kidde stared out the vision slit and then back at his gun crew his face wore nothing but astonishment aeroplanes he said his voice cracking like a boys aeroplanes and they might have sunk us what the hell is the world coming to newspapers in cuba were printed roughly half and half english and spanish sipping his morning coffee puffing on a fine habana roger kimball suddenly burst out laughing whats funny sir tom brearley asked kimball pointed look here the damnyankees say they sank us his exec scanned the item he didnt laugh he got angry those dirty lying sons of bitches he burst out you can never trust what a yankee saysnever my granddad taught me that and theyve proved he was right time after time after time hell they make jews look honest dont blow a gasket tom kimball said when we came back here for refit who took our place in the map box hampton readys boat brearley answered at once he was in the class ahead of mine at mobile readys boat yeah kimball said the bonito brearley needed a minute to take it in when he did he went from angry to grim in the blink of an eye youre right he said sure as hell youre right and that means they really did sink him too damn he was a good sailor and a good fellow too must have made it to the surface just long enough for the yanks to get a fast look at the name and then straight down before they could read it all christ kimball shivered that was a nasty way to go there werent any nice ways to go not when you jammed yourself down into a tin can and went after real ships you all right tom you look green around the gills brearley didnt answer not directly hamps wife just had a baby girl maybe six months ago you know katie little redhead nice gal ive met her kimball said married man shouldnt skipper a submersible makes you think too much but that didnt solve brearleys problemor katie readys now kimball couldnt do anything about hers about brearleys and he admitted to himself his ownhe waved a swarthy waiter hurried over two mojitos pronto dos mojitos si yes sir the officers club waiter said he hurried away not seeing anything in the least unusual about a navy officer ordering drinks with breakfast prohibition might have made strides on the confederate mainland it was only a word in cuba and a seldomused word at that rum and mint over crushed ice went enormously well with strong coffee and fine cigars tom brearley drank half of his looked thoughtful and slowly nodded that was the medicine i needed all right steady you down kimball agreed he took a pull from his own mojito i grew up drinking whiskey same as everybody else in arkansas but ill tell you i could get used to rum brearley nodded im the same way its got the kick no two ways about it he picked up the newspaper then threw it down on the table shaking his head hamp ready that does hurt damn fine fellow he poured down the rest of the drink kimball picked up the paper and read further says the boat was sunk by the uss ericsson he stiffened thats the destroyer thats been playing cat and mouse with us all right ready wasnt ready enough and they got him that box on the map doesnt have a boat in it now brearley said we were going to go back and take over for the bonito when she finished her tour what do you want to bet they send us back fast as they can now youre right goddammit kimball got up slapped coins on the table and left over his shoulder he said if i dont have much time to enjoy myself im going to make the most of what ive got instead of heading for one of the many sporting houses that catered to confederate navy men he walked down san isidro street away from the harbor till he came to a telegraph office he sent a wire to his mother and the man shed married after his father died he hoped theyd get it last hed heard the damnyankees had been close to overrunning the farm on which hed grown up he sent another wire to anne colleton both read the same i m not as easy to kill as the yankees think hope to see you soon love roger to his mother hope to see you soon was a polite sentiment nothing more with anne colletonhe hoped to see her the very soonest he could and with the most privacy he could arrange telegrams sent he hurried back toward the bonefish a fat commander with the three oak leaves of supply above the stripes on his sleeve stood on the wharf alongside kimballs submersible longshoremen some black some swarthy like the waiter streamed into and out of the boat the officer from supply checked off items on a clipboard good to see you here skipper he said nodding to kimball were stepping things upas best we can anyhow youll be going back to sea sooner than you might have hoped when you came into port reckoned as much kimball nodded back you all will have known about the bonito a while before i worked it out he donned an exasperated expression half genuine half assumed for effect you might have been good enough to let me know my boat would be turning around in a hurry oh we would have gotten around to it commander never fear the officer from supply answered breezily he did indeed have an impressive belly he was smoking a cigar that made the one kimball had enjoyed with breakfast seem a stogie made from weeds kimball wondered when hed last set foot in an actual working vessel of the cs navy probably when hed reported to havana whenever that was he didnt come from cuba his accent said alabama or mississippi fixing him with a gaze he might have sent toward a us cruiser through his periscope kimball said i am like the fellow whose neighbor has a mean dog i might put up with one bite but sure as hell i wont put up with two if i need to know something i expect to find out the minute i need to know it not when somebody gets around to it he didnt advance on the commander from supply he didnt clench his fist he didnt even raise his voice the commander staggered back as if hit in that comfortable wellupholstered belly even so im sure you wont have any trouble like that in the future he said pasting a wide placating smile on his face and taking the fancy cigar out of his mouth to make the smile even wider good kimball still didnt raise his voice but the officer from supply took another couple of steps back kimball strode past him and climbed down into the noisome darkness that was the interior of the bonefish ben coulter had things well in hand there after a stretch of time with the crew out and the boat cleaned up as much as it could be the stench had diminished it was still enough to make most sailors in the surface navy turn up their toes or perhaps heave up their breakfasts to kimball it was the smell of home long as we can keep things fresh sir well live like kings coulter said plenty of eggs and meat and fish and greenssome of em are these funny cuban vegetables that look like god forgot what he was doin when he was makin em but you boil em long enough and they all taste the same sure as hell yes sir like kings crowded kings kimball remarked and the veteran first mate nodded kimball and coulter both knew perfectly well that before long theyd be eating beans and salt pork and stinking sauerkraut and drinking orange juice and lemon juice to hold scurvy at bay as a cruise wore along freshcaught fish became a luxury dwelling on better times was more enjoyable were full up on shells again too sir coulter said armorers havent come with the fish yet though well get em we do most of our work with em these days kimball said too damn many ships with wireless we need to sink em fast and sneaky yes sir coulter nodded again damnyankees keep pulling destroyers out of their hats too like magicians with rabbits its getting so we cant hardly take a shot at a freighter without dodging ash cans for the next week i know im getting damn tired of it too kimball slapped coulter on the back by the way theyre going at this resupply business likely youve guessed well be going out sooner than we reckoned when we got into habana ben coulters head went up and down once more sure as hell did sir reckon the yankees must have done somethin nasty to the bonito they sank her kimball said bluntly adding they thought she was the bonefish the yankee papers are reporting us sunk that jerked a laugh out of the mate kimball went on the ericsson got hersame destroyer thats given us such a hard time when we get back into our box on the map ben im going to kill that bastard oh hell yes coulter said cant let the damnyankees own the whole damn ocean cant let em get past us either kimball said if they sit on englands supply line shes out of the war if england has to quit weve lost too and so have the froggies whole crew understands that sir coulter answered then he sighed sure are a hell of a lot of yankees tryin to get south of us these days when were cruising out there though kimball didnt reply as far as he could see the war was probably lost even if the us navy didnt succeed in choking off englands supply line to argentina it would take longer to lose if the british stayed in the fight that was all he didnt care he had a job to do and he was damn good at it he had very little modesty false or otherwise he knew how good he was he enjoyed doing what he was doing too as long as the csa stayed in the fight hed do it as well as he could and if the yankees sank himwell hed already hurt the usa a lot worse than losing the bonefish would hurt his own country when he got back to his quarters a telegram was waiting he wasted no time in tearing open the envelope if this here is from my ma he muttered im going to be disappointed as hell but it wasnt anne colleton wrote glad the yanks are bad fishermen let me know next time maybe we ll meet halfway anne no love not from her not even a promise kimball had seen such fripperies were not her style but a maybe from a woman like that was worth a lay from half a dozen of the ordinary sort kimball carefully tore the telegram into tiny pieces he was smiling as he did it as it happened arthur mcgregor wasnt far from the farmhouse when two greengray fords turned off the road from rosenfeld and onto the path that led to his home he decided he wouldnt go out to the fields after all but turned and walked back the motorcars got there before he did us soldiers with bayoneted rifles piled out of one of them more soldiers got out of the other instead of a springfield in his hands one of those men wore a pistol on his hip major hannebrink was slim and quickmoving and dapper easy to recognize from a long way off mcgregor scowled but did not pick up his pace when he reached the knot of soldiers he looked down at the american officer who was several inches shorter than he you must think im a dangerous character he said slowly if you need to bring all these bullies along when you come to say hello i dont know whether youre a dangerous character or not hannebrink answered coolly but i dont believe in taking chances and i do aim to find out one way or the other barn first sir or the house one of the soldiersa sergeantasked mcgregors eyes went to the farmhouse maude was watching from the kitchen window julia alongside her mary wasnt tall enough to see out if her mother and sister hadnt already told her soldiers were here though shed know soon enough and then shed call them everything she knew how to call them and she knew a surprising amount house hannebrink answered get the women out of there well turn it inside out and then well do the barn he drew the pistol and pointed it at mcgregor this gentleman wont be going in there to take out anything he doesnt fancy us seeing wasnt going to do that anyway mcgregor said stolidly you bastards have stuck your noses in there before and you never found a thing because theres nothing to find you wont find anything this time eitherstill nothing hed told that lie so many times it came out smooth as the truth though hed never been a man who lied easily before alexander was marched up against a wall and shot if they found the explosives if they find them its over he thought he wasnt ready for it to be over not yet he hadnt taken nearly enough revenge yet but the best way to keep from betraying himself was to act as if whether they found what they were looking for didnt matter out came maude and julia and mary under the yanks guns sure enough his younger daughter the spitfire was doing her best to scorch the soldiers it didnt work so well as she might have hoped one or two of the americans instead of getting angry were fighting laughter a couple of the men in greengray stayed with major hannebrink to stand guard on mcgregor and his family the rest went back into the house occasional crashes from within said they were indeed turning the place inside out hannebrink might have thought maude was calm mcgregor knew better he set a hand on his wifes shoulder to keep her from hurling herself at the american major julia looked furious and made no effort at all to hide it after an hour or so the sergeant came out and said sir the worst thing theyve got in there is kerosene for the lamps its good for killing lice too mary said looking right at hannebrink his lips thinned that got home but he said only well have a look in the barn then he gestured with the in his hand come on mcgregor you can watch and make sure we dont steal anything youve already stolen more from me than you can ever give back he answered he knew why major hannebrink wanted him along in the hope that hed give something away hannebrink turned to the women you can go clean up now he said that should give you something to do for the rest of the day in the barn the us soldiers methodically went through everything climbing up into the loft to poke their bayonets into the hay in the hope of finding hidden dynamite and also searching all the animals stalls they opened every crate they dumped the drawers set into mcgregors workbench out onto the ground and pawed over his chisels and drill bits and screwdrivers his twine and his carpenters rule he wondered if hed somehow made a mistake if hed put one of the bombbuilding tools in among the others the lowvoiced curses of the men in greengray said he hadnt he glanced toward the old wagon wheel there it lay rust on the iron tire half covered with straw one of the soldiers strode around it to get at a box by the far wall he used a pry bar to open the box whose lid was nailed shut then he turned it upside down a couple of horseshoes that had worn thin a broken scythe blade and some other scrap iron spilled out onto the ground with a series of clanks thanks mcgregor said forgot i had that junk lying around i can do something with it i expect go to hell you damn murdering canuck the yankee soldier snapped he took a long step over the wagon wheel and glared into mcgregors face mcgregor neither moved back nor blinked evenly he said youre the people who know all about murdering before the soldier could reply major hannebrink broke in enough neugebauer the private in greengray stiffened to obedient attention hannebrink went on we dont know that mcgregor here is a murderer were trying to find out he turned to the farmer so far we have no evidence only a man who thinks he has a reason to be angry at us you had no evidence against my son either mcgregor said not lunging at the us officer was one of the hardest things hed ever done you didnt need any you shot him without it i had evidence i thought good hannebrink said i did my duty to my country i would do it again i believe that mcgregor said i dont know why youre bothering with this rigmarole if you need evidence against me you can always plant it whenever you please then youll haul me off to jail and shoot me same as you did with alexander hannebrink exhaled through his nose if i have no evidence against you i have no quarrel with you if you arent the man whos been planting bombs hither and yon through the countryside i dont want to waste my time on you i want to catch the son of a bitch who is doing that and make him pay he sounded sincere but then to be good at his job he needed to sound sincere mcgregor answered if i was crazy enough to make bombs i wouldnt plant em hither and yon through the countryside he pointed to hannebrink id go after you one of those bombs almost did kill me the us major said really mcgregor was calm casual cool too bad it missed id buy a beer for the fellow who got you and then id hit him over the head with my mug for doing it before i could you ought to bring him in for sedition sir said the privateneugebauerwhod stepped over and around mcgregors bombmaking supplies hannebrink shook his head raising his voice a little he asked anything here even a little out of the ordinary no sir the soldiers answered almost in chorus hannebrink shook his head again then ive got no reason to bring him in he does have some reason not to be in love with me that doesnt worry me i did what i thought was right and ill live with it lets go back to town boys when they walked out to their fords they discovered that each of them had a punctured inner tube cursing the soldiers set about patching the punctures mcgregor wanted to smile he didnt he was too worried all the soldiers had been back at the barn and major hannebrink folded his arms across his chest if these punctures turn out to be knife cuts mr mcgregor i am not going to be pleased with your family i warn you oh mary mcgregor thought what have you done but then a soldier at the nearer motorcar said sir we got a nail in this one dont know what did this one sir said neugebauer who was holding the inner tube from the other ford but it looks like a hole not a cut anybody see anything hannebrink asked none of the us soldiers answered mcgregor realized he hadnt been breathing and sucked in a long ragged inhalation the soldiers wouldnt be thinking about a little girl even hannebrink who was professionally suspicious wouldnt be thinking about a little girl maude maybe but not mary hannebrink pursed his lips no evidence he said maybe we picked up those punctures on the way over here maybe it could have happened since i cant prove it didnt happen that way im going to leave it alone but if it ever happens here again mr mcgregor someone is going to be very unhappy and it wont be me why are you barking at me mcgregor asked i was in the barn with you and your hooligans for once he was telling the whole truth it sounded no different from his lies hannebrink didnt answer he waited while his men fixed the punctures which they handled with practiced efficiency then all the yank soldiers piled into the motorcars and drove off mcgregor waited till theyd left his land then he walked into the house his wife was furious they turned everything upside down and inside out those dirty she hissed like a cat with its fur puffed out then went on i wish i was a man so i could say what i think never mind mcgregor said which made maude hiss again ignoring her he went over to mary he knelt down and kissed her on the forehead this is for what you did and for being clever enough to use a nail and not a knife then he spanked her hard enough to make her yelp in both surprise and pain and this is to remind you not to do it again no matter how much you want to his younger daughter stared how did you know it was me pa you were inside the barn with the yankees you couldnt see it how did i know because im your father thats how this time im proud of you you little sneak some things you can only get away with once though this is one of them remember it yes pa mary said demurely so demurely that mcgregor could only hope shed paid some attentiona little attentionto what hed told her the big guns rumbled and roared the bombardment of nashville itself hadnt stopped since the us guns got close enough to reach the city lieutenant colonel irving morrell had long since got used to that rumble from the western horizon closer but still west of his position on the northern bank of the cumberland another bombardment lay its thunder over the more distant rumble for the past six days us artillery had been hammering the confederate positions south of the river with high explosives and gas bombing aeroplanes had added the weight of their munitions to the unending gunfire fighting scouts swooped low strafing the rebels trenches with their machine guns general custer could hardly have made it more obvious where he intended to throw first army across the cumberland he had even been rash enough to let them get glimpses of the barrels he was gathering for his frontal blow and the confederates having such generosity bestowed upon them were not slow to take advantage of it though the us artillery hampered their movements they brought reinforcements forward their own guns pounded away at the force custer had assembled their aeroplanes were outnumbered but still stung the us soldiers waiting on custers order to cross the river irving morrell looked west with benign approval beside him colonel ned sherrard pulled out his watch morrell imitated the gesture together they said five minutes to go sherrard put his watch back into its pocket he said how does it feel to have the whole first army moving to a scheme you thought up ask me in a few days morrell answered if it goes the way i hope itll feel great if it doesnt ill be so low a deep dugout will look like up to me as he watched the second hand of his own watch sweep into its final minutes before the curtain went up he realized how much he had riding on the next few days he would soon know the answer to a question so many men ask themselves are you really as smart as you think you are if he was hed be wearing a colonels eagles himself soon or maybe even a brigadier generals single stars if he wasnt hed be a lieutenant colonel if he stayed in the army for the next fifty years and no one would pay any attention to him during all that time compared to failure dying on the battlefield had its attractions fifteen sec he started to say and then the guns behind him the guns that had stayed hidden under canvas and branches the guns that had remained silent for so long while their brethren pounded the confederates to the west opened up with everything they had against the thinned rebel line just east of lakewood tennessee on the far side of the cumberland earth leapt and danced and quivered in agony a flight of bombers added their explosives to the attack as they were doing farther west under the cover of the bombardment army engineers rushed to the bank of the cumberland and began building half a dozen pontoon bridges across the river everything depended on the sappers if they could get those bridges built fast enough the rest of morrells plan would unfold as hed designed it if they failed he failed with them he wanted to stay and watch them work he knew what was riding on their shoulders already a few of them had fallen from machinegun fire and from shells falling too near the rest kept on that was their job colonel sherrard reminded him of his job into the barrel irv as soon as those bridges get across we go sherrard shouted at the top of his lungs right into morrells ear morrell barely heard him he thought about pretending he didnt hear him so he could keep on watching the sappers but knew sherrard was right he trotted off toward his barrel like all the others waiting to cross the cumberland it had come here by night to keep prying rebel observation aeroplanes from spotting it like the artillery concentrated by similarly stealthy means it had hidden under canvas since arriving now the canvas was off the columns of barrels were ready to go forward if they could and irving morrells would go first he nodded to the driver reached down and slapped the rightside engineer on the back and then unable to bear being cooped up in this great iron box opened the top hatch and stood up in the cupola he had to watch the engineers at work he had to watch the bridges snake across the cumberland if one was wrecked he could go with five if two were wrecked he could go with four if three were wrecked he had orders not to go but thought he might disobey them but all six bridges still pushed forward toward the southern bank of the springswollen river general custers ostentatious preparation had pulled the confederate defenders closer to nashville not many men not many guns were left to contest what would be the real crossing riflemen and machinegun crews in greengray rushed to the ends of the extending bridges as they neared the far bank of the cumberland they started blazing away at the confederates closest to the river men who already risked their lives thanks to us artillery fire a green flareone of the bridges had reached the southern bank a moment later another one burned in the sky the rest of the engineering crews worked like madmen the sappers were as fiercely competitive as any soldiers god ever made a third green flare blazed from the southern bank of the cumberland morrell ducked down into the cupola fire em up he shouted were going the twin white truck engines bellowed to life the iron deck patterned to keep feet from slipping shivered and rattled and shook under his boots maybe he was jumping the gun but he didnt think so one of those last three bridges would surely succeed in making it across and even if it didnthe stood up again to stare across the cumberland there the fourth green flare now he could go with no reservations whatever some of the other barrel commanders were also standing up in their cupolas he waved to them they waved back hed also detailed a soldier with a hammer to run down each line of barrels and give the side of every machine in it a good solid clang to signal that action was at hand more engines coughed and belched and caught even as morrell stooped down into the cupola once more the sixth and last green flare rose into the sky he grinned so far everything was perfect the way to keep it perfect was to push hard never let the confederates have a chance to build a defensive line of the sort theyd held so well for so long north of nashville off balance he muttered to himself not that anyone else in the barrel could have heard him even had he shouted got to keep them off balance he pointed straight ahead index finger extended forward forward the barrel went adding the clatter and rattle of the tracks to the engines flatulent roar morrell stood up again the driver had his louvers open he could see as much as he ever could which wasnt a great deal but it was enough to let him get onto the bridge over which he would cross the cumberland the bridge dipped and swayed a little under the weight of the barrel but held at the machines best paceabout that of a trotting soldier in full kitit waddled over the bridge barrels also crossed on two more bridges on the other three infantry marched at double time a jolt and the barrel clattered off the bridge and onto the soft dirt of the southern bank of the cumberland for a bad moment morrell thought the dirt would be soft enough to make the barrel bog down but engines screaming the machine moved ahead and onto ground better able to support its weight machinegun bullets clattered off the barrels armored carapace the two lefthand machine guns returned fire the confederate gun fell silent maybe theyd knocked it out maybe its crew had been so busy shooting at the barrel us infantry were able to rush them morrell had seen that before barrels were machinegun magnets attracting fire that might have been more profitably aimed against foot soldiers now morrell had the vision louvers down to slits through those slits he saw confederate soldiers moving forward now that the barrage had passed them by to punish targets farther behind the line halt he signaled and reached forward with a length of dowling to tap one of the artillerymen at the nose cannon on the shoulder they had no trouble figuring out the target he had in mind the cannon snarled once then again the noise wasnt too much worse than everything else going on inside the barrel through the slits morrell watched oncoming rebs get flung aside as if they were paper dolls the men in butternut who came through unhurt had to dive for cover forward morrell signaled again forward they went through the confederate defensive system the rebs had a lot of trench lines but not very many men in them the barrel crews concentrated on wrecking machinegun positions those guns could tear the heart from an infantry attack and had torn the heart from many one after another the barrels put them out of action then quite suddenlyor so it seemedthe barrels had traversed all the confederate trenches and reached the level ground behind them a few cs artillery pieces were still firing more had been pulled back and out of the pits from which they had shelled us forces and quite a few were wrecked morrells traveling fortress rumbled past a quickfiring threeinch gun whose barrel had burst not far from the breech us shells had wrecked the carriage most of the crew lay dead by the piece at the end of the trail sat one of the gunners his head in his hands a picture of despair his war was over soon the infantry advancing with the barrels would scoop him up southwest morrell signaled he stood up in the cupola again to compare the field to the map he carried inside his head if anything what he saw looked better than what he had imagined and presented to general custer open country he said exultantly weve got the rebs out of their holes at last they know how to fight from trenches but now were playing a different game there ahead a railroad line ran toward nashville along it chugged a train full of soldiers the engineer blissfully unaware the united states army had broken through a cannon shell through the boiler brought him the news gleefully the machine gunners in morrells barrel raked the train forward he signaled again he intended his thrust to cut off and outflank the rebs who were defending nashville from the rest of first army keep going he muttered weve got to keep going you dont get what you want by doing things halfway i dont want to scare these bastards i want to wreck em on rumbled the barrel for the moment the csa seemed to have little with which to stop it cassius tossed scipio a tredegar automatically scipio caught it out of the air automatically he checked the chamber it had a round in it he pulled off the clip by its weight it was full you is one o we kip cassius said and tossed him a couple of more tenround boxes when we fights de feudal pressors you fights wid we the men of the congaree socialist republic hadnt trusted him with a rifle in his hands since hed returned to the swamps by the river that gave the republic its name he looked around cherry aint here he remarked cassius expression turned sour she still huntin dat damnfool treasure miss anne never hid no kind of way she kin hunt till she git all old an shriveled up scipio said if they aint nothin there she aint gwine find it she keep huntin she don live to git all old an shriveled up cassius answered miss anne she put de militia round marshlands dey catch cherry an de poor fools she got with she i hope they do cassius thought dear god i hope they do cherry knew him for the cold heart for the weak spirit he was she knew he had no true revolutionary fire in his belly knew and despised him for it if anne colleton caught her scipio would do nothing but rejoice in one pocket of his tattered dungarees he had a letter addressed to anne colleton in st matthews getting hold of paper and pencil hadnt been too hard even laying his hands on an envelope hadnt been too hard finding a postage stamp though finally hed seen a dice game where one of the raiders was tearing stamps off a sheet a few at a time to cover his losses scipio had had almost no money in his own pockets but he got down on one knee as fast as he could luck was with him hed rolled a seven his first try out and then made his pointit was four which made it tougherso that before long several small red portraits of james longstreet took up residence alongside his pocket change one of them was on the envelope now cassius said wes gwine up to hit gadsden a lick tonight we aint done no fightin no th o the congaree in a while them fat white bastards up there they reckons theys safe from de force o revolutionary justice i aims to show they that they is mistooken you goes up there you draws the militia up there after you scipio said not so many white sojers around marshlands after dat cherry she can dig all she like i knows it cassius said caint be helped he was by no means enamored of cherry or her search for the treasure both he and scipio were convinced did not exist then cassius turned his gaze on scipio he still had a hunters eyesor maybe they were snipers eyes he didnt say anything he didnt need to say anything his expression spoke more plainly than words yes youve got a rifle in your hands it declared you dont dare use it against me or any of the other revolutionary fighters here youd have only one shot sent in the wrong direction and then youd be minebecause you and i both know that if that one shot is at me youll miss and i wont scipio sighed hed always been a halfhearted red at best he wasnt even that any more he was a man trapped in a nightmare with enemies on all sides and no way out he saw no way to take cassius with him when he fell as he surely would fall he did have hopes of bringing down cherryor if cherry got extraordinarily lucky of bringing down miss anne but cassius cassius was a force of nature the force of nature joined scipio and a couple of other men in a battered rowboat and glided north through the swamps of the congaree several other boats followed cassius knew the ways through the maze of twisting channels starlight was all he needed each of the other boats carried at least one man who knew the swamps almost as well something floated by overhead scipios blood ran cold the part of his mind that the colletons had spared no trouble or expense to educate insisted it was only an owl the part of him that had grown up in one of those clapboard cabins a world away from the marshlands mansion by which they sat said it was something worse something ghostly something that would lure them all into the heart of the swamp and never let them escape then it hooted and he felt foolish more often than not the educated part of his mind did have some notion of what it was talking about but the other part was older with roots that went down deeper education ruled his brain his belly his heart his balls no do jesus one of the oarsmen said his voice a shaky whisper i reckoned that were one o they bad hants the kind that dont never let you come out othe swamp no more scipio hadnt been the only one frightened then cassius said aint no hant can stand up against dialectical materialism his new beliefs had overpowered the older ones almost scipio envied him for that almost cassius new beliefs had overpowered his good judgment too and these tattered remnants of the congaree socialist republic the reds had hoped to establish were the proof of that cassius did not would not see defeat only a setback on the inevitable road to revolution he could no more deny that inevitability than a devout christian could the inevitability of the second coming trees and bushes began to thin out as the boats full of reds neared the edge of the swamp ahead across fields once full of tobacco and cotton and rice that now held mostly weeds the lights of gadsden shone a few houses bright with electricity more showing the softer yellower light of burning gas most of the houses showed no lights at all most people like most people all over the world had to get up and go to work in the morning cassius waved the men at the oars brought the rowboat up against the bank of the creek that fed into the congaree it grounded softly on mud the other boats came up alongside black men with rifles clambered out of them lets go comrades cassius said in a low but penetrating voice time fo de buckra to learn some more ode price de pressors pay he left one man behind to guard the boats scipio wished he could have been that man but knew better than to show it the revolutionaries did not trust him enough to let him out of their sight cassius might have but he did not try to override the opinion of the others since they were right and he wrong that was as well for their cause if not for scipios a motorcar chugged along the road toward town the driver never saw cassius and his men for he led them along paths he knew through the overgrown fields they went past a couple of mansions both dark and silent and deserted few great landowners around the congaree dared live among the dozens of negro servants and field hands needed to make a plantation and mansion live not these days they didnt militiamenthe too old and the too youngstumped along the streets of gadsden one of them was rash enough to carry a kerosene lantern cassius let out a soft chuckle look at that damnfool buckra goin roun like he a night watchman sayin twelve oclock an alls well it aint no twelve oclock an it aint well neither he raised his tredegar to his shoulder in one fluid motion aimed and fired the militiaman dropped the lantern with a shriek the burning puddle of kerosene set fire to the boards of the sidewalk another militiaman fired at the sound of cassius shot and perhaps at the muzzle flash his bullet didnt come close three negroes fired at the flash from his rifle he screamed too one of those rounds must have struck home come on cassius said he advanced on gadsden in long loping groundeating strides black shadows in the black night the reds ran after him scipio panted along with the rest doing his best to keep up the factory work hed done had hardened him he wasnt the swiftest here nor anywhere close to it but he wasnt the slowest either a bell began clanging in the center of town probably a fire alarm turned to a new purpose here and there lights came on in upper stories as people got ready to come out and fight or simply tried to find out what was going on the raiders fired whenever those lights gave them targets more screams rose slower than it should have came a cry that made sense niggers its the red niggers militiamen and whoever else could lay hands on a rifle or shotgun or pistol started banging away sometimes at the negroes who ran through the streets but as often at one another the townsfolk had not been raided for a while and so did not put up the kind of energetic organized defense the whites of st matthews for instance might have shown scipio darted along market street toward the corner of williams a whitebearded militiaman dashed from williams out onto market just as scipio got to the corner they both stared in horror scipio shot first before the old mans rifle had quite come to bear on him the militiaman fired as he fell the bullet cracked past scipios head seeing the militiaman still trying to work the bolt on his rifle scipio shot him again in the head he didnt move after that he wasnt the first white man scipio had killed but scipio hadnt wanted to shoot him hed got in the way that was all at the corner of williams and market stood a castiron mailbox scipio threw his note to anne colleton into it then ran on the men of the congaree socialist republic shot whomever they could shoot started half a dozen fires and then at cassius shouted command melted away into the night some of the younger and more intrepid militiamen and townsfolk tried to pursue but the negroes knew where they were going and the whites did not escape proved easy enough dont lose a man not one cassius exulted when they got back to the boats we tears that town to hell and gonehe pointed back toward the leaping flamesand we dont lose a man is that a great raid or is it aint that a great raid cass scipio said solemnly a great raid thegreatwar breakthroughs nashville is ours and fairly won lieutenant general george armstrong custer exulted standing in front of the badly damaged state capitol of tennessee correspondents again hung on his every word and he had plenty of words to keep them hanging we smashed their line north of the cumberland when no one thought we could we crossed the cumberland when no one thought we could and now more than half a century after an unjust and ignominious peace forced us to evacuate nashville the stars and stripes wave over it once more as he had on the other side of the cumberland major abner dowling listened with mixed emotions to the general commanding first army custers bombast always gave him the pip but now by god custer had plenty to be bombastic about hed gained two smashing victories over the confederates in the space of a month people with greater reputations had done less where do we go from here general one of the scribes asked forward against the foe custer said grandly before dowling could spoil the proceedings by throwing up on his superiors shoes custer did something most unusual for himhe gave a sensible reason for one of his rhetorical flights of fancy more than that i am not at liberty to say lest the rebels learn in our papers what their spies could not tell them how long can the rebs stand up under this kind of pounding sir another reporter said you need to ask that question in richmond jack not here custer said chuckling he added as long as the rebs still own richmond anyhow if they start using barrels back east the way weve taught them here the confederate states may not keep their capital very long with russia in revolution with france tottering and french soldiers throwing down their guns or turning them on their own officers with england stretched to the breaking point and the csa hammered on several fronts how long can the entente go on how long can the war go on jack asked until the united states and germany win their rightful places in the sun and until those places are recognized by all the powers in the world custer said it could be tomorrow it could be five years hence however long it takes we shall persevere he struck one of his poses if the rebs do throw in their hand general what sort of peace would you recommend imposing on them somebody asked before custer could get started on that one abner dowling stepped in boys thats not the sort of question you ask a soldier thats a question for the president or the secretary of state or for congress part of his jobno small part of his jobwas keeping the general commanding first army from embarrassing not only himself but his country given general custers nature it wasnt an easy job with a laugh custer said dont worry major they know im not one of the boys in the morning coats and striped trousers all they asked was what i would recommend and im happy to tell them that much sir i dont really think you dowling began it was hopeless custer rolled over him like a barrel smashing barbed wire into the mud if it were up to me i would impose upon the confederate states a peace that would prevent them from ever again threatening the peace and security of the united states twice now they have rubbed our faces in the dirt they came too close to doing it once more in this great war they should never ever have another chance on the whole dowling agreed with him which made custers adjutant want to reexamine his own assumptions but there were dangers with a punitive peace too as one of the correspondents recognized what if our terms are so harsh the confederates would sooner take their chances on the battlefield than accept them bully custer boomed so much the better in that case i confidently believe the restoration of the union by force of arms which unfortunately failed when first attempted under the inept leadership of abraham lincoln would now in gods good time at last come to pass he did give good copy the newspapermen jotted phrases in their notebooks abner dowling was of the opinion that his boss had to be suffering from a touch of the sun crossing the cumberland had been a splendid feat of arms no doubt about it even so a hell of a lot of ground lay between nashville and mobile dowling said i think thats about enough boys remember that youre asking these questions inside nashville if that doesnt speak for itself i dont know what does i dont mind answering questions custer said i could stand here all day and enjoy every minute of it dowling knew how true that was every question custer answered meant another line maybe another paragraph in the papers seeing his name in print was meat and drink to the general commanding first army but his insistence on his own stamina reminded the correspondents that he had considerably surpassed his biblical threescore and ten they drifted away by ones and twos to file their stories custer gave his adjutant a sour look i was just warming to the subject major why did you go and cut me off at the knees they already know youre a hero sir dowling said he smiled to himself watching custer lap that up like a kitten with a pitcher of cream after a couple of seconds though that inner smile slipped custer really was a hero and dowling reluctantly admitted to himself really deserved to be the portly major went on besides sir we truly do have to plan the axis of first armys next attack after lighting a cigar custer blew smoke in dowlings face i suppose so major he said with poor grace but blast me if i know why were bothering the geniuses in philadelphia will tell us what to do delivering their orders in a chariot of fire from on high as if from the hand of god himselfand it will work as well as their doctrine on barrels you mark my words having vented steam he let his adjutant lead him back into the capitol the southern wing was more nearly intact than the northern first army headquarters had been established there in the map room an enormous chart of tennessee was thumbtacked to one wall two red arrows projected out from nashville one southeast toward murfreesboro the other southwest toward memphis better than two hundred miles away as far as dowling was concerned that second line was madness an exercise in hubris but it attracted custer as much as a pretty housekeeper did by pushing in that direction major we can lend aid to the attack on memphis thats been developing in arkansas he insisted keeping custer connected with reality was dowlings main assignment sir the tennessee river is in the way he said as diplomatically as he could not only that the attack from arkansas has been developing since and it hasnt developed yet jonesboro has fallen custer said yesat last dowling said certain the sarcasm would fly over the head of the general commanding first army as indeed it did stubbornly custers adjutant went on expecting anything from a campaign west of the mississippi is whistling in the dark sir we just dont have the forces over there to do all we want if the rebs werent shy of men west of the river too wed be in worse shape there than we are well draw off their defenders custer said they havent got enough men on this side of the river either that held just enough truth to make it tempting but not enough to make it valuable in thoughtful tones dowling said well you may be right sir ive heard brigadier general macarthur find some good reasons for the advance in the direction of memphis hed gauged that about right custers peroxided mustache twitched he screwed up his mouth as if hed bitten into a lemon the only direction of advance daniel macarthur knows anything about is the one in the direction of the newspapers he sneered takes one to know one dowling thought brigadier general macarthur with his trademark cigarette holder courted publicity the way stockbrokers courted chorus girls did custer refuse to admit to anyone else that he did the same thing or did he refuse to admit it to himself too despite his long association with the general commanding first army dowling hadnt ever been able to decide custer said i wonder what lieutenant colonelno colonel you did send in that promotion didnt youmorrells view is i did send in that promotion yes sir dowling said good custer said good i wonder what morrell thinks yes i do now there is a man with a good head on his shoulders who thinks of his country first and his own glory second hes not a grandstander like some people i could name a very solid man morrell yes sir dowling said custer approved of him because his plan had brought custer fame but it had brought custer fame because it worked dowling didnt think morrell so unselfishly patriotic as custer did but he didnt mind ambition in a man if it didnt consume him and custer muttered more than half to himself i had better find out in which direction libbie thinks we should go that would be a good idea sir dowling said enthusiasticallyso enthusiastically custer gave him a dirty look dowling didnt care that libbie kept the general commanding first army from rumpling serving women he did care that libbie had shown herself to be the brains of the custer family whenever she shared living quarters with the general first army fought better custer said whether we move against murfreesboro or memphis we have to strike hard his adjutant nodded custers one great military virtue was aggressiveness that aggressiveness had cost the lives of thousands of men because it meant custer kept trying to ram his head through the stone walls the csa kept building against him but when barrels finally gave him the means to do some real ramming he made the most of them as a more subtle general might have been unable to do we have to strike hard he repeated if we but strike hard the whole rotten edifice of the confederate states of america will come tumbling down a year earlier dowling would have reckoned that the statement of a madman six months earlier he would have thought it the statement of a fool now he nodded solemnly and said sir i think you may be right reggie bartletts hospital gown was of a washedout butternut not a pale greengray like those of most of the inmates of the military hospital outside st louis for good measure the gown had prisoner stenciled across the chest in bloodred letters four inches high he could get around pretty well with one crutch these days which was a good thing because the shoulder that had taken a machinegun bullet was still too tender to let him use two crutches the doctors kept insisting the wound infection was clearing up but it wasnt clearing up anywhere near fast enough to suit him he made it to the toilets adjoining the room where he and his companions spent so much time on their backs eased himself and slowly returned to his bed took you long enough one of the yankees said i figured you were trying to escape the way you keep bragging that you did before pretty soon bob pretty soon reggie answered just not quite yet is all shoot bob didnt you know said another wounded us soldier this one named pete reggie started escaping day before yesterday but hes so damn slow this is as far as hes gotten you go to hell too pete reggie said he took care not to sound too angry though petes left leg was gone above the knee blown off by a confederate shell somewhere in arkansas bartlett sat on the edge of his bed and leaned his crutch against the wall next to it that was the easy part what came afterwards wasnt so easy he used his sound right arm to help drag his wounded right leg up onto the mattress the leg was getting better too but while it was on the way it hadnt arrived yet once he was sitting with both legs out before him he eased himself down flat onto his back that hurt worse the shoulder felt as if it had a toothache in there a dull pain that never went away and sometimes flared to malevolent heights sweat sprang out on his forehead at the wounds bite after he lay still for a while it dropped back to a level he could bear more easily you all right reggie bob asked tone solicitous as if bartlett had been from massachusetts or michigan himself pain was the common foe here not too bad reggie said ill tell you though this whole business of war would be a hell of a lot more fun if you didnt get shot that drew loud agreement from the yankees on the other beds in the room they made the old fools who ordered this war go out and fight it it never wouldve lasted five minutes bob said tell me the truth boysis that so or isnt it again most of the wounded men in the ward agreed but pete said i dont know about that roosevelt fought in the second mexican war when he was our age well thats a facthe did bob allowed he fought one mediumsized battle against the limeys licked em and they went home that was plenty to make him a hero back then we fight the rebs or the canucks do they go home with their tails between their legs on account of we lick em once we all know bettern that dont we none of usd be here if the bastards on the other side ran away quick pete said he grinned well reggie would i reckon but he dont count anyway you damnyankees dont run either the way you did the last couple of times we fought you bartlett said returning verbal fire wish to jesus you did i wouldnt have these damn holes in me and ill tell you i liked life a lot better before i got ventilated out in the hallway a faint squeak of wheels and rattle of crockery announced the coming of the lunch cart as the wounded soldiers from both sides were united in their struggle against pain so they were also united in their loathing of what the hospital fed them reggie gagged down yet another meal of mediumboiled egg beef broth stewed prunes and a pudding that tasted as if it were made from four parts library paste and one part sugar when the nurse took away his dishes she clicked her tongue between her teeth in reproof how do you expect to get better if you dont eat more maam if you give me beefsteak i will eat a slab the size of this mattress and ask you kindly for seconds if you give me fried chicken i will build you a new wing to this hospital from the bones if you give me pork chops i will gobble them down till i grow a little curly tail but maam if you feed me slops you wouldnt give the pigs you got the pork chops from i will waste away and perish thats telling her reb one of the wounded us soldiers said several others clapped their hands the nurse looked furious you are getting a nourishing meal suited to your digestion and you ought to be grateful the united states are giving it to you instead of letting you starve the way you deserve we have yankee prisoners too maam bartlett said they get doctors they get food same as i do here if they dont get better food than i do here why im sorry for em and thats a fact he hadnt made a friend the nurse set hands on hips you are getting exactly the same meal as wounded american soldiers she said coldly im an american bartlett said what do you think i am a chinaman a troublemaker the nurse answered by her expression that was worse than a chinaman and by a good distance too she rolled the cart away from reggies bed her back still radiated outrage dont nobody hook the rebs pudding tomorrow pete said when she was gone not unless you want to eat the glass ground up in it too only thing groundup glass would do for that pudding is make it better reggie said and nobody seemed inclined to tell him he was wrong the next morning bob got promoted to a different ward one a step closer to eventual release in his place an attendant wheeled in another confederate prisonera negro with a bandaged stump where his left foot should have been he grunted with pain as he got into bobs bed nobody knew what to do or what to say the wounded us soldiers looked in reggie bartletts direction the us army still did not allow negroes to serve though theyd been able to join the us navy for years in the csa the very idea of black men in uniform remained strange though the pressure of fighting a larger more populous foe had forced it on the ruling whites reggie found one question he could safely ask where did you get hit he had trouble figuring out what sort of tone to use a lifetimes experience had taught him he was superior to any black man ever born but this negro was a fellow soldier and they were both prisoners of the yankees hardly an exalted status outside o jonesboro arkansas the newly arrived black answered he also spoke cautiously how about you over in sequoyah in the red river bottomlands bartlett hesitated then gave his name and said whore you rehoboam my ma and pa called me out othe good book the negro said he was very very black with a low flat nose and small ears before he was wounded hed probably been strong and muscular now his skin sagged as it did on men whod lost a lot of flesh in a hurry after another moments thought he added had me a stripe on my sleeve fore i got shot he said it in a way that made bartlett believe him it also made reggie smile cant pull rank on me rehoboam he said i had one too we got the same rank now rehoboam said wes prisoners yeah i was thinking the same thing reggie said nodding when hed been in prison camp before over in west virginia the yankees had used captured negro laborers to lord it over their white prisoners of war and to spy on them too the blacks there had taken savage pleasure in doing just that enjoying being on top instead of on the bottom rehoboam didnt seem inclined to act like that but he didnt act submissive either the way he surely would have back in the csa bartlett didnt know what to make of him the idea of simple equality with a negro had never crossed his mind outside of jonesboro eh pete said craighead forest sure as the devil rehoboam answered he looked over toward the us soldier you after pete nodded the negro went this great big old damnyankee officer was screamin about god and jesus an i dont know what all else an he went an shot me he was runnin way the hell out in front of his menballs like an elephant i reckon but he was crazy you ask me i even think i know about the guy you mean pete said mcswenson something like that from what ive heard about him youre righthes nuts leastways you know who got you thats something me shell went off and the next thing i knew i was shy a pin he patted his short stump one of the other wounded us soldiers asked rehoboam were you a red before you put on a confederate uniform maybe i was rehoboam answered but maybe i wasnt too he gave reggie a sidelong look nobody asked me nothin about that when i went into the army so i dont reckon i got to talk about it now lets say you were the yank persisted how could you try and shoot the rebs one day and then fight for em the next if i wasand i aint sayin i was mind youi would have been tryin to make the csa a better place for me an black folks to live in either which way rehoboam said maybe thats why nobody asked me nothin about none o that when i walked into the recruitin office pete turned to bartlett how about it reggie how do you like havin a smoke like rehoboam fightin on your side once you rebs ran out of white men you could throw at us hey ill tell you this much reggie said id sure as hell sooner have him shooting at you damnyankees than at me now rehoboam gave him a measuring stare thats fair the negro said i aint got no trouble with that he spoke as if his opinion had as much weight as reggies in terms of law in the confederate states reggie realized rehoboams opinion did have as much weight as his or would the black man would surely get an honorable discharge when repatriated and that would make him a citizen of the csa not just a resident how you feelin rehoboam asked reggie legs getting better he answered they say the shoulder is too but damned if i can see it how about you my damn toes itch rehoboam said pointing to where they would be if still attached to the rest of him they aint there but they itch anyways oh lord i know what you mean pete said i reach down to scratch sometimes and im scratching air as a negro rehoboam might not have fit into the ward as a wounded man he fit fine reggie bartlett pondered that he had a lot of time in which to ponder it too he wasnt going anywhere certainly not very fast general leonard wood appeared before the houses transportation committee to testify about the difficulties in civilian railroad transport caused by the enormous demands the army was putting on the rail system of the united states as the chief of the us general staff droned on about millions of manmiles traveled flora hamburger jotted the occasional note wood was forceful and intelligent but she found his subject matter distinctly uninspiring she wished the speaker of the house had assigned her to some other committee but since she was a socialist without seniority nobodyleast of all the speakercared about what she wished but transportation wasnt the worst committee because so many types of legislation involved its subject in one way or another she could have ended up on the forestry committee that would have been a choice assignment for a representative from new yorks lower east side being the most junior member of the committee and of a minority party to boot she had to wait a long time for her turn to question general wood when at last it came her first question was different from those the chief of the general staff had been getting from other congressmen why are the us forces in the east so slow to adopt the mass use of barrels that has proved so effective in tennessee the chairman rapped loudly for order that question is not germane at this time miss hamburger he said it falls under the purview of the military affairs committee not our own mr taft the question may not be germane to you but it is very important to me flora answered my brother is a private and he asked me in a letter to ask that question if i ever had that chance i can introduce the letter into the record if you like william howard tafts round plump facenot at all suited to the upthrust kaiser bill mustache he woreturned red flora hid a smile if the chairman silenced her now he would also be silencing a man in uniform a man whom the democrats policies had put into uniform that would give the socialists all sorts of lovely ammunition flora could already imagine speeches on how the democrats not content with starting the war were now concealing mistakes in how it was being fought taft had been in congress almost as long as flora had been alive he could figure out the angles too he turned to wood if the general pleases he may answer the question he said unhappily i will answer wood said scratching at his gray mustache they have pioneered a new way of using barrels out in tennessee we had formerly employed a different doctrine throughout the army now that the western way has shown itself to give better results we are extending its use to other fronts these things do take a certain amount of time though maam so it would seem flora said otherwise you wouldnt have kept theis mistaken too strong a worddoctrine for the past year can you estimate how many men have died because of it congressman taft looked unhappier still that hed allowed the first question having allowed it though he could hardly shield wood from the question jowls quivering he nodded to the chief of the general staff no i cannot give any firm answer to that maam wood said i can only tell you that we have from the beginning prosecuted this war to the best of our ability we are but men we have made mistakes when we discover a better way of using any equipment we take advantage of it i regret the extra casualties we surely suffered because we did not know so much then as we do now my training was as a physician i regret any and all human suffering believe me to her surprise flora did believe him his long mournful face and slow deep voice made her have a hard time picturing him as a liar still she persisted in her own line of questioning how did they happen to be right in tennessee when all the best thinkers in the war department were gathered together here in philadelphia to come up withthe wrong answer let me give you a comparison i think youll understand maam general wood said suppose youre in a kitchen and patronizing flora hamburger was not a good idea ive spent most of my time in factories and offices she snapped i fear i dont know so much about kitchens that was stretching a point shed helped her mother every day after getting home from work but she was not about to let him treat her like a housewife instead of a us representative please answer the question without kitchen comparisons yes maam wood said crisply if her pinning his ears back angered him he didnt show it we designed the doctrine at the same time as we were designing the machines themselves any time you do something like that you take the chance of not getting everything perfectly right general custer tried something different it proved to work better than anything wed done with the doctrine we had before and we will take advantage of that from now on flora nodded reluctantly it was a good answer wood had spent a lot of time testifying before congress representative taft beamed with relief if the distinguished lady from new york has no further questions we can i do have one more flora said taft sighed since members of his own party had droned on and on over matters less consequential than those concerning barrels he could hardly shut her off without raising howls from the socialists he held out his hand to her palm up fingers spread to show she could go on thank you mr chairman she told him general wood if all that you say is so why did general custer have to violate war department orders against using barrels in any way except that prescribed by philadelphia in order to prove that his ideas were better than yours she hoped he would deny any such orders existed she knew they did not many socialists worked in the war department but the ones who did had a way of keeping their congressional delegation well informed about the departments inner workingsand its dirty laundry but leonard wood was too canny to let himself be caught in a lie he said maam we had done the best we could in philadelphia do please recall we did win victories with barrels used as we suggested maybe we would have done better using them from the start as general custer did but there are many other possible ways to use them too most of which are likely to have done worse than ours the main reason we tried to forbid all experimentation with barrels is that by the very nature of things most experiments fail general custers happened to succeed and he deserves the credit for it as he would deserve the blame had it gone wrong by his tone he thought custer deserved blame anyhow but he could have plausibly denied that and she had no documents to make him out a liar there anything else miss hamburger congressman taft asked flora shook her head the fat democrat got in a dig of his own nothing actually pertaining to trains mr chairman if the choice is between asking questions that have to do with how crowded trains are and how safe my brother is i know which questions i want to ask flora said i hope your brother stays safe miss hamburger general wood said despite our gains the fighting in virginia has been very hard thank you she said for a moment she was surprised he knew where david had been sent but only for a moment soldiers who happened to be related to members of congress no doubt had special files highranking officers could check at need any further questions from anyone taft asked no one spoke the chairman of the transportation committee asked another question do i hear a motion to adjourn he did and gaveled the session to a close later in her office flora was answering letters from constituents when her secretary came in and said general wood would like to see you for a few minutes maam send him right in bertha flora said i wonder what he wants she wondered if shed struck a nerve with her questions about barrels if he complained about those shed send him away with a flea in his ear into the inner office he strode erect soldierly the first words out of his mouth surprised her you did a good job of raking me over the coals there earlier this afternoon one of these days well sift all the socialist sneaks out of the war department but it isnt likely to be any time soon she didnt want to thank him but hed succeeded in disarming some of the hostility she felt you didnt come here just to tell me that she said no i didnt he answered i came here to tell you again that i wish all the best for your brother the st is a good unit and theyve compiled a record that will stand up against anyones i wish theyd never had to compile that kind of recordor any other kind of record for that matter flora said i understand general wood answered flora must have raised an eyebrow for he went on i do soldiers fight wars they know what goes into them glory is what happens afterwards what civilians make up not much glory will come out of this war even afterwards flora said hard to squeeze glory out of mud and lice and bullets and shells flying every which way wood surprised her again by nodding maybe that means we wont fight another one for a long time i hope to heaven it does he paused rubbed at his mustache and finally went on your brotherdavid isnt ityes david has already made more than an honorable contribution to our cause and to our ultimate victory if he were to request a transfer to say a clerical position or one of the supply services i think that request would be likely to receive favorable attention more favorable than if a seamstress daughter put in the same request flora asked the chief of the general staff did not answer which was an answer in itself almost despairingly flora said you put me in an impossible position you know if i keep him safe i take unfair advantage of who i am if i dont and anything happens to himi think you had better go general wood got to his feet i am sorry miss hamburger he said i hoped to ease your mind not to upset you good day out he strode shoulders back spine straight flora stared after him she didnt believe him he was too intelligent not to have understood every bit of what he was doing hed done it anyhow why just to upset her or to gain whatever advantage he could if she asked him to help david damn you general wood she muttered damn you anne colleton crouched in the brush that had advanced from the woods toward the ruins of the marshlands mansion with her crouched not only a squad of local militiamen but also a machinegun team from somewhere down by charleston shed almost had to go down on her knees in front of the governor to get them but they were here if hed asked her to go down on her knees in front of him when they were all alone shed have thought about doing that too that was how much she wanted to make sure her trap slammed shut hard in a back pocket of her mannish trousers she had a torn dirty scrap of paper with a few words written in a crisp elegant hand that did not match its stationery if what scipio told her was true if it wasnt true she was either wasting her time here or walking into a trap rather than setting one just for a moment her hand fell to the barrel of the scopesighted tredegar beside her any trap that tried closing on her would take some damage first off on the left of the little line sergeant willie metcalfe stiffened and let out a low hiss as if afraid that wouldnt be enough he turned his head so that he presented the ruined left half of his face to his comrades here they come he said in a hoarse whisper dont open up too soon anne ordered the militiamen shed said it before she would say it again let them get close let them get busy and then her voice still soft turned savage let them have it she stared avidly through the brush north toward the congaree the groundthe ground that should have been covered with cotton instead of overrun by weedssteamed as the sun rose higher and burned down on it through that thin shimmering mist she too made out the negroes heading for the mansion they were a ragged lot ragged and filthy but they carried themselves like fighting men their strides were quick and wary their heads never stopped moving she froze whenever they looked toward her and hoped her companions had the sense to do the same the militiamen she feared werent in the same class as the men of the congaree socialist republic if they kept the advantage of surprise they wouldnt need to be some of the negroes carried spades some rifles most both one in particular stalked along like a beast of prey in spite of the tredegar on his shoulder his shoulder anne took a longer look at that red rebel cherry she whispered her lips drew back from her teeth in a smile so ferocious that linus ashforth who crouched beside her involuntarily flinched away as from a wild beast anne never noticed the whitebearded militiaman her attention remained altogether focused on the negro woman who had been first her brothers lover and then as the red revolt began the instrument of jacob colletons death she didnt need long to realize that as she led the militiamen cherry bossed the negroes she bossed them imperiously bullying them into doing exactly as she required bitch hateful bitch anne thought never noticing how much cherrys style resembled her own we done tried over yonder dat side othe mansion cherrys voice floated across a hundred yards of open ground now we tries on dis side she led the reds over toward the side where anne and the militiamen waited dig you damn lazy niggers dig she set down the rifle and grabbed a spade herself they dug with her few would have been bold enough to argue cassius would have but cassius wasnt here anne let out a silent sigh had scipio handed her cherry and cassius both she might even have thought about forgiving him but cherry by herself was no small prize at my signal anne whispered to linus ashforth and to the man to her left pass it along the line they did she picked up her rifle she didnt aim at cherry not yet the militiamen stirred picking their own targets cherry was as alert as a beast of prey too she caught some tiny motion in the brush and let out a cry of alarm at the same instant anne shouted now she fired at one of the men whod just thrown down a shovel and was turning to grab for his rifle the turn only half completed he slumped bonelessly to the ground blood pouring from a wound in his flank all along the line of militiamen rifles barked the machine gun hammered away like a mad thing a couple of the reds managed to fall flat get hold of their rifles and fire back their fire did not last long methodical as factory workers the machine gunners traversed the muzzle of their weapon back and forth nothing on the ground in front of them could stay unhit for long seeing how things were cherry turned and ran anne had run once too when revolution broke out around her in charleston shed escaped cherry was not so lucky anne peered through the telescopic sight which made her target seem even closer than it wasand cherry would have been an easy shot for someone less handy with a rifle than she was she exhaled she pulled the trigger the tredegar kicked against her shoulder cherry toppled with a shriek anne started to break cover then hesitated one or more of the negroes the militiamen had shot down were liable to be shamming beside her linus ashforth did stand up sure as hell a bullet cracked past his head it could as easily have shattered his skull like a dropped flowerpot he dove for cover the machine gun hosed down the reds when willie metcalfe got to his feet no one fired at him lets see what weve got anne said coldbloodedly now she rose that one aint finished yet maam sergeant metcalfe pointed in the direction of cherry who was still trying to crawl away with a shattered lower leg he started to raise his own rifle no annes voice was sharp i want her alive you men she waved to the rest of the squad then pointed in the direction of the reds who had been digging see to them if any of them are still breathing finish them off she loped toward cherry behind her a couple of short flat cracks rang out nodding in satisfaction she trotted on she had a round in the chamber of her tredegar and was ready and more than ready to fire if the colored woman had a pistol tucked in the pocket or waistband of her tattered dungarees cherry snarled hatred at her but made no move to reach for a weapon white debbil bitch she said they was right all along damn them you never was nothinbut a goddamn liar you know all about lies dont you anne said evenly you told enough of them back before the rebellion i aint never told lies like you pressors tell de niggers and de poor stupid buckra and your ownselves cherry retorted she gathered herself though blood was puddling around her right calf dont try it anne advised her im too far away for you to reach me and i wont shoot you in the head ill try for somewhere that hurts more and takes longer kidney maybe or one in each shoulder to her surprise cherry nodded aint a patch on what i do to you i had you down shot on de ground the longing in the black womans voice made anne shiver though she was the one with the rifle she said after what you did to marshlands after what you did to my brother youve had your turn already aint cherry shook her head aint come close caint pay back three hundred years o pression in a day done whipped we and sploited we and sold we like we was horses and fucked we till we gots so many yaller niggers its a cryin shame no we aint come close anne heard the words she heard the accusations they didnt register not in any way that mattered she shook her head you rose up against us she said you stabbed us in the back while we were fighting the damnyankees and youyou when she tried to say what cherry in particular had done words failed her for one of the rare times in her life despite the pain from her ruined lower leg cherry smiled i knows what i done miss anne i was fuckin and suckin your brother and i was puttin on airs on account of it and you knows what else the smile got wider all the time that goddamn skinny little white dick was in me miss anne i never feel one thing never oncet without conscious thought ahead of conscious thought annes finger squeezed the trigger the tredegar roared the back of cherrys head exploded splashing blood and brains and pulverized bone over her and the ground around her she twitched and shuddered and lay still but below the neat hole in her forehead her face still held that mocking smile to hell with you anne whispered and two tears ran down her face half sorry for jacob half fury at the black woman and the way shed duped him and used him and cherry had got the last word too and goaded anne into giving her a quick end at the same time anne kicked at the dirt automatically she worked the bolt and chambered a fresh round linus ashforth came up to her the elderly militiaman spat a stream of tobacco juice into cherrys puddled blood this here was right good maam he said them murderin devils done took the bait you left em and there aint a one of em going back to the swamps yes maam this here was pretty blame fine it wasnt good enough anne said as much to herself as to the old man it wasnt enough what more could you want ashforth asked reasonably every single nigger stuck his nose out of the swamp is dead now cant do much bettern a clean sweep now can you but there are still reds in the swamps anne answered when theyre all hunted down and killed that will be she started to say enough but shook her head before the word passed her lips that wouldnt be enough nothing could be enough to repair the damage the negroes had done to the confederate cause the damage they had done to the confederate states she ended the sentence in a different way that will be a start anyhow linus ashforths whistle was soft and low and wondering maam dont sound to me like youll ever be satisfied i would have been anne said i could have been god i was but it will be a long time before im satisfied again youre right about that it will be a long time before this is a country anyone can be satisfied with jesus god miss anne im sure as the dickens glad you aint mad with me the militiaman spat again then wiped his mouth on his sleeve you ought to be anne colleton said she weighed the words then nodded yes you ought to be because if im angry at something ill hunt it down and kill it she looked north toward the congaree silently her lips shaped a name cassius like so many small hunted creatures nellie semphroch had learned to stay laired up in her burrow and to come out at night to forage the occupying confederates hardly bothered to patrol washington dc any more hal jacobs said theyd given up because every man they had they needed at the front nellie didnt know about that she did know that getting water from the potomac or firewood from a wrecked building she worried more about a chance us shell than she did about men in butternut even at night the bombardment from the north did not halt it only slowed a little she was far from the only one prowling the night if she passed close enough to jacobs and a few others to recognize them she would nod when she saw others she shrank back into the shadows and that though she never ventured forth without a long sharp kitchen knife still others shrank from her that made her feel oddly strong and fierce sometimes edna would come out with her sometimes not when they needed water they generally went down to the river together stove wood was easier to come by close to home one of them would usually go out for it or else the other i wish we could find some coal nellie said not for the first time the grate isnt really right for wood and the stove pipe will get all full of soot and creosote its liable to catch on fire if youre going to wish ma dont waste your time wishing for coal for gods sake edna said wish for a couple days without shells falling all the damn time thatd be somethin really worth having i think we may get that wish before too long nellie said how much longer do you suppose the confederate lines north of town are going to be able to stand the pounding the army is giving them theyll have to crack pretty soon and then the united states will have washington back again oh bully edna loaded her voice with sarcasm even if youre right ma itll only take em a hundred years to build it all back up the way it was and the rebsll fight hard to keep the place too i know they willits about the only part of the line where theyre still on our soil instead of the other way round nellie said but when you look at the way the war is going everywhere else its hard to see how theyre going to be able to do it well what if the united states do come in edna said then the rebs will pound the city to pieces from the other side of the potomac the only difference will be which way the guns are pointed nellie sighed and nodded in the candlelit dimness of the cellar under the coffeehouse her daughters guess held an unpleasant feel of truth after it got dark outside as well as down in the cellar nellie went out to see what she could find and to discover what the bombardment had knocked flat since the last time she came up above ground one of the things that wasnt flat any more was the street down the block from the coffeehouse a big shell had dug an enormous crater in it time was when such wounds had been rare and the confederates patched them as soon as they were made now the rebs kept a few roads to the front open and forgot the rest half a block farther along the street another couple of shells had landed converting several houses and shops to rubble in among the bricks would be lumber much of it already broken into convenient lengths nellie tossed them into a large canvas duffel bag she had the bag nearly ready to drag back to the coffeehouse when bill reachs voice spoke from out of the darkness close by evenin little nell ice ran through nellie though the night was warm and humid youre drunk again she said quietly if you were sober youd know better than to call me that her head went back and forth back and forth where was he he laughed maybe i am maybe i would and maybe im not and maybe i wouldnt what do you think of that there behind that pile of bricks out of which stuck a couple of legs from an upended castiron stove her fingers closed around the handle of the kitchen knife go away she said still looking around as if she hadnt found him cant you just leave me in peace i sure as hell would like a piece he said and laughed again i liked it when i had it before and i know id like it again oh you were a hot number in between the sheets little nell and i dont figure god ever gave another woman in the whole wide world a nastier mouth things you used to do if shed writhed with grunting sweating customers pounding away atop her it was only to make them finish faster get off her and leave the cheap little room where she worked shed always hated sucking on mens privates it seemed filthy even when they didnt squirt viletasting jism into her mouthusually after promising they wouldnt go away she repeated those days are long gone thank god im a respectable woman nowor i was till you walked into my coffeehouse anyways go back into the gutter go back to spying go wherever you want just as long as you leave me alone i dont want anything to do with you do you hear he stood up in his black coat and black derby he was still hard to see he swayed a little then brought a bottle to his lips oddly the whiskey seemed to steady him instead of making him keel over but i want somethin to do with you little nell he said you havent given it to me so it looks like im just gonna have to go and take it he smashed the fat end of the bottle on the bricks a little whiskey spilled outnot much jagged edges glittered under the stars just gonna have to go ahead and take it he repeated go away nellie whispered once more you take whats coming to you and everything will be fine bill reach waved the bottle around you give me any trouble and youll be real sorry yes you will real sorry now get down on the ground and take it once its in there youll love it hell you always did no nellie held the knife behind her back so reach wouldnt be able to see it the acrid fumes of the whiskey some from his breath some from the inside of the bottle made her nostrils twitch as he came closer you aint runnin he said you aint screamin see you know you want it im the man to give it to you too if youre good ill even pay you same as old times no nellie said again either he didnt hear her or he didnt listen he took a couple more steps toward her then extended his left hand to push her to the ground he still held the neck of the bottle but he didnt think hed have to do anything with it hed surely made a lot of mistakes in his time but that was the last and the worst nellie had no experience as a knife fighter but bill reach couldnt have stopped a twoyearold swinging a wooden spoon right then the knife went deep into the left side of his chest its edge grated against a rib when nellie yanked it out and rammed it home again he let out a brief bubbling shriek then toppled nellie wiped the knife clean on his coat while he was still feebly kicking once its in there youll love it she said then she grunted as she picked up the duffel full of chunks of wood slung it over her shoulder and headed for home when she got back edna was mixing salt pork into canned soup that looks like a good load ma her daughter said you were gone a while longer than i thought you would be though you have any trouble out there trouble nellie shook her head not a bit that soup smells good make you thirsty as all getout edna said i know it still smells good nellie had a big bowl the soup did make her thirsty so she drank a glass of boiled river water she went down to the cellar to sleep and had a better night than shed enjoyed in years artillery started thundering before dawn but didnt wake her right away neither she nor anyone else left in washington would have got any sleep at all if theyd let shellfire unduly disturb them when she did wake she gauged the bombardment with a practiced ear so did edna who said theyre pounding the front line right now half an hour or so later though the pattern of the shelling abruptly changed rounds began falling inside washington along the routes the confederates used to move reinforcements through the city toward the front i wonder if the army is trying to break through the rebs trenches right now nellie said do you really think they can edna asked the confederates have been digging and putting in concrete and wire ever since they got here and thats going on three years now would they try if they didnt think they could do it anyway nellie asked in return her daughter only shrugged in return which was when you got down to it a reasonable enough answer from the perspective of a coffeehouse who could know what the us general staff had in mind but then a couple of hours later nellie heard a rattle of smallarms fire rifles and machine guns off to the north edna recognized it for what it was too she let out a soft whistle havent hardly heard that since the confederates drove the usa out of here sure havent nellie agreed as long as we have water and fuel i think wed better stay right where were at if it was bad outside before its going to be worse now with both sides shelling the city and with bullets flying around along with the shells they did sneak out for water one night other than that they stayed inside the coffeehouse all the time for the next several days and down in the cellar whenever they werent at the stove the battle for washington raged around them they saw almost none of it which suited nellie if shed seen the battle the soldiers fighting it would have seen her with consequences ranging from unpleasant to lethal a couple of times barrels rumbled up the street nellie thought they belonged to the csa but she didnt go outside to look two days later somebodyshe didnt know who and again didnt care to find outset up a machinegun post just down the street and fired off belt after belt of ammunition the gun roaring like a demented jackhammer then came rifle fire and running shouting men after that the racket of small arms sounded from the south not the north several hours of relative calm were shattered when somebody pounded on the cellar door with a rifle butt you the semphrochs down there a deep voice shouted nellie and uh edna he sounded as if he might be reading the names from a list yes nellie said and went up the stairs and pushed the door open she found herself staring down a rifle barrel the soldier holding the rifle wore a greengray uniform that was familiar and a potshaped helmet that wasnt nellie semphroch he saidsure enough he had a list you and your daughter are the ones who had the coffeehouse where the damn rebs came all the damn time but nellie began he talked right through her come out both of you youre under arrest charges are collaboration and treason come on men gordon mcsweeney called as his company trudged wearily down an arkansas dirt road come on i will not have you go any place i will not go myself in front of you what i can do you can also do what i can do you will also door you will answer to me nobody argued with him nobody had argued with him since the day captain schneider fell in the craighead forest schneider mcsweeney feared had been translated to a clime warmer than this one that was a warm climate indeed as both summer and the edge of the mississippi delta grew closer with every passing moment the muggy heat made mcsweeney feel as if his uniform tunic and trousers had been pasted to his hide hed remained in command of the company since the fight in the craighead forest hed also remained a second lieutenant a sergeant was commanding one of the other companies in the regiment and nobody seemed to be making any noise about replacing him either officers didnt grow on trees especially not west of the mississippi they didnt pick em up mcsweeney called to the troopers shambling along under the weight of helmet and springfield and heavy pack and entrenching tool and clodhopper boots and however much mud clung to the boots if god grant that we pierce their forces but once more we can bring memphis and the mississippi river under our guns that would be a great blow to strike and a sore hurt to the wicked cause of the confederate states you talk like something right out of the bible sir said a private named rogers who had not been in the section or platoon mcsweeney led before getting the whole company it is the word of god mcsweeney answered is a man not wise to shape his words in the pattern of those of his father rogers didnt answer he just kept marching that suited gordon mcsweeney fine even if he had the words of the good book on which to model his own he was more comfortable doing than talking men could easily argue what he said no one could argue about what he did spatters of gunfire off to the right said the confederates were trying to slow down the us advance any way they could the gunfire wasnt close enough for him to swing his men out of their line of march to respond to it so he kept them going after us forces finally forced the rebs out of jonesboro the front had grown fluid for a change the more ground he made his men cover the closer they would be to memphis up ahead one of those rebel copies of a french started banging away mcsweeney muttered something under his breath that would have been a curse had he permitted himself to take the name of the lord in vain like every us infantryman who had ever advanced against them he hated those quickfiring field guns this one fortunately was shooting long over the heads of his company officers who hadnt pushed their men so hard would have to worry about explosives and shrapnel balls and shell fragments the road led out of the woods and into a clearing near the center of which stood a farmhouse rifle fire came from the farmhouse mcsweeneys smile was broad and welcoming all right men he said if they want to play we can play with them lets see how they like the game then past that he needed to give very few orders the men knew what needed doing and did it without undue fuss or bother fireandmove tactics that had taken them through the heavily fortified forest were perhaps wasted against a farmhouse with a few diehards in it but the us soldiers used them even so some went left some went right before long they had worked in close enough to pitch grenades through the windows of the house mcsweeney wished for his flamethrower how the faded pine timbers of this place would have burned then a fire started anyhow whether from grenades or bullets he could not tell a couple of men in butternut burst out the front door they werent surrendering they came out shooting a fusillade of lead stretched them lifeless in the dust one of them was white the other colored mcsweeney looked down at the negros bleeding corpse and shook his head if black men will fight for the government that for so long has mistreated their kind they deserve whatever that government gives them he said when they rose in revolt against their masters i admired them if they fight for those mastersthey will pay the price as this one has after the brief interruption the company moved on a few confederates fired at them from out of the bushes they hunted the rebs though mcsweeney to his disgust thought a couple of them got away then came an interruption of a different sort mcsweeney had long since grown used to shells from field guns screeching their way through the sky it had been a long time though since hed heard a roar of cloven air like this one altogether without conscious thought he threw himself flat the great shell burst fifty yards off to the left even as dirt thudded down onto his back and fragments hissed malevolently through the air another shell thundered home this one striking about twentyfive yards to the right of the road some men were down as mcsweeney was to gain what little shelter they could from those enormous rounds others were down and screaming or wailing clutching arms or legs or bellies others were down and not moving at all nor would they ever move again they arent supposed to have this kind of firepower way the hell out here somebody shouted those have to be eightinch maybe teninch shells even as he spoke two more of the big shells thundered in more screams rose busy with his entrenching tool mcsweeney forgot to reprove the soldier for cursing suddenly the answer blazed in him river monitors he exclaimed they shelled us when we crossed the ohio this must be another one if our own boats could get down as far as memphis we wouldnt have been fighting our way through arkansas all these months another pair of shells burst not far away what can we do sir a soldier cried pray mcsweeney answered he would have said that under most circumstances it seemed particularly fitting here what else can we do when no guns of ours are able to reach those aboard the confederate river monitor as he spoke he dug himself deeper into the soft dark brown soil the unwounded men in the company did the same so did some of the wounded men after almost three years of war digging entrenchments was altogether natural mcsweeney had known men safe behind their own lines to dig foxholes before settling down to sleep for the night hed done it himself a couple of times up ahead a confederate machine gun started barking if the river monitor hadnt halted mcsweeneys troops they would have run into it in short orderand it would have done them about as much damage as the big guns on the mississippi were doing most company commanders would have sent scouts forward to examine the enemy machinegun position that never entered gordon mcsweeneys mind he scrambled out of the foxhole he had dug just as another pair of shells from the river monitor landed near the position his company had taken more dirt rained down on him even after he stuck a finger in one ear it didnt hear so well as it should have he wriggled forward one thing was different now that the us army had finally pushed the rebs out of their lines in front of jonesboro not so much barbed wire on the ground to hamper movement grass and shrubs gave plenty of cover too and his muddy greengray uniform made him hard to spot as he scooted toward the machine gun no concrete emplacement here the rebs were set up in a nest of sandbags all the same mcsweeney bit his lip in frustration even if he picked off all the gunners who seemed to have no idea he was anywhere close by more confederates would take over the weapon he shrugged a tiny shrug that might do the new rebels at the machine gun wouldnt be a regular crew and wouldnt shoot so effectively he was just bringing his rifle up to his shoulder when firing off to his right made the confederates turn the gun in that direction and start blazing away at his countrymen who were trying to advance over there with the rebs thus distracted mcsweeney put a bullet through the head of one of them when the other one the one who fed belts into the machine gun half rose to check his friend mcsweeney drilled him too both confederate soldiers slumped down he thought they were both dead his member throbbed save for an annoyed mutter too low to make sense even to himself he ignored it he waited for more confederates to come forward and take over the gun they didnt it sat there silent he muttered again this time intelligibly fools he crawled to within sixty or seventy yards of it where the cover petered out then he wasnt crawling he was running in great bounding leaps a couple of startled shouts rose a few bullets cracked past him none bit though he dove over the wall of sandbags knocked the confederate corpses out of the way and manhandled the machine gun around so that it bore on the surviving rebs farther east grinning from ear to ear he gave them a taste of their own medicine before long his own men came hurrying up to support him good to see you he said not intentionally ironic ben carlton shook his head when that machine gun turned around uh sir the cook said i knew youd got to it some kind of way youve done it too damn often for me even to be real surprised about it any more do not blaspheme mcsweeney said almost automatically i do my duty and here if not in your cookery you have done yours let us push on against the foe with gods help victory shall indeed be ours at last thegreatwar breakthroughs sergeant jake featherston cursed a blue streak the surviving guns of his battery along with the rest of those belonging to the first richmond howitzers perched on sudley mountain a little east of centreville virginia from those low hills they could have wreaked fearful havoc on the yankees farther west over near the small stream called bull runif theyd had any ammunition a runner came up to featherston sir uh sergeant i mean the wagons will be here in an hour or so headquarters says could looks have killed the messenger would have been deader than if a twelveinch shell from a battleship had gone off under his feet they should have been here this morning god damn it featherston ground out what the fucking hell happened to them the runner stared he took a lot of abuse a big part of his job was telling people of superior rank they couldnt have what they wanted and what they thought they were entitled to featherstons words were nothing out of the ordinary the icy vitriol of the tone was it might have come from an irate colonel not a sergeant running a battered battery sergeant they got tangled up with a division of infantry on the march so after that they needed a good long while to get unraveled again do you think the damnyankees dont care that the army of northern virginia doesnt know what in christs name its doing jake snapped maybe they do careenough to send us a big thankyou bouquet ive given you the news i have sergeant the runner said and went on his way having other duty let him escape featherstons fury it wasnt as if jake were his commanding officer out came the gray eagle scratch pad and over open sights the whitebearded fools in richmond are doing their best to make sure that we lose this war featherston wrote though we had victory straight ahead of us now they give the niggers guns to try to put their own blundering to rights even though it was the niggers who helped stick us in this mess in the first place and white troops would never have let themselves get fouled up with ammunition wagons like that the messenger hadnt said whether the troopers whod cause his problem were white or black he drew his own conclusions when you first started keeping those notes sergeant someone said behind featherston i never thought you would keep on with them i seem to have been mistaken automatically jake closed the cover of the notebook what he wrote in there was his nobody elses major potter sir he said now i got nothing better to do than write on account of i cant go pasting the damnyankees the way i want to on account of god may know where the ammunition is but i sure dont clarence potter sighed i wish you could paste them but that you cant may matter less than you think they are building up for another large push against us if you have the ammunition youll need to help stop that well and good if not he didnt go on if not were in too much trouble for anything to matter thats what youre saying isnt it sir thats what im saying potter studied him i never have figured out exactly how smart you are featherston but youve made it plain youre shrewd enough and to spare if you hadnt made the fatal mistake of being right at the wrong time we might have the same rank by now maybe he meant that to console jake it didnt it made him furious best way to save the country i can think of sir would be for a yankee bomber to put three or four heavy ones right on top of the war department that might do it cant think of anything else that would the intelligence officer shook his head all things considered theyve done about as well as anyone could have expected god help us if thats so featherston said wed better make peace in a hurry before the damn fools do something even worse than they have already dont know what that could be but i reckon theyd come up with something you are shrewd behind their metalrimmed spectacles major potters eyes widened slightly there are people in the army and people in the government beginning to say the same thing if britain is forced to leave the war if we have to face not just the whole us army but the whole us navy less whatever part keeps fighting japan in the pacificif that happens the odds against us grow very long odds were long during the war of secession too jake said we licked the yankees twice over by manassas gap wed lick em again if only that damned ammunition would ever get here we had help then potter said without it i think we should have lost one way or another wed have licked them featherston didnt know whether that was likely to be true or just his own stubbornness talking wed be licking them now if the damn niggers hadnt risen up and stabbed us in the back i wonder clarence potter said i do wonder wed be better off than we are no doubt but would we be winning the last two times we fought the united states we won fairly quickly before they committed everything they had to the struggle we failed to do that this time and they are fully committed to the fightand they have more to commit to it than we do as if to underscore his words a flight of us aeroplanes buzzed by overhead no cs fighting scouts rose to answer them aeroplanes were mere annoyances but jake was sick of being annoyed without having the chance to return the favor at long last a couple of antiaircraft guns opened up on the yankees they scored no hits they hardly ever did potter went on and speaking of our colored troops do i hear correctly that you opened up on them with canister during the retreat from round hill hell yes you heard that straight featherston said defiantly if they aint more afraid of us than they are of the damnyankees they wont do us any good will they they were running from the enemy sir and it was the only way i had to make em stop some of them will never run from the enemy again thats certainor toward him either major potter said some of their white officers and noncoms sent complaints about what you did to army of northern virginia headquarters you might have faced a courtmartial if others had not spoken out on your behalf surprised i didnt any which way jake said theres a big raft of officers who dont love me a whole hell of a lot really potter raised an eyebrow i hadnt noticed featherston who didnt know what to make of such understated irony started to boil till the intelligence officer raised a hand and went on thats a joke sergeant i am happy to be able to tell you that i was able to deflect the complaints and make sure none of them went on to richmond thank you for that much sir jake said potter was a decent sort as far as officers went but featherston hated being in anyones debt he especially hated being in an officers debt youve had a few bad turns come your way potter said seems only right to even things up as we can there he stood smug and sweatless in the muggy heat yes youre a lord featherston thought you can throw the poor peasant a crust of bread and never miss it in that moment he might have come close to understanding what had driven the negroes of the csa to rise up late in but he never thoughthe never would have thoughtto compare his situation to theirs before the comparison could have occurred to him the first ammunition wagon arrived too late to suit him but still sooner than the runner had said forgetting his resentment of potter he took out on the wagon driver the older anger he still felt cursing him up one side and down the other the driver a lowly private first class had to sit there and take it finally having ammunition in his hands though let jake work out resentment with something more than words in mere minutes the four guns he had left were banging away at the yankees the range was too long to let him see individual us soldiers but he could make out the boil and stir as shells slammed down among them a man dropping rocks on a nest of ants below his secondstory window could not see any of the individual bugs either but he could watch the nest boil and stir clarence potter who spent most of the war back at the army of northern virginia headquarters also looked on with benign approval make them sting he told jake the higher the price they pay the likelier they are to let us have the sort of peace we can live with i dont give a damn about a peace we can live with featherston snarled adjusting the elevation screw on his field gun only thing i give a damn about is killing the sons of bitches he raised his voice to a shout fire michael scott jerked the lanyard the cannon roared out flew the shell casing in went another shell a man dropping rocks on a nest of ants did not have to worry that the ants would try to drop rocks on him too the guns of featherstons battery enjoyed no such immunity before long us artillery began replying shells did not come in so often as he sent them out but they came from bigger piecesfour and sixinch gunsfiring from a range he could not hope to match since he could not match it he ignored the fire and continued to pepper the closer us infantry whom he could hit youre cool about this business major potter said for a man unused to coming under shellfire he was pretty cool himself he didnt dive for cover at a couple of near misses till the crew of jakes gun did featherston shrugged they cant shoot for hell sir that wasnt true and he knew it damn well the yankee artillerymen were no less skilled at their trade than their counterparts in butternut since the beginning of the war theyd enjoyed an edge in heavy guns too sometimes the numbers and quick firing of the confederates threeinchers could make up for that sometimes as when trying to cave in deep dugouts they couldnt in a lull potter said we have to hold them at bull run if we cant hold them here richmond itself is threatened do my damnedest sir jake answered he didnt know if that would be enough by the way potter talked he didnt think it would jake shrugged again defeat wouldnt be his fault as far as he was concerned the war department and the niggers could split the blame lucien galtier had not been expecting a visit from major jedediah quigley he certainly had not been expecting a warm cordial visit from major quigley that was what he got though the us officer even brought along a bottle of brandy far smoother and finer than the homemade applejack galtier had grown used to drinking after marie came in from the kitchen with glasses quigley splashed brandy into them with a generous hand he raised his glass in salute to the union of our great peoples he declared in his elegant french as far as lucien was concerned the us major was making too much of the impending marriage between nicole and dr odoull but the quebecois farmer held his peace quigleys job seemed to entail making too much of everything that came to his notice for ill or for good this at least was for good it was also a toast to which galtier could drink even if he found it a bit more than the occasion called for and the brandy was good he hardly felt it going down his throat but it filled his belly with warmth that quickly spread outward formidable he murmured respect in his voice glad you like it quigley said and sloshed more into his glass the american poured himself a fresh dollop too after sipping he went on in thoughtful tones i will admit to you m galtier that i never expected to be paying a social call here when we first came to quebec you seemed a man more in love with the past than with the future what he meant was you didnt act like a collaborator lucien still didnt feel like a collaborator either he said when young people come to know each other one cannot always guess ahead of time how these things will turn out there you certainly have reason major quigley said back in new hampshire where i come from my daughter married a young fellow who makes concertinas he knocked back his brandy for a moment thinking about the choice his daughter had made he looked not at all like an occupying official but rather than an ordinary man and a surprised ordinary man to boot galtier found himself surprised too surprised quigley could look and even act like an ordinary man politely the farmer said i hope your soninlaw is safe in the war he is well so far thanks quigley answered hes out in sequoyah where the fighting isnt so heavy as it is east of the mississippinor so heavy as north of the st lawrence or over in ontario the united states have stubborn neighbors to the south of them galtier said the united states have also stubborn neighbors to the north of them i think that before this war began you americans did not altogether understand how stubborn these northern neighbors of yours were some of that was the brandy talking here for once quigley had come to his house for some reason other than doing him wrong and now he was giving the american fresh reason to suspect him marie would have some sharp things to say about that galtier had some sharp things to say about it too he said them silently but with great vigor to himself but quigley did not take the comment as he might have instead he nodded soberly or perhaps not so soberly as he spoke he reached for the bottle of brandy again well once more you have reason he said when we began the war we thought it would soon be over but as you say our neighbors were more stubborn than we thought and also stronger than we thought the fighting has proved harder than we ever imagined he held out the bottle to lucien who let him pour after three big glasses of brandy the farmer would be slowmoving and achy in the morning but the morning was a long way away i did not think an american would admit any such thing galtier said quigley tapped his long thin nose he had to shift his hand at the last minute to make it connect i admit ive got this here he said and the other is every bit as plain but that doesnt mean the united states arent going to win this war it just means weve had to work much harder than we thought we would we have done the work m galtier and we are at last beginning to see the results of it it could be so lucien said by everything he could learn it was so but he knew that what he could learn was limited both the united states and the new republic of quebec made sure of that it is so the brandy was talking through jedediah quigley too normally as smooth and polished as a new pair of shoes he made a fist and thumped it against his thigh to emphasize his words he also spoke louder than usual marie stuck her head out of the kitchen to make sure no quarrel was brewing when shed reassured herself she disappeared again galtier didnt think quigley saw her the farmer said i will be glad when the war is over he did not think anyone could disagree with that or with the way he continued everyone will be glad when the war is over and sure enough the american officer nodded vigorously the only people who love a war are those who have never fought in one he declared to which lucien could but incline his head he had not thought major quigley could say anything so wise and then quigley spoiled it but you m galtier you will have come out of the war having done pretty well for yourself without it you would not have gained a doctor as a fiance for your daughter even without brandy in him galtier would not have let that go unchallenged with brandy in him he let fly saying without the war major quigley i would not have had part of my patrimonyalienatedeven with brandy in him he had sense enough not to say stolen from me so that the united states army could build on it a hospital major quigley coughed a couple of times the brandy had turned him a little ruddy now he went red as a brick i will speak frankly he said i already told you that when the war was new i did not think you were a man the united states could trust yes you said that galtier agreed and you were right to think what you thought he had sense enough to keep that to himself too after coughing once more quigley said i also told you i seem to have been wrong i do not deny i chose your land on which to build this hospital in part because i did not believe you were reliable and now you know differently lucien asked he had to make it a question not least because he remained unsure of the answer himself but quigley nodded now i know better he echoed and coughed yet again when he went on he seemed to be talking as much to himself as to galtier since i know better it could be that what i did might not have been the wisest thing to do perhaps then you should think about how you might make amends galtier stared down at the little bit of brandy left in his glass had what hed drunk really made him bold enough to say that evidently it had major quigley rubbed his nose he fiddled with a cuff on his greengray tunic at last he said perhaps i should what would you say a fair rent for the piece of ground on which the hospital was built would be galtier had all he could do not to ask if he had heard correctly quigley still assumed hed had the right to use the land regardless of whether lucien approved or not but an offer to pay back rent was ever so much more than the farmer had expected to hear he scratched his chin named the most outrageous amount he could think offifty dollars a monthand braced himself for the haggle to come if i end up with half that he thought i shall be well ahead of the game but major quigley instead of haggling simply said very well m galtier we have a bargain he stuck out his hand in a daze lucien galtier took it the daze had nothing to do with the brandy he had drunk he did not know whether to be delighted quigley had met his price or disappointed he hadnt tried to gouge the american officer out of more in the end he was delighted and disappointed at the same time quigley said here i will leave the bottle with you if i drink any more from it tonight i shall be unable to drive back to riviereduloup here is an advantage of a wagon or a buggy over a motorcar galtier said a horse would be able to get you back to town if only you pointed him in the right direction a motorcar is not so accommodating cest vrai et quelle dommage the american replied in tones that made it a truly pitiful pity he got to his feet and walkedsteadily but very slowlyto the doorway bonsoir monsieur galtier bonsoir lucien said major quigley went outside and cranked his ford to life lucien stood in the doorway and watched him drivesteadily but again very slowlynorth toward riviereduloup marie came out of the kitchen nicole followed her astonished disbelief filled both their faces almost whispering marie said did my ears tell me the truth can it be that the americans will pay us rent for the land they stole for their hospital if they pay rent we can no longer say they stole the land from us galtier replied it becomes then a matter of business and what business the full weight of what hed done began to sink in not only rent but back rent not only back rent but fifty dollars a month we shall be rich nicole exclaimed her mother shook her head denying even the possibility of such a thing no we shall not be rich rich is not for the likes of us it could beit could be that for a little while we may have almost enough saying even so much took a distinct effort of will from her that would be fine lucien said even of itself that would be very fine acid returned to his voice it might even let us make up for the robbery the americans committed against us during the first winter of the war in a worried voice marie said but taking this moneyi pray it shall not be as it was when judas took his thirty pieces of silver nonsense galtier said judas took silver for betraying our lord we shall take this money in exchange for what is rightfully ours in exchange for the americans use of my patrimony father is right said nicole who had her own reasons to want things to go smoothly between her family and the americans i suppose so but marie still did not sound convinced lucien was not altogether convinced either but he had made the offer and major quigley accepted it what could he do now like nicoles engagement to dr odoull the rent tied him ever closer to the united states and the interests of the united states he clicked his tongue between his teeth in he never would have never could have imagined any such thing night was slowly lifting over northern virginia sergeant chester martin hadnt got much in the way of sleep even while darkness hung over the land ever since midnight us machine guns had been hammering away at the confederate line to the east and south and the guns of the army of northern virginia hadnt been shy about replying either the din had kept most of martins section awake though corporal bob reinholdt still lay wrapped in his blanket sleeping the sleep of a man more innocent than he was likely to be but the din had also kept the rebs from noticing the noise of a whole great whacking lot of barrels moving toward the front lineor so the brass hoped so chester martin devoutly hoped too he turned to david hamburger next time you write to your sister tell her thanks he bawled in the kids ear looks likely theyve got a really big force of barrels here like theyve been doing it in tennessee i dont know how much she had to do with any of that hamburger shoutedin effect whisperedback youve got to remember sarge she hates the war and anything that has anything to do with it hey shes not the only one martin said you think i like getting shot youre crazy but if weve got to have the goddamn thing wed better win it the only thing worse than having a war is losing one the united states know all about that before hamburger could reply us artillery which had been pretty quiet opened up with a thunderous roar short and sweetthat was how they did it these days none of the weeklong bombardments that martin had seen on the roanoke front enormous cannonadings that did more to tell the rebs where the attack was going in than anything else artillery or no artillery bob reinholdt kept right on sleeping martin went over and shook him then had to leap back as reinholdt lashed out with a trench knife naughty martin said the corporal always woke up at maximum combat alertness shows about to start yeah reinholdt said all right he grunted rolled up his blanket and got to his feet he hadnt given martin any trouble since absorbing both fist and steel reinforcement with his chin maybe hed learned his lesson maybe he was biding his time martin still kept an eye on him in case he was captain cremony strode along the trench all right boys he said now were driving nails in their coffin weve cleared em out of washington we need a buffer so they cant shell it whenever they choose our granddads fought on this ground they won some fights in virginia too even if they didnt win the war we get to make up for what they couldnt quite manage my grandfather didnt fight here david hamburger said after cremony was out of earshot which didnt take long he was still on the other side of the atlantic wondering if the czar would put him in the russian army for twentyfive or thirty years when the czar said go he wenthere conscriptiondodger eh martin grinned somewhere down at the roots of my family tree is a poacher who got out of england a short hop ahead of the sheriff thats what my old man says anyway how about you bob me reinholdt seemed surprised at the question im a son of a bitch from a long line of sons of bitches you dont believe me ask anybody martin wouldnt have argued with him for the world he didnt get the chance anyhow when the barrels engines went from low power to high not all the machinegun fire and artillery in the world could have concealed the racket the traveling fortresses clanked and rumbled toward the confederate line their own machine guns blazing away at the enemy positions ahead all along the front lines of the us works officers blew whistles to urge their men over the top cremony tweeted away till his face turned red us soldiers scrambled up ladders and sandbag stairways and followed the barrels toward the confederate trenches stay close captain cremony shouted stay close martin echoed those big iron critters may be ugly but theyre our best friends even as he spoke the barrel behind which he advanced began smashing its way over and through the wire the rebels had strung to protect their position between the last wire belt and their forwardmost trenches the confederates negro laborers had dug a great ditch too wide for the barrels to cross and deep enough to be sure to bog them down but us observation aeroplanes or balloonists must have spotted the digging for some of the barrels bore on their forward decks great bundles of sticks and logs bound with chains and ropes they dumped them into the ditch then ground their way across over them captain cremony who was fond of shakespeare shouted out in high glee birnam wood comes to dunsinane martin didnt know about that he did know the bundles of wood made it easier for him and his men to cross the ditch too though some of them used bites the artillery had taken out of its front and rear walls to scramble down and then up stay close to your barrel martin yelled again stay close the barrels were bludgeoning the army of northern virginia into submission these were new positions for the rebs hastily run up after the retreat from aldie they lacked much of the reinforced concrete of lines built more slowly and held longer machinegun nests of sandbags could not stand up to the barrels nose cannons one after another the barrels cleared them out tilden russell shouted something into martins ear martin had trouble making out what he said amidst the rattle of gunfire the thunder of artillery and the dyspeptic roar of the barrels obligingly the private shouted it again breakthrough he stuffed a cigar into his mouth got it going with a bronzecased flintandsteel lighter and puffed out happy clouds of smoke was it a breakthrough martin wasnt sure not here not now though on the roanoke front he would have been ecstatic at the ground he and his comrades were gaining a days advance here could be measured in miles not yards if that wasnt a breakthrough what was it but if a breakthrough required the rebs to throw down their rifles and quit in carload lots that didnt happen soldiers in butternut white and colored kept fighting till the barrels and the us infantry rolled over them if anything the colored confederate soldiers fought harder than they had when the us troops broke out of their bridgeheads south of the potomac maybe that was because the whites had given them dire warnings about what would happen to them if they didnt fight maybe too and more likely the negro soldiers were steadier now simply because theyd seen some action east of the infantry trenches and the village of centreville the ground rose the rebel batteries on those hillsmaps called them mountainshadnt given up and gone home either shells from us guns kept falling among them but they went right on giving the advancing men in greengray a hell of a hard time they reserved their chiefest fury for the barrels the traveling forts were not easy targets principally because they could travel but every so often a shell would slam home with the noise of a man beating an iron pot with a pick handle worse noises commonly followedammunition cooking off engines and gas tanks going up in flames men screaming as they cooked barrels armor plate held out machinegun bullets but threeinch shells when they hit pierced it like so much pasteboard and the csa had barrels of their own in the field they were fewer and more widely scattered than those of the usa but they were there and some of them gave a good account of themselves when not fighting for his own life martin watched in fascination as barrel battled barrel the fights put him in mind of the dinosaurs struggling in swamps hed read about in the sunday supplements one particular confederate barreltanks the rebs called them aping the british as they so often didwas altogether too good at making its us opponents extinct it set two greengray barrels afire in quick succession the second victory let it bear down on martin and his section hit the dirt he shouted and dove behind a pile of rubble that had been a rebels chimney once upon a time machinegun bullets from the confederate barrel chewed up the dirt around him and snarled off the bricks in front of him if the barrel kept coming straight ahead it would squash him into a redder smear in the redbrown dirt shouts and screams from around him said only too plainly that some of his men hadnt been so lucky in finding cover as he had clang the machinegun fire from the confederate barrel abruptly stopped wary as a wild animal chester martin raised his head the barrel was burning hatches flew open as crewmen tried to escape with a fierce glee martin and his comrades shot them down out of their steel snail shell they were easy meat martin looked around and grimaced stretcherbearers he shouted his voice cracking with urgency stretcherbearers he ran over to david hamburger the closest wounded soldier the kid was clutching his left thigh and howling like a wolf martin didnt think he knew he was doing it bright red blood trickled out between his fingers when he saw martin he stopped howling and said im going to write my congresswoman about this his voice was amazingly calm yeah you do that martin said lets have a look at what you caught there reluctantly hamburger took his hands away the wound was in the middle of the thigh martin whistled in a minor key a bullet to the inside and the kid would have bled out in short order this was better news but it wasnt what youd call good here well take him sarge a couple of stretcherbearers paused beside the wounded man do your best hes a good fellow and his sisters in congress with the stretcherbearers there martin couldnt wait around he awkwardly patted david hamburger on the shoulder then hurried past the blazing hulk of the confederate barrel and on through centreville confederate artillerymen were made to quit the high ground east of the little virginia town only with the greatest reluctance some of the gun crews stayed till they could fire at the advancing barrels over open sights they took heavy casualties though splinter shields were no match for the firepower bearing down on them a rebel gunner one of the last on the field shook his fist at the oncoming us soldiers as his crew limbered up their field piece he shook it again as they galloped away martin shot at him but missed he shrugged one man didnt much matter the high ground belonged to the usa joe conroy was about the last man in the world cincinnatus wanted to see by the look on the fat white storekeepers face cincinnatus was about the last man in the world he wanted to see too come to gloat i reckon conroy said shifting a plug of tobacco from one cheek to the other got nothin to gloat about suh cincinnatus answered with kentucky a state in the usa these days he didnt have to be so deferential to a white man as he would have before the war when the state still belonged to the csa but conroy was a confederate diehard cincinnatus figured using the old ways was a good idea if he hoped to learn anything he might not learn anything anyhow conroy sneered at him yeah a likely story you go on and tell me you dont know what the hell happened to my store after me and tom kennedy god rest his soul taught you how to make those little firebombs that aint no biggern cigars mr conroy suh i dont know what the hell happened to your store cincinnatus said evenly i didnt have nothin to do with burnin it down that there is the truth and you can take it to the bank that there was a lie and his mother would have boxed his ears for telling a lie had she been here to listen to it but his mother wasnt anywhere around and he told the lie with great aplomb huh conroy grunted as if to say he didnt believe it for a minute but then he went on if you dont know about it who the hell does cincinnatus shrugged who the hell knows about how tom kennedy got hisself killed suh he didnt think hed made the question too obvious conroy had offered him another question on which to hang it so he didnt seem to be pulling it in from out of the blue the storekeeper looked down at the park bench on which they sat at opposite ends before giving an answer more oblique than useful never could figure out what the hell tom saw in you swear to jesus suh never did figure out what he was doin there outside my door cincinnatus said conroys eyes were narrow slits almost hidden in folds of fat cincinnatus still couldnt decide whether he was clever or just sly now he said they were after himwhat do you think only a lifetime of disguising his feelings toward whites and the stupid things that came out of their mouths let cincinnatus keep from barking scornful laughter at that had nobody been after kennedy nobody would have shot him whos they mr conroy he asked thats what im tryin to find out well now the storekeeper said slowly i dont rightly know could have been a whole bunch of different folks cincinnatus wanted to grab him by the neck and shake him till his narrow eyes popped you got any notion who he asked as gently as he could been a lot o different folks comin round askin me questions i aint got no good answers for less i talk way too much unless i tell them who tom kennedys friends are was what he meant would conroy be bright enough to figure that out or would he need a more direct hint the only more direct hint cincinnatus could think of was a whack in the teeth that would be satisfying but conroy got what he was talking about the white mans absurd little rosebud mouth puckered up as if hed bitten into the worlds sourest pickled tomato who he repeated sounding like an unhappy owl could have been one of those kentucky state police bastards could have been some of the red niggers too youd know more about that than i would i reckon he gave cincinnatus a stare that meant i can talk too cincinnatus hid a grimace everybody could talk about him to somebody he said from what i seen mr kennedy and the reds didnt get on too bad i told him to watch out for em just the same conroy said cant trust a red hell yell popular front today and kick you in the nuts tomorrow tom thought he could handle it he always thought he could handle everything that did sound like the kennedy cincinnatus had known conroys characterization of the reds wasnt far wrong either though cincinnatus wouldnt have admitted it to the storekeeper and conroy wasnt through either he continued could even have been some of our own boys ive heard this one and that one go on about how tom was selling us all down the river that a fact cincinnatus pricked up his ears you got names for any o those fellows conroy looked down at his shoes which were every bit as scuffed and battered as cincinnatus he didnt say anything after a while cincinnatus realized he wasnt going to say anything everybody played his cards close to his vest in this game kennedy and conroy were the only two confederate holdouts cincinnatus had ever met conroy didnt care to give him the key to more in casual tones cincinnatus said luther blissd ask a lot more questions than i do and hed ask em a lot harder too i been down to the covington city hall i know what im talkin about yeah and he gave you money out of his own pocket the coldblooded son of a bitch conroy snapped cincinnatus sighed teddy roosevelt had done him a good turn but bliss had put barbs in it still casually cincinnatus said maybe hed listen if i was to tell him somethin then maybe he would and if you was to tell him somethin maybe some smart nigger who wasnt quite as smart as he reckoned he was would get a bullet through the ear one day when hes drivin that big ugly old white truck o his thats plumb full o shit the damnyankeesre shootin at his countrymen or maybe his wifed have a little accident or maybe his kid i aint the only one accidents can happen to conroy cincinnatus had to work to hold his voice steady plenty of people had threatened him threatening his family was an alarming departure conroy leaned back against the park bench looking like a fat cat with canary feathers on his whiskers reckon i know a bluff when i hear one reckon you dont cincinnatus said got me a little gray eagle notebook i been writin things in it for a long time anything happen to me or mine itll get to the right place ive made sure o that the storekeeper stared at him in undisguised loathing he was running a bluff but he wouldnt be for long the idea of having such protection was irresistibly appealing conroy said we was a pack o damn fools to ever let any niggers learn their letters maybe so maybe not cincinnatus answered with a shrug too late to worry about it now one way or the other the usa had fewer laws against educating negroes than did the csa he hoped achilles would get more in the way of learning than hed ever been able to acquire but it was too early to worry about that now he fixed conroy with a stare that had flint in it which of your pals didnt take to kennedy dealin with the reds none o your damn business conroy ground out he glared back at cincinnatus you want to talk to luther bliss go talk to luther goddamn bliss well see which one of us ends up happier afterwards cincinnatus didnt want to talk to luther bliss he never wanted anything to do with the chief of the kentucky state police for the rest of his life getting his wish there though struck him as unlikely he and conroy had reached an impasse he could he supposed ask apicius if he knew the names of some of the other confederate diehards but apicius reds were as likely to have killed tom kennedy as anyone else and apicius would not take kindly to questions from cincinnatus any which way the cook would wonder for whom he was asking them and would never believe he was asking them for himself alone conroy heaved himself to his feet i reckon were done he said and cincinnatus did not disagree the storekeeper shook his finger in cincinnatus face dont you come around there askin after me no more neither i aint got nothin more to say to you and i aint gonna be he shook his head his jowls wobbled like gelatin off he stomped i aint gonna bewhat cincinnatus wondered i aint gonna be there was the likeliest guess cincinnatus wouldnt have wanted to live in the dingy roominghouse where conroy made his home but didnt expect the storekeeper to head on to much better lodgings cincinnatus sighed hed got something to think about but where could he go with it nowhere he could see with another sigh he got up and headed toward the nearest trolley stop elizabeth would have something sharp to say about his wasting so much of a sunday afternoon and shed be right but he hadnt known it would be a waste till hed gone and done it which was too late the trolley stop was across the street from a saloon with a plateglass window as cincinnatus came to the stop and dug in his pocket for a nickel a man in a black homburg came out of the saloon and strode across the street to the stop he seemed as certain the motorcars would stop for him as moses had been that the red sea would part for him the sea had parted the motorcars did stop afternoon cincinnatus luther bliss pale brown eyes looked at cincinnatus and the negro would have sworn through him as well that damn diehard know who parted tom kennedys hair with a caliber slug cincinnatus was glad he was black had he been white bliss could have watched him turn pale how the devil did you know what we was talking about he demanded with almost superstitious awe bliss laugh didnt quite reach those huntinghound eyes you could have been talking about a lot of things he answered all the others are worse lets just hope that was the only one if you know all the people you dont fancy in this here town mr bliss cincinnatus said why dont you throw em all in jail so you dont have to worry about em no more stead of leavin em run loose and raise trouble i know all the people i dont fancy in this here state luther bliss answered and the reason i dont throw em all in jail is simple as hell there arent near enough jails to hold the bastards he laughed again but cincinnatus didnt think he was kidding after a moment he dug in his pocket continuing you got a hundred dollars from me on account of the president this here is from me personal you might say he handed cincinnatus a nickel looking down at the coin that sat in the pale palm of his hand cincinnatus said sure as hell you wont go broke spendin your money like this here mr bliss youre a funny one bliss said you better get on home nowhere comes the trolley and if i ever figure out how you got to be so funny ill come round again and see if youre still that way after i take you to pieces he tipped his hat and went on his way smooth as a snake cincinnatus threw the nickel in the trolley cars fare box he didnt want it in his pocket it might have been listening to him the ss pocahontas arkansas lay alongside the uss ericsson staring at the supply ship george enos said if thats not the stupidest name for a steamboat i ever saw in all my born days i dont know what is carl sturtevant looked sly and smug i know why its got that name all right ill bite george said somebody doesnt know that pocahontas ended up marrying a pilgrim hell till this minute i didnt know she ended up marrying a pilgrim sturtevant answered nah that hasnt got anything to do with it come on thencough it up george said pocahontas arkansas is this little noaccount town a few miles south of the us border the petty officer said during the second mexican war the army took the place and held it for a little while outside of montana there wasnt much glory

atlantic while we take on supplies i dont like it for hell sturtevant raised a mocking eyebrow you dont like us to have fuel so we can keep on patrolling you dont like fresh vittles i dont know about you but im damn sick of kraut and beans you dont like getting mail you got a wife aint that right yeah i got a wife george enos answered mails fine but i want to get home to boston in one piece when the wars finally over too and if im sitting here not moving that damn rebel submarines going to put a torpedo into our side somewhere right between the number two and number three stacks we sank that damn rebel submarine sturtevant said wasnt one of lieutenant crowders pipe dreams that time neither you blew the captain to pieces when he was pitching their secret papers and then the bonefish went under again and she aint never comin up no more enos exhaled angrily through his nose you should have been a lawyer not a sailor you figure the confederate navys got only that one submersible in it they build those bastards by the netful if there isnt already another one out here to take the place of that boat there will be in a few days like george carl sturtevant looked older than he was sun and wind and spray had tanned his skin turned it leather and wrinkled it too he looked older still as he contemplated enos words well youre right god damn it he said at last now im going to worry too sailors hauled sides of beef and hams and sacks of potatoes and endless cans from the pocahontas arkansas to the ericsson they chattered at one another in english and a variety of foreign languages that seemed to consist mostly of consonants fuel oil gurgled through a hose connecting the hold of the pocahontas arkansas to the ericsson s engine room as sturtevant had said it all promised that the destroyer would be able to keep on steaming and keep on feeding the crew for the next couple of weeksprovided she lived through the next couple of hours somewhere out there a submersibleall right not the submersible but a submersible sure as hellwas cruising along looking for something to send to the bottom maybe that sub was fifty miles away on the other hand maybe it was somewhere under the surface trying to sneak in from a mile to half a mile to make sure it sank the ericsson which was as sitting a duck as had ever been hatched you couldnt outrun a torpedo you couldnt outrun a torpedo at flank speed a fish had at least ten knots on a destroyer but if you were cruising along when one of those bastards tried to shoot you in the back you did have a chance to dodge how in gods name were you supposed to dodge when you werent even moving the answer was depressingly simple you couldnt finishing this resupply depended on not being spotted while it was going on george stared out over the tropical atlantic looking for a periscope or its wake odds were against him he knew it even if he did spot one it was all too likely to be too late he knew that too light chop made the surface dance in a dead calm sea the wake from a periscope would have stood out against the background here the background helped hide or mislead as it did with a camouflaged ship he wished he were down in the engine room the only way the black gang found out about a torpedo was when one exploded in their laps finally after what seemed like forever but couldnt have been more than the couple of hours carl sturtevant had talked about the pocahontas arkansas disconnected the hose and reeled it back in leaving a dark smear of fuel oil across the deck for an officer to have conniptions about any minute now all the freighters sailors were back aboard her too the deck began to thrum and vibrate under georges feet he let out a long heartfelt sigh of relief no doubt being echoed all over the ericsson theyd got away with it danger didnt disappear nowdanger from everything george had seen never disappearedbut it diminished coal smoke poured from the pocahontas arkansas stack too as the freighters wheezy powerplant also began to work harder the only way the beamy old ship would go faster than about ten knots enos thought was if someone threw her over a cliff sooner or later though shed get where she was going in the end that was what mattered but the pocahontas arkansas did not get where she was going the notion that she would had hardly crossed georges mind before her bow blew off right in front of his horrified eyes a moment later another torpedo struck her amidships she might as well have been a bull in a slaughterhouse hit over the head with a sledgehammer she stopped dead in the water and started to sink the ericsson stopped dead in the water too or so it seemed to george then he wondered if hed lost his mind the hulk of the freighter seemed to be moving forward once more while enos was scratching his head carl sturtevant let out an admiring whistle skipper must have been eating his fish lately he said you knowbrain food slam us over to full power astern and we can keep the pocahontas between us and whoever that son of a bitch out there is and speaking of which he turned and ran toward the depthcharge projector at the stern george ran that way too toward the onepounder by the projector hadnt thought of that he admitted it is pretty sly i guess theres only one thing wrong with it that i can think of sturtevant who wasnt young and wasnt skinny wheezed to a stop by his post yeah he said panting we aint gonna have a shield much longer thats it george agreed the pocahontas arkansas was sinking fast going down by the bow even as enos watched another torpedo hit shook the freighter he shivered that one was meant for us you bet it was sturtevant said the pocahontas arkansas rolled over and sank only a handful of men from her were bobbing in the water when she did and the undertow she generated when she went down pulled a couple of them with her what do we do now george asked if we hang around here and pick those guys up that submersible is liable to put the next one into us but if we donthell i wouldnt want to be one of those poor bastards me neither sturtevant said he lowered his voice so lieutenant crowder couldnt hear him before continuing every once in a whiletimes like this mostlyim glad im not an officer between you me and the bulkhead i dont want to have to play god enos nodded without hesitation up on the bridge the ericsson s skipper made his choice also without hesitation sailors hurled cork life rings toward the men still struggling in the ocean as the destroyer steamed past them the ship did not stop or even slow to pick up survivors as sturtevant had said the submarine that had torpedoed the pocahontas arkansas was sure to be waiting its own skipper hopefully licking his chops for any such move a runner came back from the bridge to lieutenant crowder sir captains orders are for you to lay down as many depth charges as you can set for widely different depths when we reach the position where we reckon the submersible is at we may not sink the bastard but well make him keep his head down while we pick up the men from the supply ship aye aye crowder said crisply he turned to the depthcharge crew and started giving orders sturtevant ignored some of them as he gave his own instructions to the men who served the projector when a signal flag waved from the bridge the crew methodically pumped one depth charge after another into the blue water of the atlantic the water soon began boiling and seething from the force of the explosions under the surface george enos eagerly peered astern looking for leaking oil or a trail of air bubbles that might mark a damaged submersible he spied nothing of the sort neither did anyone else we ought to be operating in a flotilla lieutenant crowder grumbled if we had three destroyers after that submersible instead of just our one wed sink him for sure if i had a million dollars enos thought abruptly the ericsson broke off the attack on the submarine and raced back toward the survivors from the pocahontas arkansas after hauling the four or five of them aboard with lines the destroyer hurried away from the spot where the supply ship had gone down carl sturtevant sighed well the limey or the reb down there under the water won that one damn him to hell and gone yeah enos said his boston accent making the word come out as ayuh didnt get us though so i reckon hes not as happy as he might be a destroyer is worth a hell of a lot of freighters i aint gonna tell you youre wrong sturtevant said but the games not over yet either hes still down there hes trying to get us were trying to get him wonder if well lock horns again how will we even know whether we ever fight the same boat again or some different one george asked sturtevant chewed on that for a moment before he shrugged what difference does it make any time one of those bastards shows himself well go after him whether hes this boat or a different one george considered then nodded i wont tell you youre wrong he said seawater from a new leak dripped down onto commander roger kimballs cap the electric motors were running on very low power just enough to keep the prop turning over and give the bonefish steering way the roars of exploding depth charges some well removed from the submersible others terrifyingly close put kimball in mind of a summer thunderstorm back home then the rain of depth charges stopped kimball pulled out his watch he let one minute tick by two and then reluctantly three when the third quiet minute had passed he turned to his exec and said take us up to periscope depth tom are you sure sir lieutenant brearley said god only knows where the damnyankees are up there theyre liable to be waiting around to spot us so they can drop the other shoe kimball growled discontentedly deep in his throat tom brearley had a point but every instinct in kimball cried out for attack im blind down here dammit he muttered only way to find out where the damnyankees are is to go looking for em he pulled out his watch again after the small second hand went round its dial twice more he spoke again this time in tones that brooked no disagreement periscope depth aye aye sir brearley said though he sent kimball another reproachful look the skipper of the bonefish generously failed to let himself notice it the boat climbed out of the depths in which it had taken shelter from the pounding the yankee destroyer had given it as soon as the periscope lifted above the surface of the atlantic kimball started to curse hes hightailing it out of here he snarled in disgust might have got the lousy bastard if id surfaced a little faster he glowered at his executive officer some people are afraid of their own shadows sir brearley said stiffly and the fetid atmosphere inside the bonefish got nasty in a different way be a cold day in hell before i listen to somebody elses jimjams again instead of my own plain good sense kimball said he was growling at brearley but was angrier at himself he hadnt obeyed his own instincts and had lost a chance to take out the yankee destroyer trying to spread oil over troubled waters ben coulter said that yankee fourstacker has a right smart skipper way he slid behind the freighter we nailedwho would have reckoned hed be so sneaky never came close to giving us a good shot at him all the more reason to wish the son of a bitch was down at the bottom of the ocean kimball said if that wasnt the ericsson it was another one from the same class they still think they sank us one day soon im going to think i sank them too only difference is im going to be right he rotated the periscope through a complete circle no other yankee surface ships besides the destroyer were above the horizon and she wouldnt be for long not the way she was scooting the bonefish would be able to surface soon kimball shook his head he should have surfaced after a double triumph the freighter and the warship both presently the ericsson or whoever she was vanished from periscope view kimball stayed submerged a while longer all the same the destroyer had a higher observation point and therefore a wider horizon than he did when he judged the us ship could no longer spot him he grudged a few words toward tom brearley bring us to the surface aye aye sir the exec answered he tried to add a light note time to get some fresh air anyhow kimball didnt answer he told off ben coulter to hold his legs while he opened the hatch at the top of the conning tower as always the pressurized air rushing out seemed particularly foul kimball already felt like throwing up but was too stubborn to do it he climbed out onto the conning tower and looked around nothing but ocean as far as the eye could see no smoke on the horizon the wind had dispersed the plume from the ericsson or her twin and no other ship was close enough to be showing he might have had the whole atlantic to himself and then tom brearley came clanking up the steel rungs of the ladder the executive officer inhaled deeply then chuckled feels good to breathe in something you cant taste kimball didnt answer he turned his back so that he stared out at a different quadrant of the ocean behind him he heard brearley shift his feet on the conningtower roof he pretended he didnt hear he pretended the exec didnt exist he wished the pretense were true brearley was young and earnest and lousy at taking hints instead of going below he cleared his throat kimball kept right on ignoring him but when brearley began sir i just wanted to say that kimball couldnt ignore him any more he whirled so fast and fierce that he plainly startled the exec and might have frightened him too you jogged my elbow he said in a soft deadly voice because you jogged my elbow that damn destroyer got away if you think i am very happy about that mr brearley you had better think again but sir brearley said if he had been sitting there waiting for us he could have dropped half a dozen ash cans in our lap yeah he could have kimballs head jerked up and down in a single short sharp nod but he didnt on account of he wasnt sitting there i didnt think hed be sitting there but you got the whimwhams and you put my back up too and so we stayed down longer than we should have and so the son of a bitch got away if you reckon i am very happy with you youre wrong brearley got a stubborn martyred look on his face sir it is my duty to advise you on matters concerning the welfare of the boat he said stiffly i would be failing in my duty if i kept silent if you choose not to take my advice that is your privilege as captain if you do take it though the responsibility becomes yours not mine he was right by the book he was right by everything kimball had learned at the naval academy at mobile he was right but the way things really worked especially on a boat as cramped as a submarine wasnt exactly the way the book said it was kimball snarled something sulfurous under his breath you think twice before you open your mouth out of turn again he said aloud do you hear me mr brearley yes sir brearley said in a voice much colder than the weather a low buzzing filled kimballs ears for a moment he thought it was the sound of his own rage then he realized it was real and coming from outside himself he looked around as he might have for a mosquito till he spotted the aeroplane approaching from the northeast coming from that direction it was unlikely to be off a confederate cruiser or battleship for as long as he could he hoped it had been launched from a royal navy vessel that hope vanished when he saw the eagles heads on the undersides of the wings and on the fuselage the aeroplane had spotted the bonefish too and came in for a closer look at her kimball understood that hed come to the surface too recently to have run up a confederate naval jack on the conning tower or at the stern kimball waved to the pilot the fellow waved back he was close enough for kimball to seeand to distrusthis smile kimball smiled too as he would have at a poker table through that smile he said mr brearley go below but dont make a big fuss about doing it order the machinegun crew topside tell them to act as friendly toward that goddamn aeroplane as they canand if he gives them half a chance even a quarter of a chance i want them to shoot his ass off aye aye sir brearley said shall i have some other men come up on deck too to gawk at the aeroplane and keep the pilot from paying attention to the gunners yeah do that tom kimball nodded without noticing he slipped back into the informal address common aboard submersibles now that the exec had made a good suggestion he tacitly forgave him brearley slipped below if the pilot of that aeroplane didnt like it all he had to do was turn around and fly away he didnt he came around for another pass close by the bonefish he was still trying to figure out to whose navy she belonged out came the sailors they pointed at the aeroplane and waved to the pilot and generally acted as much like damn fools as they could some of them were alarmingly good at the role the pilot waved back he was spiraling higher into the sky now maybe hed satisfied himself that the bonefish was a us boat in that case he was a damn fool or maybe like everybody else in this little charade he was sandbagging nobody had fired the machine gun aft of the conning tower at a real target since the bonefish went up the congaree river to help put down the red uprising among the negroes almost a year and a half before it burst into noisy staccato life now tracers drawing hot orange lines in the direction of the us flying machine something fell from between the aeroplanes floats kimball yipped with triumphant glee thinking the gunners had damaged the yankee aircraft a couple of his men cheered too but someone yelled thats a bomb an instant before it smashed down into the sea and exploded a few yards in front of the bonefish s bow a great column of water and spray rose and then fell drenching the sailors farthest up the hull and even splashing a little water into kimballs face he swiped a sleeve across his eyes then stared up toward the us aeroplane with a new and startled respect if it had another bombhe was about to shout orders for a crash dive when the aeroplane flew off in the direction from which it had come that son of a bitch he said indignantly that son of a bitch hed hit us square there hed have sunk us he shook his fist at the receding aeroplane i didnt know the damnyankees were putting bombs aboard those things these days cant trust anybody any more i expect we gave him a nasty surprise too tom brearley said hope to jesus we did kimball said but putting a bomb on one of those scout aeroplaneswar just got a little tougher having em flying around and spying on us is bad enough if they can hurt us once they spot us instead of sending for their pals on the wirelesswell hell if they can do that how are we supposed to do what were supposed to do we need a proper antiaircraft gun sir a onepounder not just the machine gun brearley said kimball nodded that might help it wasnt the answer though for the life of him he didnt know what the answer was thegreatwar breakthroughs sylvia enos was discovering that brigid coneval had been right boston held plenty of jobs a lot of them paid better than the one shed had in the canning plant too in the time since she last looked for work wages had risen sharply her own had gone up too but not by so much the more she saw what others were getting the more she kicked herself as a fool for not quitting sooner she also discovered many more jobs were open to women than had been true when she got work after george went into the navy she didnt see any women in overalls with pickaxes and sledgehammers on roadpaving crews but that was about the only limitation she found reason for quitting previous position afemaleclerk asked at a shoe factory both my children came down with chicken pox at the same time she answered as shed answered several times already she looked for a sympathetic glance from the clerk who wore a wedding band but got nothing but the well wheres the rest of it expression a bored man might have used a bit nonplused she went on i didnt have anyone else who could watch them and the canning plant wouldnt hold the job for methey could hire someone without any experience and pay her less that still rankled theyd used her and then they went and threw her away with no more hesitation than if shed been a torn label massachusetts despite agitation did not let women vote if it had sylvia would have voted socialist without a moments hesitation except for that will this plant give you a good character the clerk made as if to reach for the telephone on her desk yes i think so sylvia said the clerk did not pick up the earpiece and ask for the operator sylvia smiled to herself the woman had wanted to see if shed been lying and could be panicked into revealing it after scribbling a note to herself the woman said you do know how to use a sewing machine oh yes sylvia nodded im like most people i suppose i have one at home and i use it when i have the time i buy some readytowear but making clothes for myself and the children saves a lot of money shed done a lot of sewing while she was home with george jr and mary jane shed sewn and shed taken care of the children and shed read the books and magazines in the apartment till she could have recited chunks of them from memory shed got out very little she was hard pressed to remember when shed felt more delight than that which filled her when her childrens blisters got crusty and scabbed over and the scabs started falling off have you ever sewn leather with a sewing machine the hiring clerk asked sylvia shook her head if she lied there she would be too easily found out no ive never done anything like that she admitted well come try it the clerk said im sure well be able to find you an empty machine she got up from her desk follow me please back in the enormous work area little old mentoo old to be conscriptedsat hunched over about a third of the sewing machines women of all ages used the rest the men with only a couple of exceptions ignored sylvia so intent were they on their work most of the women looked her over curious as she would have been to see who might be hired next here the clerk said pointing to a machine with no one at it let me find you a couple of leather scraps and you can see what its like the stool behind the sewing machine had no back and was not very comfortable but it was an improvement over standing all day which sylvia had been doing before when she stretched out her right leg to set her foot on the treadle she got a surprise we have electric motors on the machine the clerk said seeing what must have been the startled look on her face it lets the operators work much faster on thick leather like this than they could with footpowered machines youll see what i mean she handed sylvia two pieces of shoe leather join these together with two straight seams about a quarterinch apart all right sylvia said sure enough the sewing machine had a switch near the base she flicked it and the motor hummed to life before guiding the pieces of leather under the needle she noted how sturdy it was and how strong and thick the thread that went through the eye as she started to sew her right foot went up and down up and down even though it wasnt on a treadle the hiring clerk smiled a lot of girls do that when they first come here she said some of them keep right on doing it even after theyve worked here for years do they sylvia hardly noticed answering because the needle snarled into action the motor was strong as the very devil she felt as if she were riding a poorly broken horse the needle seemed to bite its way through the leather with every stitch the machine took shed hurt herself once or twice with her own sewing machineshe didnt want to think what this one would do to her hand if she slipped or got careless she knew nothing but relief when she turned off the machine and handed the clerk her sample work the woman examined it then slowly nodded thats very nice she said even straight you can do the work no doubt about it starting pay is fifty cents an hour you go up to fiftyfive after three months that was more money than shed been making at the cannery what time does the shift start tomorrow morning she asked eight oclock the hiring clerk answered eight oclock sharp youre docked for every minute youre late and for every minute you clock out early i didnt expect anything different sylvia answered this place looked to be like all the others they wanted everything from the people they were generous enough to hirethat was how theyd look at it anyhowbut what would they give back what had the canning plant given back only a swift goodbye still at fifty cents an hourfiftyfive if she stayedshed soon make up for the time shed lost taking care of the children fifty cents an hour plus the allotment she got from georges pay was pretty good money it was more money than shed ever imagined making for herself it would have been more money still had prices not risen right along with and sometimes faster than wages she got reminded how prices had gone up when she stopped at the coal board offices on the way home from the shoe factory being able to go without having the children along was an unusual blessing the coal board was bureaucracy at its most plodding and george jr and mary jane did not take well to waiting in interminable lines neither did sylvia not when the petty functionary she finally reached told her next months ration would be smaller but cost more this is the third time this year ive heard that she exclaimed in dismay its not right im sorry maam the fellow said sounding not a bit sorry why arent you in the army sylvia thought resentfully the coal board clerk went on i am not responsible for setting policy you must understand maam only for seeing that it is carried out here let me stamp your ration ticketshe did plying the rubber stamp with might and mainso you can go over to line c to pay for the coal remember you cannot acquire it without the stamp i just gave and the pay confirmation stamp you will receive in line c i remember sylvia said how could i forget she went and stood in line c and stood there and stood there at last grudgingly the clerk there accepted her money and added his square red stamp to the other bureaucrats round black one obtaining coal without a ration coupon showing both authorization and pay confirmation marking is a violation of law punishable by fine or imprisonment or both he droned oh yes i know sylvia could have repeated the rigmarole back at him she heard it every month we are pleased to have been of service to you the clerk said just as if he meant it then while she was still standing in front of him he forgot sylvia existed next luxuriating in an afternoon without the children and with a job in hand sylvia went out and bought a couple of shirtwaists and a skirt in the new style that daringly left the ankles bare it was advertised as saving fabric for the war effort that she was convinced had nothing to do with why only a couple were left on the rack people finally felt victory in the air and wanted to bust loose and go a little wild she took her purchases home before going out again to pick up the children that was another small extravagance but she would have plenty of nickels coming in to make up for the extra one she was spending on trolley fare both george jr and mary jane looked forlorn with the marks of the chicken pox still upon them but they had been certified as noncontagious several of george jrs classmates were down with the disease as well as another girl mrs dooley cared for after supper the children were playing and sylvia washing dishes when someone knocked on the door whos that mama mary jane said i dont know sylvia said im not expecting anyone apprehension filled her as she went to the door opening it she breathed a silent sigh of relief to find no western union messenger standing there but rather isabella antonelli come in sylvia exclaimed have you eaten can i make you coffee as the children stared at the woman who was a stranger to them mrs antonelli said coffee will be fine i have eaten yes thank you i am not very hungry anyhow the two women sat at the kitchen table and chatted when they didnt pay much attention to george jr and mary jane the children gradually stopped gaping at isabella antonelli sylvia was sure she hadnt come to talk about the weather or even the high price of coal whatever was on her mind she would get to it when she was ready eventually she did mr winter asked me to marry him the other day thats wonderful sylvia said at the same time thinking better you than me have you set a day yet he wants it to be in about six months isabella answered slowly deliberately she set both hands above her navel that is about five months later than i would like her meaning was unmistakable sylvias eyes widened the widow antonelli nodded adding he does not know this yet what do i do oh sylvia understood why isabella had not gone to her family even if she was a widow they would have pitched a fit all the italians shed ever met were like that after some thought she said i think youd better tell him panic filled isabella antonellis face and what if he leaves me i do not know if he wants a child dear doesnt he have one whether he wants one or not sylvia asked to which isabella gave a miserable nod or you could look for an abortionist sylvia thought but she had no idea how to go about finding one shed never needed to for which she heartily thanked god she never would have advised anyone to do anything so flagrantly illegal anyhow and isabella was catholic which would have made the suggestion worse than illegal in her eyes that is so she said now her fingers spread there on her belly hed better know sylvia said it is his business too after all i think hell do whats right she was by no means sure the canningplant foreman would butif he doesnt do you want to have him around anyway with a bambino coming i want someone around isabella said in a firm voice i think you are right though he is a good man he will do what is right grazie thank you she rose kissed sylvia on the cheek and was gone before sylvia could say goodbyeor anything else why did she come over here mama george jr asked to talk sylvia answered absently why dont you and your sister get ready for bed she ignored the howls of protest that brought better you than me isabella she thought again better you than me wearily jefferson pinkard and the rest of his regiment marched out of the front lines wearily he groused with his buddies about how criminal it was to leave them at the front for so long without a breather what i reckon it is sergeant albert cross said is that richmond done forgot we was even here so of course they forgot to send anybody out to take our goddamn place a couple of people laughed relatively recent replacements most of them who were innocent enough to think that was meant as a joke this texas prairie sure as hell is the ass end of nowhere pinkard muttered wouldnt surprise me one damn bit if everybody forgot about us to me the country does not look so bad hipolito rodriguez said pinkard grunted next to the chunk of sonora rodriguez had tried to farm the west texas prairie was liable to look pretty good which when you got down to it was a frightening thought the stocky little sonoran went on and the yankees jeff the yankees they dont forget about us pinkard grunted nobody could deny that the us advance wasnt going fastthe united states didnt have as many men in texas as they needed eitherbut it was and remained an advance nobody talked about throwing them back on lubbock any more the most anybody would talk about was halting their advance and talk outran reality there too sergeant cross said damn me to hell and toast my toes over the fire if it aint gonna feel good not to get shot at for a while si es verdad hip rodriguez said muy bueno yeah pinkard said because rodriguez expected him to say something like that he didnt mean it though he suspected his pal knew he didnt mean it rodriguez had enough tact for any other dozen soldiers jeff had ever met jeff wanted to be in the trenches he wanted to be in the yankee trenches killing yankees when he was doing that he didnt have to think about anything else replacements came forward to fill the trenches pinkard and his comrades were leaving it was a black unit with white noncoms and officers moving the men along mallates rodriguez said shaking his head you know down where i was living i didnt hardly never see no niggers not till i come into the army isnt like that in alabama jeff said bout as many of em back home as there are white men didnt have to bring niggers down into sonora with greasers there already but he didnt say that out loud and hoped hip didnt know he thought it rodriguez was a good soldier and a good guya good friendeven if he was a greaser on they trudged toward the tiny hamlet of grow texas whose dusty main street all of two blocks long made a liar of the cockeyed optimist whod named the place most of the buildings along those two blocks had been turned into saloons texas was officially dry where soldiers were involved people looked the other way some of the barmaidsmost of the barmaidssold more than beer and whiskey too up above every saloon were several small rooms in constant frantic use that sort of thing did not officially exist either jeff had never felt the urge to go upstairs in any place like that of which hed seen a good many a few shots of whiskey maybe some pokerthat had been plenty he didnt know what the hell hed do now along with most of his pals he went into a saloon that called itself the gold nugget when they got inside sergeant cross said they should have named this place the cow pie he didnt walk out though none of the other dives in grow was any different sawdust on the floor a bouncer with a bludgeon on his belt and a sawedoff shotgun by his chair the stink of sweat and booze and the barmaids cheap perfumethey all came with saloons in grow and in any of scores of little towns behind both sides of the line from the atlantic to the gulf of california somebody from another unit got out of a chair while jeff was standing by it he threw his backside into it before anyone else could a barmaid wiggled through the crowd of soldiers trying to crowd up to the bar their hands roamed freely till she almost decked one of them with a roundhouse slap i aint apples boys she said you got to pay before you pinch the merchandise she spoke good english but her accent reminded pinkard of hip rodriguezs so did her chamoiscolored skin and black black eyes most of the barmaids were of mexican blood a few were black jeff didnt see any white women at the gold nugget though some did work in the other saloons in grow when the barmaid finally got over to him he ordered a double shot of whiskey and gave her a dollar which would have been outrageous before the war and was too damned expensive now pinkard wasnt one of the ones who groused about that thoughwhat the hell else did he have to do with his money except spend it on hooch and whatever other pleasures he could find he knocked the whiskey back in a hurry after the barmaidconsuela some of the guys were calling herbrought it to him it wasnt the sort of whiskey to sip and savor it tasted like kerosene and went down his throat as if it were wearing shoes with long sharp spikes but once it got to his stomach it made him hot and it made him stupid and that was the point of the exercise he waved his empty glass a signal that he wanted a full one to take its place eventually he got one he drank it and peered around the gold nugget looked cleaner the kerosene lamps looked brighter he wondered what the devil the barkeep was putting in the whiskey when he waved the glass again consuela brought him another refill she looked better too a moment later she plopped herself down in his lap coyly she spoke in spanish te gustaria chingar he had a pretty good idea what it meant chinga tu madre was one of the things hip rodriguez yelled at the yankees when he ran out of english to leave jeff in no possible doubt consuela wrapped her arms around his neck and gave him a big kiss he wondered whom else shed kissed latelyand where after a few seconds though his blood heated and he stopped worrying we go upstairs she asked coming back to english then her voice got amazingly pragmatic ten dollars you have a hell of a good time ten dollars was at least five dollars too much with three doubles sloshing around inside him jefferson pinkard wasnt inclined to argue upstairs he agreed surprised at the way his tongue stumbled inside his mouth ten dollars hell of a good time going up the stairs took longer than it would have if hed been sober the cubicle to which consuela led him was cramped and humid and smelled as if someone should have taken a hose to it a long time before she held out a hand for the money then shucked out of her clothes with nonchalant aplomb he had a little trouble rising to the occasion ill fix consuela said and started to lower her head no jeff exclaimed she looked up at him in surprise she probably hadnt had anybody refuse that offer lately but instead of consuelas face jeff saw emilys her eyes glowing on the night hed caught her with bedford cunningham shed lowered her head that same way the mixture of pleasure and pain was too strong for him to want to repeat it he spat on his palm and played with himself instead till he was stiff enough to go into consuela she shrugged and did her best to hurry him along once he was inside her the second after he spent himself he wished he hadnt bothered that was too late of course hip rodriguez came out of a little cubicle two doors down from the one hed used the little sonoran looked drunk and sad too ah jeff he said i do this it feels good and i still miss my esposa maybe i miss her more than ever where is the sense in this can you tell me he was drunk all right and drunkenly serious sense jefferson pinkard shook his head damned if i see any of that anywhere at all he wondered if he missed emily he supposed he did when an opium fiend couldnt get his pipe he missed it didnt he that was how jeff missed his wife he wanted her he longed for her and he wanted her and longed for her even though he knew she wasnt good for him downstairs the bouncer and a couple of military policemen were breaking up a brawl the military policemen looked like men going about their business the bouncer looked like someone having a hell of a good time pinkard wouldnt have wanted to tangle with him and he was a big man whod been a steelworker before going into the army he wondered why the bouncer wasnt wearing a uniform himself maybe they didnt make one wide enough through the shoulders to fit him had a tent had sleeves that might have worked consuela didnt waste much time upstairs pretty soon she was down on the floor of the saloon again hustling drinks and pretty soon again she was going up the stairs with another soldier look at that jeff said just look at that if she does that kind of business every day shell end up owning half of texas by the time the wars over yes and the yankees will own the other half rodriguez said and do you know what else jeff i will not be sorry sonorans have no love for texans more than anyone else in the csa texans treat sonorans like niggers let the yankees have texas hasta la vista hasta luego he waved derisively adios but youre fighting in texas pinkard pointed out never heard you talk like this here before yes i am fighting in texas rodriguez agreed sadly mala suerte bad luck you never hear me talk like this his smile was oddly sweet i am not so drunk before i think when we talk of texas i dont give a damn about texas myself any more pinkard said hell weve lost the damn war like you say the damnyankees are welcome to the place all i want to do is go back home you no say go back home to my wife like you used to rodriguez said you didnt used to go up with the putas neither when they take us out of line leave it alone hip jeff said leave it the hell alone whatever happened back there happened is all it aint anybodys business but mine rodriguez looked at him with large liquid eyes he realized hed never before admitted anything out of the ordinary had happened back in birmingham the sonoran said i hope it turns out well for you whatever it is i got my doubts but i hope so too jeff said and fell asleep in his chair even out in the middle of the ocean sam carsten kept a weather eye peeled for aeroplanes whenever he came out on the uss dakota s deck he was still amazed at how much damage a bomb explosion could do the one from the argentinebased aeroplane had caused at least as much harm as a hit from a battleships secondary armament hastily welded sheets of steel covered the destruction the bomb had wrought they looked as out of place as bandages covering a wound on a mans body because the patches were neither painted nor smooth they drew the wrath of petty officers merely by existing sam laughed when he had that notionhe was a petty officer himself these days even if he did still think like an ordinary seaman hiram kidde came up beside him kidde had been one of the exalted for a long time now carsten waited for some snide comment about the way the dakota looked with a steel plate in her head or at the least a grumble over the repairs not having been neater he got nothing of the sort what kidde said was its a good thing those limey sons of bitches didnt have an armorpiercing nose on that bomb the way weve got armorpiercing shells otherwise that one little bastard wouldve done even worse than it did carsten considered that after a couple of seconds he nodded youre likely right capn he said this was only a first try though i expect theyll get it right or we will or somebody will pretty damn quick kidde gave him a look that was anything but warm you know what youre saying dont you he demanded youre saying we might as well melt the dakota and all the other battlewagons in the whole damn navy down for tin cans right now on account of by the time the next war rolls around aeroplanesll sink em before they get within five hundred miles of where theyre going am i saying that sam did some more thinking well maybe i am but i tell you whatmaybe we dont melt em down for cans till after this here war is over because i dont figure the aeroplanesll sink too many battleships this time out real white of you the gunners mate said real white you make me feel like a guy in the buggywhip business going broke an inch at a time because people are buying fords instead of buggies these days hell of a big buggy whip were sailing on sam observed after letting his eye run along the dakota from bow to stern dont talk stupid hiram kidde snapped you know what im talking about youre a squarehead yeah but you never were a dumb squarehead goddamn capn you say the sweetest things carsten said and they both laughed after one more pause for thought carsten went on maybe well get some use out of battleships in the next war after all he didnt doubt there would be a next war there would always be a next war kidde got a cigar going then held it in his mouth at an angle that made his dubious look even more dubious wait a minute youre the same guy who was just saying somebodyd have armorpiercing aeroplane bombs long about day after tomorrow or next week at the latest soon as that happens the jig is up right maybe sam said maybe not too its up if the aeroplanes get to drop the bombs on the ships sure as hell but if our side has aeroplanes too to shoot down the other fellows bombing aeroplanes the battleships can get on with the job theyre supposed to be doing right now kidde stopped and did some thinking that sounds good he said when he came out of his own study but i dont think it works you squeeze enough you might be able to mount two or three aeroplanes on a battleship maybe one or two on a cruiser that wont be enough to hold off all the aeroplanes the other bastards can throw at you from dry land mmm carsten saidan unhappy grunt yeah youre right a fleetd need a whole ship stuffed full of aeroplanes and there is no such animal see hiram kidde said you got to keep your head on your shoulders or else you go flying off every which way he walked down toward the stern puffing contentedly on his cigar carsten stuck his thumbs in his trouser pockets and slowly mooched after the gunners mate his idea had been pretty foolish when you got down to it he had a picture of the navy whose business was ships building a ship to take care of aeroplanes it hung in his mental gallery right alongside the portrait of the first negro president of the confederate states the dakota swung through a turn toward the west toward the argentine coast sam knew what that meant it meant that aeroplanes or no aeroplanes the flotilla was going to bore in and see what they could do to the british convoys scuttling along in or near argentine territorial waters he supposed that made sense it sure as hell made dollars and cents this attack had surely cost millions to fit out and as surely hadnt worked near enough devastation to be worthwhile rear admiral bradley fiske either had wireless orders from philadelphia to do something worth doing or else he was going to try to do something big to keep from getting wireless orders from philadelphia telling him to sail his command back to valparaiso and forget about marauding in the south atlantic carsten had no way of knowing which of those was true but hed been in the navy long enough to be pretty sure it was one or the other rear admiral fiske was also doing everything he could to keep the dakota and the american and chilean ships with her from getting a nasty surprise of the sort theyd already had once long before klaxons hooted men to their battle stations he had crews at all the antiaircraft guns on the battleships deck he also sent not only the dakota s aeroplane but the other two the flotilla boasted off to the west ahead of the ships they wouldnt be able to fight off any bombing aeroplanes but they could at least warn of their presence sam wondered how much good that would do he shrugged it couldnt hurt the us aeroplanes could and did do one other useful thing they could spot convoys for the dakota and her companions to attack down in the fiveinch guns sponson sam attributed a sudden shift in course to the north as likely springing from a wireless report hope they havent stuck some freighters out there to humbug us into getting too close luke hoskins said now theres a nice cheery thought carsten said he turned to hiram kidde who was peering out through the vision slit see anything capn smoke trails the chief of the gun crew answered cant spot the ships that are making em though land behind em we a thunderous roar interrupted him thats the main armament sam said unnecessarily if it werent the main armament it had to be the end of the world kidde looked disgusted they must have let the big guns open up as soon as they could take the range up in the crows nest on the observation mast skipper doesnt want to get in close enough to let us do any work after what happened that one time do you blame him sam asked blame him hell yes i blame him i want to be in on the fun too stead of sitting around here like some homely girl nobody wants to dance with kidde said he paused now if you ask me whether i think hes smart to do it this way thats a different question yeah hes smart listen hoskins said from behind sam the best fighting is the fighting you dont have to do as he spoke he had both hands on the casing of a shell ready to pass it to carsten nope kidde shook his head what matters is winning if we can win here easy enough so they dont have to squawk for the secondaries thatll be fighting we dont have to do sam said we this gun crew i mean give the man a big fat smelly cigar and put him in the judge advocates office kidde said with a snort sure as hell sounds like a bunkroom lawyer to me i always hated a rebel accent carsten said but this one time when i was a kid i heard a fellow from louisiana going on and on about lawyershed just lost a lawsuit down in the csa i guessand every time he said the word it sounded like he was saying liars i liked that the older i get the better i like it too i remember one time i luke hoskins began they never found out what hed done or said or thought one time because the main armament bellowed out another broadside speech was impossible through that great slab of noise thought nearly so then kidde shouted hithis voice sounding thin and lost after the guns spoke with twelveinch throats everybody yelled after that carsten elbowed his way to the vision slit sure enough out there far away a british or argentine or french freighter was burning sending up more smoke than could ever have come out its stack the cruisers with the flotilla were firing too their guns had enough range to reach the freighters the destroyers stayed silent for the excellent good reason that their main armament was no match for the fiveinch guns of the battleships secondary weaponry battleships were fierce proud creatures sure as sure nothing that prowled the sea could beat them for a moment that thought made sam carsten feel as large and powerful as the ship of which he was a tiny part then he remembered submersibles and floating mines and the gnat of an aeroplane that had carried such a nasty sting in its tail twenty years earlier battleships might have been all but invulnerable save to one another it wasnt like that any more what would it be like for battleships twenty years down the road he and hiram kidde had had that discussion just a little while before he came up with the same answer as he had then it would be tough as hell that was twenty years down the road though now here the battleships and cruisers methodically pounded the convoy of freighters to bits no one came out to challenge them no torpedo boats no submersibles no aeroplanes they had everything their own way just as they would have in the old days before aeroplanes before submersibles when even torpedo boats were hardly to be feared sam should have felt triumphant in fact he did feel triumphant but only in a limited way we pounded them to bits wasnt really what was going through his mind it was much more on the order of thank you jesus we got away with one this time the canucks and the limeys were pushed back to their last line in front of toronto theyd been working on that line since probably since before thatand had no doubt worked on it again after barrels entered the picture if toronto fell the war for ontario was as near over as made no difference they did not intend to let it fall what the canadians and british intended was not the most urgent thing on jonathan moss mind he had been a part of the struggle since the day it opened thinking back on the curtiss super hudson aeroplane with the pusher prop hed flown then he laughed if either side presumed to put a flimsy old bus like that in the air in this modern day and age it would last only until the first enemy fighting scout spotted it and shot it downunless of course it fell out of the sky of its own accord as such antiques had been all too prone to do moss set a gloved hand on the dopedfabric skin of his fast graceful streamlined wright twodecker here was a machine to conjure with nothing like the awkward makeshifts with which both the quadruple alliance and the entente had gone to war archie from the enemys antiaircraft guns burst a little below moss flight some of those black puffs came close enough to make his aeroplane jerk from the concussion he started his game of avoidance speeding up slowing down gaining a little altitude losing some swinging his course now a few degrees to one side now a few to the other along both sides of the line tethered observation balloons hung in the sky like fat sausages some pilots went hunting for them with whole belts of tracer ammunition hoping the flaming phosphorus that made the rounds visible would set the hydrogen in the balloons afire anyone who got forced down on the other sides territory with that kind of load in his guns was unlikely to survive the experience even if he landed perfectly and some pilots hunted balloons with no more than their usual ammunition moss had gone after a few in his time on the front line but hed never really worked at being a balloon buster to him enemy aeroplanes and enemy troops on the ground seemed more important targets here today though one balloon in particular caught his eye it had to be floating close to a mile in the air a thousand feet or so higher than the other gasfilled cylinders from which observers watched us troops movements and called artillery down on the americans heads moss grunted a sound of discontent he could not hear over the roar of the engine and the shriek of the wind that balloon was liable to be a trap the enemy always had plenty of archie around his sausages if theyd run up a balloon there just to lure us aeroplanes they were liable to have more than plenty but those extra thousand feet would give an observer a long long look behind the american lines if the observation balloon was a trap it wasthat was all there was to it trap or not it needed taking out moss nodded to himself as decision firmed he swung his aeroplane toward the balloon percy stone hans oppenheim and pete bradley followed without hesitation though they had to know what they were liable to be getting into sure as hell heavy antiaircraft fire burst around moss twodecker as he approached the balloon told you so he said to no one in particular he did settle one thing to his satisfaction though it was an observation balloon not just a trap he could see a man moving in the wicker basket beneath the gas bag often a balloons groundcrew would reel it in by its cable when it came under attack that didnt happen here maybe the observer thought the archie would drive off the us aeroplanes maybe he was a patriot maybe he was a damn fool moss neither knew nor cared if the fellow stayed up there so temptingly high he was going to get himself and his balloon shot to bits the twin machine guns mounted about the fighting scouts engine started chattering moss aimed the stream of bullets first at the balloon and then at the smaller more difficult target the wicker basket made to his amazement the enemy observer started shooting back he was hideously outgunned but hed brought a rifle up there to keep him company and he was taking aimed potshots at moss and his flightmates the son of a bitch was a good shot too a bullet cracked past moss head close enough to scare him out of a years growth he jammed his thumb down on the firing button as hard as he could trying to blow holes in that crazy canadian or eccentric englishman or whatever the hell he was hed never live it down if he got shot down by an observer in a balloon basket that was a joke something to laugh at till hans oppenheims aeroplane pulled out of its run at the balloon and broke back toward the west toward the american lines either the bus or oppenheim himself was in trouble moss saw to his astonished dismay that his flightmate wasnt going to make it back to territory the us army controlled down hans went not far from an enemy artillery position canucks and limeys came running from every direction toward oppenheims aeroplane after seeing that moss had to look away because he was around the far side of the balloon with that infernal observer still blazing away at him and stone and bradley the son of a bitch was a good shot a bullet thrummed through the tightstretched fabric of the fuselage about three feet behind moss seat he whipped the wright twodecker into a tight turn and bored in on the observation balloon stone behind him to the right bradley to the left there he shouted in savage exultation as the hydrogen in the fabric sausage finally caught fire thatll teach you you bastard maybe nothing would teach the observer even as his crew on the ground at last began hauling down the flaming balloon he calmly climbed over the edge of the wicker basket from which hed fought so hard and so well and leaped off into space his parachute must have been connected to the basket by a static line for the big silk canopy opened almost at once pilots of fighting scouts were not issued parachutes moss didnt know whether to be jealous or to despise the device as a sissy affectation the latter he decided and swung the nose of his aeroplane down a little a burst from his machine gun and the observer hung limp and unmoving beneath the chute maybe moss wouldnt have done it had the fellow not shot down his friend but maybe he would have too that canuck or limey or whoever he was had been too damn good to let him live moss swooped down below the thunderous archie and streaked toward the spot where hans oppenheims aeroplane went down his flightmate wasnt inside the bus any more dead or alive the enemy soldiers had taken him away a crowd of men in khaki were gathered around the wright moss machinegunned them and whooped with glee to watch them scatter some didnt scattersome crumpled and wouldnt get up again then moss and stone and bradley zoomed past the disabled twodecker and low over the front line the canadian and british troops in the trenches gave them a warm sendoff with rifle and machinegun fire and then because they were coming out of the east half the americans assumed they had to be hostile and fired at them too more bullets pierced moss aeroplane now wouldnt that be bully he growled hell of a mission to have to try and explain to major cherney a balloon observer shot down one machine from the flight and our own ground fire made another one crash hed love that yes he would hed love it a hell of a lot but his twodecker kept flying and so he saw to his relief in the rearview mirror did those of percy stone and pete bradley us antiaircraft guns opened up on them too but they made it back to the orangeville aerodrome unscathed as moss had known it would be what happened to lieutenant oppenheim was the first question the groundcrew asked after he shut off the motor and the sounds of the outside world returned to his ears after he answered the silence that fell made him wonder if hed gone deaf youre joking aint you sir asked a fitter who was walking down the length of the fuselage and examining the bullet holes moss had picked up i mean to say you guys shoot at the balloons the guys in the balloons dont shoot backthats archies job you know that herm and i know that moss said but nobody ever told this skunk one thing thoughhe wont ever do it again the groundcrew man nodded at the grim emphasis he gave the words as they walked toward major cherneys tent stone and bradley sounded as disbelieving as had herm the nerve of that son of a gun bradley said over and over the nerve good thing you got him stone said to moss if somebody didnt punch his ticket for him hed have ended up an ace and he hasnt even got a motor in that damn thing when they told major cherney what had happened to hans oppenheim the squadron leader looked at them for a long time without saying anything at last he did speak you really mean it solemnly moss stone and bradley nodded cherney shook his head you go into a war you fight it for damn near three years you think youve heard every single thing that could happen and then he shook his head again shot down by an observer in a balloon i will be goddamned maybe its just as well for him that he didnt make it back to our side of the line nobody would ever have let him forget it i only hope hes alive to try and forget it sir pete bradley said i couldnt tell when we flew over his aeroplane neither could i moss and stone said together i will be goddamned major cherney repeated he let out a long slow sigh maybe the canucks will let us know they do sometimes when one of our boys gets forced down on their side same as we do for them two days later an enemy aeroplane dropped a note behind the us line in a washedout jam tin made more noticeable by the small chute taken from a parachute flare it duly made its way back to the orangeville aerodrome where major cherney called in moss stone and bradley hansie died of wounds he said heavily the canadians buried him with full military honors for whatever its worth thank you sir jonathan moss said with one accord he and his flightmates headed for the officers club after they left the squadron commanders tent after they had the first of what would be many drinks in front of them moss turned to the men on whom his life dependedand vice versa and said well boys i wonder what sort of birdll join our flock next wont be long till we find out bradley said soberlyfor the time beingmoss nodded time hung heavy in the hospital lying there with a rubber drainage tube coming out of the shoulder that still stubbornly refused to heal reggie bartlett had plenty of time to think and very little chance to do anything else one of the things he thought aboutand disapproved ofwas the weather you all sure this is really yankee country he asked the wounded us soldiers who filled most of the beds in the big ward richmond doesnt get any hotter and stickier than this st louis sure as hell pete reminded him the onelegged soldier winked you ought to feel at home aint that right doesnt mean i liked the weather reggie said anybody who likes summer in the confederate states is crazy he turned to his countryman for support isnt that right rehoboam the negro was scratching toes on the foot he no longer had as he often did he said dont know nothin bout what its like in richmond out in the fields down around hattiesburg mississippi where is from it gets powerful hot in the summertime this aint a patch on that i dont reckon from what ive heard about mississippi i expect hell would look chilly in the summertime next to it reggie said thoughtfully his shoulder twinged he grunted and thought some more till the pain faded then he added working in the fields down there doesnt sound like a whole lot of fun rehoboam looked at him from across the aisle you aint the stupidest white man i ever did see pete whistled you gonna let him talk to you like that reggie i thought a smoke who talked to a white man like that down in the csa could go and write his willexcept you wouldnt let him learn to write and he wouldnt own enough to bother leaving it to anybody youre a naturalborn troublemaker reggie told him if you still had that other leg id tear it off you and beat rehoboam to death with it thatd settle both of you there are you satisfied now minute i woke up and found out i was shy a pin i was satisfied and then some ill tell you that right now the amputee answered right then i knew id had all the fighting i was ever going to do reggie only grunted in reply to that he still wasnt satisfied not in that sense if he ever got healed up hed try to escape again hed done it once he didnt think doing it again would be so hard but while his leg wound bothered him less each day pus still dripped from that shoulder it left him sore and weak and feverish there were lots of things he told himself he should be doing but he lacked the energy to do any of them lying here was what he was up to and lying here was what he did in came the nurse with a tray of suppers everyone got an identical slab of chicken breastor possibly it was baked cardboardan identical lump of mashed potatoes with gravy that looked and tasted like rust and machine oil and something that might have been bread pudding or might have been sponge in molasses after working his way through the dismal meal reggie said you yankees are winning the damn waror you say you areand this is what they give you god have mercy on you if you were losing thats all i can tell you if cooking was something they shot out of the barrel of a gun wed be good at it pete said since it aint we havent much bothered with it since the end of the second mexican war had more important things to worry about instead rehoboam said the kind o cooking you yankees do here yall ought to shoot it out the barrel of a gun amen reggie said but if you shot it at our side youd just make the boys fight harder for fear of having to eat like that all the time pete laughed so did the rest of the wounded us soldiers they were no fonder of the grub the military hospital doled out than were their confederate counterparts and so did rehoboam but his laugh had an edge to it and his dark face twisted in a way that for once had nothing to do with the pain and phantom itches from his missing foot whats chewing on you reggie called across the aisle what do you reckon rehoboam returned when you was talkin bout what the boysd do you didnt mean me i aint the boys to you an i aint never gwine be the boys neither is just a nigger an id be a nigger without a gun if all the whites in the csa wasnt worse afeared o the damnyankees kickin em in the ass than they was of putting a tredegar in my hands and callin me a sojer he hadnt spoken in a loud voice but he hadnt particularly kept it down either everybody in the ward must have heard him silence slammed down everybody looked toward reggie bartlett to see what he would say he hadnt the faintest idea what the devil to say hed seen for himself that confederate blacks harbored a deep and abiding loathing for the whites who ruled them outside of the prisonerofwar camp in west virginia though none of them had ever come out and said so to his face rehoboam pressed the point too what you think reggie is that the truth or aint it bartlett had never had a negro simply call him by his name before either he said yeah thats the truth i was there in capitol square in richmond when president wilson declared war on the usa and i cheered and threw away my straw boater same as every other damn fool in the place if we could have licked these fellows herehe waved with his good arm at the men in the greengray hospital gownswithout giving black men guns of course wedve done it kept things like they always was you mean rehoboam said of course reggie repeated only after the words were out of his mouth did he realize it wasnt necessarily of course white confederate public opinion was so wedded to the status quo that realizing other choices were possible came hard then pete stuck his oar in the water saying blacks got guns of their own any which way dont know much about that especially not firsthand bartlett said i got captured over on the roanoke front before the risings started and theyd been put down by the time i got loose bunch of reds pete gleefully stoked the fire he got rehoboam hot too you take a man and you work him like they works niggers in the csa the negro growled and if he dont turn into no red he aint much in the way of a man wasnt for the risings i dont reckon congress never wouldve done nothin about the army wouldnt be surprised if youre right reggie said but they did do something you know i was thinking about that a while ago when you go back to mississippi youll be a citizen with all the same rights ive got mebbe rehoboam said through clenched teeth mebbe not too its what the law says bartlett pointed out aint got no black police aint got no black lawyers aint got no black judges aint got no black politicians rehoboam rolled his eyes at reggies naivete how much good you reckon the law gwine do fo the likes ome to reggie a law was a law to be obeyed automatically for no better reason than that it was there seeing another side of things made him feel jittery as if an earthquake had just shaken his bed still he answered if theres enough of the likes of you youll do all right you reckon the stork brings the babies too rehoboam asked acidly or do you figure they finds em under the cabbage leaves when they wants em the ward erupted in laughter laughter aimed at reggie his ears got hot no he said with venom of his own the red party chairman or general secretary assigns em thats how it worked in the socialist republics isnt it you liable to be too smart for your own good rehoboam said after a pause i doubt it not if i volunteered for the army bartlett replied and if you didnt want to be a citizen and if you didnt think being a citizen was worth anything what made you put on butternut that made the negro pause again mebbe i was hopin moren i was expectin you know what im sayin as a white man as a white man living in a country that had beaten its neighbor two wars in a row bartlett had seldom had to worry about hope his expectations and those of his white countrymen were generally fulfilled he said i wonder what the confederate states will look like after the wars over smaller pete put in both men from the csa ignored him rehoboam said we dont get whats comin to us we jus rise up again youll lose again reggie said arent enough of you and you still wont have enough guns and we wont be fighting the damnyankees any more mebbe they give us a hand rehoboam said mebbe they give us guns not likely now reggies voice was blunt they dont much fancy black folks themselves you know if we deal with you thatd suit them fine and rehoboam who had answered back as boldly as if he were a man who had known himself to be free and equal to all other men since birth now fell silent his eyes flicked from one of the wounded us soldiers with whom he shared the ward to the next whatever he saw there did not reassure him he buried his face in his hands pete said i guess you told him i guess i did said reggie who had not expected the negro to have so strong a reaction over what was to him simply a fact of nature he called to rehoboam come on stick your chin up its not that bad not for you rehoboams voice was muffled by the palms of his hands youre white you goddamn son of a bitch you got the world by the balls just on account of the noonday sun kill you dead if i had the world by the balls none of these damnyankee bastards would have shot me bartlett pointed out rehoboam grunted finally he said you had the world by the balls when you wasnt in the army anyways its the rich white bastards who dont never have to fight got the world by the balls all the time see i knew you were a red reggie said maybe hes just a good socialist pete said what the hells the difference reggie demanded rehoboam and pete both got offended they both started to explain the difference then they started to argue about the difference as if one of them were a methodist preacher and the other a hardshell baptist reggie lay back and enjoyed the show it was the most entertainment hed had since he got wounded bertha came back into flora hamburgers private office congresswoman mr wiggins is here to see you your two oclock appointment thank you flora told the secretary send him in she put away the transportation committee report shed been reading and wondered again whether she should have made the appointment with mr edward clhed insisted on both middle initialswiggins over the telephone he hadnt described his reason for wanting to see her as anything more specific than a matter of possible common interest well if that was a polite way of leading up to offering her a bribe shed show him out the door one minute and put the us marshals on his trail the next in he came he proved to be a chunky little man in his late forties sweating in a wool tweed suit and vest and fanning himself with a straw hat very pleased to make your acquaintance in person maam he said giving flora a nod just short of a bow his manner was courtly almost stagily so pleased to meet you too flora answered wondering if she was lying she did not believe in beating around the bush now that we are meeting in person i hope you will tell me what you have in mind i certainly aim to edward cl wiggins replied i want you to know i truly do admire the way youve spoken out against the war both before you got elected to congress and since i think it does you great credit flora had not expected that tack thank you she said but i dont quite see what that has to do with ill tell you then wiggins broke in you are not the only one who thinks this war was a mistake from the beginning and has gone on far too long already i do hope your brother is doing well as well as you can with one leg flora said tightly then she stared at her visitor how do you know about david and what happened to him are you connected with the war department and coming around here to gloat because i wouldnt play along with you no maam edward cl wiggins raised his right hand as if taking an oath i have nothing to do with the us government nothing whatsoever the people i have to do with dont want this war to go on any more they want to end it as soon as may be thats why im here because youve been bold enough and brave enough and wise enough to want the killing stopped too thank you flora repeated who are the people you have to do with he was not a socialist she was sure of that he behaved like a prominent man in his own circle whatever that was and it was not hers were the remnant republicans approaching her with some kind of deal was he a renegade democrat a capitalist whod grown a conscience you must understand this is at present highly unofficial maam wiggins said flora did not reply in another moment she was going to ask her visitor to leave he must have sensed that for he sighed and went on more quickly than hed spoken before very well maam i rely on your discretion unofficially i have to do with president gabriel semmes down in richmond the confederate states are looking to see if there might be an honorable way to put an end to this ghastly war flora hamburger gaped that was among the last answers shed expected why me she blurted if president semmes wants peace why not go straight to president roosevelt who can give it to him because president roosevelt has made it plain he does not want peace or peace this side of subjugation wiggins replied sooner than accept that the csa will go on fighting i was instructed to be very clear there but a fair peace an equitable peace a peace between equals a peace that will let both sides rebuild after this devastationthat president semmes will accept and gladly i see flora said slowly she had no great love for president gabriel semmes reckoning him as much a class enemy of the proletariat as theodore roosevelt his unofficial emissary had approached her in defense of no principle save his countrys interest stilli will take what you have said to president roosevelt i can urge him to accept the kind of peace you are talking about though you have given me no details kentucky has rejoined the usa for instance how do you stand on that we would accept the results of plebiscites as binding there and elsewhere wiggins answered flora nodded in understanding and some admiration that not only had a fine democratic ring to it it was likely to favor the csa edward cl wiggins went on we are also ready to negotiate all other matters standing in the way of peace between our two great american nations if president roosevelt wishes to reach you how may he do so flora asked i am at the aldine hotel on chestnut street wiggins said flora nodded again and wrote that down though she had not taken notes on any other part of the conversation wiggins rose bowed and departed flora stared down for a long time at the address shed written then she picked up the telephone and told the switchboard operator she wished to be connected with the powel house congresswoman hamburger president roosevelt boomed in her ear a couple of minutes later to what do i owe the honor of this call why does a radical socialist congresswoman want to talk with me was what he meant she gave him the gist of what wiggins had told her finishing in my opinion mr president any chance to end this horrible war is a good one roosevelt was silent for a while a novelty in itself then he said miss hamburger your brotherinlaw lost his life in the service of his country your brother has been wounded in that service and my heart goes out to him and to you and to your family i am going to speak plainly to you now in a fight if you have a man down you had better not let him up until you have finished beating him otherwise he will think he could have beaten you and he will try to beat you again first chance he sees if the confederate states want to say uncle they shouldnt come pussyfooting up to you and whisper it let them cry uncle for the whole wide world to hear havent you seen enough fighting yet mr president flora asked as for seeing it ive seen a great deal more than you have roosevelt answered ive seen enough that i dont want to see more in a generations time and that is why before i make peace with confederate states i aim to lick them till they dont dream about getting up any more and canada right along with em if the confederate states are seeking terms of peace dont you think theyve seen enough war flora said if they want peace miss hamburger roosevelt told her again let them come right out and say so instead of sneaking around behind my back can you grant them peace pray tell of course not flora said though i would if i could i would not roosevelt said most especially not if they go about it in this underhanded way and since i was comfortably returned as president of the united states defeating senator debs who shares your views i must conclude that my views on the subject are also the views of the large majority of the american people that was probably true because of it flora did not have a good opinion of the political wisdom of the large majority of the american people nationalism kept too many from voting their class interests she said mr wigginsmr edward cl wigginsis staying at the aldine hotel i think you should hear him out to see if the terms richmond proposes are acceptable to you not bloody likely roosevelt said with a snort what did this fellow with the herd of initials have to say about kentucky for instance roosevelt might be a class enemy but he was no fool flora reminded herself of it again he went straight for the center of things reluctantly she answered he spoke of a plebiscite and no roosevelt broke in kentucky is ours and stays ours and i need hear no more when the confederate states are serious they will let us know good day miss hamburger he hung up so did flora angrily slighted was the least of what she felt her first instinct was to call or wire half a dozen good socialist newspapers and break the story of the presidents refusal to negotiate with the csa but before she picked up the telephone once more she had second thoughts that had nothing to do with socialism and everything to do with the ghetto from which her family had escaped to the united states dont do anything to make things worse was the eleventh commandment of the ghetto at least as important as the original ten and so when she did pick up the telephone it was not to call the newspapers not at first at any rate instead when her call was answered she said may i please speak with mr blackford this is miss hamburger hello flora hosea blackford said a moment later to what do i owe the pleasure of this call flora felt her face heat at blackfords cordialmaybe even more than cordialtone as baldly as she could she told him of the approach from edward cl wiggins and of president roosevelts response to it when she was through she said i want to expose roosevelt for the bloodthirsty rogue he is but at the same time i dont want to do anything that would hurt the party blackford was silent even longer than roosevelt had been when she put wiggins proposal to him she heard him sigh start to speak and then stop at last he said much as i regret admitting it i would advise you to keep mrwiggins was itvisit to yourself you might embarrass teddy if you thunder what he did from the rooftops you might i say but i wouldnt want to bet on it youre too much likelier to embarrass us instead flora made automatic protest this is a capitalists war if we can keep the workers and farmers of one country from slaughtering those of another in the sacred name of profit how can we hold back because the workers and farmers of the united states will be perfectly happy to slaughter those of the confederacy and canada as long as they win in the end was blackford mournful or cynical or both at once flora couldnt tell the congressman from dakota went on a year ago i would have told you to take it to the papers as fast as you could a year ago the war was going nowhere and because it was going nowhere the confederate states wouldnt have come to anyone in congress looking for a way out flora said exactly blackford paused for a moment perhaps to nod but if you go to the papers now with the war on the edge of being won roosevelt will crucify us and say were jogging his elbowand im afraid people will believe him but flora didnt go on right away either she sighed instead it seemed to be her turn then she said all right hosea thank you you may be right only then did she realize shed called him by his first name i am right i wish i werent but i am he said and changed the subject how is your brother doing hes not going to die flora answered hes out of the woods as far as that goes hes only going to be crippled for life in this war that teddy roosevelt has brought to the edge of being won this war where we dont dare jog his elbow this great grand glorious triumphant war she hung up the telephone and very quietly began to cry thegreatwar breakthroughs when luther bliss unhappily released him from the covington kentucky city hall cincinnatus had devoutly hoped he would not see the inside of the building again that hope failed here he stood outside the city hall soon to be inside once more and very much to his surprise he was not filled with panic one thing he had seen since the usa drove the csa from kentucky bureaucrats were far more numerous and far more thorough than their cs counterparts that had a great deal to do with why he was standing in front of the covington city hall in the middle of a long line of negroes he and they laughed and gossiped as the line moved forward why not they were friends and neighbors the new government of kentucky had been summoning covingtons negroes to the city hall a few square blocks at a time i tell you somebody behind him said this here gonna make the passbooks we had to put up with look downright puny alongside it you step out of line now and they kin step on your whole blame family wherever they be in the usa aint doin nothin with us the white folks aint done to themselves somebody else answered and they reckon theys free the first speaker said and shook his head they aint free cincinnatus said all the taxes they got to pay theyre powerful expensive and now we get to be just like them aint that bully nobody answered not straight out a couple of people let their eyes flick toward a white policeman who was standing not far away cincinnatus looked his way too then nodded ever so slightly hed pitched his words about right the people he wanted to hear had heard while the cop with his billy club and permanent tough expression hadnt noticed a thing as the line snaked forward the man right behind cincinnatus murmured dont want to let the white folks know yous a red aint against the law not like it used to be cincinnatus answered but the fellow had a point cincinnatus glanced at the white cop again he wondered if the bruiser had been a policeman when the csa ruled covington or if he was one of luther bliss men if he belonged to bliss kentucky state police he was liable to be more dangerous than he looked once cincinnatus got inside the city hall he found himself facetoface with white petty officials whose faces said they were disgusted at having to show up for work of a sunday that he and his fellow negroes might also be unhappy at having to come to the city hall on sunday never seemed to enter their minds that surprised cincinnatus not a bit whats your name boy a clerk snapped when he got to the head of the line cincinnatus suh cincinnatus answered kentucky might be part of the usa again but the clerk by his accent had likely served the confederate states far longer than his new country long and sometimes bitter experience warned cincinnatus to walk soft not soft enough cinciwhat the clerk demanded even though cincinnati was just across the ohio river he gnawed at the top of his fountain pen toothmarks showed that was a habit of his i dont reckon you can spell that for me can you yes suh i can cincinnatus said as quietly and submissively as he could he spoke the letters one by one slowly enough so that the clerk had no trouble writing them down then he gave his address reading upside down he saw that the clerk had misspelled the name of his street he did not correct the man being literate gave him a leg up on being thought uppity and he was already in enough hot water with enough different people family the clerk asked my wife elizabeth my son achilles cincinnatus answered he had to spell achilles too as if taking some small revenge for that the clerk shook his head not enough boy you got any other kin in town any other kin at all who havent been registered yet names and addresses both mind youyou reckon im gonna let you waste my time you can think again my pas called seneca my mothers name is livia cincinnatus gave their address too now were gettin somewhere the clerk said in sour satisfaction he gnawed the pen some more scribbled on the form in front of him and went on all right boy what surname are you choosing for this lot of people here having hashed that out with his family ahead of time cincinnatus answered without hesitation driver suh driver the clerk repeated he seemed to weigh it on some mental scales which finally came down on the side of approval well thats not too bad anybody wouldve asked me idve told him letting niggers own surnames was a pack of damnfoolishness but nobody asked me even niggers have surnames in the usa and were in the usa so he shrugged as if to show he wasnt responsible for the policy he had to carry out makes it easier to keep tabs on us cincinnatus said not altogether without bitterness did fine with passbooks for a hell of a long time the clerk said but he brightened if only fractionally maybe youre right he wrote some more reading as he wrote cincinnatus driver elizabeth driver achilles driver seneca driver livia driver wherever any of you go in the united states that there last name goes with you when you got right down to it that was a pretty large thought you dont mind me sayin so id sooner carry around a name than a passbook the clerk looked at cincinnatus as if he emphatically did mind his saying any such thing cards for all you people will be coming in the mail in the next few days from now on if it has to do with you it has to do with cincinnatus driver whatever it is you got that boy yes suh cincinnatus answered then get the hell out of here the clerk said and cincinnatuscincinnatus drivertook his leave behind him the clerk called next and the black man in back of cincinnatus stepped forward to take his place he got out of the covington city hall as fast as he could he kept expecting luther bliss to pop out of nowhere and start grilling him had the kentucky state police chief known what all cincinnatus had done instead of merely suspecting him because of the company he kept he would have been in a different line a line where his ankles were shackled to those of the prisoners in front of and behind him when he got outside he let out a sigh of relief he also felt a surge of pride that surprised him somebody might actually call him mr driver now a form of address impossible before in the form of his nameif in very little elsehe had become a white mans equal he spotted apicius in the line snaking its way toward the building the barbecue cook saw him too and waved as he waved back he wondered what the local red leader would think of this small measure of equality nothing much he suspected mystification was one of apicius favorite words apicius waved again more urgently this time with a certain amount of reluctance cincinnatus approached what are you callin yourself the fat black man asked him driver cincinnatus answered how bout you you gonna be cook hell no apicius jowls wobbled as he scornfully shook his head im gonna call me an my boys wood you aint got the right wood in the fire you aint got no barbecue apicius wood as the clerk had before cincinnatus tested the flavor of the new surname as the clerk had he decided he approved sounds pretty good you want to know what i think dont care much the red answered on account of it dont matter a hill of beans any which way just one more tool of the oppressors to do a better job of exploitin us hell of a lot easier to keep track of apicius wood than it is to keep track of apicius the barbecue king he made no particular effort to keep his voice down most kentucky negroes like most down in what was still the csa had at least some sympathy for the marxist line cincinnatus felt that way himself grinning at apicius though he said they aint gonna have much trouble keepin track o you apicius set his hands on his hips which only made him look wider than ever i aint sayin youre wrong mind you but i aint sayin you re right neither he said other thing is aint a whole lot o niggers stand out in a crowd like i do he snapped his fingers in a crowdthat reminds me goddamn if it dont reminds you of what cincinnatus asked reminds me of why tom kennedy got his head blown off apicius replied cincinnatus stiffened i think maybe you better tell me whatever it is you reckon you know wonder if i ought to apicius said thoughtfully i still dont know whose game youre playin im playing my own game goddammit cincinnatus replied in a low furious voice and ill tell you somethin else tooi know how to play rough you dont reckon im tellin you the truth you remember what happened to conroys store and you reckon it up again you come prowlin round my place you aint goin home again apicius told him catfish on the river bottom git hungry this time o year cincinnatus looked back at him and said not a word the barbecue cook was the first to shift from foot to foot dammit i do recollect about conroys tell me what you know then think about it like this apicius said think about how come kennedy came round your place think about how come he didnt go to conroy or any o them confederate diehards cincinnatus duly thought about it his first thought was the one apicius no doubt wanted him to have that kennedy had fallen foul of the diehards and was trying to escape them but cincinnatus exboss could as easily have been fleeing luther bliss or the us army or for that matter the reds might have been after him while trying to make himand cincinnatusthink someone else was letting apicius see any of those thoughts but the first one was dangerous uh huh cincinnatus said as if to tell the red leader he was with him and had not gone one step beyond him a broad friendly grin spread over apicius face cincinnatus trusted it no further than he would have trusted a smile from luther bliss apicius said thats the way the money goes pop goes the weasel cincinnatus thought popped right between the eyes most likely and im the weasel he took up his new surname and carried it off toward his home weve grabbed em by the nose lieutenant general george custer said in the map room of what had been the tennessee state capitol now we have to kick em in the pants yes sir major abner dowling said resignedly custer was a great one for mouthing slogans he was a great one for inspiring his men too hed had a lot of practice at that having fed so many of them into the meat grinder but now that hed come up with what was admittedly the great military idea of his career he seemed disinclined to think about any other military ideas he had reasons too or thought he did the war department is run by morons he growled and expects everyone else to be a moron too sir as ive said before in my opinion its just as well that first army doesnt advance on memphis dowling answered were too distant for the thrust to do much good murfreesboro is a better choice all the way around custer muttered something into his gilded mustache it sounded like if the war department orders it it must be wrong but since he hadnt said it quite loud enough to compel dowling to notice it his adjutant didnt he made such a point of not noticing in fact that custer had to say something intelligible so long as we kick em in the pants hard enough maybe it wont matter which direction we go in yes sir dowling said more enthusiastically than before we truly may have them on the ropes all we need to do is finish them off was he really talking like that he was did he really believe what he was saying he did that he believed it still astonished him the rebs were fighting hardnobody had ever accused confederate soldiers of having any quit in thembut there werent enough of them white or black and they didnt have enough guns or barrels to hold back the united states not any more custer said the barrel brigade will put a crimp in the csayou wait and see if it doesnt yes sir abner dowling didnt know whether to be pleased he was thinking along with the general commanding first army or appalled custer was thinking along with him after momentary hesitation the latter emotion prevailed with a chuckle that struck dowlings ear as evil custer went on im going to make sure the barrel brigade doesnt smash the rebel line anywhere near general macarthurs division too and do you know what else major ill have macarthur thank me for doing things that way too because ill extend his men the great privilege of feinting against the rebels to draw their attention away from the main axis of my attack thats veryclever sir dowling said no wonder custer had sounded evil he might not be a great soldier on the other hand despite everything he might be a realization that never failed to unsettle dowling but more than half a century in the army had made him a nasty schemer daniel macarthur could no more help putting his heart into any attack he made than a trout could help rising to a fly but an attack meant as a feint would be foredoomed to failure and not all his brilliance could change that poor bastard dowling thoughtnot that he was fond of the arrogant macarthur either colonel morrell now colonel morrell is a proper officer custer said that young fellow will go far since morrell had made himself so prominent in custers eyes dowling had done some checking on the officer who led the barrels morrells record was impressive the only thing that could possibly be construed as a blemish was trouble getting along with the general staff back in philadelphia dowling didnt hold that against a man and custer no doubt would look on it as virtue rather than vice off in the distance antiaircraft guns began to pound first army had driven the csa out of artillery range of nashville but the confederates never stopped trying to hit back as best they could their aeroplanes were finishing the job of pounding the town to bits that us artillery north of the cumberland had begun so well larger explosions started mingling with the barking thunder of the guns dowling frowned archie cant hit the broad side of a barn he complained its a good thing the rebs arent any better at it than we are thats all i have to say the explosions came closer to the state capitol as the confederates bombing aeroplanes penetrated one ring of us antiaircraft guns after another dowling wondered how much damage the bombers were liable to do in the early days of the war bombing raids had been pinpricks annoyances now more and bigger aeroplanes carried more and bigger bombs they could hurt sounds like theyre heading right toward us custer remarked he didnt sound afraid or even particularly concerned only interested no one had ever challenged his courage his good sense perhaps but never his courage as the antiaircraft fire grew more frantic the drone of the bombers motors provided a swelling background to it the ground quivered under dowlings feet from bombs slamming into nashville one after another marching ever closer to the alreadybattered building in which he stood his urge was to dive under a table the only thing he personally could do about the bombers was try to keep them from killing him being under fire so to speak without being able to do anything about it galled him it galled custer too far more he went to a southfacing window yanked his pistol from its holster and blazed away at the confederate aeroplanes overhead abner dowling knew how utterly futile that was but sympathized with it nonetheless and then custer shouted one of thems coming down by god dowling stared custer couldnt possibly have custer no doubt hadnt the confederate bomber had to have been in trouble long before the general commanding first army opened fire on it otherwise it would have crashed beyond the state capitol instead of coming down not far in front of the building custer was using as his headquarters it must have had most of its bomb load still on board too the blast sounded like the end of the world custer reeled away from the window both hands clapped to his ears one of his elbows caught dowling in the belly uff his adjutant said they both sat down hard custer yelled something dowling had no idea what it was he hoped his ears would start working again one of these days they werent working for the time being bombs kept falling too dowling heard them and felt them as well one of them blew the glass out of the window custer had thrown open dowling yipped as a little fragment bit the back of his neck he clapped a hand to the wound his palm came away red but not too much worse than if hed cut himself shaving get up custer screamed in his ear weve got to make sure this headquarters is still a going concern grunting dowling struggled to his feet custer was up ahead of him even though the general commanding first army carried twice his years that shamed dowling although every part of his corpulent bodyhis right ham in particularseemed one great bruise custers right trouser leg was out at the knee he had a cut on his face and another on the back of his hand each about the same as the small wound dowling had taken he seemed to notice none of that spry as a new recruit he ran back to the window and fired some more at the confederate aeroplanes only when his pistol clicked instead of roaring did he bellow what had to be a curse and shove the weapon back into the tooled leather sheath in which it had sat idle for so many years dowling wondered if he would reload instead he ran for the door limping his adjutant followed dowling had never actually seen custer under attack till now lieutenant generals seldom approached the front the last time custer had been there was during the first chlorine gas attack against the csa two years before now all at once dowling understood how custers shortcomings had failed to keep him from advancing to his present eminence in combat the general commanding first army was a man transformed nothing fazed him he threw open the door and charged down the hall dowling in his wake general custer general custer officers and enlisted men yelled custers name loud enough to penetrate the cotton wool some unknown malefactor seemed to have stuffed into dowlings ears what do we do general custer come with me custer shouted and they came they obeyed without question dowling was very impressed he was even more impressed at the stream of orders custer threw out wherever the general saw a fire or a pile of rubble he set men to attacking it they went in with a will too just as theyd gone in with a will against the confederates in so many expensive attacks steam pumps played water on the fires closer to the cumberland from which they could easily draw a good supply other fire engines struggled against those here close by and in the state capitol but pressure in the mains wasnt all it should have been dowling wondered if some of the bombs had damaged the water works he sighed the usa had finally got them running again and now but custer far more than in an office or conferring with his subordinates around a map took charge dont worry pal he called to a soldier whom other men in greengray were digging out from under bricks and stones if you think this is bad just wait till you see what we do to those rebel sons of bitches thats bully sir the wounded man answered by the blood soaking his leg and by the way he held it he wouldnt be doing any more fighting any time soon but he was smiling as his comrades carried him away dowling shook his head in amazement he wouldnt have been smiling with a broken leg he would have been screaming his head off would listening to custer have made him shut up he didnt think so but it had sure as hell done the job for the wounded soldier custer turned and said major get on the telegraph to philadelphia let the war department know i am well and tell them first army has just begun to fight dowling whose ears were still stunned had to get him to repeat that several times before he had it straight custer gladly repeated himself the only thing he liked better than hearing his own voice was seeing his name in the newspapers but the men hed been directing listened avidly no matter how pompous he sounded sorry sir said the telegrapher to whom dowling brought the message but the lines north are all down right now they had better be fixed soon for the future of the nation may ride on them dowling boomed he was appalled at how much he sounded like custer a moment later he was appalled again this time by the telegraph operators fervent apology it made him blink and scratch his head damned if the old boy didnt have something after all barrels crawled north up the road past arthur mcgregors farm they chewed the dirt to hell and gone kicking great clouds of dust into the air mcgregor wouldnt have wanted to be one of the yankee soldiers marching behind the noisy smelly barrels but then he wouldnt have wanted to be a yankee soldier under any circumstances he looked out across his fields they were beginning to go from green to gold he would have a fine crop this year if the weather heldand the only way he would be able to dispose of it was to the us authorities he grimaced almost better to touch a match to the wheat than sell it to the usa the barrels passed like a kidney stone he thought remembering a torment of his fathers more men in greengray slogged north on foot watching them mcgregor thought of ants swarming round spilled molasses you could smash some but more kept coming how many columns of us soldiers had he watched trudging up that road how many men did the united states hold anyway one answer fit both questions too many southbound traffic was sparser the farm near rosenfeld was a long way from the front these days few americans needed to withdraw this far gloomily mcgregor headed for the barn to muck out and to get in a little work on his latest bomb he thought he had a way to get it into town but he wasnt sure yet here came a us ford painted greengray as army motorcars often were mcgregor paused wondering if it was major hannebrink trying to catch him in the act if so the yank would be disappointed mcgregor had nothing out now and would have nothing out ninety seconds after he stopped work he did not believe in taking foolish chances with his revenge when the ford stopped just outside the lane that led to his farmhouse and barn he laughed quietly sure hed pegged things aright not today major he murmured not today but then the automobile sped up again rolling south toward the border mcgregor scratched his head wondering why it had stopped in the first place he got his answer a moment later when a great exultant shout ripped from the throats of the marching american soldiers winnipeg mcgregor took two quick steps to the barn and leaned against the timbers by the door he didnt think he could have stood up without that support he felt as punctured as deflated as the inner tubes on the motorcars that had come with hannebrink after mary got through with them winnipeg the us soldiers cried again and again winnipeg every repetition felt like a fresh kick in the belly to arthur mcgregor since the war began the city through which passed the railroads linking canadas east and west had held out against everything the united states threw at it mcgregor knew fresh train lines had been built north of winnipeg but if the yanks had broken into it could they would they not move past it as well slowly grimly he walked back toward the farmhouse the bomb would wait the bomb would wait a long time the united states looked to be in canada to stay when he went inside julia gave him a severe look and said dont you dare slam the door father dont you dare stomp around the way you usually do either ive got bread in the oven and i dont want it to fall all right mcgregor said meekly and shut the door with care the last time he could remember sounding meek hed been about eight years old he shook his head like a bear bedeviled by dogs and wondered what the devil to do next he had no idea with winnipeg lost what did anything matter his older daughter noticed that he sounded strange whats wrong father she asked he cocked his head to one side with the door closed with the windows closed he had trouble hearing the yankees yelling if julia had been busy with the bread she probably hadnt even noticed them winnipegs fallen he said baldly i think the americans mean it this time julia stared at him as if hed started spouting gibberish but it cant have she said though she had to know perfectly well it could then she burst into tears and threw herself into his arms he held her and stroked her hair as if she were a little girl and not turning ever more into a woman day by day hearing julia start to cry was enough to bring maude and mary at a run mcgregor knew what was in his wifes mind at leastmaude had surely feared the yanks were seizing him seeing him there she stopped dead dear god in heaven what is it she demanded winnipeg he said the one word was plenty it made julia cry harder than ever maude turned away as if she could not bear to hear such newsand if she could not who could blame her marys mouth fell open god doesnt love us she whispered no doubt the worst thing she could think of then as a grown man might have done she gathered herself over julias shoulder and bent head mcgregor watched the process with nothing but admiration a word at a time mary went on i dont care if god loves us or not i wont be a yankee and theres nothing they can do that will make me be one i wont be a yankee either julia said and stood straighter mcgregor affected not to notice the dark tear stains on the front of his denim overalls i wont be a yankee julia repeated but she more than anyone else in the family had a way of looking at things over the long haul i wont be a yankee she said for the third time and then added but what will my children be if i ever have children what will their children be mcgregor thus prodded thought of those distant hypothetical greatgrandchildren he probably wouldnt live to see since theyd be born around a year that seemed impossibly distant from mundane what would they be like try as he would he couldnt see them as much different from himself and his own family he supposed that was foolish his greatgrandfather whom hed never known would have been astonished at the modern conveniences to be found in rosenfeld just a few hours away by wagon maybe when the century had halfway run its course such conveniences would reach farms too that wasnt really what he wanted to think about if the united states won this war as they looked like doing how would those greatgrandchildren think of themselves would they be contented americans as the yanks would try to make them they have to remember he said more to himself than to anyone else they have to remember theyre canadians and the usa stole their country from them they have to try to take it back one day can they do that maude asked the ruthlessly pragmatic question a farm wife who was anything but ruthlessly pragmatic had a long hard rocky road ahead of her but mcgregor to his own surprise had an answer ready look at quebec the frenchies there are still mad that we licked them on the plains of abraham a hundred and fifty years ago as soon as the yankees gave them their chance they jumped on the idea of this republic of theirs and to the devil with whatever went before it if somebody gives us the chance we can do the same who would give us a chance with the united states smothering us the way a bad sow smothers her piglets maude said i dont know mcgregor admitted but the quebecers didnt know before the war either sooner or later something will turn up my bread julia exclaimed i forgot the bread she fled back into the kitchen the oven door clanked open julia let out a sigh of relief it smelled fine maude called after her i didnt think you had anything to worry about mary looked at her mother in astonishment dont you think turning into a yankee is something to worry about well yes maude said but it isnt something julia can fix by taking it out of the oven on time her younger daughter thought that over at last reluctantly mary nodded mcgregor said maybe they can make us stand up in front of the stars and stripes whatever they do though they cant keep us from spitting on it in our hearts and from staying loyal to the king god save the king mary said and mcgregor and maude each put a hand on her shoulder she caught fire as she had a way of doing well make it our secret she breathed well all make it our secret i dont mean all of usi mean all of us canadians well do what the yanks tell us but inside well be laughing and laughing because well know what we really think arthur and maude mcgregor looked at each other over their daughters head some of us will mcgregor said some of us will keep the secret some of us will want to some of us wont care thoughremember how things were in your school some people will believe the americans lies well make them pay mary said fiercely her parents looked at each other again mcgregor didnt know how much she knew about his bombs she did know major hannebrink kept coming aroundand she knew her father hated him mcgregor might have taken her out of school because the teacher mouthed the yanks lies but mary knew how to add even so what happens next maude asked mcgregor blew air out through his lips making a whuffling noise a horse might have produced i dont know i dont know enough to know if we can stop them in winnipeg and keep them from getting at the new railroads farther north the fight goes on a while longer he was trying to find the bright side and that was the most hopeful thing he could say if the americans kept driving if the canadians and the british were able to stop them no morein that case the fight wouldnt go on a while longer it would be over in a matter of weeks whatever happens we have to go on he said whatever happens we have to pay the americans back mary said we have to pay them back for alexander we will maude said i dont know how but we will you can count on that mary mcgregor added his daughter nodded she had confidence in him even if he had none in himself even if the war was as good as lost he looked up at the ceiling he seemed to look right through the ceiling to look on the naked face of god the war might be as good as lost but all his confidence came flooding back as shed done every day she could since the war began nellie semphroch opened the coffeehouse for business the morning was fine and bright before long it would get impossibly hot and impossibly muggy the way it did every summer in washington nellie stood on the sidewalk enjoying the freshness while it lasted she had little else to enjoy the view was one to inspire horror not delight even if a robin did trill from a tree that had been broken only into table legs not into matchsticks most of her own block had come through pretty well which is to say it hadnt been smashed flat and then burned even so bullet holes pocked storefronts shells had bitten chunks out of them and the only glass in sight was not in the windows but drifted in the street to puncture motorcars inner tubes off to the south on the far side of the potomac artillery boomed it was us artillery pounding the confederates still farther south confederate forces had retreated out of artillery range of washington driven not so much by the us troops who had retaken the capital as by us successes off to the west which had left the rebels afraid of being cut off not having to worry about shellfire for the first time in weeks felt good though cs bombers did still make nocturnal appearances overhead hal jacobs threw wide the boardedup door across the street to show his cobblers shop was open too he waved and called good morning nellie good morning hal nellie answered she didnt like giving jacobs the encouragement of using his christian name but didnt see she had much choice either as she did every morning she saw the shoemaker these days she said thank you for getting me and edna out of that military jail jacobs waved his hands i have told you before do not thank me for this it was my duty it was my pleasure people saw confederate officers in your coffeehousenaturally they thought you were collaborating they didnt know you were passing what you heard on to me you could have let me rot nellie said i didnt come across for you so you didnt have any reason to come across for me that was how things worked in the world from which shed escaped and for the most part in the more decorous world shed managed to enter too they didnt seem to work that way for hal jacobs which made nellie intensely suspicious he waved again this time in rejection of the idea you bravely served your country how could i do such a wicked thing if bill reach turns up againno i will say when bill reach turns up againi know he would will feel the same thats nice nellie answered she had to make herself not look in the direction of the wreckage where she presumed bill reach still lay jacobs might talk about his turning up but she knew he wouldnt turn up again till the last trump blew with a final wave jacobs went back inside and got to work nellie went inside too while she was opening up edna had come downstairs her daughters face bore a look of sullen discontent as it often did lately jesus this town is dead nowadays edna complained we did a hell of a lot better when the rebs were running things we wouldnt have if it hadnt been for the help we got from mr jacobs and the rest of the people who worked for the united states nellie said ednas discontented look went from sullen to angry and you never told me about it not a word she said shrilly i even said that crazy bill reach was a spy and you went poohpooh the very idea you would have let me marry nick and then taken my pillow talk straight across the street since that while unkind was not altogether untrue nellie did not rise to it she did say you know i never wanted you to marry him at all but that wasnt because he was a reb edna said that was just because he was a man he could have been on the us general staff and you wouldve felt the same way that also had a good deal of truth in it edna went on you just dont want a girl to have any fun and look at what all you done when you was my age and even younger thats wasnt fun nellie replied that was hell is what that was but edna didnt believe her she could see as much in her daughters eyes edna was convinced she was acting like a dog in the manger what edna wanted was to screw herself silly not having a clue how silly she was already with a sigh nellie said get a pot of coffee going why dont you i could use a cup and i bet you could too might as well make it for us edna said aint nobody else likely to come in and drink it most of the folks left here in town dont have the money and most of the ones who do still think we was a pack of traitors i know nellie sighed again this time over lost business unlikely to return good thing i put aside as much as i did or wed be in worse shape than we are one more sigh only thing that rebel scrip we got is good for now is blowing our noses on it im afraid we havent got that much of it though edna said lighting the fire in the stove the rebs liked us why not we always had good coffee and good food so no wonder they liked us and mostly paid us real cash as she started measuring grounds for the pot she gave her mother another sour stare now i know how we got all that good stuff i never did before on account of you never told me before nellie could answer a motorcar stopped outside she was amazed anyone had even tried to negotiate the shellpocked glassstrewn roadway got a puncture ill bet she said a moment later the door opened nellie started to say see told you so but the words clogged in her throat into the coffeehouse walked theodore roosevelt he pointed a finger at her you are mrs nellie semphroch he said as if daring her to disagree yyes sir she said and dropped a curtsy and this here is my daughter edna she didnt know whether she ought to be introducing edna to the president of the united states she didnt know whether she should have admitted her own name either if roosevelt was inclined to believe most of her neighbors and not hal jacobs he was by all accounts capable of ordering her dragged out and shot on the spot now that our capital is in our own hands once more he said i decided to come down from philadelphia and see what was left of this city that was once so wonderful the rebs havent left us much have they no sir nellie answered on the stove the pot began to perk would you care for some coffee sir bully roosevelt said a couple of hardfaced men in greengraybodyguards by the look of themcame into the coffeehouse after him cups for roland and stan too if you please i have something for you here mrs semphroch and also for your lovely daughter edna simpered as she poured the coffee nellie wished the cups that had survived the recapture of washington were all from the same set she supposed she should have been grateful any cups had survived one direct hit and they wouldnt have one direct hit and she might not have either after taking a sip roosevelt set down his cup and reached into his pocket his hand came out not with a derringer but with a dark blue velvet box the sort of box in which a ring might have come he opened the box nellie gaped at the big golden maltese cross on a red white and blue ribbon roosevelt lifted the medal out of the box the ribbon was long enough to go around nellies neck the order of remembrance first class roosevelt boomed highest civilian honor i can give i argued for a distinguished service cross myself but the stickinthemuds at the war department started having kittens this is the best i could do congratulations mrs semphroch a grateful country thanks you for your brave service he slipped the medal over nellies head dazedly she watched him put a hand in his pocket again and produce another velvet box when he opened it the maltese cross inside was of silver with inlaid gold stripes the ribbon attached to it was also of the colors of the national flag but not quite so wide as the one on nellies medal order of remembrance second class he said putting the decoration over ednas head for you miss semphroch for helping your mother gather information from the foe and pass it on to the united states edna gaped so did nellie maybe roosevelt didnt know edna had been on the point of marrying confederate lieutenant nicholas h kincaidwould have married him if the us bombardment hadnt turned the ceremony into a bloody shambles maybe he did know and didnt care no sooner had that thought crossed nellies mind than as if on cue a photographer strode into the coffeehouse president roosevelt put one arm around nellie the other around edna and nellie realized the photographers appearance wasnt as if on cue at all it was on cue the fellow touched off his tray of flash powder foomp as a glowing purple smear made hash of nellies eyesight the shutter clicked can we do one more the photographer asked beginning to set up again im standing here with my arms around two lovely ladies and you ask me a question like that roosevelt said by all means sir by all means take all day if you need tobut make sure you do the job right edna laughed at the presidents joke had roosevelt shown any interest in more than her laugh she probably would have given him that too nellie did not like being touched without having invited it but she endured it shed endured worse in her time and roosevelt took no undue liberties of one thing nellie was very very sure he had no more idea than did hal jacobs of how bill reach had died nor did she intend to let either of them ever learn thinking that she was smiling when the flash powder went foomp again so was theodore roosevelt so was edna great the photographer said the newspapersll eat this one up bully roosevelt said again he let the women go and then turned to them now i must depart i fear i have to look over this poor tormented town and try to decide how we can set it to rights once more but now that i have had a cup of your excellent coffee and given you some small portion of the reward you so richly deserve i do hope any and all slanders against you on the part of your neighbors shall cease forthwith a very good day to you both and he was gone a human hurricane in a black suit and straw boater his bodyguards followed him out so did the photographer who had the grace to tip his hat nellie felt as if shed survived yet another bombardment as soon as that feeling faded even a little though she went to a counter and pulled out a can of red paint and a brush roosevelts limousine was still making its slow way around the corner when she painted a message on the boards covering her shattered window our coffee is fine enough for the president of the united states how about you oh thats good ma edna said the medal still around her neck its better than good nellie said its bully mother and daughter smiled at ease with each other for one of the rare times since the shooting started a horsedrawn cab driven by a white man whose right arm ended in a hook carried anne colleton across the bridge from the georgia mainland to jekyll island i hope the weather at the hotel will be a little nicer than this she said down near the florida border georgia could give south carolina lessons in heat and humidity which hotel were you at again maam the driver asked the laughing january its called she answered oh yes maam thats on the ocean side its always cooler there place got the name on account of before the war rich yankeesd come down here to get away from winter i had to live up in yankee country and i had the money reckon id do the same thing the road did not go directly to the laughing january but meandered around the rim of the island most of the interior was swamp and salt marsh and on the rare ground that rose slightly higher woods of pine and mossdraped oak egrets and herons their wings as broad as a man was tall rose from the marshes and flew off with ungainly haste a cardinal perched on a branch outthrust from an oak added a splash of brightness it caught the drivers eyes too my blood was about that color when the damnyankees blew up my arm he remarked and then you got any kin in the war maam they gassed one of my brothers anne answered hes dead now the other ones an officer on the roanoke front he was well last i heard if the driver had been on the point of making any cracks along the lines of a rich mans war and a poor mans fight that forestalled him he kept quiet the rest of the way to the hotel not all the richyankee and confederatehad stayed at hotels their villas had crushedshell driveways leading off from the road some of the fancy houses were in fine shape with servants bustling about some looked abandoned forlorn weatherbeaten men from the united states had probably wintered in them and some these days were charred ruins like marshlands she wondered how bad the red risings had been here she didnt ask she didnt really want to know here we are the cab driver said at last the laughing january the place seemed more like a village than a hotel with individual cottages surrounding a larger building to the north the south and the east toward the ocean the driver had been right about the weather even inside the cab anne could feel as much it wasnt cool it wasnt dry it was better than it had been after hitching the horse the driver carried her bags into the lobby he was handy with his hook but used his right arm only for the lighter pieces inside a colored bellhop took charge of them all and what were you doing there toward the end of anne thought looking at him he was all deference now under that deference who could guess what went through his mind anne had once thought she could she didnt any more at the desk the clerka womanconfirmed that her reservation was in order and handed her a shiny brass key with a large stamped onto it youll have a grand sea view from that cabin maam she said and the netting on the porch is fine enough to keep out the mosquitoes and the nasty little noseeems too thats good anne said she got directions on how to find cabin then headed off down the walk with the colored attendant pushing her bags on a little wheeled cart behind her you jus here by your lonesome maam he asked you didnt bring no servants or nothin no she said tightly after folk who had been her servants tried to kill her she neither wanted anything to do with them nor wanted to acquire new ones lest they prove to have similarly unfortunate habits she gave the attendant half a dollar once he set the bags down on the floor of the front room of her cottage it would have been an extravagant tip before the war and was still a good one he went back toward the main building whistling and with a spring in his step anne didnt think was assumed would that save her if the negroes planned another uprising her laugh had broken glass in it she knew better she was hanging up a white tennis dress when someone knocked on the frame to the screen door maybe it was the bellhop again had she dropped or forgotten something or maybe a navy officer in tropical whites stood there his cap under one arm a cigar dangling from his mouth at a deliberately rakish angle why commander kimball anne drawled exaggerating her accent to the point of burlesque what a pleasant surprise to her genuine rather than assumed surprise roger kimball glared at her instead of grinning i didnt get interested in you because you were cute and sweet and helpless he growled if i want that i can buy it on a streetcorner any time i please i got interested in you because i think youre the only woman i ever met whos every bit as ornery and uppity as i am you dont like that ill head back to habana he meant it she could see as much she almost did send him packing if there was one thing she couldnt stand it was being upstaged but he was one of the few men shed ever met who came close to being as ornery and uppity as she was she didnt think he matched her but he did come close and so when she spoke again it was in tones she might have used with her brother all right roger it takes one to know one i expect come in how long do you have in georgia four days he answered then back on the train and the boat to cuba and then back to sea no rest for the weary he stepped past her into the cottage and closed the door you have any whiskey in this place plenty in mine if you dont i dont know anne said i havent had a chance to look kimball nodded saw you on the way over here with the coon hauling your bags i usually like a little water in my whiskey but not here jekyll island water tastes like swamp they say its safe to drink but its nasty thanks for letting me know anne answered as they made their way back toward the little cottages kitchenif you came to the laughing january with a cook and a housekeeper you could do some very handsome entertaining i havent tried that yet either kimball stopped so suddenly that she almost ran into him voice lazy and amused he asked what else havent you tried here afterwards she couldnt sort out which of them grabbed the other first what followed was as much a brawl as lovemaking he tore a couple of hooks and eyes from her gauzy summer frock as he got her out of it she sent one of the gold buttons from his uniform jacket spinning across the room when she yanked it open instead of bothering to undo all the fastenings they didnt even look for the bedroom for the rough coupling they both wanted the floor seemed better kimballs weight pinned anne half against rug half against polished hardwood he slammed himself into her as if he wanted to hurt her and please her at the same time and he did both her nails clawed stripes down his back as she bucked under him come on damn you come on she said her own excitement mounting she bit his shoulder and tasted blood he grunted drove even deeper into hershe would not have thought it possibleand spent himself only a couple of quick heartbeats later she cried out too a noise any cat prowling along a fence would have recognized suddenly he was heavy upon her before she could push him away he rolled off and to one side she felt a small pang of regret as he pulled out of her hell of a woman he muttered to himself and then spoke directly to her you dont believe in taking prisoners do you he set a hand where shed bitten stared at the red smear on his palm and shook his head i was wondering if id come out of that one alive anne rubbed her backside in a fashion no properly refined lady would have usedbut then no properly refined lady would have got rugburn on the area in question by screwing her brains out on the floor i thought you were trying to ram me down into the basement she replied not without admiration these places dont have basements roger kimball said i knew that anne told him the way you were going there i didnt think you cared her stretch was an odd blend of satisfied lassitude and abraded posterior one appetite for the moment slaked kimball remembered another we were coming in here for some whiskey werent we he got to his feet and searched the cabinets curtains covered the windows but they werent thick a dedicated snoop would have had no trouble spotting his nudity he didnt care anne admired him again this time for brazennessnot that she didnt already know about that she also admired the red lines on his backand the back itself he grunted again on a different note from when hed shot his seed into her and held up a bottle threequarters full of amber liquid if this cottage is like mine the bedroom should beover here he said and sure enough it was he bothered with glasses no more than hed bothered with clothes anne followed his lead something she was unused to doing he yanked the cork from the bottle with his teeth when it would not yield to his fingers what shall we drink to anne asked she wondered if he would say victory she thought he started to but the word did not pass his lips instead he answered to doing our jobs the best way we know how while the world goes to hell around us and took a long pull at the bottle leave some for me anne said she had to pull it out of his hand it wasnt the best whiskey shed ever had nor anywhere close but if she drank enough of it it would get her drunk after shed swallowed and her eyes stopped watering she said were going to lose arent we dont see how we can do anything else kimball said scuttlebutt is weve already started sniffing around for terms i hadnt heard that anne said id have thought president semmes owed me enough to let me know such things but maybe not maybe with her plantation in ruins and her investments in hardly better shape she wasnt rich enough to be worth cultivating any more well he hasnt told me about it either i dont know if the stories are true or not kimball said ones ive heard say that damned roosevelt turned us down flat so it doesnt matter any which way he drank again then stared at the bottle what are we supposed to do after we lose the war how are we supposed to get over that the damnyankees did they did it twice anne said anything those people can do we can do too we have to figure out where we went wrong in this fight and make sure we dont go wrong that way again because there will be another round kimball said and anne nodded she reached for the whiskey bottle he handed it to her she drank till her eyes crossed anything even oblivion was better than thinking about spending so many lives and so much treasureand losing anyhow she discovered roger kimballs hand high up on her bare thigh as she stared at it it moved higher still she set the bottle on the floor by the side of the bed and clasped kimball to her love or even fornication was better than thinking about what might have been too an aeroplane buzzed high over the line east of lubbock jefferson pinkard stared up at it he thought about firing a few roundsby the way it had come it was plainly a us machinebut decided not to waste the ammunition it was so high up there he had no chance of hitting it why we dont got no aeroplanes to shoot down that puto hipolito rodriguez asked the yankees they got aeroplanes all the time they look at us like a man peeking at a woman taking a bath in a river jeff thought of emily he couldnt help imagining her naked that was all right when he didnt imagine bedford cunningham naked beside her or on top of her he answered guess they dont reckon this here fronts important enough to send us much in the way of flying machines yankees always have had moren us something fell from the us aeroplane pinkards first reaction was to hit the dirt but he checked himselfthat wasnt a bomb no those werent bombs they drifted and fluttered in the air like the snowflakes he occasionally saw in birmingham rodriguez stared at them in blank wonderment jeff guessed he never saw snow down in sonora even if hed made its acquaintance here this past winter papers sergeant albert cross said the bastards are dropping leaflets on us rather have em drop leaflets than bombs any old day and twice on sunday pinkard said si hip rodriguez nodded enthusiastic agreement with papers too i can wipe my ass this is muy bueno probably be scratchy as hell cross said after a judicious pause for thought but hey hip youre rightdamn sight bettern nothin its a fucking wonder all the flies in texas dont live in this here trench you mean they dont jeff said kidding on the square could have fooled me as if to make him pay for his words something bit him on the back of the neck he swatted but didnt think he got it by then the fluttering papers had nearly reached the ground a few drifted back toward the yankees trenches others fell in nomansland still others came down in and behind the confederates forward line had pinkard stabbed up with his bayoneted tredegar he could have spitted one of the descending leaflets he didnt bother he just grabbed one out of the air cross and rodriguez crowded close to see what the devil the united states thought it worthwhile to tell their foes at the top of the leaflet was a us flag that looked to have too many stars in the canton crossed with another one pinkard hadnt seen before a dark banner with the light silhouette of a toughlooking mans profile on it the headline below explained the united states welcome the state of houston into the union wait a minute cross said houstons in texas god damn it i been through there on the train here let me read it jeff said and did when texas was admitted to the united states in it retained for itself the right of forming up to four new states within its boundaries the people of the state of houston have availed themselves of the opportunity to break free of the evil and corrupt richmond regime and found a new political body in the words of the immortal john adams a government of laws and not of men the new state takes its name from governor sam houston who so valiantly tried to keep the whole of texas from joining the confederate states of america the united states are delighted at this return to the fold of so many upstanding citizens who repent of their grandfathers errors pinkard crumpled up the paper and stuck it in his pocket its an asswipe sure as hell he went down the trench gathering more leaflets rodriguez and sergeant cross also picked up several copies of the announcement no doubt for the same purpose rodriguez peered west toward the enemy lines and what was presumably the territory of the new state of houston how do they do this he asked make a new state where there was no state before i mean same way they did when they stole part of virginia from us during the war of secession and called it west virginia i reckon pinkard answered with a snort of contempt sergeant albert cross added then they went and found themselves enough traitors and collaborators to make themselves a legislature out of like they done in kentucky when they went and stole that from us wonder how many soldiers they got to use to keep the people from hanging all those bastards from the closest lamp poles probably enough so that if we start ourselves a counterattack the yankees wont have enough reinforcements left to be able to hold us back jeff said sergeant cross laughed louder than the joke deserved thats good pinkard thats right good he said but then gave the game away by adding aint heard you say nothin that funny in a while now world hasnt been a funny place lately and thats a fact jeff said the yankees have been pushin us back every place there is to push and livin in the trenches wouldnt be my notion of a high old time even if we was winnin other thing is way it sounds is that everybody else on our side is about to fall over dead too dont know about you sarge but none of that makes me want to do a buck and wing hip rodriguez looked at pinkard with his large dark eyes and didnt say anything he was still convinced jeff had more urgent reasons for not making jokes these days he was right of course but also too polite to push it sergeant cross lacked sonoran manners not only that he outranked pinkard which hip didnt he said i dont reckon its fretting over whether were goin to lose the damn war thats made you try to get yourself killed every time we sent raiders out the past couple months havent been trying to get myself killed pinkard protested which at least as far as the top part of his mind went was true want to kill me as many damnyankees as i can is all you used to have better sense than to volunteer to do it all the damn time cross said you go across nomansland often enough sooner or later you dont come back if he could have shot emily and bedford first pinkard might have been content to turn his tredegar on himself one of the reasons he shook his head now was that he hadnt shot the damned bitch give her the satisfaction of outliving him he shook his head again then from the other side of nomansland the yankees started firing trench mortars the bombs whistled cheerily as they fell as hed almost done for the leaflet pinkard threw himself flat hijos del diablo hip rodriguez shouted as he dove down to the bottom of the trench too sons of the devil that meant and pinkard couldnt have agreed more mortar bombs flew right down into a trench as conventional artillery with its flatter trajectory often could not along the line somebody shrieked as fragments pierced him machine guns started to rattle both from the yankees entrenchments and from the confederate line under attack theyre coming someone yelled cursing jeff scrambled up that made him more vulnerable to the mortar bombs which kept on falling lying down and waiting for damnyankees to jump into the trench and shoot him or bayonet him was the worse side of that bargain though just as he gained his feet a soldier in greengray did leap down into the trench jeff thought he shot him before the yankees feet hit the dirt as the fellow crumpled jeff shot him again he groaned his springfield slipped from fingers that could hold it no longer blood poured from the wounds in his chest and from his mouth and nostrils he was a dead man even if he didnt quite know it yet his pals were intent on making jefferson pinkard a dead man too jeff shot another yankee just before the man could shoot him the us soldiers shouted to one another in their sharp accents they seemed dismayed that the confederates should be so alert and ready to fight how the hell we supposed to bring back prisoners like the lieutenant wants one of them called to another shit i dont know his friend answered i only hope to jesus i bring myself back in one piece here and there parties of damnyankees were getting into the confederate trenches then it became a stalking game rushing out of traverses and into firebays flinging grenades and fighting vicious little battles with bayonet and entrenching tool jefferson pinkard didnt think he was trying to get himself killed but he was at the fore of the party that swarmed out of a traverse to beat down the last us squad still holding a length of firebay he swung an entrenching tool with savage abandon reveling in the resistance the flesh and bones of a yankees head gave to the edge of the tool reveling also in the way the soldier in greengray moaned and dropped his rifle and clutched at himself and toppled all in the space of a couple of seconds then the yankees those few who hadnt been shot or stabbed or otherwise put out of action were fleeing over the parapet and back toward their own lines have fun in the state of houston boys pinkard shouted taking a couple of potshots at the retreating us soldiers he thought he hit one of them the others kept on running a couple of us soldiers still lay groaning and wounded in the trench sergeant albert cross examined their injuries with experience gained in a lot of war they aint gonna make it back to field hospitals still breathing he said christ pinkard looks like you took off half this poor bastards face with that damn shovel of yours he wasnt there to give me a kiss sarge jeff answered didnt say he was cross replied equably he pointed down the length of the firebay might as well put these sons of bitches out of their misery nobody moved for a few seconds there wasnt a confederate soldier in the trench who didnt hope somebody regardless of whether friend or foe would do him that favor if he ever lay in agony horribly wounded that didnt mean many men were eager to do the job killing in cold blood even for the sake of mercy was different from killing in battle ill take care of it pinkard said at last he loaded a new clip into his tredegar and walked slowly down the trench line whenever he came across a us soldier who was still breathing he shot him in the head one of the yankees whose guts spilled out onto the ground from a dreadful bayonet wound thanked him as he pulled the trigger they didnt buy anything cheap today sergeant cross said no jeff answered but theyre in texas and we aint in new mexico what the hell have we bought cross didnt say another word thegreatwar breakthroughs lieutenant gordon mcsweeney peered across the mississippi from the bushes on the low swampy arkansas bank to the bluffs on which sat memphis tennessee us guns painfully moved forward over roads that would have had to improve to be reckoned miserable pounded away at the confederate bastion nor were the confederates in the least shy about pounding back they had a lot of guns in memphis and a lot of shells too rail lines up from mississippi made it easy for them to keep those guns supplied with munitions farther east the course of the tennessee river shielded memphis from attack by the us first army and cs river gunboats dominated not only the course of the tennessee but also this stretch of the mississippi the mines upstream remained too thick for us monitors to make their way down and challenge the confederate boats that meant that wherever the csa wanted largecaliber guns to deliver their fire they couldand they did theyd hurt us forces on the west bank of the river too many times already a us field gun down by the riverbank not far from where mcsweeney was standing presumed to fire on one of the river monitors flying the confederate naval ensign it hit the monitor square on the turret the cs boat though was armored to withstand the shells of others of its kind a hit from a threeinch gun got its attention but did no damage to speak ofthe worst of both worlds ponderously the turret swung so that the pair of eightinch guns inside bore on the field piece flame and great clouds of gray smoke belched from the muzzles of those eightinch guns a couple of seconds later mcsweeney heard the roar as the sound traveled across the water to his ear an instant after thator perhaps an instant beforethe two shells launched from the guns blew the us field piece and its crew to kingdom come on steamed the gunboat smug in its invulnerability god have mercy on their souls gordon mcsweeney murmured he said not a word about the bodies of the brave but foolhardy us gun crew after those shells struck home the gunners were fit for burial in jam jars coffins would have been wasted on their remains hed watched that sort of thing happen too many times before the united states might have finally reached the bank of the mississippi but the confederate states still ruled this stretch of river some us mines had gone into the muddy brown water but mcsweeney hadnt seen them do any good if you want something done properly do it yourself he muttered under his breath he was no expert with the mines both sides used in ocean and river warfare but that did not worry him the methods that sprang to his mind for disposing of a river monitor were considerably more direct he wished one of them involved his beloved flamethrower he could not figure out how to use it without destroying himself along with the monitor though he sighed god did not grant anyone everything he wanted if he asked permission to attack a confederate river monitor his superiors would surely tell him no accordingly he asked nothing of anyone save only the lord and the lord providedwith a certain amount of help from gordon mcsweeney he already knew how to swim he knew how to make a raft too after a little thought he figured out that he would be wise to make the raft well upstream to ensure that the current did not sweep him past the river monitor instead of toward it if he came out of the mississippi without having done what he intended to do he would be in trouble with the us army if he came out on the wrong bank of the mississippi he would be a prisoner of warunless the rebs chose to shoot him for he would certainly be out of uniform where are you going sir a sentry asked as mcsweeney left the company perimeter to reconnoiter he answered a response that had the virtue of being true and uninformative at the same time another sentry a man who did not know mcsweeney asked him the same question when he left the battalion perimeter he gave the same answer and got by the same way he had with the soldier from his company the sentry was not inclined to quarrel with an obvious us officer who sounded shorttempered and was armed to the teeth mcsweeney would have shown just how shorttempered he was had anyone come across the raft hed hidden behind bushes and underbrush but there it was when he pulled the brush aside he stripped off his clothes loaded his weapons aboard the raft and pushed off into the river no one paid any attention to the small splashing noises he made the mississippi was warm the mud it carried didnt keep a couple of fish from finding him and nibbling at him what he would have done if an alligator or snapping turtle had come up to investigate him was a question he was glad he did not have to answer he kicked hard propelling the raft out toward the middle of the mississippi one thing he had not taken into account was his small circle of vision with his eyes only a few inches above the water if he drifted past the cs river monitor without spying it he would feel worse than just foolish there it was that long low shape with almost no freeboard couldnt be anything else someone had described the original monitor as a cheese box on a raft which also fit its descendants both us and cs to a teealthough the confederates billed theirs as river gunboats refusing to name their kind after a us warship mcsweeney hung onto the raft with his fingertips letting as little of himself show as he could his scheme would have been impossible had the cs vessels deck been higher above the waterline as things were it was just insanely foolhardy gordon mcsweeney had been doing insanely foolhardy things since the war began if god willed that he die doing one of them die he would praising his name with his last breath he wondered what sort of watch the confederate sailors kept on deck he knew they didnt patrol with electric torches had they been foolish enough to do so us sharpshooters on the western bank of the mississippi would have made them regret it he had to kick hard to keep the raft from gliding past the confederate monitor and down the river grabbing the and the sack of rubberized canvas hed carried on the raft he scrambled up onto the monitors deck his bare feet made not a sound on the riveted iron somewhere aft a sentry was pacing his shoes clanked on the deck and here he came he moved without any particular urgency but as much on his appointed rounds as a postman might have done mcsweeney had no trouble keeping the turret between himself and the man who strode on through the darkness never expecting trouble could come on his watch when the confederate states so dominated this stretch of the mississippi river whether he expected it or not trouble shared the deck with him mcsweeney undid the sack and drew from it two onepound blocks of tnt twenty seconds worth of fuse for each and a match safe that had stood up to all the rain and mud nearly three years in the trenches had thrown at it the matches inside rattled he glared at them willing them to be silent then crimped the fuses to the explosive blocks silent himself he scuttled round the turret to the openings from which the barrels of the monitors big guns projected once he got there he reluctantly set down the so he could take a match out of the trusty safe and strike it the hiss of the match as it caught was tiny so was the light that came from it one or the other though alerted the sentry who goes there he demanded his voice suddenly sharp and alert damnation mcsweeney muttered and only saved himself from the blasphemy he so despised by hastily adding to the enemies of the lord he lit the fuses attached to the explosive blocks tossed them inside the monitors turret as far to the back as he could and snatched up the pistol once more who goes there the sentry repeated now his shoes rang on the deck as he hurried to investigate mcsweeney fired three quick rounds at him one of them must have hit for the reb let out a shriek mcsweeney didnt care except insofar as the fellow didnt get a chance to shoot at him he threw away the pistol and dove into the mississippi hed cut things too fine both metaphorically and with the fuses literally as well he swam away from the monitor as fast as he could he tried to go as deep as he could his ears ached in protest he ignored them knowing better than they what was about to happen no matter how muddy the mississippi was suddenly the surface of the water high over his head lit up bright as day bright as hellfire the explosion behind him sent him tumbling through the water more than half stunned why he didnt open his mouth and breathe in half the river he never knew either the lord watched over him or he was simply too stubborn to drown after a while his lungs told him he had to breathe or die by then the chunks of ironsome of them bigger than he washad stopped raining down out of the sky when he broke the surface he was amazed hed swum so far from the confederate monitortill he remembered the explosion had given him a big push hed hoped his explosives would touch off the magazine inside the turret and had they had they ever bombs bursting in air he thought as one explosion followed another god had wanted him to live and so he lived surely no one aboard the monitor did not now he struck out for the arkansas bank of the river his slow backstroke let him rest whenever he needed alarm tingled through him when he finally splashed up onto the bank of the mississippi what if the current had swept him beyond the limits of usheld territory and into land the rebels still controlled then he would have to make his way north that was all as long as he was on the right side of the river being captured never entered his mind the sentry who challenged him when he came up onto the land was a pure yankee from maine or new hampshire he didnt believe mcsweeneys explanation of who he was or why he was naked neither did his superior nor that fellows superior either calm as could be mcsweeney kept explaining who he was what hed done and how hed done it they gave him clothes eventually they got hold of his service record that made them argue less and gape more then they found out he wasnt with the company where he was supposed to be which made them begin to wonder if he might not be in front of them after all it was midmorning before they brought ben carlton down to identify him when carlton did they stared and stared oakleaf cluster they kept muttering medal of honor with an oakleaf cluster who would dare write up the citation though who would believe it can you please send me back to my unit mcsweeney asked ive had a long night and im very tired everyone kept right on staring at him scipio wished he were anywhere but trapped in the swamps by the congaree river hed wished that ever since anne colleton sent him here hed never wished it so intensely as now from out on the perimeter the fighters of the congaree socialist republic kept up a continuous crackle of fire the confederate militiamen were not nearly so good man for man as the reds but they had more men and finally what looked to be a determination to press the fight cassius looked worried scipio had never before seen cassius look worried not even when the csa put down the larger version of the congaree socialist republic the version that had tried to carry the red revolution to a wide stretch of south carolina damn that cherry he burst out now she don listen to nobody but her ownself an she werent as smart as she reckon she were an now she aint here no more an i feels like is missin my lef hand maybe you is scipio said but maybe you is just as well off without it too if she was your left hand you was always watchin it to make sure it dont stab you in the back now i knows that aint a lie but i misses she all de same cassius answered what she do she do for the sake othe revolution anything gits in the way othe revolution she sure as hell push it off to de side he sighed she sure as hell try and push me off to de side you right about dat but even so i misses she she hate de pressors moren anything in the whole wide world scipio remained not the least bit sorry hed mailed that letter to anne colleton kin hate too much he said mebbe cassius shrugged sure as hell wish she was shootin at de damn buckra though yeah she do dat good scipio allowed as if making a great concession course she shoot at anything that strike she fancy she shoot at de buckra or else she shoot at you or me or anything else she committed to de revolution cassius repeated she shoot anybody she reckon dey gets in de way o de revolution she screw anybody she reckon dat help de revolution she screw miss annes gassed brother till he dont know up from tuesday he scowled at that he might have recognized the revolutionary need for it while it was going on but he hadnt liked it then he still didnt marse jacob he dead scipio said quietly reminding the leader of the congaree socialist republic off in the distance the crackle of gunfire increased all o we gwine be dead too we dont figure out what the devil we do bout they buckra pretty damn quick cassius didnt even disagree with him not directly he said even if wes dead de revolution go on widout we scipio would sooner have gone on without the revolution than the other way round saying as much struck him as highly inexpedient just then a series of rending crashes off to the northwest made him peer in that direction the militia find some shells for they artillery again he said and then do jesus aint we got a camp over yonder bout where that stuff come down we doesor maybe we done did cassius frowned i dont reckon de buckra knowed about dat place i dont reckon nobody who dont live in de swamps could know about dat place traitors the word hung in the air as clearly as if the red leader had spoken it aloud any talk of traitors inevitably became talk of scipio too he knew it for once though he was innocent he had betrayed cherry but not the camp but somebody was liable to jump to the wrong conclusion in this particular case which would also put him in trouble before cassius could so much as turn his eyes toward scipio in speculation both men looked up at a noise in the sky scipio for a wonder spotted the aeroplane before cassius did it was as far as aeroplanes went an antique an ungainly biplane with a pusher propeller all struts and booms and wires against the swift sleek fighting scouts the usa put in the air these days the ugly machine wouldnt have survived five minutes but it was plenty good for spying on the men of the congaree socialist republic cassius figured that out as fast as scipio did aint fair he shouted furiously shitfire kip it aint fair if the buckra looks down on the swamp like a man look through the cabin window when a pretty woman take off she dress how we gwine stay hid that was a good question as far as scipio could see that was the good question he shook his head no there was one other he asked it you reckon that pilot got one o they wireless telegraph machines up there with he dont rightly know cassius answered do jesus though i hope he dont that hope like so many hopes of the congaree socialist republic was shortly to be dashed the aeroplane flew back and forth back and forth over the encampment a few of cassius men fired rifles and machine guns at it it was too high for any of that to damage or even alarm it back and forth back and forth cassius cursed horribly for the next couple of minutes that did no good either he had no more than a couple of minutes to curse after that shells started falling on the encampment where he and scipio had been talking the first few explosions were long and off to scipios right the next couple were short and off to his left sure as hell the pilot must have had a wireless telegraph in his flying machine and used it to correct the aim of the gunners firing at the encampment the first correction had been excessive but hed seen where those shells fell too after that do jesus scipio screeched through the wail of falling shells these ones is comin down right on top owe cassius must have said something by way of reply whatever it was though scipio didnt hear it hed been right and more than rightthe shells were coming down on top of him and on top of the biggest encampment the men of the congaree socialist republic had maintained in the swamps by the river that gave them their name scipio threw himself flat he had seen enough of war to have learned that lesson cassius sprawled on the ground a few feet away from him mud rained down on them as shell fragments chewed up the landscape all around through the explosions men screamed like lost souls more shell fragments and shrapnel balls hissed through the air something that was not mud fell almost harmlessly on scipios back almost harmlesslyit was hot enough to burn with an oath he knocked away the hunk of brass overhead the aeroplane kept circling and circling the pilot could spot exactly how much damage the artillerymen were doing and let them know where to send the next few shells the confederate states had been doing that sort of thing against the united states since now the men of the congaree socialist republic were getting a taste of how effective it could be scatter cassius shouted git out ode camp git under the trees an de bushes dat buckra pilot up dere caint see we he caint tell de buckra at the guns where to put they shells scatter along with the rest of the negroes in the encampment scipio fled into the forest he paid no attention to which way he was running so long as it was away from the unending thunder of the confederate militias cannon a man not twenty feet in front of him was blown to red rags when a shell exploded between his legs there wasnt enough left of him to scream scipio shuddered and kept running if hed run faster that might have been him no one paid him any special attention as he blundered through the lush woods and the mud for the first time since anne colletons machinations had forced him back into the shrunken congaree socialist republic he was on his own running for his life from the bombardment he needed a while to figure out what that meant he wasnt thinking so clearly as he might have been had unfriendly strangers not been doing their best to kill him only when he paused to lie panting under a pine did he realize the bombardment gave him an opportunity the likes of which he had not known since entering the swamp if he was lucky enough he might escape if he wasnt lucky and he tried it hed end up dead of course sometimes he told himself he would sooner die than go on living in the swamps by the congaree unfortunately he knew what a liar he was still if he never tasted scrambled turtle eggs again he wouldnt shed a tear now that he was farther from the artillery bombardment he noted that the smallarms fire was heavier and closer than it had been the confederate militiamen really were doing their best to hammer the congaree socialist republic flat this time maybe they would if they saw him hed be just another red nigger to them just another rebel to shoot or bayonet so their vision of what the confederate states should be could go forward if they saw himthe problem then was to make sure they didnt see him had he been the woodsman cassius was it would have been easy even being the poor excuse for a woodsman he truly was hed got beyond most of the firing before a white man snapped halt who goes there scipio peered through the brush that screened him the militiaman pointing a tredegar his way might have been handsome once but some disaster had ruined the left side of his face he was going to shoot if scipio didnt satisfy him right away scipio tried using his best butlers tones to say carry on sergeant the sooner we rid these nasty swamps of the goddamned red niggers who infest them the better off our beloved country shall be had he laid it on too thick sometimes when he used that voice he sounded more like an englishman than an educated white confederate but the militiaman with the slagged face was satisfied yes sir he said and plunged deeper into the swamp he couldnt possibly have known who scipio was but assumed anyone who talked the way he did had to be an officer thank you miss anne scipio whispered as he made his way farther and farther from the congaree teaching him how to talk like an educated white man hadnt been for his benefithaving a butler who could talk like that had given marshlands more swank it had also made him a white crow one who couldnt fully fit in with the rest of the negroes on the plantation hed hated it while it was going on now it just might have saved his life if he kept going straight away from the swamp hed emerge somewhere near the ruins of the marshlands mansion he didnt want to do that too many people around there were liable to recognize him he swung to the west guiding himself by the sun as best he could he came out in a cotton field that was like so many others in this part of the country untended and overrun with weeds he was filthy and exhausted he didnt care he didnt care even a little bit hed escaped anne colleton and cassius too he was for the time being a free man again chester martin was not the only us sergeant commanding a company in virginia these days they might eventually get around to promoting him or bringing in an officer to take over on the other hand they might not they might just keep putting more young privates under him sending them forward and seeing what the hell happened next somewhere not far away there was supposed to be a regiment led by a first lieutenant the outfits senior officer who was alive and in one piece even a year before rank would have worried him more than it did today today all he wanted to do was get on with the attack however it went in he had trouble believing he was actually eager to go forward nor was he the only one corporal bob reinholdt who had been furious at not getting a section but was now commanding one looked up from the springfield he was cleaning and said one more good push and these bastards are going to roll over and play dead thats about the size of it i think martin agreed never thought id say it but they dont snap back the way they used to tilden russell remained a private too but he was leading a squad in martins shrunken company he might lack rank but he had experience he said the rebs are like an inner tube with a little tiny leak they look fine till you press on em but then they give martin whistled a low respectful note thats not half bad tilden you ought to think about writing for the newspapers when the wars done when the wars done the words hung in the air for a long timefrom the minute the fighting started up to his own getting shot and beyondthe war had seemed to stretch out forever ahead of martin if he wasnt still fighting thirty years from now his sons or grandsons would be if he found time to marry and beget any on his infrequent leaves the only way out hed seen was getting killedand hed seen a lot of that nownow it was different as he rolled himself a cigarette he thought about how reinholdt and russell had defined the difference as well as he heard it defined if we keep pressing on em sooner or later theyll go flat im finally starting to think itll be sooner it hadnt happened yet confederate artillery south of manassas started banging away at the us lines threatening the town those lines werent so deeply entrenched nor so well furnished with dugouts as many of the ones in which martin had previously served they were too new to have acquired what hed come to think of as the amenities of trench life he threw himself down in the dirt and hoped he wouldnt be like moses dying before he entered the promised land of peace of course no one had promised that land to him after a while the barrage eased he braced for a confederate counterattack to follow it but none came the rebs still fought ferociously on defense but they didnt hit back so hard or so often as they once hadanother sign as tilden russell had said that their inner tube had sprung a leak martin wished the army could have pinned them against the potomac from the west before they could pull out of washington that might have ended the war right there as things were he was glad to get to his feet he was glad to have feet to get to and arms and everything else hed had before the shelling started here and there wounded men and their pals were shouting for stretcherbearers he gauged the cries with practiced ears the company hadnt been hurt too badly not as a group the unlucky soldiers who were the exceptions wouldnt have seen things the same way a couple of hours later as afternoon drifted toward evening a fellow who looked no older than martin but who had gold oak leaves on his shoulder straps came down the trench im looking for the company commander he called youve found him sir martin said and jabbed a thumb at his own chest the major looked surprised but only for a moment all right sergeant looks like you got your job the same way i got mine yes sir im still breathing martin answered fair enough the major said with a laugh im gideon adkins happens that im the senior officer still breathing in this regiment so the st is mine till they send somebody to take my placeif they ever get around to that were in the same boat all right sir martin said lets get down to business what do you need from b company adkins studied him he knew what was in the majors mindthe same thing that would be in a brigadier generals mind when he studied adkins can this man do the job or do we need to replace him if they did replace martin he hoped he wouldnt be as resentful as bob reinholdt had been when he first joined the company well major adkins couldnt complain about the question hed asked indeed the young regimental commander said thats the spirit sergeant oh sorry sir im chester martin thanks sergeant martin wish i didnt have to ask but im still learning the ropes too no doubt about it all right heres what you need to know in three days we go over the top first objective is manassas second objective is independent hill adkins drew a muchfolded map from his breast pocket and pointed the hill out to martin after he glanced at the scale of miles martin raised his eyebrows sir that looks to be eight or ten miles past manassas if theyre setting that as an objective for this attack they do think the confederate states are ready to throw in the sponge if they arent were going to make them throw it in anyhow gideon adkins declared thats what this attack is all about well have plenty of barrels to throw at them and plenty of aeroplanes and theyll be bringing forward some new light machine guns thatll do a better job of keeping up with a rapid advance that all sounds good sir martin gave a wry smile and therell be plenty of us oldfashioned gardenvariety infantrymen around to do whatever the barrels and the aeroplanes and the machine guns cant infantrymen major adkins made as if hed never heard the word then he laughed and slapped martin on the back yes i expect therell be something or other for oldfashioned critters like us to do martin spread the word to the other sergeants who commanded the platoons in his company they had all seen a lot of fighting one of them said well its been going better lately but aint a one of usd have the job hes doing right now if itd been going what youd call good that summed up the course of the war so well nobody tried to improve on it barrels came forward under cover of night they went into position behind the front line shielded from snoopy confederates by canvas when the sun rose even so they were about as hard to hide as a herd of elephants in church us aeroplanes did their best to keep rebel observers in the sky from flying over territory the united states held as had the other recent offensives this one opened with a short sharp artillery barrage designed more to startle and paralyze than to crush nobody had bothered to issue chester martin a whistleeven if he was commanding a company he wasnt an officer come on boys he shouted a couple more kicks and the doors fall down a lot of soldiers would fall down too fall down and never get up again martin wondered how many times hed gone over the top now the only answer he came up with was too many as machinegun and rifle bullets whipped around him he wondered why the hell hed done it even once for the life of himliterally for the life of himhe came up with no answer the barrels behind which the infantry advanced forced their way through the confederatesforward line us fighting scouts buzzed low overhead adding their machinegun fire to that from the barrelsand that from the light machine guns major adkins had talked about having along firepower more potent than that which springfields could provide felt very good to a veteran foot soldier here and there rebel machinegun nests and knots of stubborn soldiers in butternut some white men some colored held up the us advance martins bayonet had blood on it before he got out of the trench system rebel artillery though outgunned remained scrappy and the rebels had barrels of their own if not so many as those that bore down on them yet even though resistance was heavy in spots the army of northern virginia yielded its forward positions more readily than chester martin had ever seen it do before as the soldiers in greengray broke out of the trenches and into open country he spotted bob reinholdt not far away this is too damn easy he called the rebs have to have something up their sleeve reckon youre right reinholdt answered but to hell with me if i know what it is im going to enjoy this while it lasts yeah me too martin said he didnt enjoy it long because the army of northern virginia did have something up its sleeve it had put fewer men into the forward trenches than usual its generals perhaps aware that no matter what they did they could not withstand the first us blow once the first line was pierced thoughthe confederates had machine guns cunningly concealed in every cornfield they had snipers in every other pine and oak the ground south of their front line was more stubbornly defended than martin remembered from earlier fights he tried to think strategically in those earlier fights the rebs defending open country had been men forced from their trenches here the confederates had planned from the beginning to fight in the open and they showed a nasty talent for it martin got to hate cornfields in a hurry the plants stood taller than a man you couldnt see more than one row at a time anything might be lurking among them all too often it was machine guns trip wires foxholesanything at all his company managed to bypass the fighting for manassas itself skirting it to the west before long by the sound of things the town was cut off and surrounded but the confederates inside showed no signs of quitting they kept banging away at the us soldiers with whatever they had come on martin yelled as a wright twodecker which could see better than he could poured fire on the rebs in a field ahead the objective lines on major adkins map had seemed insanely optimistic they were the soldiers werent going to reach those set for the first day even if manassas would fall soon martin rolled himself in a blanket when night came and wearily thanked god he was still breathing the next day was another grim blur as the rebs brought reinforcements forward and tried to counterattack the us soldiers glad to play defense for a little while took savage pleasure in mowing them down by that evening the confederates couldnt find any more troops who would press home a counterattack their raw recruits would make a halfhearted lunge then fall back in disorder and dismay when rifle and machinegun bullets began to bite by noon the next day a day behind the preordained schedule but far ahead of chester martins fondest dreams he stood atop independent hilla knob barely deserving the nameand peered south wondering where the next push would take him somewhere north of independent hill jake featherston and what was left of his batterywhat was left of the first richmond howitzers what was left of the army of northern virginiatried to hold back the tide with bare hands he was filthy he couldnt remember the last time hed had leisure even to splash in a creek his butternut uniform aside from being out at the knees and elbows had enough green splotches on it to make him look halfway like a damnyankee the real damnyankees were forcing their way across cedar run hed expected they would be any time now and had taken the range for his guns lets give it to them boys he shouted and the four surviving guns of the battery began banging away peering through field glasses he watched the explosions a couple of miles to the north the shells were falling right where he wanted them to on the leading yankees and trailing confederates he was the man with the binoculars the rest of his gun crews couldnt tell exactly where the rounds were coming down that wasnt their job it was his if the confederate stragglers caught a little hell from their own side too damn bad odds are theyre niggers anyway he thought retreating infantry streamed past the battery to either side some of the men falling back were indeed colored others to jakes disgust were white why dont you fight the goddamn sons of bitches he shouted at them fuck you one of the infantrymen shouted back got your damn nerve yellin at us when you lousy bastards aint never been up in a trench in all your born days hope the damnyankees run right over you give you a taste of what real fortrue soldierin is like featherstons temper went up like an ammunition dump canister he shouted fully intending to turn his gun on the infantryman whod talked back to himand on the fellows pals too load me a round of canister damn your eyes ill teach that asshole to run his mouth when he dont know what hes talkin about sorry sarge dont reckon we got any more canister michael scott said that was a damn lie and featherston knew it was a damn lie he cussed his loader up one side and down the other by the time he was through the offending soldiers were around a stand of trees and out of sight scott probably thought that meant they were forgotten but he underestimated jake who never forgot a slight even when he could do nothing about it this was one of those times regardless of his shelling the yankees kept right on crossing cedar run a few aeroplanes emblazoned with the confederate battle flag swooped down on them but more us fighting scouts raked the soldiers in butternut who were trying to hold them back despite the aeroplanes despite the yankees numbers featherston thought for a while that the army of northern virginia would be able to hold them not too far south of cedar run from his own position on slightly higher ground he was able to watch us assaults crumple in the face of fire from the machine guns the confederates had posted in cornfields and woods those fieldsll raise a fine crop of dead men he said with a chuckle turning the elevation screw to shorten the range on his own field piece but the men in greengray did not give up despite the casualties they took in almost three years of war jake had come to know the enemy well the yankees made more stolid soldiers than the men alongside of whom hed gone to war they werent quite so quick to exploit advantages as were their confederate counterparts that coin had two sides though for they kept coming even after losses that might have torn the heart out of a cs attack as usual these days they had barrels leading the way too featherston whooped with glee when one of the guns from his battery set a traveling fortress on fire burn now and burn in hell you sons of bitches he shouted he hoped they did burn that would hurt the damnyankees for every barrel carried inside it a couple of squads worth of men for every us barrel confederate artillery or confederate tanksjake still sneered whenever the term crossed his mindknocked out though two or three more kept waddling forward and the yankees frontline troops seemed to have an ungodly number of machine guns too featherston recognized the muzzle flashes that went on and on as the guns fired burst after burst at the cs troops resisting them in disgust he turned to michael scott theres somethin else well get around to trying in six eight monthsmaybe a yearor we would cept the goddamn warll be lost to hell and gone by then he said those cant be regular machine guns the loader replied theyre keeping up with the rest of the damnyankee infantry way too good for that yankees mustve turned out some lightweight models so why the hell aint we featherston asked a good question without a good answer not long before hed reckoned us soldiers stolid in the way they fought there was unfortunately nothing stolid about their war department he spat in disgust those whitebearded fools down in richmond shouldnt ever have started this here fight if they didnt reckon they could whip the usa they did reckon that steady as if he were attacking new york instead of defending richmond scott loaded yet another shell into the breech of the quickfiring threeinch featherston made a minute adjustment to the traversing screw then nodded scott yanked the lanyard the gun bellowed scott opened the breech out fell the shell casing to land with a clank on one of the many others the piece had already fired as he placed the next shell in the breech the loader went on maybe they werent quite right this time yeahmaybe a rattlesnake might have carried more venom in its mouth than jake featherston did but not much more he fiddled with the traversing screw againthe yankee machine gun at which hed aimed the last shell was still blazing away when he was satisfied he yelled fire the field gun roared again he took off his tin hat and waved it in the air when that lightweight gunscott had made a shrewd guess thereabruptly fell silent darkness slowed the carnage but didnt stop it featherston slept by his gun in fitful snatches when the firing died down for a while ammunition did come forward to his guns but us bombing aeroplanes kept thundering by low overhead and dropping their loads deep behind the confederate line troops and munitions would have a harder time moving up in the morning when the skirmishing along the front line picked up he fired a few rounds at where he thought the damnyankees were michael scott wasnt so sure havent you shortened the range so much thosell be dropping on our own boys he asked dont reckon so jake answered yanksll likely have moved up a bit since we could see where they were at and if they havent well what the hell odds are im just blowing up some coons fighting grew heavy before sunrise as soon as black turned to gray the two armies started going at each otheror rather the us forces started going at the army of northern virginia which fought desperately to hold back the onslaught the damnyankees had brought soldiers and supplies forward during the night too and threw everything they had into the fight for a couple of hours in spite of his gibes about the fools in richmond and his contempt for the negroes surely manning a large part of the line in front of him featherston dared hope that line would hold the yankees crept within a couple of thousand yards of his positionclose enough that occasional rifle and machinegun bullets whistled byand stalled but then no doubt saved for just such an emergency fifteen or twenty barrels painted greengray rumbled over pontoon bridges thrown across cedar run and straight at the outnumbered outgunned men in butternut jake looked wildly in all directions where were the confederate barrels that could blunt the slowmoving charge of the us machines he saw none there were none to see he shouted to his gun to his battery its up to us if we dont stop them fuckers nobody does they did what they could do three or four barrels went up in flames sending pillars of black smoke high into the sky to mark their funeral pyres but the rest kept coming through the woods through the fields straight at himand straight through what was left of the army of northern virginias line and the line gave way hed seen that up at round hill a sea of panicstricken men in butternut streaming back toward him hed hoped hed never see anything like it again but here it was these soldierssome white more coloredhad had all the fighting they could stand the only thing left in their minds was escaping the oncoming foe they might have had a better chance if theyd stayed and tried to hold back the us soldiers infantrymen in greengray and barrel crews were not the least bit shy about shooting fleeing confederates in the back featherston would cheerfully have shot them in the back too he didnt have that choice since they were coming his way fight he shouted to the infantrymen turn around and fight god damn you they didnt they wouldnt as he had at round hill as he had when the soldier cursed him the day before he shouted canister if i cant do it any other way ill send em back on account of theyre more afraid of me than they ever dreamt of being afraid of the damnyankees michael scott objected again sarge god only knows how come we didnt get crucified the last time we did that if we do it again featherston did not intend to let his loader balk him not now he drew his pistol ill load and fire it myself if i have to he snarled then over open sights he aimed the gun at the confederate soldiers heading his way scott could have drawn his own weapon instead whitefaced he loaded the round jake had demanded jake pulled the lanyard himself he shrieked out a rebel yell when the worthless cowardly scum in butternut vanished from before the gun as if swept aside by a broom he might have hit some of the yankees close on their heels too but the canister roundshe fired severaldid not could not stem the rout any more than they had at round hill the infantry would run and he could not stop them save for the ones he killed and maimed the men in butternut fled past him black soldiers and white cried out in amazement that he did not flee too cowards he shouted at them in turn filthy stinking rotten cowards stand and fight damn you all youre stabbing your country in the back and then the yankees were well within canister range he gave them several rounds too to make them go to ground that bought him time to limber up his guns and abandon his own position he could not hold if everything around him fell all four guns got out backstabbers he muttered as he trudged south past independent hill nothing but filthy backstabbers ill pay them all back one day every goddamn one of them so help me jesus i will sam carsten shoveled in beans and smoked sausage and sauerkraut alongside dozens of other men in the galley the uss dakota rolled as he ate but the tables were mounted on gimbals the rolling wasnt nearly enough to make his food end up in his lap across the table from him vic crosetti grinned and poured down coffee well you were right you lucky son of a bitchwere still down here and its turning into winter you dont toast for a while longer yet oh come on sam said mildly yeah its winter but its not winter if you know what i

your mouth god help you if you did though jesus sam had been swigging coffee himself he had everything he could do to keep it from coming out his nose dont make me laugh like that again especially dont make me laugh like that and want to deck you at the same time he put down the coffee mug and made a fista pale pale fist vic crosetti grinned again no doubt ready with another snappy comeback damn smartmouth wop carsten thought with wry affection bracing himself to laugh and get furious at the same time again but instead of sticking the needle in him one more time crosetti jumped from his seat and sprang to attention so did sam wondering why the devil commander grady was coming into the galley as you were men the commander of the starboard secondary armament said this isnt a snap inspection then what the hell is it crosetti mumbled as he sat down again carsten would have said the same thing if his bunkmate hadnt beaten him to it several sailors let out quietbut not quite quiet enoughsighs of relief i have an announcement to make grady said an announcement that will affect the dakota and our mission we have just received word by wireless telegraph that the empire of brazil has declared war on the united kingdom the republic of france the confederate states of america and the republic of argentina he grinned now an expression of pure exultation how about that boys for a few seconds the big compartment was absolutely still then it erupted in bedlam at any other time a passing officer would have angrily broken up the disturbance and assigned punishment to every man jack in there now commander grady showing his teeth like a chimpanzee in the zoo pounded on the bulkhead and whooped louder than anybody else dom pedro knows whose ship is sinking and it isnt ours carsten shouted goodbye england crosetti yelled and waved at sam as if he were king george so long pal be seein yoube seein you starve hell of a lot longer run from buenos aires to west africa than it is from pernambuco sam said through the din as if he were seeing things from rear admiral bradley fiskes cabin and with brazil in the war on our side well be able to use their ports and theyll have some ships of their own theyll throw into the pot as he weighted the sudden enormous change his smile got wider and wider near as i can see the limeys are a lobster in the pot and the waters starting to boil near as i can see youre right vic crosetti nodded emphatically then he leered at carsten and you know what else no what sam asked near as i can see youre a lobster in the pot and the waters starting to boil too crosetti answered if we go up into brazilian waters buddy that might as well be pearl harbor he pantomimed putting on a bib waiter some drawn butter and make it snappy you go to hell carsten said but he was laughing too maybe i will the swarthy italian sailor answered but if we head to brazil youll burn ahead of me and thats a promise he was right sam knew only too well how right he was all at once the big fair sailor dug into the unappetizing dinner before him i better eat quick he said with his mouth full so i can get to the pharmacists mate before i have to go back on duty first sensible thing ive heard you say in a long time crosetti told him with commander grady still there celebrating along with the sailors sam couldnt even think about punching his bunkmate in the nosevery much the pharmacists mate behind the dispensary window was a wizened cadaverouslooking fellow named morton p lewis on a day like today even his face wore as much of a smile as it had room for ah carsten he said nodding rather stiffly at sam havent seen you for a while but i cant say im surprised to see you now his vermont accent swallowed the r in sams last name and turned cant into something that might have come from an englishmans mouth heading up toward sunny weather carsten said resignedly you want to give me a couple of gallons of that zincoxide goop its dispensed in twoounce tubes as you know perfectly well lewis voice was prim proper precise oh dont i just sam said dont i just he sighed damned if i know why i bother with the stuff i burn almost as bad with it as without it your answer i would say boils down to the word almost the pharmacists mate replied yeah carsten sighed again well let me have a tube now would you sooner i start using it he broke off and stared at morton p lewis boils down to is right you do that on purpose mort do what said lewis a man whose sense of humor if hed ever had one must have been amputated at an early age his blank look convinced carsten he hadnt done it on purpose but even if humorless the pharmacists mate wasnt stupid oh i see what youre asking about heh heh listen can i have the stuff for gods sake sam asked you dont require a doctors prescription for zincoxide ointment lewis said which carsten already knew from years at sea you dont require authorization from a superior officer either carsten knew that too the pharmacists mate finally came to the point you do require the completion of the required paperwork he didnt notice hed used the same word twice in one sentence and sam didnt point it out to him he did say mort if we get men wounded during an action i hope you dont make them fill out all their forms before you give em what they need oh no lewis said seriously unnecessary delay in emergency situations is forbidden by regulation he went back in among his medicaments before carsten could find an answer for that when he returned he was carrying a tinfoil tube and a sheaf of papers in ordinary situations delay seemed to be encouraged not forbidden sam checked boxes and signed on lines what it all boiled down to was that he wouldnt use the zinc oxide for anything illegal or immoral since the stuff was too thick and resistant to be any fun if he wanted to jack off with it he couldnt imagine anything illegal or immoral he could use it for wading through the paperwork meant he had to hustle to make it up on deck without getting chewed out that was the way life in the navy worked you hurried so you could take it easy a few minutes later it had never made a whole lot of sense to him but nobodyd asked his opinion he wasnt holding his breath waiting for anyone to ask either no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than hiram kidde came by puffing on a fat cigar he asked sams opinion how about dom pedro eh but he didnt wait for an answer giving his own instead took the walleyed little son of a bitch long enough yeah carsten said he agreed with that opinion but hes gone and done it he sees the writing on the wall hed better the chief gunners mate said train was almost out of the station before he decided to jump on board he sneered an expression that could turn a junior lieutenants bones to water doesnt cost him anything eitherjust his name on four pieces of paper not like brazils gonna do any fighting maybe a little against argentina sam said but yeah not much jesus though closing that coast to england and opening it up to usdoesnt cost dom pedro much like you say but it does us a hell of a lot of good uhhuh kidde gave him almost the same leer vic crosetti had does us a hell of a lot of good but youre going to be fried crisp when we head up that way wearily sam reached into his pocket and displayed the tube of zincoxide ointment hiram kidde laughed so hard he had to take the cigar out of his mouth when he started to flick the long gray ash onto the deck carsten said whoever swabs that up ought to swab your shoes too kidde looked down at his feet he could have seen himself in the perfectly polished oxfords three steps put him by the rail the ash went into the atlantic there you happy now he asked sure sam answered why not way i see things worlds looking pretty decent these days yeah im going to burn for a while but the dakota s home port is san francisco war ever ends i figure well go back there for a spell you burn in frisco too kidde pointed out and that aint easy i know but i dont burn so bad there sam said ill tell you one more thing too brazil jumping into the war may make me burn but it makes the limeys sweat you come right down to it thats a pretty fair bargain well mon vieux how is it with you lucien galtier asked his horse as they made their way up toward riviereduloup a us ford didnt bother to honk for them to pull over but zoomed around the wagon and shot up toward town at what had to be close to thirty miles an hour i wonder why he is in such a hurry galtier mused i wonder why anyone would be in such a hurry the horse did not answer save for a slight snort that was likelier to be a response to the stink of the motorcars exhaust than to galtiers words but the ford kicked up hardly any dust from the fine paved road the americans had extended it for their own purposes not for his but he was taking advantage of it jedediah quigley had told him he would jedediah quigley had told him quite a few things a good many more than hed expected had turned out to be true his mind couldnt help doing a little of the arithmetic the good sisters had drilled into him with a ruler coming across his knuckles if he had a motorcar capable of thirty miles an houroh not today not tomorrow but maybe one of these dayshe could get to town incould it possibly be so few minutes my old he said to the horse i begin to see how it is that the americans have put so many of your relations out to pasture i mean no offense of course a flick of the ears meant the horse had heard him it dropped some horse balls on the fine paved road maybe that was its opinion of going out to pasture maybe that was just its opinion of the road behind him some chickens made comments of their own he never paid attention to what the chickens had to say their first journey into town was also their last they did not have the chance to learn from experience outside riviereduloup the snouts of antiaircraft guns poked into the sky the soldiers who manned them wore uniforms of american cut but of bluegray cloth rather than greengray galtier cocked his head to one side to listen to them talking back and forth sure enough they spoke french of the same sort as his own soldiers of the republic of quebec he thought dr odoull had said there were such men now he saw them in the flesh they were indeed a marvel what do you think he asked the horse whatever the horse thought it revealed nothing unlike the chickens the horse was no fool it had come into town any number of times it knew how much trouble you could find by letting someone know what was in your mind lucien drove the wagon into the market square newsboys hawked papers whose headlines still trumpeted brazils entry into the war though galtier had heard about it several days before from nicole who had heard it from the americans at the hospital the newspapers also trumpeted brazils recognition of the republic of quebec that was actually news he tried to outshout the newsboys and all the other farmers whod come into the market square to sell goods from their farms his chickens had a solid reputation they went quickly he made good money soon he was down to one last ignorant fowl he waited for a housewife to carry it off by the feet but the chicken was not to go to a housewife and her tinker or clerk or carpenter of a husband and their horde of hungry children here came bishop pascal plump enough to look as if he could eat up the whole bird at one sitting galtier hid a smile the bishop was being a good republicanostentatiously being a good republicanand shopping for himself again instead of letting his housekeeper do the job how she would scold if she found out how much a rude farmer had overcharged him lucien had no compunctions whatever bishop pascal could afford it and then some good day good day good day he said now with a broad smile how does it go with you my friend not bad lucien said and yourself everything is well i give thanks to you for asking and to le bon dieu for making it so bishop pascal crossed himself then held his right forefinger in the air no not quite everything is perfectly well he pointed that finger at lucien galtier as if it were a loaded gun and it is your fault as best he could with his round smiling face he glowered he sounded very severe my fault luciens voice was a startled squeak like georges when his son was caught in a piece of tomfoolery what have i done what had he done to offend bishop pascal offending the bishop could be dangerous what have you done you do not even know bishop pascal sounded more severe yet he wagged that forefinger in luciens face do i understand correctly that i am not to officiate at the wedding of your lovely nicole to dr odoull i am desolated your reverence but it is so galtier replied doing his best to imply that he was desolated almost to the point of hurling himself into the st lawrence that was not so he felt nothing but relief you must comprehend this is not my fault and it is not meant as an insult to you dr odoull is the closest of friends with father fitzpatrick the american chaplain at the hospital and will hear of no one elses performing the ceremony only the truth there that it delighted galtier had nothing to do with the price of chickens he wanted as little to do with bishop pascal as he could the man had got too cozy with the americans too fast to suit a lot of people even those who like lucien had ended up getting closer to the americans themselves than theyd ever expected one can hardly go against the express wishes of the bridegroom true still bishop pascal always looked for an angle as his quick collaboration proved i must confess i do not know father fitzpatrick as well as i should i am certain his latin must be impeccable but has he also french oh yes galtier most carefully did not smile at the disappointment in the bishops eyes i have spoken with him several times he is not so fluent as major quigley or dr odoull but he makes himself understood without trouble he also understands when we speak to him i have seen many an englishspeaker who can talk but not understand i have some of the same trouble myself in fact when i try to use english ah well bishop pascal sighed i see there is nothing more to be said in that matter and i see also to my great joy that this choice has not come about because i am diminished in your eyes galtier shook his head denying the possibility with all the more vigor because it was true bishop pascal turned his forefinger and his attention in another direction since this is so perhaps you will do me the honor of selling me that lovely fowl lucien not only did bishop pascal the honor he did him out of about forty cents for which the bishop being a man of the cloth had no urgent need if bishop pascal proved unwise enough to mention to his housekeeper the price hed paid to galtier he would indeed hear about it hed hear about it till he was sick of it odds were hed heard enough of similar follies often enough to try to keep quiet about this one i thank you very much your reverence said galtier who could think of several useful purposes to which he might put forty cents or so he waved at the empty cages behind him and now since that was the last of the birds i brought to town today i think i shall he did not get the chance to tell bishop pascal what he would do three newsboys ran into the market square each from a different direction they all carried papers with enormous headlines a different edition from the ones galtier had glanced at coming into riviereduloup they were all shouting the same thing france asks for armistice france asks germany for armistice over and over the words echoed through the square calisse oh maudit calisse lucien galtier said softly he needed time to remember that the germans who were the enemies of france were allied to the united states the supporters of the republic of quebec and much more to the point the homeland of his soon to be soninlaw he wished he had not cursed such news where bishop pascal could hear him the bishop waved to the newsboys who raced to get to him he bought a paper from the one who ran fastest he blessed them all some consolation but probably not much as they went off one happy two disappointed he turned to galtier i understand how you feel my friend he said and i i feel this pain as well it is the country from which our forefathers came after all and we remain proud to be french as well we should is it not so yes it is so galtier said to hear that his homeland had gone down to defeat at the hands of the boches was very hard even when the boches were friendly to the united states but bishop pascal said the france that is beaten today is not the france that sent our ancestors to this land the france that was beaten today is a france that has turned its back on the holy mother catholic church a france that embraced the godless revolution this is a france of absinthedrinkers and artists who paint filthy pictures no sensible man can understand or would want to understand a france of women who care nothing for their reputations only that they should have reputations it is not ours if it is beaten god has meant for it to be beaten that it may return to the right and proper path it could be that you are right lucien spread his hands i am but an ignorant man and easily confused right now i feel torn in two you are a good manthat is what you are here let us see what has happened bishop pascal read rapidly through the newspaper passing sentences to galtier as he did so the republic of france unable any longer to withstand the weight of arms of the empire of germany requests a ceasefire all english troops to leave france within seven days or face combat from french forces the german high seas fleet and the us navy to have fueling and supply privileges at french ports the royal navy to be denied them the new border between france and germany to be fixed by treaty once the war ends everywhere thus the atheists and their mistresses are humbled and brought low no doubt there were some in france who met bishop pascals description but since france was a nation of men and women like any other lucien was sure it also held a great many more folk who did not and they too were humbled and brought low a meticulous man galtier had trouble seeing the justice in that had germany been conquered instead of conquering what would have happened to the ordinary germans much the same he suspected did that make it right was he god to know the answers to such questions bishop pascal said how much longer can the war on this side of the atlantic go on now how much longer before all of quebec joins our republic of quebec i assure you this cannot now long be delayed i think you are likely to be right lucien recalled the men in bluegray uniforms at the antiaircraft guns outside of town the killing shall cease bishop pascal said peace shall be restored and god willing we shall never fight such a great and mad war again i hope we do not galtier said i shall pray that you are right but he spent a lot of time talking to his horse on the way home from riviereduloup when he got there he still felt torn in two thegreatwar breakthroughs colonel irving morrell stood up in the cupola of his barrel as it pounded through the rough and hilly country just north of nolensville tennessee he did that more and more often these days and more and more of the commanders in the barrel brigade were imitating him some of them had stopped bullets the rest were doing a better job of fighting their machines he grinned he had a toy the other fellows didnt or most of them didnt anyhow when first army infantry got light machine guns to give them extra firepower as they advanced hed commandeered one and had a welder mount the tripod in front of the hatch through which he emerged when the rebels shot at him now he shot back they were shooting theyd been shooting hard ever since the drive on murfreesboro opened two days before but first army had already come better than ten miles and the advance wasnt slowing down if anything the barrels were doing better today than they had the day before a bullet ricocheted off the front of the barrel just one roundthat meant a rifleman a moment later another one snapped past morrells head his lips skinned back from his teeth in a ferocious grin hed spotted the muzzle flash from the middle of a clump of bushes he swung his ownhis very ownlight machine gun toward the bushes and ripped off a burst no one shot at the barrel from that direction again weve got them he said once playing chess hed seen ten moves ahead a knights tour that threatened several of his opponents pieces on the way to forking the fellows king and rook it had been an epiphany of sorts a glimpse into a higher world he was at best a mediumgood player hed never known such a moment before or sincetill now hed had a taste of that feeling when first army crossed the cumberland this was different though this was better there the confederates had been fooled here they were doing everything they could do as the soldier across the chessboard from him had done everything he could doand they were losing anyhow they did not have enough men they did not have enough aeroplanes no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than a us fighting scout zoomed past the waddling barrel morrell waved though the pilot was gone by then he almost wished it had been a confederate aeroplane he longed to try out the light machine gun as an antiaircraft weapon and give some reb a nasty surprise the confederate states did not have enough barrels either nor fully understand what to do with the ones they had every so often a few of their rhomboids would come forward to challenge the us machines individually theirs were about as good as the one morrell commanded but what he and ned sherrard and general custer had grasped and the confederates had not was that with barrels the whole was greater than the sum of its parts a mass of them all striking together could do things the same number could not do if committed piecemeal a shell whine in the air sent morrell ducking back inside his steel turtles shell even as he ducked a shell burst close to the barrel fragments hissed past him and clattered off its plating none bit his soft tender vulnerable flesh though more shells burst close by a battery of cs threeinchers was doing its best to knock out his barrel and any others close by except at very short range field guns hit barrels only by luck but the hail of splinters from the barrage forced morrell to stay inside for a while it was like dying and going to hell except a little hotter and a little stickier july in tennessee was not the ideal weather in which to fight in a barrel the ideal weather for men if not for engines would have been january in labrador the barrel generated plenty of heat on its own when its shell trapped still moremorrell was coming to understand how a rib roast felt in the oven and the rest of the crew suffered worse than he did when he stood up he got a breeze in his face a hot muggy breeze but a breeze even so they got only the whispers of air that sneaked in through louvered vision slits and the mountings of the cannon and machine guns the engineers down below morrell in the bowels of the barrel got no air at all only stinking fumes from the twin truck engines that kept the traveling fortress traveling morrell stood up again shells were still falling but not so close there was nolensville only a few hundred yards ahead infantrymen and machinegun crews were firing from the houses and from barricades in the street as they did in every little town as morrell watched a shell from the cannon of another us barrel sent chunks of a barricade flying in all directions a moment later that barrel started to burn soldiers leaped from it morrell hoped they got out all right he sprayed a few rounds in front of them to make the defenders keep their heads down infantrymen in greengray and barrels converged on nolensville us aeroplanes strafed the confederates in the town from just above chimney height morrell did not order his barrel into nolensville where it might easily come to grief moving along any of the narrow winding streets he poured machinegun fire and cannon shells onto the rebels from just outside where the barrel could move as freely asa barrel could move some of the defenders died in nolensville some seeing they could not hold the town broke and ran morrells barrel rumbled past nolensville he took potshots at fleeing men in butternut some white some colored some of them probably had been brave for a long time under endless hammering though even the hardest broke in time another confederate came out from behind a large duncolored rock morrell swung the light machine gun toward him he was on the point of opening fire when he saw the man was holding a flag of truce bullets from one of the barrels hull machine guns stitched the ground near the confederate officers feet he stood still and let the flag be seen the machine gun stopped firing all over the field firing slowed to a spatter and stopped morrell ducked down into the cupola halt he signaled urgently then like a jackinthebox he popped up again even before the barrel had fully stopped he scrambled down off it and ran toward the confederate with the white flag sir i am colonel irving morrell us army how may i be of service to you courteously the rebel an older man returned the salute the three stars on each side of his stand collar showed his rank matched morrells harley landis he said he said nothing after that for close to half a minute morrell saw tears shine in his eyes then gathering himself he resumed colonel ii am ordered to seek from the us army the terms you will require for a ceasefire our own forces having proved unable to offer effectual resistance any longer joy blazed in morrell to let his opposite number see it would have been an insult sticking to business would not how long a ceasefire do you request sir and on how broad a front a ceasefire of indefinite duration along all the front now being defended by the army of kentucky landis answered again he seemed to have trouble finding words at last he did i hope you will forgive me sir but i find this duty particularly difficult as i was born and reared outside louisville you have my sympathies for whatever they may be worth to you morrell said formally you must understand of course that i lack the authority to grant a ceasefire of any such scope i will pass you back to first army headquarters which will be in touch with our war department i can undertake to say that troops under my command will observe the ceasefire for so long as they are not fired upon and so long as they do not discover cs troops improving their positions or reinforcingor of course unless i am ordered to resume combat that is acceptable colonel landis said a question if i may morrell said and the confederate officer nodded morrell asked are the confederate states requesting a ceasefire along the whole front from virginia to sonora as i understand it no not at the present time harley landis replied morrell frowned i hope you see that the united states may find it difficult to cease fighting along one part of the front while continuing in another way i learned it fighting in the war of secession went on a while longer out here than it did back east on account of the united states kept trying to hold on to kentucky landis said that was true whether it made a binding precedent was another question morrell shrugged again thats not for me to say sir lets head back toward nashville till i can flag down a motorcar and put you in it the sooner the fighting does stop the better for both our countries yes sir thats a fact as landis stalked past the barrel from which morrell had emerged he glowered in its direction you yankees hadnt built these damn things in carload lots wed have whipped you again i dont know morrell said wed stopped you before we began using them breaking your lines would have been a lot harder without them though i will say that landis didnt answer he kept on glaring but he kept on walking too north and west toward nashville and first army headquarters the white flag in his hand fluttered in the breeze every soldier in greengray who saw the confederate officer inside us lines with a flag of truce stared and stared then burst into cheers off in the distance gunfire still rattled here and there it fell silent one pocket after another the rebels had to be sending more men forward under flag of truce to let us forces know they were seeking a ceasefire before morrell spotted a motorcar he found something even better a mobile fieldtelephone station the men still laying down wire after them as their wagon tried to keep up with the advance can you put me through to nashville he demanded of them they nodded eyes wide with wonder as they too gaped at harley landis and the flag he bore morrell said then do it they did in a few minutes morrell and general custers adjutant were shouting back and forth at each other through the hisses and pops and scratching noises that made field telephones such a trial to use they want what colonel major abner dowling bawled a ceasefire on this front morrell shouted back on this front this front only dowling asked thats what colonel landis says morrell answered the general commanding wont like that dowling predicted neither will the war department and neither will the president i think youre right major morrell said shall i turn him back he watched landis face at those words the rebel officer looked like a man whod taken a bayonet in the guts at the same time dowling was shouting good god no send him on if they give so much without being pushed well get more when we squeeze i wager and come yourself too only fitting you should be in at the death thank you sir morrell said and hung up he turned to colonel harley landis they will be waiting for you sir if i had to make a prediction though i would say they will not find acceptable a proposal for a ceasefire on one front only sir i have my orders as you have yours landis replied to which morrell could only nod a ford came picking its way up the battered road toward the front morrell gave a peremptory wave the courier who had been in the automobile soon found himself on shanks mare while the ford turned around and carried landis and morrell back through the wreckage of war toward nashville boston was going out of its mind the trolleyman kept ringing his bell but inside the trolley sylvia enos could hardly hear it through the din of automobile and truck horns wagon bells church bells steam whistles and shouting screaming people the trolley had a devil of a time going forward for people were literally dancing in the streets rebs ask for ceasefire newsboys shouted at every other streetcorner they were mobbed rebs ask for peace newsboys shouted at the corners where the rebs werent shouting for a ceasefire they were mobbed too sylvia watched a fistfight break out as two men struggled over one paper mostly though joy reigned supreme only the oldest granddads and grandmas remembered the last time the united states had beaten a foreign foe sylvia saw more men and women kissing and hugging in public during that slow streetcar ride to the shoe factory than she had in her life before a man got on the trolley drunk as a lord before eight oclock in the morning he kissed two women who seemed glad to kiss him back then tried to kiss sylvia too no she said angrily and pushed him away he might have fallen over but the trolley was too crowded to let him the wars not over yet sylvia told him and whoever else might listen as far as she was concerned the newsboys shouting peace were out of their minds as far as the drunk was concerned sylvia was out of her mind his mouth fell open giving her another blast of gin fumes of courseit came out coursh the wars over he said rebsre quitting aint they shed already read the globe she hadnt just listened to the boys yelling their heads off no she answered they havent surrendered and theres still fighting in places and the canadians havent quit fighting anywhere and neither has england and george was out there somewhere in the atlantic and no indeed the royal navy had not quit fighting and nobodyd said anything about the confederate navy quitting either so what the drunk said well lick em well lick all them bastards he paused and leered now how about a kiss sylvia wondered if she would have to use a knee in a most unladylike fashion her expression though must have been fierce enough to get the message across even to a lush he turned away muttering things she was probably lucky not to be able to understand she also wondered if she was the only person anywhere in the united states not convinced all the shooting was over as of this moment by all appearances she was the only person on the streetcar who thought that way people avoided her and patted the drunk on the back one of the women hed kissed now kissed him in turn she didnt look like a slattern she looked like a schoolteacher at last after fighting its way through endless traffic jams the trolley got to sylvias stop two more men one drunk one sober tried to kiss her before she got to the shoe factory she dodged the drunk and stepped on the sober mans foot hard he hopped and cursed and cursed and hopped she hurried to work she clocked in almost twenty minutes late when she went in from the front hall where the time clock stood to the great cave of a room where she worked she expected the foreman to descend on her with fire in his eye despite being only an inch or so taller than she was despite a snowy mustache gustav krafft was not a man to trifle with but he only nodded and said a guttural good morning as she went to her sewing machine a good third of the workers hadnt yet made it to the factory sylvia let out a silent sigh of relief women and more little old men drifted in as the morning wore along some of them like the drunk on the trolley were visibly the worse for wear sylvia would not have wanted to come to work that way not when she was working at a machine that could bite if she was careless she sewed pieces of upper together and tossed them into a box when it got full a feebleminded young man carried it away to the workers who would join uppers to soles halfway through the morning one of the men who looked as if hed been born at his sewing machine let out a horrible yell and held up a hand that poured blood gustav krafft dashed to his aid at a speed that belied the foremans years ach max dummkopf he shouted and then a spate of german sylvia could not understand at all after wrapping his own handkerchief around the wound krafft led max out of the chamber toward first aid the worker was still yelling and emitting hotsounding gutturals of his own between yells sylvia turned to the woman at the sewing machine next to hers and said i wouldnt have thought hed be one who let himself get hurt neither would i max has been here since this place opened up i hear replied the other woman whose name was emma kilgore she was plump a few years older than sylvia and had curly hair two shades darker than a carrot its the war newseverybodys going crazy now that things are over but they arent sylvia protested theres still fighting and plenty of it my husbands down in that tennessee place emma said as long as they arent shooting at jack the wars over as far as im concerned george is in the navy out in the atlantic sylvia said its not over for him not by a long shot and that means its not over for me either thats a tough one dearie emmas sympathy was real but perfunctory as shed said her own worries were gone few people sylvia had seen really cared about the troubles of others unless they shared them gustav krafft came back into the cavernous room maxs blood stained the front and side of his shirt he looked around saw how many machines werent working and scowled fiercely even if the war is over the work is not he said the devil loves idle hands i do not if you loved milk itd curdle emma kilgore muttered sylvia let out a strangled snort of laughter but her head was bent over her machine which was snarling before kraffts eyes could pick out from whom the sound had come the foremans gaze swept on sylvia laughed again this time silently she felt as if shed been naughty in class and got away with it in a couple of hours max came back his hand wrapped in bandages that had turned red here and there hes crazy emma kilgore whispered maybe he needs the money sylvia whispered back emma shook her head which made those copper curls fly about i hear tell he owns an apartment house and i know for a fact hes got one son whos a cop and another one whos a cabinetmaker he aint broke as if to offer his own explanation max said it is not the first time the machine gets its teeth in me it is probably not the last either he sat down and went back to work now that he was paying attention to what he was doing he was more deft with one good hand and one bandaged than sylvia could dream of being with both of hers but an absentminded moment had given him a nasty wound krafft came over thumped max on his bent back and said something to him in german he answered in the same language the foreman thumped him again careful not to disturb him while he was guiding leather under the needle then krafft spoke in english max says he is like the united states he has been hurt many times but he wins at the last several people clapped their hands on this day of all days patriotic sentiment won applause sylvia kept right on working with doggedness similar in kind if not in degree to that which max showed emma muttered christ he didnt cut his hand off her patriotism plainly was limited to getting her husband back in one piece sylvia was ready to settle for having george home safe too she clocked out as slowly as she could after the closing whistle blew to make up a couple of the minutes shed lost in the morning because the trolley hadnt got her to work on time it was late coming to pick her up too the celebration on the streets of boston hadnt slowed down since shed last seen it if anything crowds were thicker louder and better lubricated than they had been earlier in the day when at last she got to george jrs school she found it festooned with red white and blue bunting george jr came pelting over to greet her when she stuck her head into his room we won ma he shouted we licked the dirty rebels and that means pa can come home he jumped up and down in excitement i wish it was that simple she answered your fathers not home yet and i dont know when hes going to be for that matter were not home yet and i dont know when were going to be either we still have to get your sister and everythings a little crazy today we won george jr repeated he wasnt old enough to know any better but plenty of people who were old enough to know better were saying the same thing sylvia led george jr up to mrs dooleys to get his little sister more than half an hour late she resigned herself to another lecture from the woman about tardiness but mrs dooley opened the door with a smile on her face she smelled of what sylvia recognized after a moment as cooking sherry hello mrs enos she said isnt it a grand and glorious time to be alive yes i suppose it is sylvia said i am sorry im late everyone seems to be in the streets today nobody will blame anybody for anything today mrs dooley said she turned mary jane your mother is here by the noises from within mary jane wasnt the only child whose mother was late today when she came around mrs dooleys billowing black skirt she chirped we won the war mama well were certainly winning sylvia said that let her state her own opinion without sounding too much as if she was disagreeing with what seemed to be the whole world but for her now we the three of us need to go home there was an opinion on which she would put up with no disagreement at all they were late getting home too of course which meant they had a late supper the children were too excited to want to go to bed when they should sylvia had known they would be at last she got them settled then she had to settle herself too the trouble she had going to sleep made her wonder whether down deep she was exulting over victory too lieutenant brearley stowed the code book in the locked drawer and turned the key heres what it means sir he said handing the decoded wireless message to roger kimball itsimportant give it here the commander of the bonefish said ill decide how important it is he wished the exec hadnt said anything to draw the crews attention to the message sailors were curious enough without encouragement he unfolded the paper read it and then read it again to make sure his eyes werent playing tricks on him it still said the same thing the second time seeking ceasefire on land end offensive activity if attacked defend self acknowledge receipt youre sure you decoded it right he demanded of brearley yes sir the executive officer said here are the groups they sent he made as if to open the drawer again and get out the code book never mind kimball said wearily i believe you i believe it we were getting hammered the last time the bonefish went into port its just thataah god damn it to hell his left hand closed into a fist and struck his left thigh hard enough to hurt then slowly and deliberately he tore the message into tiny indecipherable shreds and threw them away what do we do sir brearley asked we acknowledge receipt as ordered kimball said then we keep right on with the patrol we werent ordered to hold in place i dont see a surrender order or anything like it do you well no sir not when you put it like that brearley admitted he looked even unhappier than he had already i wish theyd have told us more so wed have a better idea of what were supposed to do kimball reveled in commanding a submersible not least because the navy department had very few chances to tell him what to do the more code groups they send the better the odds the damnyankeesll figure out what they mean he answered now you get clicking on the wireless telegraph and acknowledge that we got that order he lowered his voice but raised the intensity in it and for gods sake keep your mouth shut afterwards i dont want the crew to hear one word about what kind of shape the countrys in you got that tom yes sir brearley answered and then aye aye sir to show he not only understood but would willingly obey gloomily kendall climbed back up to the conning tower and peered out over the atlantic it was a hell of a big place as far as he could tell the bonefish might have been alone in the middle of it if he spotted no plumes on the horizon he didnt have to worry about following the order from the navy department but he wanted to spot a smoke plume there on the edge of visibility he wanted to send more yankee ships to the bottom the same way a hunting dog wanted to tree a possum or a coon it was what hed been trained to do and it was what he enjoyed doing and he knew without false modesty he was damn good at it as he raised the binoculars to his eyes he knew the secret wouldnt keep forever it probably wouldnt even keep very long he wished he could blame brearley for calling him down from the conning tower to read the decoded message but he couldnt it was too important to allow delay the crew would already be wondering what it was all about though one way or another theyd learn too somehow or other they always did and what would they do then would they cause trouble saying peace was at hand and they didnt want to fight any more or would they want to keep fighting no matter what happened on land they hadnt lost the war regardless of the failures of the fools in butternut miserable bastards kimball muttered meaning the soldiers not the crew of the bonefish but then a long grim sigh burst from his lungs followed by more muttering shit it doesnt hardly matter anyhow not with brazil in the war on the wrong side with the empire of brazil in the war on the wrong side all the shipping routes from argentina that had kept england fed for so long didnt work any more and with france out of the fight across the atlantic the german high seas fleet was liable to pick off any freighters the us navy missed in that case why go on fighting he wondered the only answer he could come up with was that the cs navy though battered did remain unbeaten as long as he could strike a blow against the enemies of his country he would do it he scanned the horizon turning slowly through degrees nothing and then as hed learned to do in the past few weeks he scanned the rest of the heavens too any aeroplane he spotted through his field glasses would belong to the united states experience paid off as experience has a way of doing the aeroplane was too far away for him to hear its engine without the binoculars he might not have seen it at all or might have taken it for a distant soaring albatross he started to scramble down the hatch and order a quick dive then made himself watch and wait if the aeroplane came closer he would dive before it could drop a bomb on the bonefish if it didnt if it turned away slowly he smiled if it turned away it would be turning away for a reason or he hoped it would sure enough a minute later the moving speck swung off toward the north looking more satisfied than he had any business being given the state of the war and the state of his orders kimball paced the steel roof of the conning tower the aeroplane had spotted the bonefish he was sure of that it wouldnt have changed course so abruptly if it hadnt and kimball didnt think the pilot thought anyone on the bonefish had noticed him no reason he should nothing aboard the submersible had changed while he looked it over kimball kept watching the whole round of the horizon he would have been a fool to do otherwise and he had not stayed alive for almost three years in a submarine by being a fool but he would also have been a fool not to pay particularly close attention to the north when not one but three smoke plumes came into view he nodded to himself he waited till he was sure the ships were destroyers then waited a little more let them think he was a little on the slow side then he did go back down into the fetid steel tube that was the bonefish the real bonefish dogging the hatch after him as he did take her down to periscope depth he called to the crew weve got some damnyankees coming to pay us a call they were coming hard too in the hopes of sending the bonefish to the bottom kimball had loitered on the surface a good deal longer than he would have otherwise to make them think hed be easy pickings he slid toward them at five knots easing the periscope above the surface every minute or two to keep an eye on them ben coulter spoke quietly beg your pardon sir but we aint headin toward those sons of bitches so as we can surrender are we hell no kimball answered hiding how appalled he was at the speed with which rumor spread you ever hear of submerging before you give up no sir the veteran petty officer answered i never heard of any such thing and im damn glad of it he went back to his post sir our orders tom brearley began kimball silenced him with a glare i am obeying our orders mr brearley he snapped now you see that you obey mine brearley bit his lip and nodded one of the trio of destroyers went straight for the spot where theyd seen the bonefish one went to the southeast of that spot one to the southwest coulter let out a quiet chuckle when kimball relayed that news they reckon were runnin away dont they sir thats how it looks to me kimball said he let out a sigh that might have been annoyance all these years of fighting somebody and they dont know him at all i bet they dont know whos screwing their wives either in the dim lamplight his sailors grinned at him just for a moment he wondered if anybody was screwing anne colleton right now if anybody was hed never find out about it not unless she wanted him to there in the middle of the stinking steel tube he nodded respectfully say what you would that was a woman with balls splash the sound was very clear inside the pressure hull a depth charge flying into the atlantic followed by several more at short intervals they were still splashing into the sea when the first one exploded as best kimball could judge it had been set to burst deep he turned to his executive officer id say we are being attacked he remarked brearley nodded a depth charge was not the prelude to an invitation to tea grinning kimball said and now by jesus i aim to defend myself yes sir the exec said tom wasnt stupid after a while he was liable to wonder whether his skipper had dawdled on the surface on purpose to provoke the damnyankees into attacking the bonefish but that would be later for now they had a fight on their hands kimball crept closer to the nearest destroyer watching ash cans flying off her stern he grinned again yeah keep it up he muttered good luck with your damn hydrophones while youre throwing those babies around he ordered the two forward tubes flooded an exploding depth charge covered the noise of inrushing water then it was just a matter of sliding in to within eight hundred yards and shooting the fish the destroyer had barely started an evasive maneuver when the first torpedo hit her amidships a moment later the second struck the stern with two fish in her the destroyer shuddered to a stop and began to sink the other two us warships turned in the direction of their stricken comrade and in the direction from which the bonefish had launched the torpedoes dive deep and evade sir brearley asked hell no kimball answered thats what theyll be looking for me to do i want an approach at periscope depthbut only at four knots because i want to save the batteries as much as i can i dont aim to come up for air till after sunset when the ships and the aeroplanes cant spy me he got a good shot at one of the two yankee destroyers but her skipper turned tight into the path of the fish and it sped past her bow after that it was the surface ships turn kimball still refused to dive deep but staying at periscope depth where his boat might be spotted from the surfaceand from overhead if that damned aeroplane was buzzing around againwas too foolhardy even for him to contemplate by the time hed sneaked far enough away from the depth charges that sent endlessly repeated thunder through the boat to take another look with the periscope he was too far away to fire off any more fish well we hurt em he said in no small satisfaction if they think were giving up and going home they can damn well think again that had a salutary effect on the sailors rumors of a surrender would be a lot harder to believe now kimball noticed tom brearley watching him there in the orangelit stinking gloom he grinned at his exec a tigers smile or a hammerheads brearley stayed sober he was drawing his own conclusions all right too damn bad kimball thought i dont aim to quit till i have toand maybe not then captain jonathan moss had flown over lake ontario in the early days of the war when the us army was slowlyso slowlybattering its way through one fortified belt on the niagara peninsula after another now here he was again flying down from the northwest instead of up from the south as it had then archie from canadian guns filled the sky around his aeroplane with puffs of black smoke the wrightbuilt albatros copy bucked in the turbulence of near misses now though the antiaircraft fire came from inside toronto from the city the united states had confidently thought they would overrun in a few short weeks moss grimace had only a little to do with the wind tearing at his face nothing in this damn campaign has gone the way it should he muttered hed said the same thing out loudsometimes drunkenly loudwith his flightmates and in the officers club seeing the slateblue water of the lake below him brought it to mind again nothing in lake ontario had gone as it should have either even at the start of the war a man could probably have walked from shore to shore on the mines laid there along with them the canucks submersibles had meant us great lakes battleshipsthey would have been coastdefense ships on the oceanhadnt done a quarter of what they were supposed to down below him thunder of a different sort roared along with huge tongues of fire and clouds of gray smoke the canadian navy still had a couple of great lakes battleships in working order behind their mine fields the ships these days were earning their keep by pouring shells from their big guns onto the us infantrymen pushing their way into toronto lets see how you like this moss said diving on the behemoth below percy stone pete bradley and charley sprague who had replaced unlucky hans oppenheim on the flight followed him down he wished he were carrying a bomb fixed to his landing gear so he could hope to do some real damage to the armored warship below but consoled himself by remembering that real bombers hadnt been able to sink her either hed do what he could that was all men scurried on the deck of the great lakes battleship it carried its own archie guns very much like those used on land they started hammering away at him so did machine guns the long spurts of flame from their muzzles very different from the intermittent flashes from the antiaircraft guns proper his thumb came down on the firing button on top of the stick the twin machine guns atop the engine chattered into life he raked the deck from bow to stern buzzing along no higher than the warships stack he was past the ship before he could see how much damage hed donebut not before a couple of machinegun bullets pierced the fabric covering his fighting scout he clawed for altitude if any enemy aeroplanes had spotted his dive theyd be stooping on him like so many falcons as he did he also swung back toward the great lakes battleship for another run his flightmates formed in line behind him theyd come safe through the heavy antiaircraft fire too then sailors were dragging wounded or dead men to shelter give up you stupid bastards moss growled you and the limeys are the only ones left fighting and you cant last long strictly speaking that wasnt true out in the pacific the japanese had given as good as theyd got but that part of the war was a sideshow for the united states down below jonathan moss toronto lay at its bleeding heart as he started his second pass at the canadian warship he thought of laura secord back on her farm near arthur had her ancestor not imitated paul revere toronto might have belonged to the usa for the past hundred years and then some he shook his head if he got to worry about what might have been he was liable not to worry enough about what was going on and to lose the chance to worry about what would go on in the future a hail of bullets and shells greeted him when he went into that second dive he fired back the sailors on deck were a stationary target and he wasnt there were a lot of them too and only one of him they didnt do him any harm he hoped he hurt them the great lakes battleship almost shot him down without meaning to the big guns roared out another broadside the shells aimed at foot soldiers far away but blast sent moss flying scout flipping through the air he had only moments to straighten out before he ended up in lake ontario shouting curses he hardly even noticed he fought for control and won it just in time anxiously he looked back for stone and bradley and sprague wondering if the warships main armament had accidentally done what the antiaircraft guns could not do on purpose to his relief he spied all three of them he also saw that he was beginning to run low on fuel and was not in the least sorry to discover it when he waved back toward the aerodrome by orangeville his flightmates followed his lead with what seemed like relief of their own they were up above ten thousand feet by the time they crossed the front line just outside of toronto that didnt stop the canucks and limeys from blazing away at them nor did it keep some overeager idiots on the american side of the line from sending some archie their way fortunately the us gunners were no better at what they did than their counterparts on the other side moss bumped his fighting scout to a stop on the rutted grass landing strip outside the little ontario town as usual the groundcrew men clucked at the fine assortment of punctures hed picked up the idea sir is to fly an aeroplane not a patchwork quilt herm said as long as they dont puncture me or the motor im not going to worry about it moss said well well charley sprague came up to him as he was descending from the cockpit to the ground thats not the sort of instruction you can get in flying school is it sir sprague was tall and lean and goodlooking with expressive eyebrows and a kaiser bill mustache waxed to a pointed perfection not even the slipstream could ruffle he had the indefinable manner of coming from a moneyed family not more than once moss answered which made sprague break into a wide grin more seriously moss went on after that the war department sends your family a wire theyd sooner not have after what percy stone asked his goggles pushed up on top of his head after you strafe a great lakes battleship i bet they do the only thing i can think of that was less fun was when i got shot actually i was thinking of after you train to strafe a great lakes battleship moss said stone considered that then nodded youve got something there i knew about as many people who got killed learning as i did fliers who went down against the enemy nobody ever talks about it but its true charley sprague nodded youre right about that sir he said even in brief acquaintance moss had seen that he punctiliously observed the rules of military courtesy i saw half a dozen fellows die while i was learning the game some of them were better fliers than i was but they thought they were better than they were too if you know what i mean and some fell out of the sky for no reason anyone could see he spread his hands time and chance happeneth to them all is what the bible says about that last of the flight pete bradley came up in time to hear spragues last couple of sentences aint it the truth he said a sentence unscriptural but most sincere when your numbers up its up thats all he wiped his forehead with the back of his hand i thought all our numbers were up when we made the second run at that damn boat worst of it is they can go right on mounting more machine guns on it too moss said pretty soon strafing it will be suicide nothing else have to bomb at high altitude then lieutenant sprague said well need better bombsights for that we couldnt hit the broad side of a barn with the ones we have now and the bombers will need more guns to hold off the foes fighting scouts regular flying fortresses thats what theyll have to be moss looked at him in admiration youve got all the angles figured dont you charley sounds like youre ready for the next war right now poppycock sprague said what wants doing is plain enoughplain as the nose on my face which is saying something he touched the member in question which though long and thin was not outstandingly so how to get from where we are to where we need to be ay theres the rub thats shakespeare percy stone said and sprague nodded stone slapped him on the back he stiffened slightly as at an undue familiarity either not noticing that or ignoring it stone went on good to have you in the flight by god first the bible now thisyou give us a touch of class we sure dont get from our flight leader here he jerked a thumb at jonathan moss lieutenant sprague turned toward moss and turned pink at the same time sir i dont want to offend or dont worry about it charley moss said easily i was good enough to bring percys carcass back home when he got himself a puncture a couple of years ago and now im good enough for him to insult thats the way the world goes i guess he made sure stone understood he was kidding both sprague and bradley looked worried they werent sure he meant it for a joke till stone laughed and said well its not like i asked you to do it i was too busy bleeding for that i know thinking about what the observers cockpit had looked like after he and the groundcrew got stone out of it made moss stomach do a slow loop he fought the memory with another gibe you gave me so much trouble i figured youd make yourself a nuisance to the limeys and the canucks too indeed charley sprague trotted out another tag from shakespeare but when the blast of war blows in our ears then imitate the action of the tiger i cant do that charley stone said im not limber enough to lick my own balls all four men from the flight laughed like loons more because they were young and alive when they could easily have died than because percy stone had said anything so very funny come on jonathan moss said lets go tell major cherney what we did on our summer holiday the squadron commander listened to their report then said im glad youre all back in one piece but dont go sticking your heads in the lions mouth like that again and thats an order but sir moss began cherney held up a hand no buts captain even if that ship had no antiaircraft guns at all you couldnt sink her or hurt her big guns dont waste yourself on targets like that not with the war so close to won do what you can do fight the enemys aeroplanes and balloons shoot up his men on the ground if you take on a great lakes battleship youre fighting out of your weight but moss said again then he remembered charley spragues words some of them were better fliers than i was but they thought they were better than they were too and theyd ended up dead and they hadnt helped the war effort a bit slowly reluctantly moss nodded yes sir ive been thinking george enos said between gulps of air as he stood beside the onepounder at the stern of the uss ericsson after yet another dash to battle stations this one a drill beside him carl sturtevant was panting more than a little probably wont do you any lasting harm he said and then presently yeah what were you thinking about that son of a bitch who sank the cushing yesterday and almost put a fish into us enos answered yeah well i can see how thatd be on your mind the veteran petty officer allowed so what about it whoever the skipper of that boat is he fights mean george answered to which sturtevant could only nod george went on he comes at us and he comes hard and he doesnt like to dive deep for hell thats all true sturtevant agreed like i said though so what he fights like the skipper who almost sank us before we sank the bonefish enos persisted whoever he is whether hes a limey or a reb i dont think we got him when we got that boat sturtevant screwed up his face as he thought that over that other bastard dove deep and tried to hide after he took a shot at us didnt he he smacked his lips a couple of times tasting an idea instead of soup maybe youve got something there he glanced over toward lieutenant crowder who was talking with another officer lowering his voice sturtevant said you aint gonna make him your bosom buddy if you tell him though but if i dont tell him and we go on doing what weve been doing and he goes on doing what hes been doing were all liable to end up dead enos said sturtevant didnt answer his expression made plain what he was thinking that lieutenant crowder wouldnt listen even if he did get told crowder was convinced hed sunk the submersible that had come so close to putting the ericsson on the bottom for good telling him otherwise would make him unhappy which was liable to make georges life miserable not telling him though was liable to make georges life short he went over and positioned himself so lieutenant crowder would have to notice him sooner or later it was later not sooner but george had been sure it would be eventually the lieutenant said you wanted something enos george saluted yes sir he said and proceeded to set out for crowder the same chain of reasoning as hed given carl sturtevant as he spoke he watched crowders face it was not encouraging he sighed silently he hadnt expected it to be when he was through the officer shook his head i dont believe it for a minute sailor that the rebs or the limeys have put a new boat into this areathat is possible in fact its more than possible its certain as recent events have shown that it would be the boat we battled beforeno we sent that one to the bottom and thats where he richly deserves to be but sir the way this fellow operates having begun the effort george thought he ought to see it through crowder did not give him the chance return to your battle station at once enos or ill put you on report yes sir stiff and precise as a steampowered piece of machinery george did an aboutface and strode back to the onepounder once there he could look over at lieutenant crowder whod gone back to talking to the other officer enos let out another silent sigh he really should have known better carl sturtevant caught his eye told you so the petty officer mouthed george shaped the beginning of an obscene gesture with a hand his body shielded from lieutenant crowder sturtevant laughed at him in spite of that laughter or maybe because of it sturtevant was a pretty good fellow a lot of petty officers were as stuffy as real officers about ordinary seamen giving them a hard time after a couple of minutes to let crowder get involved in his conversation again sturtevant said hell it probably wont matter for beans anyway rebs are on their last legstheyre doing their damnedest to get out of the fight pretty soon itll just be us and the limeys and they wont last long either for all we know its a limey boat were talking about one we sank belonged to the confederates yeah but thats not the one with the nasty skipper no matter what lieutenant crowder thinks mm thats true sturtevant admitted but youve got to figure the odds are whoever was patrolling this stretch probably kept right on doing it itd be harder to work if things went back and forth between two different countries george thought about that all right youve got something there he said at last does make sense if we sank one rebel boat that means theres probably another one prowling aroundwhich means its even more likely this is the same skipper who almost got us before that sounds logical sturtevant said he nodded over toward lieutenant crowder you feel like taking another shot at convincing him no thanks enos answered he already knows everything there is to knowand if you dont believe me just ask him without apparently moving a muscle sturtevant made his face into a mask of contempt i dont need to ask him i already know what he knows by the tiniest twitch of an eyebrow he got across how little he thought that was well then shouldnt we george began i dont reckon weve got to worry about it on account of it aint gonna matter worth a hill of beans anyway sturtevant waved out across the atlantic look the rebs wont bother keeping a boat around these parts that much longer anyway because the shipping route they were guarding went to hell and gone when dom pedro finally figured out which side his bread was buttered on as if to underscore his words a flotilla of us cruisers steamed past heading south they looked enormous alongside the destroyers that cruised to either side of them protecting them from submarines as sheepdogs protected their flocks from wolves battleships were yet another size up to george who was used to going to sea aboard fishing boats they resembled nothing so much as floating cities he said havent seen so many of our freighters passing through these parts lately especially northbound probably wont either sturtevant answered theyll come down from the usa to supply our warships yeah but for a lot of things they wont have to head back to the states any more they can load up in one of the brazilian portshell of a lot quicker trip that way son of a bitch youre right enos shook his head disgusted with himself i should have thought of that hey nobody can think of everything sturtevant glanced over at lieutenant crowder again crowder still chattering away with the other officer tapped his forefinger against his own chest so he was talking about his favorite subject himself the veteran petty officer rolled his eyes jesus christ some people cant think of anything enos snorted im not going to argue with you about that he made himself cheer up almost as if a superior officer had given him an order and odds are youre right about the other too once the fellows with the high foreheads back in philadelphia figure it out too theyll probably call us back to port carl sturtevant laughed in his face you fisherman you itd be cheaper to do things that waysure it would but do you think the navy gives a fart in a hurricane about cheap in a pigs ass they do especially during a war we dont go home till the whole quadruple ententes waving white flags at usand maybe we dont go home then either maybe we go around the horn and teach the japs they picked the wrong side he eyed enos you ever been on the other side of the equator before you know damn well i havent enos said this is further south than i ever figured id come before the war started just a damn polliwog sturtevant shook his head and clicked his tongue between his teeth well old father neptune will settle your hash enos had heard about those rituals from sailing men whod gone through them some in the navy some as merchant seamen theyd shave his head or put him in a dress or maybe both at once and he and the rest of the polliwogs on the ericsson would have to do whatever father neptune told them something in the way sturtevants eyes gleamed made george ask have you ever been father neptune who me what could have given you that idea the petty officer might have been the soul of innocence then again he might not have the allclear sounded then lieutenant crowder kept right on talking with the other officer as enos drifted away from his battle station he quietly asked is he a polliwog by any chance i dont know sturtevant said i really dont know i may have to go and ask a few questions because that would be worth finding out an officer polliwog is just another damn polliwog as far as father neptunes concerned he slapped george on the back that could be a lot of fun couldnt it couldnt it though george said dreamily its not that hes dumbmore that he thinks hes so smart chipping paint was easier to take after that somehow instead of thinking about himself going through the antics father neptune would require of him he thought about lieutenant crowder going through them when someone else was the victim the joke got a lot funnier the petty officer supervising the neverending job of stopping rust stared at enos when he strolled by damn me to hell if you havent pulled your weight today he said well done when george looked back to see what had impressed the petty officer he discovered hed chipped twice as much paint as he usually would have done in so much time thinking about lieutenant crowder making an ass of himself in front of the whole crew had been so entrancing he hadnt kept his work pace to the usual just enough to get by he shook his head now theyd expect him to work this hard all the timeand it was lieutenant crowders fault everything was lieutenant crowders fault if i get killed ill never forgive him george muttered lieutenant straubing paced among the big white trucks as colored roustabouts hauled supplies from the covington wharves and loaded them into the greengray machines for the drive south straubing spoke to the men some white some black who would be in the cabs of those trucks what youve got to remember boys is that the wars not over yes theres a ceasefire in tennessee and its still holding pretty well but the shooting could start up again any day and theres still fighting in virginia and out in the west besides god only knows there are rebel diehards loose in kentucky dont do anything stupid like dropping your guard this late in the war itd be a shame to get yourself killed now cincinnatuscincinnatus driver as he was learning to think of himself these daysturned to the driver nearest him and said the lieutenant dont give two whoops in hell if we get ourselves killed if the cargo dont get through to where its supposed to go thats a different story that ticks him off plenty herk chuckled you got that one right he was as white as lieutenant straubing and cincinnatus despite spending a lot of time on the road with him even getting shot up by some of those diehards with him still had no idea what his last name was or even if he owned one hed always just been herk now he went on the lieutenant treats the cargo like he was paying for it out of his own pocket yeah cincinnatus said he watched the roustabouts load more trucks hed done that work himself before hed convinced the us forces to let him drive insteadand to pay him more money for doing it despite his own experience at their job he muttered i wish theyd move faster damn it herk didnt make any cracks about lazy niggers lieutenant straubing would have given him seventeen different kinds of hell if he had men of one color giving men of another a hard time about it interfered with getting materiel down to the front so he refused to tolerate it what herk did say was youve been itchy to get on the road lately havent you kid givin you a hard time at home nah it aint that so much cincinnatus answered when im movin though nobodys botherin me you know what im sayin theres just me and the truck and the road thats all yeah sureunless somebodys layin in the bushes with a goddamn machine gun like happened before herk said happen inside covington easy as it can outside cincinnatus said had a man shot dead on my own front stoop remember could have been me shot dead out there easy as that other fella when he was on the road he didnt have to worry about whether every stranger he passed on the sidewalk would carry tales about him to luther blissor to apiciusno apicius wood and his red friendsor to joe conroy and however many other confederate diehards still operated in covington when he was on the road he was free oh he had to obey lieutenant straubings orders but his spirit was free that counted for more than hed ever imagined at last the cargo bay in his truck was full whistling under his breath he cranked the whites engine to loud flatulent life when it was going he jumped into the cab and fed it more gas other trucks rumbled awake too with lieutenant straubing in the lead they headed south more of the road down to tennessee was paved every time cincinnatus drove it he suspected that wasnt true only of the road that went through covington the united states would need to move supplies down every highway they could when the war ended kentucky would have a pretty fine network of paved roads or at least the northsouth strands of such a network a man in the trucking businessa man like cincinnatus driver saymight do well for himself there were some rich negroes in the usa not many but a few that put the usa a few up on the csa a chance cincinnatus muttered no one sitting beside him in the cab could have heard the words but that didnt matter he knew what he was saying all i want is a chance i ever get it ill make the most of it he wasnt going to hold his breath hoping he would get it laws against blacks werent so tough as they were in the csa though that varied from state to state what didnt vary was that most whites in the usa would have been just as well pleased if they could have readmitted kentucky without its negroes he rolled past a truck by the side of the road the driver a black man out there with a jack and a pump and a patch repairing the puncture cincinnatus hoped it was only one of those things that happened now and again and that the diehards hadnt gone and strewn the road with nails or broken glass or specially made fourpronged innertube biters that would make a lot of trucks late and that would make lieutenant straubing unhappy very little else would but that was guaranteed to do the trick parts of the country were very much as they had been before the war began prosperous farmlands raising wheat and corn and tobacco and horses more though looked as if a mad devil had lost his temper and spent twenty years kicking it to pieces that wasnt even so far wrong except that war had done the job faster than any devil could have managed near covington almost three years had passed since us forces overran the countryside grass had grown over trenches rain had softened their outlines some of the rubble and wrecked buildings had been cleared away some had even been rebuilt the farther south cincinnatus went the fresher the scars of war got the confederate states had fought as hard as they could to keep kentucky one of their numberthe tormented landscape told of their effort but it spoke even more loudly of their failure cincinnatus luck held he got through the day without a puncture after a stop for fuel for the truck and a bowl of pork and beans from an army kettle at midday he rolled on steadily until toward evening he crossed from kentucky into tennessee he started passing bands of soldiers heading toward the front they got off onto the soft shoulder for the truck convoy and smiled and waved as the big square clumsy machines passed them they even smiled and waved at cincinnatus they had the world by the tail and they knew it he also steered the truck past columns of men coming away from the front a few of them a very few showed the same high spirits as the soldiers who were replacing them most simply trudged along toward the north putting one foot in front of the other their faces and no doubt their minds far away theyd seen so much hell they didnt yet realize theyd escaped itor perhaps theyd brought it with them theyd converted the white from acetylene lamps to electric ones not too long before cincinnatus enjoyed being able to throw light on the dimming road ahead at the turn of a knob without having to stop and get out hed liked it even better the first time hed done it in the rain at last about nine oclock they pulled into the supply depot we expected you an hour ago complained an officer with a quartermasters badge crossed sword and key over a wheel on which perched an eagle cincinnatus had never known a quartermaster with a good word to say to or about the men who fetched him the supplies he then grudgingly disbursed sorry sir lieutenant straubing said we made the best time we could he had to give a soft answer the other man outranked him likely story the quartermaster sniffed well youre here now so well unload you he made it sound as if he were doing the truck convoy an enormous favor thats good sir straubing said equably i can certainly see youve been ready for us this past hour in the cab of his truck cincinnatus chuckled nobody was waiting to unload the trucks plenty of people should have been straubing knew just how to place the dart to get the most damage with it lieutenant the other officer began doing his best to make straubing wish hed never been born but the truth was too obvious for him to bluster his way past it he seemed to deflate like a punctured observation balloon that hadnt caught fire then he started shouting for soldiers to get off their lazy backsides and come unload the trucks lieutenant straubing having got what he wanted turned into the soul of helpfulness offering all sorts of suggestions so the soldiers could do the job quicker and more efficiently he seemed to be everywhere at once when he passed cincinnatus truck he tipped him a wink cincinnatus grinned and winked back straubing used the quartermasters embarrassment to get him to order his men to run up tents in which the drivers from the truck convoy could spend the night more and more trucks kept rattling into the depot as those that had had punctures or breakdowns on the road down from covington caught up with the rest straubing also arranged for bedrolls and hot meals for the men in his charge spooning up greasy stew full of meat that might have come from an elderly cow or a fairly tender mule herk said the lieutenant he looks out for his people no two ways about it he does that cincinnatus agreed talking with his mouth full hed seen as much before when lieutenant straubing placed under arrest soldierdrivers who tried to refuse to work alongside negroes from covington he didnt mention that to herk because he wasnt sure the white driver would take it as supporting his point of view i aint worked for many bosses as good as he is like that dont know if i ever worked for any now as i think about it tom kennedy had come pretty close like lieutenant straubing though not to the same degree hed been more interested in the work he could get out of cincinnatus than in what color he was for a white citizen of the confederate states hed been as good a boss as a colored residentnot citizenof the csa could hope for if he hadnt been cincinnatus would have turned him over to the yankee soldiers that night they came looking for him his life probably would have been simpler if he had too late to worry about that though too late to worry about tom kennedy too except to wonder who had put a bullet through his head shaking his own head cincinnatus went back to get more stew and a tin cup full of coffee come on boyseat up and get some sleep straubing called like a father telling a houseful of children what to do were heading back to covington before it gets light theyll need us again soon as we can be there i told you before the wars not done till the rebs roll over and play dead along the whole line the men in the convoy obeyed as children would obey their father too cincinnatus gulped down his coffeehe was tired enough he knew it wouldnt keep him awake longand ducked into one of the tents he took off his shoes wrapped himself in a blanket as much to hold bugs at bay as for warmth and drifted toward sleep outside the tent the officer from the depot spoke lieutenant i will say you have yourself a pretty fair batch of men there ive spent a lot of time getting them to where i want them sir lieutenant straubing answered i must say im not altogether displeased with them now myself by whatever means necessary they get the job done they took a while to learn that from me but now theyve got it down solid they get the job done and thats what counts thegreatwar breakthroughs in augusta georgia scipio didnt turn around every few seconds as if afraid his own shadow were about to rise up and stab him in the back it wasnt that a price didnt remain on his head it did it probably would as long as he lived certainly as long as anne colleton lived however unenthusiastically hed played too big a role in the congaree socialist republic for that to change but with the confederate states tottering on the brink of losing the war against the usaactually the war was lost but the csa hadnt yet been able to persuade the usa to stop advancing on the fronts where fighting went onearlier victories over the socialist republics were forgotten whites on the streets in augusta went around with stunned dazed expressions on their faces theyd never lost a war before theyd never imagined they could lose a war the confederacy had gone from one triumph to another now the whites here were learning what the united states had learned half a century before what defeat tasted like next to that chasing reds was of small import the other side of the coin was that scipio had got to georgia whatever hed done in south carolina he might as well have done in a foreign country confederate states often seemed proud of paying no attention to what went on in their neighbors backyards georgia had reward posters up for its own red negro rebel fugitives but none for those from south carolina here scipio was just one more anonymous black man looking for work he was looking harder than hed expected too factories werent hiring the way they had been a year before were already letting people go a clerk told scipio whats the point of bringing more onto the lines when the war orders are gonna dry up and blow away any minute now i understands that suh scipio said but i gots to eat too what is i sposed to do go pick cotton the white clerk answered reckon thats what you were up to before the war started wont hurt you to get on back when the army shrinks the soldiersll need their own jobs back again white men will need their old jobs back again scipio thought and the negroes who were doing those jobs well the hell with them they might have been good enough to help out for a little while but now theyre going to have to learn their place again hed got rebuffs from every factory he tried for a while hed wondered if he would have to work in the fields the money hed earned from odd jobs as he made his way across south carolina was almost gone his life at marshlands had convinced him of one thing he did not want to be a field hand but he did not want to starve either and then he passed a little restaurant on telfair street with a sign in the window waiter wanted he started to go in then shook his head reluctantly he spent a couple of quarters on a shirt and a pair of pants that if long past their salad days were not ragged and falling to pieces then he went back to his flophouse in the terry the negro district in the southeastern part of town and bathed in a tin tub that plainly hadnt been used as often as it should have only after his clothes and he were as fresh as he could make them did he head back toward the restaurant inside a colored fellow was setting cheap silverware on a table what you want he asked in neutral tones as he slowly put down the last couple of pieces i seen the sign in the window scipio answered is lookin for work i works hard i does he wondered if the proprietor had already hired the other man in which case hed parted with money he couldnt afford to lose but the other negro just shrugged and asked you wait tables befo is done that scipio nodded emphatically he pointed to the place setting the fellow had just finished laying out de soup spoon belong on the udder side ode teaspoon smiling now the fellow reversed them you has waited tables he raised his voice hey mistuh ogelthorpe i think we got you a waiter here a white man in his late fifties came out of the back room he walked with the aid of a stick scipio wondered if hed been wounded in this war or the second mexican war more likely the latter by his ageor of course he might just have been in a train wreck or some other misfortune he looked scipio over with gray eyes that were far from foolish whats your name boy he asked is called xerxes suh scipio replied hed been called a lot of different things lately he was glad he could keep them straight and remember who he was supposed to be at any given moment ogelthorpe turned back to the other waiter how come you reckon hes a waiter fabius on account of he knows the difference tween a soup spoon and a teaspoon and where each of em goes on the table the other negrofabiussaid that a fact ogelthorpe said and fabius nodded the white man who owned the restaurant turned to scipio and asked whered you learn the business xerxes here an dere suh scipio answered i been doin factory work since de war start mostly but de factories deys shuttin down here and there ogelthorpe rubbed his chin you tell me you got anything like a passbook im liable to fall over dead from the surprise no suh scipio said times is rough lots o niggers aint got none dese days on account of wes moved around so much or for other reasons no ogelthorpe wasnt stupid not even close a frown twisted his narrow mouth wish you didnt talk like you been pickin cotton all your born days had scipio wanted to he could have talked a great deal more elegantly than ogelthorpe hed used that ability to speak like a polished white man to help escape from the swamps of the congaree but if he didnt speak like a polished white man speaking like a field hand was all he could do hed never before missed his lack of a middle way now he did intently is powerful sorry suh he said i tries to do better you read and write and cipher ogelthorpe looked as if anything but a no there would have surprised him too but scipio read the names and prices of the soups and sandwiches and stews and meat dishes on the wall he found a pencil and a scrap of paper on the counter and wrote his name and fabius and ogelthorpes in his small precise script then he handed ogelthorpe the paper and said you write any numbers you wants ani kin cipher they out foyou hed wondered if his demonstration would make ogelthorpe not bother but the white man scrawled a column of figureswatching scipio saw they were the prices of items he servedand thrust back the sheet and the pencil go aheadadd em up scipio did careful not to make any mistakes they comes to fo dollars an seventeen cents all told he said when he was done ogelthorpes expression said that while they did indeed come to he rather wished they didnt fabius on the other hand laughed out loud you got anything else you want to give him a hard time about boss dont reckon so ogelthorpe admitted with a sigh he turned back to scipio pays ten dollars a week an tips an lunch an supper every day youre here you play as good a game as you talk ill bump you up a slug or two in a month what do you say i says yes suh i says thank you suh scipio answered he wouldnt get rich on that kind of money but he wouldnt starve especially not when he could feed himself here and hed be able to get out of the grim terry flophouse and into a better room or even a flat ogelthorpe said you can tell me im crazy if you want but i got the idea you aint got a hell of a lot of jack right now youre clean enough ill say that but i want you to get yourself black trousers an a white shirt like fabius is wearin and i want you to do it fast as youre able you dont do it fast enough to suit me back on the street you go i takes care of it scipio promised he thought fabius was dressed up too fancy for the kind of food the place dished out but realized his own tastes were on the snobbish side one more thing i can blame on miss anne he thought maybe now that he was outside of south carolina she wouldnt be able to track him down he hoped to jesus she couldnt outside a clock started chiming noon a moment later two steam whistles blew here comes the lunch crowd ogelthorpe said all right xerxes looks like you get baptism by total immersion me i got to get my ass back to the stove he disappeared into the rear of the restaurant fabius just had time to hand scipio a gray eagle scratch pad before the place filled up then scipio was working like a madman for the next hour and a half taking orders hustling them back to ogelthorpe carrying plates of food to the customers taking money and making change and trading dirty china and silverware for clean with the dishwasher an ancient black man who hadnt bothered to come out and see whether hed be hired some of the customers were white some colored by their clothes they all worked at the nearby hash cannery or the ironworks or one of the several factories that made bricks from the fine clay found in abundance around augusta whites and negroes might come in together sometimes laughing and joking with one another but the whites always sat at the tables on one side of the restaurant the blacks at those on the other scipio wondered if fabius would wait on the whites and leave the negroes for him the whites would undoubtedly have more money to spend scipio presumed that would translate into better tips but the two waiters split the crowd evenly and scipio needed less than half an hour to find out his idea wasnt necessarily so the idea of tipping a colored waiter had never crossed a lot of white mens minds when they did tip they left more than their negro counterparts but the blacks were more likely to leave something if often not much taken all together things evened out by half past one after the last lunch shift ended the place was quiet again as it had been before noon panting like a hound fabius said reckon you see why mistuh jim hired hisself a new waiter we got more businessn two can handle let alone one like i was doin you one busy nigger fore today sure enough scipio said you done pulled your weight fabius said never had to hustle you never had to tell you what to do you said you know about waitin on tables you wasnt lyin no i werent lyin scipio agreed we git our ownselves somethin to eat now plumb hard settin it in front o other folk wif so much empty inside ome i hear what you say fabius nodded i done et fore the rush started but you go on back there now mistuh ogelthorpe dont feed you good you take a fryin pan and whack him upside the head ogelthorpe also nodded when scipio did head back to the cooking area you know what you were doin sure as hell he said yes suh scipio said compared to the fancy banquets anne colleton had put on this was crude rough fast work but the principles didnt change chicken soup in the pot ogelthorpe said you want a ham sandwich to go along with it thank you suh that be mighty fine scipio had carried a lot of ham sandwiches out to hungry workers he knew they were thick with meat and spears of garlicky pickle and richly daubed with a mustard whose odor tickled his nose hed just ladled out a bowl of soup when ogelthorpe handed him a sandwich of his own the first bite told him why people crowded into the restaurant miss anne would have turned up her nose at such a rough delicacy but she wasnt here scipio was he took another big bite with his mouth full he said suh is gwine like this place jus fine here you are maam the cabbie said to flora hamburger as he pulled to a stop at the corner of eighth and pine pennsylvania hospital thank you she answered and gave him half a dollar which included a twentycent tip that was enough to make him leap out of the elderly duryea and hold the door open for her with a show of subservience that made her most uncomfortable socialism to her meant equality among all workers no matter what they did but she had no time to instruct him not now she hurried past the statue of william penn toward the front entrance to the hospital whose cornerstone she saw bore an inscription dating from the reign of george ii a soldier walked past her smiling and nodding as he did so by his stick and the rolling gait he had in spite of it flora knew he was using an artificial leg because of what hed gone through she smiled back at him without that she would have ignored him as she was in the habit of ignoring all the young men who smiled and nodded at her she went up the stairs to the second floor one wing had private rooms the best doctors gave the patients in them the best care they could that was an advantage david hamburger would not have had without his sisters being in congress using it went against every egalitarian instinct she had but family instincts were older and deeper she almost ran into a nurse coming out of her brothers room the woman in the starched gray and white uniform with the red cross embroidered on the breast gave back a pace im sorry congresswoman she said i didnt realize you were coming in its all right nancy flora knew a lot of the nurses who helped take care of david she came to the pennsylvania hospital as often as she could she felt bad about not coming more often than she did but sitting in congress and handling the endless work that went along with sitting in congress was a trap with huge jaws full of sharp teeth david lay quietly in the bed his face almost as pale as the white linen of sheets and pillowcasesbeing at war with the csa and the british empire had made cotton scarce and hard to come by under the covers the outline of his body seemed unnaturally smalland so it was with one leg gone above the knee but the rest of him seemed shrunken too as if losing the leg had made him lose some of his spirit and if it had would that be so surprising he managed a smile hello flora he said he sounded very tired even now flora was glad he sounded any way at all loss of blood and an infection had almost killed him if the infection had been a little worsehow would flora ever have been able to show her face to her family she had enough trouble showing her face to her family now they didnt condemn her she condemned herself which was far harder to bear how are you she asked feeling foolish and useless not too bad he answered as he did whenever she askedwhich meant she couldnt take the words seriously hed lost a lot of flesh parchmentlike skin stretched tight over the bones of his face his dark eyes were enormous then he did seem to pick up a little energy a little life as he asked are the rebs really and truly trying to surrender back in new york city hed never called them rebs hed picked that up in the trenches flora didnt like it it made him sound as if he endorsed the war even after what it had done to him she said pieces of the ceasefire are in place but roosevelt wont give them all of it hes still driving in virginia and the west i wish he werent but he has the bit between his teeth bully david said as if he were roosevelt after everything its cost us wed better get the most we can out of this war if we stop too soon why did we go and fight it in the first place because we were mad flora replied staring at her brother with a new kind of horror he did sound like the president where hed been growing up a socialist like everyone else in the family she asked how can you say that after what happened to you only after shed spoken the words did she notice shed slipped from english into yiddish david answered in the same language how can i say anything else do you want me to lose my leg and the country to have nothing to show for it i never wanted you to lose your leg at all flora said i never wanted anyone to lose his leg or his arm or his eye or anything even if we win we have nothing to show for it we never should have fought at all nu david said even raising an eyebrow seemed to cost him no small physical effort maybe youre right flora maybe we shouldnt have gotten into it but once we did decide to fight what can we do but fight as hard as we can to win that dilemma had dogged the socialist party from the beginning cutting the war short once a treasure of money and an even greater treasure of lives had been spent had proved not just impossible but worse unpopular as the majorities roosevelt and the democrats brought in showed as david had learned new ways of talking and thinking in the trenches so flora had on the floor of congress being without a good answer she changed the subject have they said anything more about fitting you with an artificial leg as i was coming in i saw a man walking very well with one she was stretching a point but not too far theyll have to wait a while longer he said the stumps not healed well enough yet and the amputation was pretty high his mouth twisted maybe ill be a onecrutch cripple instead of a twocrutch cripple floras expression must have betrayed her for her brother looked contrite its better than being dead believe me reluctantly flora nodded her sisters husband yossel reisen had been killed in virginia bare days after he married sophie he had a son hed never seen and never would see now a doctor came in congresswoman hamburger he said polite but not obsequious hed dealt with a lot of important people if youll excuse me he advanced on david maybe youd better go david said to flora the stump looks better than it used to but its still not pretty she was glad of the excuse to leave and ashamed of herself for being glad here was her baby brotheror so she remembered him at any ratedreadfully mutilated and here he was too wanting the fighting to go on so others could suffer a like fate or worse he obviously meant every word he said but he might as well have started talking persian for all the sense he made to her she went downstairs a soldier with no legs was moving along in a wheelchair he was whistling a vaudeville tune of some sort and seemed happy enough with his world flora didnt understand it flora couldnt understand it and had she asked him she was sure he would have told her the war had to go on too she didnt understand that either but she was sure of it she went back to her office but accomplished little that truly resembled work shed expected nothing different seeing david always left her the worse for wear after a while realizing shed read a letter three times without having the faintest idea what it was about she put it away got up and told her secretary bertha im going over to my apartment all right miss hamburger bertha answered i hope your brother is better i pray for him every night she crossed herself thank you flora said hes doing as well as he can i think shed said that so many times it was even true but as well as he can was a long way from well and still he thought the united states should keep on with the war flora shook her head till the silk flowers on her hat rustled and rattled she could live another hundred years without having it make sense to her she was standing in front of the congressional office building waiting to flag a taxi when someone in a ford called to her where are you going flora it was hosea blackford to my apartment she answered the congressman from dakota pushed open the passengerside door im heading that way myself he said hop in if youve a mind to she did hop in with a word of thanks she had very little to say on the short trip back to the apartment building blackford glanced over at her youve been to see your brother or i miss my guess i hope he hasnt taken a turn for the worse no flora said and then she burst out he still thinks we have to go on pounding the confederate states blackford drove in silence for some little while before finally saying if your own brother feels that way after he was wounded you begin to get an idea of what the democrats would have done to us if we had tried hard to cut off funds for the war after it began this country thirsts for revenge the way a drunk thirsts for rotgut whiskey but its all mystification flora exclaimed the capitalists have tricked the workers into going to war against their class interest and into being thankful while theyre getting slaughtered theyve even tricked someone like david who ought to know better if anyone should to her dismay she began to cry congressman blackford parked the ford across the street from the apartment building where they both lived mystification is a notion that sounds more useful than it is he observed as he got out and went around to open her door for her what people believe and what theyll do because they believe it is a big part of whats real especially in politics its one of the planks in the platform flora said taking his arm as she got out of the motorcar the capitalists and the bourgeoisie mystify the proletariat into going along with their desires she raised an eyebrow hed shown before that his ideology wasnt so pure as she would have liked he shrugged now if you run a campaign that doesnt do anything but shout theyre tricking you over and over youre going to lose thats one of the things the socialist party has proved again and again the other thing the democrats have proved for usor against us ratheris that right now anyhow nationalism is stronger than class solidarity he shrugged again id say the whole world has proved that for us what about the negroes in the confederate states flora asked what about them blackford returned they rose up and they got smashed youre still learning the difference between being an agitator and being a politician listen to me flora he sounded very earnest compromise is not a dirty word maybe it should be she answered and strode into the apartment building ahead of him she could feel his eyes on her back but she did not turn around gordon mcsweeney prowled along the west bank of the mississippi looking for confederate soldiers to kill he didnt find any the united states had this stretch of the riverbank under firm control these days he felt frustrated as a lion might feel frustrated looking out of its cage and seeing a cage full of zebras across the walk in the zoo not even the new shiny captains bars he wore made him feel any easier about the world he knew hed been lucky to wreck one confederate river monitor asking god to let him be that lucky twice was pushing the limits of what he was likely to grant across the mississippi lay memphis it might as well have lain across the pacific for all mcsweeney could do to it us artillerymen still pounded the city the ceasefire did not hold west of the tennessee river mcsweeney was glad of that watching smoke rise from the foes heartland gave him a certain amount of satisfaction but only a certain amount he hadnt caused any of that devastation himself and acutely felt the lack ben carlton came up alongside him carlton wore new sergeants chevrons on his sleeve he was a sergeant for the same reason mcsweeney was a captain the regiment had gone through the meat grinder taking craighead forest and not nearly enough new officers and noncoms were coming up to replace the dead and wounded very few veterans were still privates these days pretty damn soon the rebsll pack it in here too i expect carlton said every blasphemy that passes your lips means a hotter dose of hellfire in the world to come mcsweeney answered ive seen enough hellfire right here on earth carlton said the kind the preachers go on about dont worry me as much as it used to oh but it must mcsweeney was shocked out of anger into earnestness if you do not repent of your sinful ways the things you have seen here will be as nothing beside the torments you will suffer there and those torments shall not pass away but endure for all eternity instead of giving a direct answer carlton asked what are you going to do when the wars finally done mcsweeney hadnt thought about that not since the day the united states had joined their allies in the fight against the confederate states and the rest of the quadruple entente he didnt like thinking about it now i work on my old mans farm he answered reluctantly maybe ill go backdont know much else or maybe ill try and stay in the army that might be pretty good well ill tell you sir you can have my place when they turn me loose carlton said ive done enough fighting to last me all my days dont rightly know what ill do afterwardsi was sort of oddjobbing around before i got conscriptedbut ill come up with something i figure not cook mcsweeney said anything but cook when youre good youre not very good and when youre bad even the rats wont touch it love you toosir carlton said with a sour stare he looked thoughtful he might have been a lousy cook but he knew all the angles mcsweeney cared nothing for angles he always went straight ahead after a few seconds contemplation carlton went on you want to stay in the army i figure theyll let you do it youve picked up so many medals youd fall forward on your kisser if you tried to pin the whole bunch on at once if the army tried to cut you loose and you didnt want to go you could raise a big stink in the papers raising a stink in the papers had never crossed gordon mcsweeneys mind hed seen a newspaper but seldom before he had to do his service when he read he read the good book so now it was with genuine curiosity that he asked do you think it might help hell yes carlton answered ignoring mcsweeneys fearsome frown cant you see the headlines hero forced from uniformin big black letters no less think the army wants that kind of headline like hell they do they want everybody proud of em especially now that weve finally gone and licked the rebs it sounded logical it sounded persuasive mcsweeney knew little of logic what he knew of persuasion he actively distrusted it struck him as a tool of satan with a sigh he said the army wont be the same after the war is over thats right carlton said most of the time youd sleep in a barracks youd get your meals regular from a better cook than me nobody would be trying to shoot you or gas you or blow you up mcsweeney never worried about what the enemy was trying to do to him his only concern was how he could kick the other fellow in the teeth how to put that into words after the war he said slowly how can anything i do seem better than lukewarm youre stationed in a nice cozy barracks you can go into town and find yourself a pretty girl carlton had an answer for everything most of the time though it was the wrong answer by gordon mcsweeneys reckoning lewdness and fornication lead to the pangs of hell no less surely than blasphemy he said his voice stiff with disapproval carlton rolled his eyes all right captain he said using the rank in a way that reminded mcsweeney hed known him when he had none go into town find yourself a pretty girl and marry her then if thats how you feel about it it is better to marry than to burn so paul had said in first corinthians to hear the same advice from ben carlton was jolting few people struck mcsweeney as being less like paul than did the longtime and stubbornly inept company cook do i tell you how to arrange your life carlton he demanded only when you open your mouth ben answered sir mcsweeney gave him a dirty look you are godless he said you have made my life a trial since the moment we began serving together why god has not called you to him to judge you for your many sins i cannot imagine by failing to call you he proves himself a god of mercy reckon youre right about that captain mcsweeney sir carlton said but the gleam in his eyes warned that he did not expect to be taken altogether seriously maybe he figures that with you riding herd on me he doesnt have to do any nagging of his own get out of my sight mcsweeney snarled then he held up a hand no wait get down carlton was already throwing himself flat no more slowly than mcsweeney he heard the screech of cloven air and intermixed with it the roar of a river monitors big gun the roar of the shell was like the end of the world face down in the black sweetsmelling mudmcsweeney could tell by his nose how rich the soil washe felt the world shake as the round thudded home splinters hissed and squealed past overhead dirt pattered down on him and carlton both the rebs hadnt missed them by much the crash of the shell left his ears stunned battered dimly as if from far away he heard carlton shouting i hate those goddamn fucking monitorsunless theyre ours foul language aside mcsweeney agreed with all his heart that was why he had sent one of them to its no doubt less than heavenly reward the us army still had not brought up guns that could match the monitors firepower as a sergeant he would have guessed about why that was and only his strong belief would have kept his guesses from being profane as an officer he heard official explanations in place of guesses the only trouble was the explanations changed from day to day once hed been solemnly told that all the really largecaliber cannon were in service east of the mississippi a few days later he heard that the roads down from missouri were too bad to let the army move superheavy cannon down as far as memphis the roads were bad he knew that whether they were that bad or whether the other half of the explanation was true he did not know he did know the us artillery that had made it down opposite memphis could not match what the rebels river monitors carried another shell came whistling down out of the sky this one struck even closer than had the first the force of the explosion sent him tumbling along the ground he felt something wet on his upper lip when he raised a hand he discovered his nose was bleeding if hed been breathing in rather than out he might have had his lungs torn to shreds inside his chest and died without a mark on his body except blood from his nose hed seen that happen after almost three years hed seen everything happen ben carlton was screaming because his ears had taken a beating mcsweeney needed longer to realize that than he would have otherwise he crawled toward carlton then stopped and grimaced and shook his head a shell fragment had gutted the company cook like a trout his innards spilled into the mud it put mcsweeney in mind of the last time hed butchered a calf oh mother carlton wailed oh jesus oh jesus fucking christ that was not the way mcsweeney would have called on the son of god but he did not criticize not here not now as he took a better look at carltons wound he became certain the cook was beyond his criticism though not beyond that of a higher judge not only were his guts spilled on the ground they were also gashed and torn if he didnt die of blood loss or shock a wound infection would finish him more slowly but no less surely he wasnt in shock now but too horribly aware of what had happened do something god damn you he shrieked at gordon mcsweeney mcsweeney looked at his contorted face looked at the wound and grimaced again he knew what needed doing hed done it before for wounded comrades it never came easy not even for him he drew the trench knife he wore on his belt and showed it to carlton the wounded man was awake and aware and deserved the choice yes he groaned oh god yes it hurts so bad mcsweeney got up on his knees used one hand to tilt up ben carltons chin and cut his throat his comrades eyes held him for a few seconds then looked through him toward eternity looking at carlton mcsweeney hardly noted yet another shell screaming in had he noticed it would have mattered little the shell burst only a couple of feet away for an instant everything was goldglowing light then it was dark darkness absolute and then gordon mcsweeney found out whether or not everything in which he had so fervently believed was true richmond shocked anne colleton she hadnt been in the capital since the night of the first big us bombing raid most of a year before it had taken a beating then shed seen as much as she made her way to the train station but that had been a house gone here a shop gone there and a few piles of rubble in the street now after months of nighttime visits from us bombing aeroplanes richmond was a charred skeleton of its former self whole blocks had been burnt out hardly a building had escaped getting a chunk bitten out of it windows with glass in them were rare enough to draw notice more were boarded over still more gaped empty things have been hard sure enough the cab driver told her as he pulled up in front of fords hotel last time they were this hard i was a little boy and the yankees were comin up the james instead of down from the north he wore a neat white beard at which he plucked now we druv em back then but ill be switched if i know how were going to do it this time a colored attendant took charge of her bags when she registered she smiled to find her room was on the same floor as it had been during her last visit the smile held a hint of cats claws shed kept roger kimball out of her bed then much to his annoyance after shed unpacked she telephoned the presidents residence the aide with whom she talked seemed surprised shed come into richmond so nearly on time but said yes miss colleton the president looks forward to seeing you youre booked for tomorrow at ten i trust that will be acceptable i suppose so she answered or will we have surrendered by then the flunky spluttered anne said never mind that will be fine she hung up in the middle of an expostulation supper that evening wasnt what it had been the year before either sorry maam the negro waiter said caint hardly get food like we used to he lowered his voice a couple o the bes chefs went an joined the army too anne sighed i wish id known that before i ordered i think this socalled beefsteak would neigh if i stuck a fork in it no maam that really an truly is beef the waiter insisted he dropped his voice to a whisper again but if you stick a fork in the rabbit with plum sauce itll meow sure as im standin here roof rabbit nothin else but having thought about ordering the rabbit anne let out a sigh of relief us bombers pounded richmond again that night anne grabbed a robe and went down to the cellar of the ford hotel where she spent several crowded uncomfortable frightened hours even in the cellar she could hear the crump of bursting bombs the barking roar of the antiaircraft guns and the seemingly endless buzzing snarl of aeroplanes overhead she realized how isolated from the war shed been in south carolina it left no one here untouched just after shed managed to fall asleep in spite of the racket the allclear sounded she went back to her room and lay awake again for a long time before finally dropping off once more ham and eggs the next morning tasted fine the coffee was muddy and bitter but strong enough to pry her eyes open which counted for more she walked outside flagged a cab and went up shockoe hill to the presidential residence antiaircraft guns had sprouted on the lawn since her last visit holesactually they were more like cratershad sprouted in the lawn boards took the place of glass here as elsewhere in richmond other than that the mansion seemed undamaged for which anne was glad inside a flunky of higher grade than the one with whom shed confirmed her appointment said maam the president will see you as soon as he finishes his meeting with the british minister president semmes stayed closeted with the british minister till nearly noon too had he been with anyone else save perhaps the secretary of war the delay would have offended her but the british empire and the confederate states were the last of the quadruple entente still in the fight against the usa and germany anne didnt count japan and didnt think she shouldthe japanese were fighting more in their own interest than as allies of anyone else it was only natural for them to take counsel together when the british minister left semmes office and came out through the antechamber where she was sitting she grimaced his expression would have had to lighten to seem grim he hurried past without looking at her without false modesty she knew that any man who did that had a lot on his mind the president will see you now the flunky said appearing in the waiting room as if by magic thank you anne said and went into the office from which presidents of the confederate states had led their nation from one success to another for better than half a century gabriel semmes still led where the success was to come from however anne could not imagine semmes seemed to have aged a decade since anne had seen him the previous year he was grayer and balder than he had been his skin hung slack on his face and dark shadows lay under his eyes when he said come in miss colleton do come in his voice was an old mans voice thank you your excellency anne said and then as she sat are things really so bad as that by no means president semmes let out a gallows chuckle they are a great deal worse the british isles will starvesave perhaps that part of ireland that has risen in revolutionand we are taking blows not even an elephant could hope to withstand for long but the truce in tennessee is holding anne said why would roosevelt let it hold if the united states werent also at the end of their tether so he can hammer harder at other fronts semmes said so he can threaten us with starting up the war again there too if we do not lay down our arms on all fronts if he does semmes shook his head we could not hold the yankees at the line of the cumberland i do wonder if we should be able to hold them at the line of the tennessee he shook his head again anne got the idea he wished he hadnt said so much theyve licked us then she said colored soldiers and all theyve licked us we might as well not have bothered with them as it turned out that is true semmes said though they did buy us some extra time had russia not collapsed had france held out our own circumstances would be very different and then when the empire of brazil stabbed england in the backour allies are in a bad way miss colleton even as we are we had better cut our losses then and get out of the fight with the best bargain we can make anne said for one thing that would mean casting aside our allies once and for all the president answered for another but for the ceasefire in tennessee i have seen no sign that the united states want to bargain all they want is to rub our faces into the dirt the men i have sent forth to treat with them leave me in no doubt as to how much they want to rub our faces in the dirt we did it to them twice anne said and theyve been burning for revenge since the second mexican war weve embarrassed them since too semmes said gloomily with britain and france at our backs weve been too strong for them to challenge and so up till now we have for the most part had our own way up till now anne echoed can we yield or do they aim to wipe us off the face of the earth if they do i already know how to use a rifle teaching the rest of the women in the csa wouldnt take long i admire your spirit miss colleton the president said but we are not in the state we are in because of any want of spirit we are in our present state because our allies have failed and because our negroes rose up against us and most of all because the united states outweigh us by about two to one they outweigh us and canada combined and they have been able to take advantage of it i wish i had something more hopeful i could tell you we must never let this happen again anne said in principle i agree with you gabriel semmes replied in practicein practice i fear living up to that principle shall not be so easy the yankees will grow as a result of whatever peace they force upon us we shall shrink correspondingly they will not make it easy for us to gain redress for the grievances they leave us they waited fifty years and more for their revenge anne said if we have to we can do the same but i hope and pray it will come sooner they also spent a lot of time and money preparing that revenge semmes pointed out can we do the same under their watchful eye just when anne thought his manhood altogether quenched he added whether we can or not i dont know but we shall have to try yes anne said i never understood what drove them to want the revenge so badly now i do nothing like losing to make you want to take back what youve lost and to get even with the fellow who took it from you she thought of jacob gassed by the yankees and murdered when the negroes raised the red banner of revolution shed had some measure of revengenot enough but someon the reds how could she avenge herself upon the united states of america i do want to thank you for the support you have shown for my policies since i succeeded president wilson semmes said i hope that support will continue as we head toward the end of this war i hope you still have some money and some influence left was what he meant anne hoped the same thing she wished shed sold marshlands before the red uprisingthat would have given her more capital to invest her investments at the moment were disasters but marshlands was a catastrophe not only was it bringing in no money the taxes she paid on the land were sucking the lifes blood from her veins she said ill do what i can we need to get our strength back as quickly as were able to that wasnt a promise that what she would do would involve supporting gabriel semmes although she would not have been brokenhearted to have him take it as one and so he did saying i knew i could rely on you and let me say that even now i have some hope that the army of northern virginia will yet halt the yankees inroads for which they are paying a dreadful price if we stop them if we can drive them back we may yet get terms more nearly acceptable to the national honor i hope we do anne said and meant it at the same time though she still held to the thought shed had before if the war was lost best to escape it as soon as might be with this war behind them the confederate states could start thinking about the next one it was lucien galtier thought a grand day for a wedding he felt not the least bit sorry to hold the ceremony in the little tinroofed church of stantonin rather than the grander structure up in riviereduloup father pierre the local priest got on very well with father fitzpatrick bishop pascal would have made a fine show of getting along with dr odoulls friend and while making that fine show would have done everything in his power to undercut him lucien had seen bishop pascal in action before he fiddled with his wing collar and cravat marie had gone on and on about how handsome he looked in his somber black suit whether he looked handsome or not he disliked the way the collar grabbed him around the neck he sniffed at his sleeve hoping neither the suit nor the white shirt under it smelled too overpoweringly of mothballs they spent most of their time in a chest in the closet coming forth for hardly anything but funerals and weddings his sons stood around fiddling with their collars too hed had to tie their neckties for them it was either that or spend half an hour waiting while they botched the job and then do the tying neither of them had had much practice at the art he hadnt had much himself and hoped the knot in his own cravat was as straight as those hed tied for charles and georges had nicole been marrying some young man of the vicinity he too would have worn a black suit of no particular age and no particular shape and like as not a cravat his father had tied for him dr leonard odoull on the other hand wore a cutaway white tie trousers pressed into creases scalpelsharp and a stovepipe hat when georges saw him in his splendor he whistled and said i thought i was getting a doctor for a brotherinlaw not a rockefeller and i thought i was getting a troublemaker for a brotherinlaw and i see i was right dr odoull returned he refused to let georges get his goat lucien reckoned that the best way to handle his younger son who was indeed a troublemaker father fitzpatrick came up to them a little man with a beaky nose and hair the color halfway between rust and a sunset well do it in just a few minutes now he said he spoke parisian french with a peculiar lilting accent when he spoke english with dr odoull the lilt remained this is good lucien said this is very good he slowed his own speech a little for the priests benefit turning to his daughters fiance he asked are you nervous of course im nervous odoull answered georges looked disappointed had odoull tried to deny it luciens son would have made him pay the american doctor went on werent you nervous when you married your wife now that i think on it it could be that i was galtier said and pursed his lips to show he knew he was understating things hed been as nervous as a man getting a halfgrown lynx out of a tree and hed known marie since they were both children odoull had known nicole only since they began working together at the hospital no wonder he was nervous friends and relatives filed into the church most of them waved to lucien some came over to shake hands with him and odoull a few went inside with rather sour expressions they were families with young men who might possibly have been matched to nicole had her father not chosen this outsider in their shoes he would have shown a long face too and then it was time to go inside and for lucien to lead nicole down the aisle toward the altar in her dress all of white she looked very young and very beautiful she beamed at him through the veil he patted the hand shed set on his arm if she was happy he would be happy and even if dr odoull was an american he struck galtier as a solidly good fellow so did father fitzpatrick though he gave lucien a start by pronouncing the latin of his prayers in a most peculiar fashion galtier glanced sharply over at father pierre the local priest remained calm that let lucien also remain calm if father pierre thought father fitzpatricks pronunciation acceptable god likely would too after dr odoull had opened nicoles veil and kissed her after he had set a ring on her finger people headed across the street to the hall lucien had hired for the receptionthe money major quigley had paid for back rent for the land on which the hospital stood was proving useful in all sorts of ways once there lucien got a drink and then found an excuse to get father pierre in a corner and ask him about father fitzpatricks latin father pierre was also holding a drink he knocked it back chuckled and answered you need have no concern over that english and irish and american priests are in the habit of pronouncing their latin as they believe the ancient romans would have spoken and you how do you pronounce your latin lucien asked in the same way as does his holiness the pope father pierre said i think i have made the better choice but the other is in no way evil merely different i also think you have made the better choice lucien said in your mouth latin sounds splendid in father fitzpatricks mouth i found it harsh and rather ugly part of that is because you are not used to it the priest of stantonin replied their way does have a certain majesty to italthough as i say i prefer our own he rolled his eyes trust englishspeakers to pay no attention to what the rest of the world does galtier laughed at that where is the joke mon beaupere leonard odoull asked he could properly call lucien his fatherinlaw now yes father where is the joke nicole echoed instead of galtiers arm she clung with proud possessiveness to her new husbands it is a matter of latin lucien answered with any luck at all that would impress and confuse both the newlyweds it worked with his daughter but not with odoull the doctor thumped his forehead with the heel of his free hand but of course im an idiot fitz learned his latin the ciceronian way same as i did but you folks here pronounce it as if the romans had been italians dont you he must have sounded pretty funny to you if our way is good enough for the holy father in rome it is good enough for me galtier said behind him father pierre nodded and yes your friends latin did sound odd though i am given to understand it is also good of its kind he wondered if that would insult the american instead he saw that odoull was having a hard time not laughing fitzs latin is certainly better than mine these days his soninlaw said who but a priest has the chance to keep his grasp of the language so fresh you have reason father pierre said i speak no english i am sorry to say and many priests who do speak english know not a word of frenchunlike your friend father fitzpatrick whose french is very good if like his latin spoken in an interesting way but with such folk i speak in latin and i am understood even with the differences in pronunciation i am understood its like the difference between the french of paris and the french of quebec odoull said why so it is the priest of stantonin beamed at him then turned to lucien and slapped him on the back you are a fortunate man to have a scholar as part of your family i am a fortunate man lucien said that is enough and if i owe some of my good fortune to an americanwhy then i do that is all before either leonard odoull or father pierre could say anything to that shouts from the street distracted both of them and galtier too a couple of people near the doorway called out to learn what was going on lucien heard the reply very clearly the flag of the republic of quebec flies over the city of quebec several other people who also heard shouted for joy a moment later somebody punched one of them in the nose half a dozen men jumped on the puncher and threw him out to luciens dismay he saw the fellow sprawled in the street with his trousers torn was a cousin hed always liked pretty well before the reception could turn into a freeforall he let out a great bellow enough he was loud enough to make everyone turn around and notice him still at the top of his lungs he went on this is a wedding not a political rally anyone who wishes to make it a political rally will answer to me he cocked a fist leaving no doubt about what he meant and me georges and charles said in the same breath standing shoulder to shoulder with their father that settled that people horrified at the victory of the americans and the republic of quebec very much in that order over the canadian and british troops defending the capital of what had been the canadian province of quebec kept that horror to themselves lucien galtier felt some as he watched the world with which he was long familiar crack further but his manner also persuaded those who were delighted with the success of the republic to keep their mouths shut the reception went on marie came up to him and spoke quietly you did very well there did i lucien shrugged i do not know what should i feel i was torn in two when france lay down her arms to germany now i am torn in two again what we had is not what we shall have change his wife spoke the word as if it were more filthy than tabernac why can the world not stay as it has always been now it was galtiers turn to whisper you ask this at the wedding of your eldest daughter to an american doctor how many american doctors would have come to the farm acourting without the war not more than six or eight i am certain marie stuck an elbow in his ribs and i am certain you are as much trouble as georges which is saying a good deal i am also certain dr odoull is a fine young man even if he is an american i am certain of this as well else i should never have allowed him to join the family galtier said and i am certain we have profited since the americans came when everything is taken all in all but in doing so we have turned our backs on everything that we knew and taken hold of everything that is new do you wonder that i worry on account of it i wonder that you worry so little on account of it marie answered this only shows that wife of mine as you have been these many years you do not know every dark place inside my heart lucien told her i worryhow i worry but i have got bywe have got by and old or new we will go on getting by now he spoke with great determination after a moment marie nodded lieutenant general george custer was in a state and for once his adjutant was damned if he blamed him on my front custer shouted roosevelt accepts a ceasefire on my front does he accept a ceasefire on any other front in a pigs arse he does why my front why my front alone he must have reasons major abner dowling said though hed been hard pressed to find any that made sense to him oh he has reasons all right custer snarled he had no trouble finding them either he wants to rob me of my glory thats what he wants to do he always has damn him he never let me go to canada to lead our soldiers there and now this is the front where we first broke through the rebels lines this is the front where the us army learned how to break through the rebels lines and this is the front teddy roosevelt chose to halt do i have to draw you a picture major sir you cant mean that dowling said he might as well not have spoken for custer ranted right through him that man in the white house has tried to rob me of the credit i deserve for the past thirtyfive years i was the one in command when we drove chinese gordon out of montana during the second mexican war but who stole the headlines roosevelt and his unauthorized regiment thats who tell me to my face major that hes not doing the same thing now look at the map and tell me that to my face dowling obediently looked the longer he looked the more he wondered whether the general commanding first army didnt have a point if roosevelt hadnt accepted the ceasefire how far would us forces have advanced by now custer inevitably had his own opinion about that murfreesboro to hell with murfreesboro wed be pushing on toward chattanooga by now damn me to hell if we wouldnt fortunately for him dowling couldnt do anything of the sort chattanooga was a long way away i doubt that general the voice came from the doorway dowling turned his mouth fell open there grinning stood theodore roosevelt how much of custers tirade had he heard by the look of that grin altogether too much dowling kissed his own career goodbye and custer wasnt finished custer wasnt anywhere close to finished how dare you inflict this indignity on first army mr president how dare you he demanded whatever you may think of me the brave soldiers who have given so much to the cause deserve to be in at the kill many of those soldiers would have agreed with him too though being in at the kill might have meant their dying dowling knew as much complaints from the front kept flooding into nashville roosevelt said either the confederates will yield on all fronts in a weeks time general or you will be moving forward again that i promise you maybe you will be able to aim toward chattanooga after all why the devil did you halt me in the first place custer said anything but mollified even more to the point why did you halt me and no one else you do not serve your country well by bearing a grudge across so many years if that wasnt the pot complaining of the kettles complexion dowling had never heard any such but roosevelt didnt rise to the bait instead walking over to the map on the wall he pointed to the ground first army had seized south of the cumberland i stopped first army general because you have done something no other us force has accomplished you halted us because we did better than any other force you have custer howled you admit it thats not what i said general roosevelt answered sharply your unique achievement is easy to describe in moving south of the cumberland yours is the only force to have captured territory i am willing to return to the confederate states in exchange for concessions elsewhere we go from the realm of war into the realm of diplomacy heredo you see ahh that wasnt custer it was abner dowling he wasnt sure he agreed with what roosevelt was doing not that the president would lose any sleep if he didnt but he was profoundly relieved roosevelt was doing it for some other reason besides or at least in addition to pique against custer custer himself did not give over sputtering and fuming why on earth should we give any land weve taken back to the rebs when i was a lad this was all part of the united states and so it should be again in principle general i agree with you roosevelt answered in practice the line we occupyand what we can reasonably hope to takewill not give us a neat defensible frontier everywhere along it well do some horse trading at the table and this stretch south of the cumberland i can trade without a second thought you wont have to do much trading sir dowling said we hold the whip thats true major but i cant wipe the confederate states from the face of the earth however much i might want to the president answered kaiser bill cant make france go away either if we weaken them though and make them pay they wont trouble us for a long while then by thunder when we do fight them again well put paid to them once and for all custer said he rubbed his agegnarled hands together damned if i dont look forward to reuniting the country at last he sounded as if he looked forward to commanding us soldiers in the next war against the csa if as roosevelt hoped the confederates would have to lie quiet for a long time the wait would put him up into his ninetiesor beyond maybe he didnt think about that maybe he thought about it and didnt care having gone on for so long he might believe he could go on forever major dowling asked mr president for what land might you want to swap what weve taken south of the cumberland what i have in mind getting is the little chunk of southeastern kentucky the confederates still hold roosevelt answered lord knows its not worth much as far as land goes but having the whole state in our hands will make life simpler after the shooting stops the confederates wont be able to keep kentucky in their congress then or to go on electing senators and a congressman or two wholl spend all their time speechifying about how the confederacy needs to take back their home state i want it gone from their minds altogether gone and that will be that that makes agood deal of sense dowling said slowly because of his bulldog aggressiveness roosevelt didnt get the credit he deserved either as a politician or as a statesman the germans had no end of trouble from france when they took part of lorraine after the francoprussian war but let the froggies keep some too better they should have grabbed it all to make the break clean roosevelt beamed at him the very example i had in mind as a matter of fact major dowling beamed too looking smart in front of your boss never hurt the president went on our allies will correct that omission in the forthcoming peace i assure you custer coughed one of those coughs loosed for no other purpose than to draw attention to oneself this is all very well your excellency i have no doubt but why do it at the expense of what first army has achieved if you must trade the confederates land for land why not give them back some of the vast worthless stretches weve captured west of the mississippi in arkansas and sequoyah and texas and sonora not all that land out there is worthless general roosevelt answered the stretch of arkansas we hold puts memphis under our guns which emphatically is worth doing sequoyah is full of oil and gas and we can use them motorized machines grew ever more important as this war moved along and as for the land that is largely worthlessthat being so why would the csa want it back it still strikes me as unjust that my forces should be singled out for this halt custer said we deserve better than that i deserve better than that he meant dowling had no trouble understanding as much and neither did theodore roosevelt he blew air out through his mustache before replying general would you not say that in your long and distinguished military career you have already been treated better than you deserve i havent the faintest idea what you are referring to mr president custer said bristling and i resent the imputation resent all you like roosevelt growled abner dowling did his best to seem a large corpulent fly on the wall he listened avidly as roosevelt continued when we were taking our position north of the teton you were the one who wanted to move back the gatling guns that chopped the british infantry to dogmeat if we had moved them the limeys probably would have overrun us the only reason you ever got to be a hero you pompous fraud is that colonel welton and i talked you out of it thats a damned lie custer shouted the hell it is roosevelt shouted back and if your brother hadnt got himself shot he would have said the same thing another lie custer turned a dusky shade of purple that had to surely had to portend an apoplexy tom and i were two sides of the same coin both tails or maybe blockheads roosevelt said damn you you know why i always wanted to lead in canada youve always known and youve always ignored my requests for transfer is it any wonder i resent that custer said instead of answering roosevelt shrugged off his coat custer cocked his fist and glared a challenge the two men one nearing sixty the other nearing eighty looked ready to swing at each other gentlemen please dowling said reluctantly reminding them of his existence even more reluctantly he stepped between them if the two of you quarrel the only gainers live in richmond roosevelt recovered his temper as fast as he lost it hed always been volcanic but his eruptions quickly subsided with a nodalmost a bowto dowling he said youre right of course he also nodded to custer general i apologize for my hasty words as if to prove he meant it he put the coat back on i also assure you that as i said before i accepted this ceasefire for reasons of state ones that have nothing to do with personal animus against you with the memory of your brother or with disrespect for the sterling fighting qualities the men of first army have displayed slander nothing but slander custer muttered under his breath unlike roosevelt he stayed angry a long time but when the president affected not to hear him he muttered something else and then said i must accept the assurances of my commanderinchief from him that was an extraordinary concession it wasnt what most interested his adjutant though for years dowling had heard whispers about the combat in montana territory that said what roosevelt had said out loud it did not strike him as improbable where sound military judgment required pushing straight ahead custer could be relied upon to exercise such judgment where sound military judgment required anything else custer could be relied upon to push straight ahead general weve won the damn war roosevelt said as your adjutant so wisely put it richmond laughs if we disagree among ourselves i do recognize what you have done here to prove it when i get back to philadelphia i shall propose to congress your elevation to the rank of full general and i am confident congress will confirm that promotion where minutes before custer had been ready to punch the president now he bowed as deeply as his years and his paunch permitted you honor me beyond my deserts your excellency he said by his expression though he did not for a moment believe he was being too highly honored dowling was inclined to agree with the modest selfappraisal custer gave to roosevelt but then wondered if he might not be promoted too a rising tide lifts all boats he thought and the us tide rose higher day by day thegreatwar breakthroughs chester martin was no longer in command of b company st regiment and did his best to feel resigned about it out of some replacement depot had come second lieutenant joshua childress who might possibly have been nineteen years old but might well not have too we hit the rebels one more good lick tomorrow morning he declared to the weary veterans in the hastily dug trench north of stafford virginia that will take us all the way down to the rappahannock wont it be bully his voice broke with excitement at the prospect corporal bob reinholdt chuckled softly somebody better oil the lieutenant sarge he whispered to martin he squeaks yeah martin whispered back weve got to keep an eye on him hell get some good men killed if we dont aint that the sad and sorry truth reinholdt said with a nod if he still resented chester for taking over his sectionand for coldcocking himhe didnt show it too much water to say nothing of blood had gone under the bridge since we must finish the punishment we have given the confederate states since childress was saying we are all heroes in this fight and we must not fear martyrdom in our countrys cause reinholdt and martin both rolled their eyes this couldnt be anything but childress first combat duty firing had been light in the couple of days since hed come down to the front people whod served longer were apt to be less enthusiastic about the prospect of martyrdom when the war was visibly won people who like martin had won purple hearts were apt to be least enthusiastic of all be bold childress said be resolute be fearless now when the enemy totters is the time to strike the fiercest blows christ reinholdt muttered wish you was still in charge of us sarge that stupid prick is going to have us charging machinegun nests with our bare hands he got out a tobacco pouch and began to roll a cigarette well one thinghe aint likely to last long then its your turn again yeah martin said if he doesnt get me shot too thank god for barrels is all i can say without em most of usd be dead about five times over god knows thats true reinholdts big head bobbed up and down if i stay in the army after the rebs quit i figure im going to try and get into barrels myself that way ill have some iron between me and the fuckers were fighting martin considered only trouble i can see with that is the other guys go after barrels with everything theyve got youll get in the way of a lot more cannon shells than you would if you stayed out in the open well yeah reinholdt allowed the thing of it is though you get in the way of even one shell when youre out in the open and it aint what you call your lucky day he stuck the handmade cigarette in his mouth and brought it to life with a lighter made from a springfield cartridge case in the background lieutenant childress droned on and on some of the men in b companyreplacements mostlyhung on every word he said the soldiers whod been in the trenches for a while either took no notice of him or quietly made fun of him the way martin and reinholdt did they didnt need him to tell them how to fight had he been willing to listen instead of banging his gums he might have learned a good deal the army of northern virginia had taken a hell of a beating but it hadnt quit the rebs interrupted childress disquisition with a mortar barrage martin hated mortars they dropped bombs right down into the trenches which regular artillery had a lot more trouble doing he was damned if he could figure out where the valor lay in cowering and hoping a spinning fragment wouldnt turn him from a man into an anatomy lesson when the barrage eased childress picked up where hed left off without seeming to miss a word as chester martin got to his feet and tried to brush damp earth from the front of his uniform he hoped that meant the new company commander had some guts the other choice was that childress was so full of himself he hardly noticed what went on around him remembering how hed been at nineteen or so martin knew that was possible us artillery didnt let the confederates mortar the forward trenches without paying them back the usa had more guns and bigger guns than the csa did the bombardment went on long into the night that puzzled martin whod grown used to sharp short barrages in the middle of the din lieutenant childress exulted see how we thrash the stubborn foe he makes more noisen the guns do bob reinholdt said disgustedly that gave martin the answer or he thought it did he snapped his fingers bet theyre making a racket to keep the rebs from hearing the barrels coming forward huh reinholdt said a noise that could have meant anything after a bit he went on maybe i never should have given you no trouble sarge sure as hell youre smartern i am thats got to be it nothings got to be anything martin spoke with the deep conviction of a man who had seen almost everything its a pretty fair bet though yeah it was too dark for martin to watch reinholdt nod but the pause before the corporal spoke again was about right last time they kept the machine guns banging all night long you dont want to do the same thing twice in a row or the rebsll get wise to you i hadnt thought of it that way but youre right martin swatted at a mosquito he didnt think he got it scratching he continued maybe im the dummy if reinholdt finally was getting used to having him in charge he wanted to help that along as much as he could ignoring occasional shells from overmatched confederate batteries trying to reply to the us barrage he rolled himself in his blanket and went to sleep to lieutenant childress credit he went through the trenches an hour before the attack was set to begin making sure everybody in the company was awake and alert when he recognized martin in the predawn gloom he said remember sergeant we are to form behind the barrels and follow them toward the enemys position yes sir martin hid a smile ive done this before sir the last big attack hed done it as a company commander he let out a silent sigh lieutenant childress might as well not have heard him we have to stay close to the barrels to take full advantage of what they can do for us he could have been reciting something hed learned by rote he didnt understand what it meant not really but at least he had it right as he was speaking us artillery came to life again making the confederates stay under cover in the key minutes just before the attack went in through the booming of the guns and of their shells martin caught the sound he was listening for the rumble of truck engines and the rattle and clank of iron tracks sure enough the barrels were moving up to their jumpingoff places darkness slowly yielded to morning twilight martin got a glimpse of a couple of barrels not far away the big boxy steel shapes putting him in mind of prehistoric monsters looming out of the mist but these monsters were friendly to him and his only the confederates would find them horrid and then the note of the engines grew harsher louder the barrels waddled forward at their best speed somewhere between a fast walk and a slow trot toward the men of the army of northern virginia lieutenant childress almost beardless cheeks puffed out like a chipmunks as he blew and blew the whistle that ordered his company forward he was first out of the trench himself he would do what he could by personal example come on you lazy bastards chester martin shouted if the rebs shoot you your family picks up a nice check from uncle sam so youve got nothing to worry about right he suspected that wouldnt hold up if anybody took a long logical look at it but so what it got the men moving which was what hed had in mind machine guns winked balefully from the confederate positions ahead no the army of northern virginia hadnt quit however much martin wished it would us machine gunners did their best to make their cs counterparts keep their heads down the barrels began firing on the confederate machinegun nests too they also began smashing down the wire in front of the confederate trenches though those belts werent nearly so thick as some martin had seen forward lieutenant childress shouted stay close to the barrels he trotted on doing his best to make sure he was applying what hed learned in school it did him no good one thing his training hadnt taught him was how to keep from catching three or four machinegun bullets with his chest he let out a brief bubbling wail and crumpled martin was only a few feet behind the company commander he threw himself flat and crawled up to him childress eyes were wide and staring blood poured from his wounds and from his mouth and nose he was still twitching a little and still trying to breathe but he was a dead man that meant b company belonged to martin again he scrambled to his feet come on he shouted again we can take em let em try and stop us hard as they want we can still take em talk like that on the roanoke front in would have got him laughed at taking such talk seriously back then would have got himand whoever listened to himkilled nownow he was right the army of northern virginia lacked the men and the guns and most of all the barrels to halt the vengeful forces of the united states each barrel the csa did get into the fight had to fight off two or three or four us machines also at last even the white confederate soldiers seemed to have despaired of the fight instead of battling in the trenches with bayonet and sharpened spade more and more of them threw down their rifles and threw up their hands and went into captivity pleased with themselves for having outlasted the war here and there in the trenches and behind them diehards still fought till they were killed in place but the tide of war flowed past them and over them and washed them away now finally everything was going as the generals and politicians had predicted it would go back in martin passed through the little town of stafforda few homes and shops clustered around a brick courthousehardly noticing it till it was behind him us artillery had reduced most of the buildings to rubble the confederates no longer defended every hamlet as if it were land on which jesus had walked come on he shouted to the men who advanced with him eight miles to the rappahannock if we push these bastards well be there by sundown and if on the roanoke front in hed heard himself say anything like that hed have known he was either shellshocked or just plain crazy but only a few rebs contested the way south of stafford save for those rear guards most of the confederates seemed intent on getting to the southern bank of the river perhaps to make a stand there perhaps simply to escape a couple of miles north of the rappahannock shells from the far side of the river began landing uncomfortably close to martin and his men then the shells stopped falling the rifle and machinegun fire from the few men in butternut still north of the rappahannock died away a confederate soldieran officercame out from behind a ruined building he was carrying a white flag hold your fire chester martin shouted to his men the hair at the back of his neck and on his arms tried to stand on end its over the confederate officer shouted its done you sons of bitches licked us standing there defeated before the soldiers of the united states he burst into tears jake featherston had the surviving guns of his battery in the best position hed found for them since the war began back of fredericksburg virginia up in maryes heights a stone wall protected a sunken road if the yankees swung down along the curve of the rappahannock and tried to force a crossing at fredericksburg he could look down on them and slaughter them for as long as his ammunition held out they would be able to hit him only by luckby luck or by aeroplane he kept a wary eye turned toward the sky at the moment he had the guns turned toward the north rather than the east thoughthe us soldiers seemed to be heading straight for falmouth instead of fredericksburg that was what he gathered from the beaten men in butternut streaming past anyhow hed given up shooting at confederate soldiers fleeing the enemy he couldnt kill them all he couldnt even make them stop their retreat and the more rounds he wasted on them the fewer hed be able to shoot at the damnyankees he climbed up on top of the stone wall and peered north through field glasses sure as hell here came the us soldiers trailing the barrels that smashed flat or blasted out of existence any strongpoints in their path us fighting scouts swooped low over the front further harrying the men of the army of northern virginia come on boys jake said theyre inside seven thousand yards lets remind em they have to pay for their tickets to get in god damn me to hell and fry me for bacon if anybody else is going to do the job infantrymen christ on his cross all the good infantry we used to haves been dead the last two years the four guns that remained of his battery of the first richmond howitzers desperately needed new barrels theyd sent too many rounds through these the rifling grooves were worn away to next to nothing featherston knew the guns werent going to get what they needed fat cats in richmond get what they need he thought all im doing is defending my country does that count not likely what do fellows like me get hind tit thats what when the guns began to roar though he whooped to see the shells falling among the leading damnyankees hed spent the whole war doing his best to hurt them even if the guns werent so accurate as they should have been he could still do that he could still enjoy it too an improbably young lieutenant in an improbably clean uniform came up to him and demanded who commands this battery sergeant jake drew himself up with touchy pride and took pleasure in noting that he was a couple of inches taller than this baby officer i do he growled sir oh the lieutenant looked as if he were tasting milk that had gone sour very well sergeant i am to inform you that as of five oclock pm which is to say about an hour from now an armistice will go into effect along our entire fighting front with the united states jake had been braced for the news or thought he had for the past couple of weeks getting it was like a boot in the belly just the same weve lost then he said slowly were giving up were whipped the officer said featherston looked at the men who served the guns perhaps for the first time he let himself see how worn they were their heads bobbed agreement with the shavetails wordsthey were whipped the lieutenant went on weve done everything we could do it wasnt enough what the hell did you do jake asked the lieutenant stared at him disbelieving his earshow could an enlisted man presume to question him jake shook his own head strangling the pipsqueak would be fun but what was the use the csa grew his sort in carload lots ask a question with an answer worth knowing then what are we supposed to do with the guns after five oclock leave them the young lieutenant said as if they were unimportant they wereto him he went on the yankees will take them as spoils of war i reckon that didnt seem important to him either off he went to give the word to the next battery he found spoils of war featherston muttered hell they will he looked at his watch we got most of an hour boys till the wars over lets make those shitheels wish it never got started plainly his soldiers would just as soon have let the fighting peter out he didnt shame them into keeping onhe frightened them into it that he could still frighten them with everything theyd known crashing into ruin around them said a lot about the sort of man he was at five oclock he himself pulled the lanyard to his field gun one last time then he undid the breech block carried it over to hazel runa couple of hundred yardsand threw it in the water he did the same with the breech blocks from all the other guns now the damnyankees are welcome to em he said fat lot of good theyll get from em though his words seemed to echo and reecho as the armistice took hold silence flowed over the countryside it seemed unnatural like machinegun fire on a sunday afternoon in the middle of richmond when the gun crew talked they talked too loud for one thing they were used to shouting over the roar of the threeinchers for another they were all a little deaf jake suspected he was more than a little deaf hed been at the guns longer than any of his men before the sun set major clarence potter made his way to the battery featherston nodded to him as to an old friend in the army potter was about as close to an old friend as he had the intelligence officer looked at the field guns then at jake youre not going to let them have anything they can use eh he said jake spent some little while describing in great detail the uses the damnyankees could make of his guns major potter listened appreciating his imagination finally featherston said goddammit sir sure as hell were going to fight those bastards another round one of these days before too long why give em anything they can take advantage of oh you get no arguments from me sergeant potter said i wish more men were busy wrecking more weapons well have to turn over to the usa he wore a flask on his hip he took it in hand yanked the cork swigged and passed it to featherston heres to the two of us we were right when the people over us were wrong and much good it did us the whiskey burned its way down to jakes belly he wanted to gulp the flask dry but made himself stop after one long pull and hand it back to major potter thank you sir he said for once sincere in showing an officer gratitude then he asked the question undoubtedly echoing throughout the beaten army of northern virginia throughout the beaten confederate states what the devil happens next we never lost a war before what happens next is up to the yankees potter drank again unless i read them wrongand i dont think i dotheyll take us down just as far as they can without provoking us into starting up the war he thrust the flask at featherston once more here finish it yes sir jake was glad to obey that order once the reinforcements had landed and spread warmth along his legs and up on his cheeks and nose he found another question closely related to the first whatll they make us do im not teddy roosevelt thank god but i can make some guesses potter said first one is the united states are going to keep whatever theyve grabbed in the war kentuckys gone sequoyahs gone that chunk of texas theyre calling houston is gone the chunk they bit out of sonora is gone too yeah jake pointed out north probably hold on to virginia down to the rappahannock too probably the intelligence officer agreed when the next war comes that will keep us from shelling washington the way we have the last couple of timeskeep us from doing it for a little while anyhow the next war jake repeated he assumed there would be a next one all right how soon do you reckon itll come that depends on a lot of things major potter answered how much the damnyankees make us cut our army and navy for one how many men and barrels and aeroplanes and submersibles they let us keep oh yeah featherston nodded and on how many well have stashed away without them being any the wiser and on that potter agreed the other side of the coin is how soon do the thieves fall out i dont know what you mean jake said with a frown who won the war major potter asked patiently the usa and germany thats who oh austriahungary and the ottoman empire too but they hardly count roosevelt and the kaiser are pals now but how long will that last when they start squabbling among themselves that may give us the chance to get some of our own back ah featherston thought that over then raised an admiring eyebrow you come up with all kinds of things dont you major that was genuine ungrudging praise and drew a smile from potter featherston went on ill tell you who lost the war for us though ive heard this song before sergeant potter said jake went on as if he hadnt spoken the whitebearded fools in the war department and the niggers thats who anybody wants to know we ought to take em all out and shoot em whole lot of good they did us during the war take all who out and shoot them major potter asked interestedly the whitebearded fools in the war department or the niggers hell yes without his quite noticing it the whiskey had mounted to jakes head countryd be better off without em you mark my words duly marked sergeant but potter sounded amused not convinced nice to know someone has all the answers ill tell you one thing a lot of people in richmond will be looking for answers and heads will roll on account of it some maybe savage scorn filled featherstons voice but not enough you mark my words on that too the high muckymucksll find ways to cover for their brothers and cousins and inlaws and pals and nothing muchll come out of this and as for the niggershellfire major some of those damn coonsll be voting now voting after they stabbed us in the back voting can you imagine it you are an embittered man the intelligence officer told jake he studied him for a long moment then slowly shook his head if you turned to good use the energy you waste in bitterness who knows what you might be able to do with it waste jake shook his head too im not wasting it major im going to get even im going to get even with everybody who screwed me and my country forgive me sergeant but ill believe it when i see it potter said you will jake said damned if i know how but you will major cherney was laying things out for the fliers in his squadron all right boys this is the last act the confederate states are out of the war its us against england and canada now and were going to lick them thats all there is to it toronto is going to fall with the rebs quitting we can bring up another million men and another thousand aeroplanes and squash em flat jonathan moss stuck up his hand when cherney pointed to him he said sir i dont know about you but i want to finish licking the canucks before all the reinforcements come up from the south if they do it for us its like saying we couldnt handle the job ourselves he looked around the tent at the orangeville aerodrome most of the pilots who nodded with him were men whod been flying against the canadians and englishmen for a long time percy stone agreed with him for instance pete bradley like a lot of the newer men didnt seem to care one way or the other as long as canada goes under his shrug might have said who cares how but charley sprague among the newest of the new spoke in support of moss thats right theyll take all the credit and what will they leave us not a confounded thing thats what after the war is over everybody will try to pretend we didnt do anything anything at all is that how we want to go down in history i agree with both of you cherney said weve been through too much to let those other bastards grab our glory that means we have to grab it ourselves lets go out and do it after almost three years of war moss hadnt thought a speech could fire him up for combat in the air but he went out to his wright twodecker with a grim smile on his face and a spring in his step he felt ready to whip the whole british empire singlehanded perhaps seeing that percy stone set a hand on his arm as he was about to climb up into his flying scout steady there he said when you try to do more than you really can thats when you get into trouble moss paused with his foot in the mounting stirrup on the side of the fuselage youre right he said ill remember thanks my pleasure stone answered you brought me home so they could patch me up again i want you to get home too he paused then looked west or over toward arthur if youd rather do that when the war is over ears burning under his flying helmet moss scrambled into the cockpit percy stone went over to his own bus and took his place inside moss shook his head his friend knew how sweet hed got on laura secord and if doing that wasnt foolish he didnt know what was for one thing she despised americans for another she had a husband except for those minor details she would have made a perfect match but he couldnt get her out of his mind he knew he should but he couldnt a groundcrew man spun the fighting scouts prop moss checked his instruments he had plenty of fuel plenty of oil and his oil pressure was good flying relieved the symptoms of what ailed him he didnt have timewell he didnt have much timeto think about it he looked to the other pilots stone bradley and sprague waved in turn they were ready to go he nodded to the groundcrew man who pulled the chocks away from his wheels the twodecker bumped along over the rutted grass of the landing strip till after one bump it didnt come down the smoke that marked torontos funeral pyre guided him south and east his flightmates followed he kept trying to look every which way at once and wished for eyes on stalks like a snails to make that easier for two or three miles inland from the shore of lake ontario the land that made up the city of toronto rose smoothly from the water then it became steeper even hilly british and canadian artillery used the hills to advantage posting batteries on them and looking down on the flat country through which us forces were slowly and expensively fighting their way antiaircraft guns protected the pieces that were shelling the americans black puffs of smoke burst around moss aeroplane as he dove on an enemy battery the wright twodecker bucked in the turbulence from the explosions like a restive horse a piece of shrapnel tore some fabric from the buss right upper wing moss knew it could as easily have torn through the engine or through him his thumb found the firing button on top of the stick below the gunners swelled from dots to toys to barechested men in khaki trousers englishmen or canadians he didnt know he didnt see that it made a difference one way or the other he stabbed at the button with all his strength see how you like that he shouted as tracers lanced toward the artillerymen they scattered some of them fell early in the war when hed thought the principal function of fliers was observation hed felt bad about shooting at the foe it didnt bother him any more it hadnt bothered him for a long time the limeys and canucks werent shy about shooting at him they would have cheered their heads off if hed crashed in flames his twin machine guns kept things even he zoomed back toward the front at just above treetop height his flightmates on his tail every time he spotted a concentration of men in khaki he gave them a burst and sent them flying like ninepins they shot back too rifle bullets hissed past him some uncomfortably close an infantryman had to be amazingly lucky to shoot down an aeroplane if enough infantrymen fired enough rounds thoughhed never liked that thought he brought up the wrights nose to gain altitude for another swoop on the enemys guns that let him look down on toronto once more us forces had crossed the etobicoke and the mimico there was heavy fighting in a parkhigh park he remembered the name from maps hed studiedjust east of the latter stream farther east still what had been the parliament building in queens park was now a burntout ruin wrecked by bombs and artillery as always he checked the air around him for enemy machines spying none he began his second dive on the enemys guns something was different this time the altimeter wound off a thousand feet before he realized what it was the antiaircraft guns werent firing any more he wondered if artillery hits had put them out of action hope so he said with luck the slipstream would blow his words to gods ear down on the ground the enemy artillerymen were milling around their guns his thumb found the firing button again the men were looking up at him and waving scraps of clothscraps of white cloth behind his goggles his eyes widened he took his thumb away from the firing button and pulled out of the dive a little higher than he would have if hed been shooting up the gunners in khaki instead of grabbing rifles to take potshots at him they kept flying those makeshift white flags some of them waved their hands too as if he were a comrade and not a hated foe tears that had nothing to do with the slipstream blurred his vision its over he said almost in disbelief can it really be over it could it was as moss once more led his flight back toward the american lines none of the british and canadian soldiers on the ground fired at their machines like the artillerymen they waved whatever bits of white cloth they could find us soldiers in greengray were beginning to come out of their trenches and approach the enemy line no one shot at them either jonathan moss wished the racket from his aeroplanes motor didnt drown out everything else he would cheerfully have given a months pay to hear the silence on the ground where only minutes before rifles and machine guns and exploding shells had created hell on earth he wanted to find a landing strip and put down just to be able to savor that silence he needed all the discipline in him to fly away from the front where the fighting had finally ceased and back toward the orangeville aerodrome if hed suffered a sudden case of fortuitous engine trouble he had no doubt stones aeroplaneand bradleys and spragues as wellwould have come down with similar miseries when he finally did land at the aerodrome the groundcrew men knew far more about what was going on than he did yeah we got word of the armistice about half an hour after you took off a mechanic said we could have called you back if youd had a wireless telegraph in your bus canucks kept fighting up till the last minute then moss said they did their best to blow us out of the sky the first time we strafed their artillery charley sprague asked has england given up the fight then the groundcrew man shook his head wish the limeys had but they havent the armistice is for land forces in canada the royal navys still fighting us and the germans both they cant win that fightnot a prayer sprague said had his flightmate not beaten him to it moss would have said the same thing well you know that sir and i know that but the limeys havent figured it out yet the mechanic answered been a hell of a long time since they lost a war i guess they dont hardly know how to go about it weve had practice moss said how many remembrance day parades have you watched that was a rhetorical question everybody in the usa had seen his share and then some moss went on about time they threw in the sponge quebecthe city i meanis gone winnipegs gone torontos going montreals blasted to hell and weve finally broken out of that box between the st lawrence and the ottawa and the ridea where theyd penned us up since the start of the war another few months and they wouldnt have had much left to surrender now weve conquered them percy stone said what the devil are we supposed to do with them sit on em pete bradley said if they give us a hard time well shoot some of em thatll give the rest the idea oderint dum metuant sprague said moss whod had latin nodded the groundcrew men stared in blank incomprehension sprague condescended to translate let them hate so long as they fear moss thought of laura secord she hated he didnt think anything could make her fear he wondered whether her husband had come through the war in one piece if he had he had that was all there was to that if he hadntmoss did intend to make a trip back to arthur so he could find out one way or the other he suddenly smiled with the fighting done that trip looked a lot easier to arrange than it had when he took off earlier in the day rosenfeld manitoba blazed with light as the us soldiers occupying the town celebrated their victory over the forces of the british empire in canada every so often somebody would fire a springfield into the air every shot set off a fresh round of raucous cheers arthur mcgregor crouched behind a bush in the darkness just outside of town if a patrol caught him here he was in a lot of trouble he shook his head if a patrol caught him here he was a dead man he didnt usually take chances like this but he wouldnt get another chance like this either if ever he could catch the yanks with their guard down now was the time he stiffened someone was coming his way along the dirt road that led out from rosenfeld a moment later hearing how erratic the footsteps were mcgregor relaxed the drunken us soldier a little gamecock of a man staggered past him and out into the deeper darkness where night still ruled absolutely after ten or fifteen minutes another couple of soldiers meandered by mcgregor stayed concealed one of the drunks paused not far away to throw up by the side of the road then he stumbled after his friend who hadnt stopped fifteen or twenty minutes more passed out of rosenfeld came another soldier looking for fresh air or perhaps only for a quiet place to heave he was a big broadshouldered fellow for whose lurching strides the roadway did not seem wide enough as the us soldier passed the bush mcgregor got to his feet he carried an axe handle a good solid chunk of wood since hed had not a drop to drink his movements were swift and sure the soldier his face a mask of surprise was just starting to turn when the axe handle slammed into the side of his head he dropped as if shotbut a shot would have made noise and mcgregor could not chance that he dragged the soldier back to his hiding place once there he finished the job of smashing the fellows skull he might have been recognized after all then he stripped the dead man of tunic and trousers puttees and boots he took off his own clothes and put on the americans they werent a perfect fit the tunic was loose the trousers and boots tight but they would do for what he had in mind they would do he opened a wooden box hed carried from the farm and set the alarm clock inside to ring in two hours time then carefully he replaced the lid and used the axe handle to drive in four brads to keep it closed that done he stepped out into the roadway the dead soldiers brimless service cap lay there knocked off his head when mcgregor hit him the farmer picked it up and put it on a lot of soldiers in town would probably not be wearing theirs but he wanted to look as much like one of them as he could into rosenfeld he went he didnt stand out on account of his age the yanks had conscripted men who looked older than he did plenty of them were carrying this or that one was giving a piggyback ride to a laughing woman waving a whiskey bottle mcgregor knew rosenfelds two or three whores by sight she wasnt any of them the americans must have brought her in from some other town hey pal whatcha got in the box there a soldier asked mcgregor had known he might get that question so he had an answer ready beer for colonel alexander the colonel named for his son was fictitious but the soldier wouldnt know that reckon he could spare a bottle or two the fellow said mcgregor shook his head hed skin me alive the us soldier grimaced but went off instead of trying any more wheedling the americans were more submissive to their officers than mcgregor remembered being from his own days in uniform comes of having germans for teachers he thought he found a spot opposite the sheriffs station major hannebrink was using as his headquarters lights were on inside the yanks arrested their own men as well as canadians and were probably hauling in lots of them tonight that thought had hardly crossed his mind before hannebrink came out to stand on the porch and look around hands on hips in indignation at the chaos victory was creating he saw mcgregor but didnt recognize him after a couple of minutes he shook his head and went back indoors now mcgregor muttered to himself if he couldnt do it now hed never do it he staggered across the street toward the sheriffs station suddenly acting much drunker than he had before he got down on hands and knees by the wooden steps leading up to the porch where hannebrink had stood as if about to lose whatever he had in his stomach he knew he wasnt the only man in uniform doing that when he thoughthe hopedno one was paying him any special notice he shoved the box under the steps he got to his feet nobody shouted what are you doing or whats in that box or even wait a second buddyyou forgot something after that he had no trouble walking as if he were drunk he was drunk drunk with relief he got out of rosenfeld and made his way back to the bushes where hed hidden once there he put the dead americans clothes back on himan awkward joband got into his own shirt and overalls and shoes he took the mans billfold and stuck it in his pocket with luck the yanks would think one of their soldiers had robbed and murdered another he was tying his shoes when another american wobbled up the road past him several of themhe didnt know how manywere farther from rosenfeld than he was if any of them saw him he might be in trouble instead of getting up and starting along the road he crawled away over grass and dirt then got to his feet and made his way north and west across a field whatever he did he was not going to leave a trail that led straight back toward his farm when he came to a little rill he threw the americans wallet into it after taking out the banknotes he stuck those in his pocket and splashed along in the rill for a couple of hundred yards if they set dogs on his trail he wouldnt give the beasts an easy time not long after he came out he kicked a stone he lifted it and stuck the dead americans paper money under it with luck the money would never be found if the empty wallet was it would make robbery look more likely thank you sweet jesus he whispered when he found a road the wheeling stars gave him the direction he needed to head home on the hardpacked dirt hed make good time he wouldnt leave much in the way of tracks either hed been walking almost an hour and a half when a bang louder than any of the sporadic rifle shots came from the direction of rosenfeld he made a fist and thumped it against his thigh he had no way of knowing whether major hannebrink was still at his post when the bomb went off sooner or later hed find out even if the major had gone hed still hurt the americans he could console himself with thatbut he didnt care about consolation he wanted vengeance going down back roads and sneaking across the welltraveled highway east of his fields after a line of trucks rattled past he got back to the farmhouse as twilight was beginning to stain the eastern horizon he still had a full days chores ahead by the time he finished them hed wish he were dead right now he hoped someone else was maude was making coffee in the kitchen when he came inside well she asked it was as close to a direct question about what he did when he went out at night as shed ever given him he came close to giving a direct answer too it worked i wasnt there though so i dont know how well all right his wife looked him over go change your clothes and bring the ones you have on downstairs ill wash them set your shoes by the stove first he bent down and felt of them they were still damp good idea he said he sighed as he pulled off the shoes feet are tired ill bet they are maude said go on now ill have coffee and eggs waiting when you come down again by the time hed changed and splashed water from the pitcher on the chest of drawers onto his face mary and julia were up too julia sliced bread for him to go with the fried eggs maude set out you look tired pa she said which was not a question at all but at the same time was everythings all right he replied an answer that said nothing and at the same time quite a lot marys face glowed does that mean you she began and then abruptly stopped as if she did not want to hear what it meant arthur mcgregor only shrugged with food and coffee in front of him he didnt want to think for a while he went out to work in the fields when he looked back toward the farmhouse he saw the overalls and shirt and socks and drawers hed worn the night before out flapping on the line the breeze was strong they would dry quickly in the middle of the afternoon a greengray ford parked between the farmhouse and the barn mcgregor didnt notice it till the soldiers who got out fired a couple of shots in the air that brought him in at a shambling trot that told him just how worn he was three privates in greengray surrounded a tall skinny us captain mcgregor had never seen before without preamble the officer snapped where were you last night here at home in bed he answered he felt drunk with joy now and had to work hard to make sure it didnt show on his face if hed failed major hannebrink would have been the one to bark questions at him but sending sullen looks toward the occupiers wasnt hard not even a little why what are you going to try and blame on me this time somebody set off a bomb in rosenfeld the captain said a lot of good men died somebodys set off a lot of bombs in this part of the country since your son received military justice a fair number of hostages have died on account of them too you yanks have murdered a lot of people in this part of the country besides my sonincluding those hostages mcgregor returned i dont love you but i havent bombed you major hannebrink turned this place upside down trying to show different but he couldnt show what wasnt there major hannebrink is dead the us captain told him ill not shed a tear mcgregor said again he had to remind himself not to exult i wish i had settled him but i didnt that lie came easy hed had lots of practice using it his conscience which had once sickened at any untruth troubled him not at all shall we search the house and barn again captain fielding one of the privates asked mcgregor waited for the tall officer to say yes if the yanks found what hed hidden under the old wagon wheel he could die content now but fielding shook his head no evidence he said nothing but hannebrinks suspicions and i cant see that he had anything more than suspicions to go on you keep your nose clean mcgregor and you can help us put this country back together again he gestured to his men they and he got into the ford and drove away mcgregor stared after them hed won his battle and cherished that the man whod ordered his son executed was dead himself but the americans had won the war and still aimed to reshape canada to suit themselves if he was going to keep on resisting he had to get ready for the long haul grimly he resolved to do just that nellie semphroch came downstairs to start another day at the coffeehouse she smiled at the plateglass windows replacing the boards that had fronted on the street once word got around that president roosevelt had given her and edna medals people started going out of their way to do them favors as people had gone out of their way to cut them when theyd thought them collaborators across the street hal jacobs cobblers shop still presented boards to the world nellie didnt think that was fair jacobs had done much more than she had to hurt the rebels inside washington if roosevelt had given him a medal nellie didnt know about it maybe he was naturally modest maybe being selfeffacing went into making a good spy whatever the reason jacobs had let no one know hed done anything out of the ordinary during the war nellie unlocked the door and turned the sign in the window so it read open as she was doing that jacobs opened his own door and came out onto the sidewalk seeing nellie through the window he waved to her a little reluctantly she waved back she knew how much she owed him the coffeehouse never would have made a go of it let alone flourished without his help but very likely she never would have had to set eyes on bill reach again if not for his dealings with hal jacobs as far as she was concerned that went a long way toward canceling her debt edna came downstairs morning ma she called as she started making the days first coffee morning nellie answered edna had been subdued since roosevelt put the medal she did not deserve around her neck maybe that was because she realized she didnt deserve it and appreciated the contribution her mother had made toward a us victory more likely nellie judged edna missed the handsome young confederate officers whod filled the coffeehouse for most of three years that might not have been charitable but nellie reckoned it close to the mark a us officer came in he was neither handsome nor young when he ordered a friedegg sandwich and a mug of coffee though nellie looked on him with benevolent eyes when he left a quarter for a tip on top of his tab she reckoned him a paragon among men another officer came in a few minutes later all he wanted was coffee nellie served him with the best smile she could muster business was better than it had been when people shunned edna and her but not what it had been when the confederates held washington she didnt suppose it would ever be that good again and was glad shed managed to save some of what she made hal jacobs walked into the coffeehouse as that second officer was leaving they did a little dance in the doorway to keep from bumping into each other jacobs asked for a cup of coffee too when he set a nickel on the table nellie shoved it back at him your moneys no good here hal she said you ought to know that by now this is foolishness jacobs said you can use this no matter where it comes from like you cant nellie answered i know how many people go in and out of your place every day its a wonder youve got any money to spend at all if you ask me but even if you had plenty i wouldnt take it from you you are more generous than i deserve the shoemaker said i was happy to help you and help our country at the same time well you did and now im going to help you too nellie said from behind the counter edna gave her a look that meant we can use every nickel we get she ignored her daughter as edna was in the habit of ignoring her jacobs said i know how you can help me nellie hows that nellie asked cautiously she thought she knew what kind of thing the shoemaker would say sooner or later every man in the world said that kind of thing edna leaned forward so as not to miss a word by the leer on her face she thought she knew what kind of thing the shoemaker would say too and by that leer she wouldnt let her mother forget it after he said it either then to nellies surprise hal jacobs slipped out of the chair in which he was sitting to her even greater surprise he went down on one knee before her and took her hands in his before she could pull away nellie will you please marry me and make me a happy man for all the rest of my days he asked nellies face heated she was sure her cheeks had to be red as raw meat she glanced over at edna whose jaw had fallen and whose eyes were wide and staring whatever else her daughter might do edna wouldnt be able to tease her about getting a lewd proposition shed been ready to deal withto deal forcefully witha proposition a proposal was something else again a man who wanted her enough to ask to marry her without even trying to sample the merchandise first shed never knownindeed never imaginedsuch a thing her experience had always been that men were a lot longer on sampling than on proposing and so after a silence that stretched longer than it should have she could only stammer mr jacobs ii dont know what to say this is so sudden not when we have worked side by side for so long jacobs said still on his knees i know what i would like i can only hope and pray you would like it too before nellie could find any way to respond to that edna hissed say yes ma where are you going to do better unlike a good many from her daughter that was a good question nellie looked down at hal jacobs he wasnt too young and he wasnt too handsome but she knew he had a good heart shed never tried living with a man with a good heart maybe it would make a difference and maybe on their wedding night he would show his heart wasnt so good after all she had seen how men who outwardly were pillars of respectability could turn into animals brutes when they found themselves alone with a woman if she said yes and jacobs turned out to be that kind of man what would she do what could she do then maybe one fine morning he would wake up dead in as inconspicuous a manner as she could arrange even if he wasnt an animal did she want him in her bed no man had been to bed with her in a lot of years and she hadnt felt that to be a lack on the contrary if anything but when hed kissed her the year before back in his shop shed been glad to have the kissand astonished that she was glad what exactly did that mean did she want to take a chance and find out if she didnt what would she do stay the way she was and try to keep an eye on edna till her daughter found another young man and moved away knowing edna that might happen in a matter of weeks maybe even days what then spend the rest of her life alone and getting more sour by the day that didnt sound like such a good bargain either she looked down at hal jacobs again she wished hed never asked her by asking her he was making her think about things she would sooner have ignored no matter what she did now no matter what she said now it would irrevocably change her life she hated having to make choices that big and hated having to do it on the spur of the moment even more or perhaps it wasnt exactly on the spur of the moment edna said come on mayouve got to tell the poor man something with a sigh nellie realized her daughter was right with another sigh a longer and deeper one she said ill marry you hal thank you for asking me she wondered how much she would regret that more or less than saying no one way or the other shed find out edna let out a cheer that sounded almost like the yells with which confederate soldiers went into battle an enormous smile spread over hal jacobs face he squeezed her hands and said oh nellie thank you so much you have made me the happiest man in the world dont be silly edna said she came out to the front of the coffeehouse as jacobs was getting to his feet kissing him on the cheek she went on teddy roosevelts got to be the happiest man in the world now that the rebs have quit but if you want to say youre running second thats all right jacobs laughed edna laughed after a moment nellie laughed too she felt giddy and foolish as if shed been drinking whiskey not coffee was that happiness or was it just surprise at what shed gone and done for the life of her she couldnt tell a customer came in then distracting her he wasnt a military man and he wasnt one of the locals nellie knew either he wore a black suit a black cravat and a black homburg and carried a black leather briefcase ham and eggs and coffee he said like a confederate plantation owner giving orders to his house niggers eggs over medium not too hard yes sir nellie said some of the rebel officers whod frequented the coffeehouse had been that peremptory too would you like your coffee now or with the ham and eggs and would you like toast to go with that like the menu says an extra ten cents coffee now no toast had i wanted it i should have requested it the newcomer looked around this is one of the few places ive seen since coming here that we wont have to tear down and start over from the ground up a light went on in nellies head youre from she began philadelphia the newcomer broke in of course you wouldnt think id live in washington would you we manage nellie said the philadelphialawyersniffed people from the de facto capital of the united states were in the habit of sneering at those from the legal capital nellie got him his coffee as edna started the ham and eggs his money would spend as well as anyone elses i am going back to my work dear nellie jacobs said thank you again we will talk more of these arrangements as soon as we can he blew her a kiss as he went out the door over the pleasant hiss and crackle of frying food edna spoke to the man from philadelphia mr jacobs there just asked my ma to marry him and she said yes how nice the fellow said given the way the tax laws are it will likely prove an advantageous move for both of them nellie had worried about a lot of things before saying yes taxes werent one of them maybe she didnt need the coldblooded philadelphians money so badly after all maybe on the other hand he was tryingcoldbloodedlyto do her a favor edna gave her the plate of ham and eggs and she set it in front of the man who was helping decide how to restore or whether to restore washington she didnt know a whole lot about taxes and how they worked maybe she should ask him for more good advice about one thing she needed no advice whatever hal jacobs she resolved would never ever learn how bill reach had died lieutenant crowder was lecturing the crew of the depthcharge projector which meant he was also lecturing george enos who standing nearby at the onepounder could hardly escape the officers words we must maintain our vigilance crowder declared as if someone had suggested that the whole crew of the uss ericsson should lie down and go to sleep the confederate states may be out of the fight but the royal navy is still in it carl sturtevants sigh was visible but not audible out of the side of his mouth he muttered good thing he gives us the news aint it enos georges nod was half amused half annoyed crowder didnt notice when he was talking he didnt notice anything but the sound of his own voice and we must remain alert against submersibles from the cs navy even now he said some of them may have defective wireless gear and so be ignorant that their government has at last given up its hopeless fight and others may claim ignorance and seek to strike one last blow against the united states in spite of the armistice now in force it was enosturn to roll his eyes sturtevants answering snort was almost as quiet as his sigh had been as far as george was concerned the lieutenant hadnt a clue about how to keep the men wary talking about the royal navy was a decent idea because england was still in the war talking about imaginary confederates who wouldnt surrender though made no sense at all and if the sailors decided crowder didnt make sense about one thing they were apt to decide he didnt make sense about anything and so not keep an eye peeled for the limeys on second thought george decided it didnt matter so much most of the depthcharge projector crew from everything he could see had already concluded lieutenant crowder didnt make sense about anything theyd keep an eye on the atlantic anyhow for the sake of their own skins after a while the allclear sounded crowder hurried away from the depthcharge projector as if he had a beautiful blonde waiting under the covers back in his cabin thinking about a beautiful blonde made george think about sylvia christ i want to go home he said hearing the longing in this voice carl sturtevant burst out laughing you want to kick your wifes feet out from under her is what you want what the devils wrong with that enos said its been a hell of a long time some ships you could cornhole some pretty sailor if you really felt the lack sturtevant said the ericsson s pretty good about that thoughpretty careful to make sure it doesnt happen i mean i should hope so george said i dont want a pretty sailor hell i dont think there is such a thing as a pretty sailor i want to go to bed with my wife i wouldnt mind the petty officer stopped abruptly hed probably been about to say something like i wouldnt mind going to bed with your wife either he was smart not to have said that giving a sailor of higher rank a fat lip would have got george in a lot of trouble but he would have done it without hesitation after a couple of seconds sturtevant tried again i wouldnt mind going to bed with anything female like you said its been a hell of a long time yeah i know what you mean enos remembered that day along the cumberland when hed been about to go to bed with a colored whore for no better reason than that he was half drunk and more than half bored as hed been going from the ramshackle saloon to the even more ramshackle crib next to it the confederates had blown his river monitor out of the water if hed been aboard the punishment odds were he wouldnt be breathing now he drew a mop and bucket and started swabbing a stretch of deck by now he understood perfectly the pace he had to use to keep passing petty officers happy once when he fell below that pace one of those worthies barked at him even then he had an answer ready sorry chief i guess i was paying too much attention to the ocean out there yeah well pay attention to what youre supposed to be doing the veteran sailor growled aye aye george said but he noted that as the petty officer paraded down the deck he made a point of peering out into the atlantic every few paces what was he doing if not trying to spot a periscope the limeys were still struggling to get freighters from argentina across the ocean and their submersibles still prowled lieutenant crowder had been dead right about that theyd have to quit sooner or later but they hadnt done it yet that evening attacking corned beef and sauerkraut the sailors hashed over what theyd do when the war ended theyd done that a good many times before but the talk had a different feel to it now in the midst of the grapple with the enemy theyd just been blueskying it and theyd known as much now when the war would end in daysweeks at the mostlife after it seemed much more real and planning for it much more urgent george was one of the lucky ones he had no doubts as soon as they let me out of the navy i find me a fishing boat and go back to sea he said only thing ill have to worry about is hitting a drifting mine otherwise thingsll be just like they were before the war for me before the war somebody down the table echoed jesus i cant hardly remember there ever was such a time christ what a load of horse manure dave somebody else said you were here on the ericsson same as me dave was unabashed give me a break smitty all we were doing here before the war was getting ready to fight the damn thing wasnt hardly different than what were doing now except nobody was trying to kill us back then nobody but the chiefs anyways smitty said which got a laugh he went on we stay in the navy what the hell you think well be doing getting ready to fight the next war thats what well whats a navy for dave returned you better be ready to fight if you get into a war otherwise you lose our dads and grandpas had their noses rubbed in that one look at the clever fellow smitty said he learned about remembrance day in school give him a hand boys aint he smart ahh shut up dave said since he was half again as big as smitty the other sailor did changing the subject looked like a good idea george said wonder how long itll be till the next war depends dave it seemed had opinions about everything if we forget what we have an army and navy for probably wont be long at all thats what we did after the war of secession and jesus did we pay for it we do that half of usll be on the beach smitty said which turned things back toward what the sailors would do after the war then somebody said no democrat would ever be that stupid wed have to elect debs or whoever the socialists put up three years from now that touched off a political argument the socialist minority loudly insisting they were americans as good as any others and better than a lot of people i can think of one of them added the first thing some of you want to do after the war ends is put the workers and farmers into another one george asked his question again all right louie how long do you think weve got till the next one if we keep electing democrats fifteen yearstwenty years tops the socialist answered we finally get wise and put in some people who understand what the class structure and international solidarity really mean maybe it wont happen at all maybe thisll be the last war there ever was yeah and maybe the popes gonna run off with my sister too dave said i tell you louie i aint holding my breath on either one he got a bigger laugh than smitty had a couple of minutes before and preened on account of it fifteen years twenty years tops nobody said peace could last longer than that well louie had but even he didnt sound as if he believed it no socialist had ever even come very close to getting elected president george didnt see any reason for that to change soon if war came when people thought it would his son would get dragged into it he didnt like that for beans hell if war came again in fifteen or twenty years he might get dragged into it too he wouldnt be an old man he liked that even less wasnt once enough he didnt have any duty after supper so he wrote a letter to sylvia if the ericsson went into port before a supply ship met her he was liable to get into boston before the letter did but that would have to mean england was quitting right away which didnt look likely i sure will be glad to sleep in a bed that doesnt have one on top of it and another one underneath he wrote if they packed us in oil we might be sardines some of that was exaggeration for dramatic effect arrangements aboard a fishing boat were just as cramped and those aboard the river monitor on which hed served had been even more crowded however i sure will be glad to sleep in a bed that has you in it one of the officers would have to censor the letter before it could leave the destroyer most times george didnt worry about that now he wondered if the fellow whoever he was would start breathing a little faster if he read something like that after a moment george laughed at himself the ericsson had a war complement of better than men if the censor hadnt seen anything hotter than what hed just written he didnt know anything about horny sailors imaginations he finished the letter then read it over he didnt know about the censor but he was breathing faster by the time he finished to wake up in a soft bed with his wife beside himhe couldnt think of anything better than that he addressed an envelope and put the letter inside but didnt seal the flap the censor would take care of that george carried the letter to a collection box and put it in hey enos you want to get into a card game the socialistlouiecalled george shook his head go suck in some single guy i got a wife and two kids at home gotta save my money you might win louie said yeah i might enos allowed but i usually dont and thats why i dont get into card games much any more he went back to the bunkroom he didnt usually hit the sack till lightsout but tonight he stripped to his skivvies and lay down a fan was doing its best to keep the warm muggy air moving its best wasnt very good george always woke covered in sweat but the stuffiness helped him fall asleep fast he yawned a couple of times and dozed off smiling as he thought of waking up in bed with sylvia thegreatwar breakthroughs from the conning tower of the bonefish roger kimball stared gloomily out into the blackness of night on the tropical atlantic a million stars hung overhead the moons lantern floated low in the east and spilled a long track of pale yellow light across the dark water it was as beautiful a seascape as god ever made he was blind to the beauty that afternoon the wireless telegraph had picked up orders directing all confederate submersibles to return to their home ports as the confederate states had been forced to seek an armistice from the united states ever so reluctantly hed shaped course for habana hed wondered how the crew would take the news most of the sailors had taken it the same way he had theyd been furious and heartsick at the same time god damn it skipper we didnt lose the war ben coulter had cried it was those stupid army bastards who went and lost it nobody ever licked us why do we have to go and quit several other men had shouted profane agreement since kimball felt like that too hed had trouble answering tom brearley had done it for him if the damnyankees lick us on land we have to give in otherwise where do we go home i dont give a fuck coulter had answered aint had a home but for my boat the past twenty years anyways kimball chuckled remembering the startled expression on his execs face as if coulter had hit him in the side of the head with a sack full of wet sand the captain of the bonefish agreed with the petty officer for that matter he still wasnt sure whether or not the arkansas farm on which hed grown up remained in cs hands he hadnt heard from his mother in a long time and whether it did or not he didnt want to go back the navy was his life these dayshe hoped brearley joined him atop the conning tower the exec stayed silent for several minutes accurately guessing kimball did not care for conversation but brearley as happened sometimes didnt keep his mouth shut long enough sir once we get to port what are they going to do with us dont know kimball said shortly hoping the exec would take the hint he didnt the damnyankees are liable to make us cut way back on submarines weve hurt em bad they wont want to give us the chance to do it again worry about that if it happens but kimball had already started worrying about it hed been worrying for weeks even since word of the first confederate peace feelers came to his ears he was liable to end up on the beach not because of what he wanted but because of what the united states decreed he enjoyed that idea about as much as the idea of a kick in the balls a fragment of a curse floated up through the open hatch it we fought the bastards to a draw out here hell aint close to fair we have too brearley broke into it as hed broken into kimballs silence the yankees could cripple our navy for years they could even shut up now kimball spoke in a flat harsh tone the voice of command brearley stared his face a white oval in the moonlight he opened his moutha dark circle in the white oval shut up damn you kimball snapped he pointed off toward the east where a ship was suddenly visible against the moons track he raised binoculars to his eyes the ship leaped closer how close estimating range at night was as tricky a thing as a submersible skipper could do but he didnt think it was more than a couple of miles and that silhouette seen against sky and moonlit ocean was all too familiar take it easy sir brearley said as kimball stared hungrily toward the ship that steamed along unaware he was anyplace close by the wars over for us shut up kimball said again now almost absently you know what ship that is tom its that fucking destroyer thats given us nothing but trouble since she came out here is it brearley said thats too bad sir shame we didnt spy her last night instead of now kimball went on as if the exec hadnt spoken and do you know what else im going to sink the son of a bitch my god sir brearley burst out you cant do that if anybody ever found out theyd hang you theyd hang all of us no doubt about it kimball agreed but englands still in the war the damnyankeesll blame it on a limey boatas long as we can keep our mouths shut to hell with me if im going home with my tail between my legs im going to hit em one more lick and im going to make it the best one i know how you cant sir brearley repeated go below mr brearley kimball said i can and i goddamn well will if you dont like it you dont have to play you can lay on your bunk and suck your thumb for all i care he leaned close to the younger man and if you ever breathe one word of this to anybody i dont know whatll happen to me but youre a dead man you wont die pretty either have you got that yes sir brearley whispered miserably then go below kimball followed the executive officer down into the stinking steel tube that was the bonefish s fighting and living quarters brearley headed toward the stern he really didnt want any part in what kimball was about to do kimball didnt care he was going to do it anyway in conversational tones he told the rest of the crew boys weve got the uss ericsson a couple miles off to starboard load fish into tubes number one and two and open the watertight doors i aim to put a couple right in the whores engine room had the sailors hesitated they might have made kimball think twice too but they didnt after brief incredulous silence they let loose with yells and howls so loud kimball half feared the yankees on the destroyer would be able to hear them he made frantic shushing noises discipline returned quickly discipline and a fierce eagerness for the kill much like his own he took the helm himself sending a sailor up to the conning tower to watch the destroyer while he made his attack approach give me fifteen knots he said theyre just lollygagging along i want to get out in front of them and double back for the firing run were in the dark quarter of the sea ben coulter remarked as much to himself as to kimball he grunted in satisfaction theyll never spot us theyd damned well better not kimball answered to which the petty officer nodded kimball went on well make the firing run coming in at a steep angle too so they wont pick up the reflection of the moon from the paint on the conning tower and well be going in with the wind at our back pushing the waves along to help hide our wake in the water you dont want to make the angle too steep though skipper coulter said easy to think its smaller than it is and to miss with your fish on account of it dont want that not now we dont not hardly kimball agreed with a dry chuckle from the bow a sailor waved to let him know the torpedoes were loaded into the forward tubes he waved back wishing he could be two places at the same time he wanted to be at the helm and up on the conning tower both he peered through the periscope which at night was like making love wearing a rubber for it took away a lot of the intimacy he wanted despite that annoyance everything went smooth as a training run in the gulf of mexico outside mobile bay the destroyer which could have left him far behind kept lazing through the sea he pulled ahead of the us ship and swung the bonefish into the tight turn for the firing run bring her down to five knots he ordered not wishing to draw attention to the boat as he closed in like any submarine skipper he would have made a hell of a pool player for he was always figuring angles here though players and balls and even the surface of the table were in constant motion he took his eyes away from the periscope every so often to check the compass for the bonefish s true course gauging things by eye didnt work at nighttoo easy to be wrong on both range and angle he swung the submersibles course a couple of degrees more toward the southeast ben coulter had been right if he was going to do this he couldnt afford to miss the lookout on the conning tower called softly down the hatch sir i reckon were inside half a mile of that yankee bastard thanks davis kimball called back hed just made the same calculation having the lookout confirm the range made him feel good inside six hundred yardsinside five hundredinside four hundredfire one he shouted if he couldnt hit the ericsson now he never would clangs and hisses and the rush of water into the emptied tube announced the torpedo was on its way even in moonlight kimball had no trouble making out the white track of air bubbles the fish left behind it maybe somebody on the destroyers deck also spotted it if he did though he was too slow to do anything about it less than half a minute after the bonefish launched it the torpedo slammed into the us warship just forward of amidships hit kimball screamed and the sailors howled out rebel yells the ericsson staggered on her course like a poleaxed steer water foamed as it poured into the hole better than two hundred pounds of guncotton had blown in her flank already she was listing to port and appreciably lower in the water than she had been a moment before up on the conning tower davis the lookout whooped for joy weuns is goin home but not them yankees taking his time now kimball lined up the second shot with painstaking precision fire two he shouted and the torpedo leaped away it broke the destroyers back and almost tore the stricken ship in two she went to the bottom hardly more than a minute later kimball scanned the sea for boats spotting none he grunted in satisfaction resume our course for habana he said and stepped away from the periscope weve done our job here ben coulter spoke earnestly to the sailors remember boys this aint one where you get drunk and brag on it in a saloon you do that theyre liable to put a rope around your neck hell theyre liable to put a rope around all our necks you do want to bear that in mind kimball agreed he wished he could tell anne colleton if she ever heard hed gone right on killing yankees even after the armistice shed probably drag him down and rape him on the spot warmth flowed to his crotch as he thought about that but then slowly regretfully he shook his head he didnt think with his crotch or hoped he didnt if she found out what hed done here it would give her more of a hold on him than he ever wanted anyone to get hed have to keep quiet the log would have to keep quiet too kimball went back to an earlier attack and neatly changed a to a on the writeup of the run that would make the number of torpedoes listed as expended on this cruise match the number hed actually launched he strode toward the stern sure enough tom brearley sat on his bunk looking glum and furious he glared up at kimball how does it feel to be a war criminalsir he made the title into one of scorn kimball gravely considered you know what tom it feels pretty damn fine sylvia enos threw a nickel in the trolleycare fare box for herself and another one for george jr next year shed have to spend a nickel for mary jane too she sighed even though she was getting her husbands allotment along with her salary at the shoe factory she wasnt rich not anywhere close nickels mattered she sighed again seeing she and her children had nowhere to sit during the run from mrs dooleys to her own apartment building she clung to the overhead rail george jr and mary jane clung to her as the trolley squealed to a stop at the corner closest to her building she sighed yet again who could say how long shed keep the job at the shoe factory with soldiers coming home from the war theyd start going back to what theyd done before women would get crowded out it hadnt happened yet but she could see it coming she wondered when the navy would let george loose hed have no trouble getting a spot on a fishing boat operating out of t wharf as long as he was home with her she wouldnt have toshe didnt think shed have toworry about his chasing after other women they could try getting back to the way things had been before the war too maybe shed have another baby mary jane would be heading to kindergarten next year if sylvia didnt get pregnant right away maybe she could look for parttime work then extra cash never hurt anybody she paused in the front hall of the apartment building to pick up her mail it was unexciting a couple of patentmedicine circulars a flyer announcing a fishermens benevolent league picnic sunday after next and a letter to the woman next door that the postman had put in her box by mistake she set the last one on top of the bank of mailboxes for her neighbor to spot or for the mailman to put in its proper place and then took the children upstairs whats for supper george jr demanded im starved pork chops and string beans sylvia said theyll take a little while to cook but i dont think youll starve before theyre ready why dont you play nicely with your sister till then why dont you ask for the moon sylvia while youre at it rebellion came not from george jr but from mary jane i hate string beans she said i want fried potatoes sylvia swatted her on the bottom youre going to eat string beans tonight anyhow she answered if you dont feel like eating string beans you can go to bed right now without any supper mary jane stuck out her tongue and crossed her eyes sylvia swatted her again harder this time sometimes she practically needed to hit her daughter over the head with a brick to get her to behave now though mary jane seemed to get the idea that shed pushed things too far she looked so angelic any real angel who saw her would have been extremely suspicious sylvia laughed and shook her head and started cooking shed just set supper on the table and was cutting mary janes pork chops into bitesized pieces when someone knocked on the door she muttered something she hoped the children didnt catch then went to see which neighbor had chosen exactly the wrong moment to want to borrow salt or molasses or a dollar and a half but the youth standing there wasnt a neighbor he wore a green uniform darker than that of the us army his brass buttons read wu sylvia enos he asked when sylvia nodded he thrust a pale yellow envelope at her telegram maam he hurried away before she could say anything scratching her headdelivery boys usually hung around to collect a tipshe opened the envelope then she understood the navy department she whispered and ice congealed around her heart deeply regret to inform you read the characterless letters that your husband george enos was among the crew aboard the uss ericsson which was sunk last night by an enemy submersible despite diligent search no trace of survivors has been found or is expected he must be pre sumed dead the united states are grateful for his valiant service in the cause of remembrance and victory the printed signature was that of josephus daniels secretary of the navy your pork chops are getting cold ma george jr called from the table if you dont eat your green beans you have to go to bed right now mary jane added gleefully sylvia kept staring at the words of the telegram hoping praying they would twist into some different shape some different meaning twice now when george had been captured by a confederate commerce raider and when hed survived the sinking of the punishment shed feared the worst this wasnt like those times she didnt fear the worst now she knew it she felt it in her bones what am i going to do she said though no one could answer what am i going to do without george im right here ma her son said i didnt go nowhere your pork chops are still getting cold theyre no good if they get cold you always say that ma you do she turned back to the table she didnt realize tears had started running down her face till mary jane asked why are you crying ma dont cry ma george jr added whats wrong well fix it whatever it is they depended on her she had to be strong because they couldnt do it for themselves and she had to tell them the truth they needed to know she swiped her sleeve over her eyes then she held up the telegram this says she had to pause and gulp before she could go on this says your fatherit says your fathers ship got sunk and he isntisnt alive any more he isnt coming home any more not ever again they took it better than she had imagined possible mary jane she realized hardly remembered george shed been very little when he went into the navy and hed come home but seldom since how could she miss what she hadnt truly known george jr understood better though he plainly didnt want to hesdead ma he asked his voice trembling like harrys father at school the one the dirty canucks shot thats right sylvia said thatssort of what happened a noise in the hallway behind her made her turn there stood brigid coneval and several of her other neighbors somehow almost as if by magic everyone knew when a western union messenger brought bad news had anyone doubted the news was bad the look on sylvias face would have told the tale oh you poor darling said mrs coneval who if anyone knew what sylvia was feeling at the moment you poor darling what a black shame it is with the war so near won and all people crowded round her holding her and telling her they would do what they could to help someone pressed a coin into her hand she thought it was a quarter when she looked at it through tearblurred eyes she discovered it was a gold eagle she stared in astonishment at the tendollar goldpiece who did this she demanded its too much take it back no one said a word no one made any move to claim the coin god bless you whoever you are sylvia said she started crying again mary jane said youre going to have to go to bed without any supper because you arent eating your pork chops small things mattered to her she didnt understand the difference between what was small and what was not sylvia wished she didnt understand that difference either not understanding it would have made life much simpler and much easierfor a little while life wasnt going to be easy not ever again life probably wouldnt be comfortable not ever again if she lost her job at the shoe factory shed have to find another one and right away if she didnt find another one right away her children would go hungry and so would she even if she did money was going to be tight from now on what could she do if she lost the factory job she had no idea she couldnt think her wits felt stunned strangled she knew she had to use them but they didnt want to work mourning clothes she exclaimed suddenly out of the blue i have to fix up some mourning clothes brigid coneval put an arm around her shoulder and steered her back to the sofa in the front room when the irishwoman pushed her down her legs gave way and she sat you wait right here dont move now dont even twitch back in a flash ill be she hurried out of the apartment sylvia didnt move she didnt think she could move george jr and mary jane seeing their mother upset picked their way through the crowd of neighbors and crawled up into her lap she did manage to put her arms around them out of my way now move aside brigid coneval spoke with as much imperious command as general custer or some other famous war hero might have used she thrust a tumbler of whiskey at sylvia drink it off and be quick about it i dont want it sylvia said drink it mrs coneval insisted he was a good man your george sure and he was hardly ever a cross word from him did i hear but hes gone darling you may as well drink what could you do thats better pray she rolled her eyes drink without much willwithout much anythingof her own sylvia took the glass and gulped down what it held choking a little as she did as far as she could tell it didnt do anything her head was already spinning what am i going to do without george she asked again as if one of her neighbors might know no one answered as mrs coneval had people kept praising her husband he would have been a happier man had they said all those nice things about him while he was there to hear them then sylvia started to cry again as another thought struck through the walls of grief and liquor he wont even have a funeral she said he would have hated that fishermen dreaded being lost at sea they ate of its creatures and did not want those creatures turning the tables after a while even in the midst of disaster routine reasserted itself sylvia had to put the children to bed after she did that she went to put the pork chops she hadnt been able to eat into the icebox she discovered a couple of silver dollars and a tiny gold dollar on the kitchen table along with some smaller coins when she opened the icebox she found a dressed chicken in there she had not bought and also a package wrapped in butcher paper that might have been sausage or fish thank you she said thank she couldnt go on brigid coneval put her to bed much as shed taken care of george jr and mary jane she lay awake and stared and stared at the ceiling what will i do she thought endlessly uselessly what will i do when his name was called jefferson pinkard marched up to a pair of officers his tredegar on his shoulder pinkard jefferson davis he said and then his pay number he tossed the rifle down on a growing pile of weapons pinkard jefferson davis echoed a confederate captain from divisional headquarters he had a list of the soldiers in jeffs regiment after lining through his name he turned to the other officer and spoke in formal tones jefferson davis pinkard has turned in his rifle jefferson davis pinkard has turned in his rifle the other officer agreed he was also a captain but wore a uniform of greengray not butternut he lined through pinkards name on his copy of the list yankee officers freely crossed the line between their positions and those of the csa these days confederate soldiers had to obey them as they obeyed their own officers confederate officers even those of higher rank had to obey them too the yanks didnt sneer or gloat but they didnt take any nonsense either one by one in alphabetical order the soldiers of his regiment surrendered their weapons hipolito rodriguez came only a few men after pinkard once hed thrown his rifle onto the stack he came over and stood by the big steelworker finito he said that was close enough to finished for jeff to understand it yeah its done he said its done and we got licked who the hell would have reckoned on that when we started out rodriguez shrugged asi es la vida he said and then translated that such is life now they must send us to our homes once more bully pinkard said in a hollow voice he hated the west texas prairie no doubt about that but he dreaded going back to birmingham too what had emily been doing since the leave when hed walked in at just the wrong moment even if she hadnt been doing anything since then which knowing her he found less likely than he would have wanted could he live with her once he did get home orthe other side of the same coincould he live without her and how was he supposed to go on living next door to bedford cunningham that was a smaller question but not a small one theyd been best friends and foundry partners for years but bedford wouldnt be going back to the sloss works not shy an arm he wouldnt and how could you be friends with a man when youd found your wife naked on her knees in front of him hip rodriguez sighed i hope everything goes good for you amigo thanks jeff said same to you here unlike talk about going home he could speak freely i never knew any sonorans before you youre a good fellow you ever get tired of trying to scratch out a living down where youre at you bring your family on up to alabama plenty of good farm country there youd live high on the hog thanks amigo but no thanks rodriguezs smile was sweet and sad i want to go home i want to talk espanol to see my friends and family and in sonora i am a man in alabama i am a damn greaser he tapped a brown hand with a brown finger to remind pinkard of what he meant in the trenches jeff had long since stopped worrying about their being of different colors hip was right though it would matter in alabama jeff put the best face on it he could its not like you was a nigger too close rodriguez said positively and odds were he was right you go to your home and i go to my home and maybe god lets us both be happy the last tredegar thudded onto the pile the cs captain addressed his us counterpart all weapons for this unit are now accounted for all rifles for this unit are now accounted for the us officer answered sharply this regiment still has two machine guns outstanding destroyed in combat the confederate captain said blandly cant give you what we havent got pinkard wouldnt have believed that from a beaten foe and neither did the yankee youre holding out on us he growled his sharp quick accent made him sound suspicious even when he wasnt when he wasthats a violation of the terms of the armistice and youll be sorry for it weapons are to be turned over i cant give you what we havent got the cs captain repeated he waved to jeff pinkard and his companions this here is an infantry company not a machinegun outfit theyve turned in their weapons why dont you let them go and take the other up with division hq for a long moment jeff thought the us officer would hold them up out of sheer cussedness if for no other reason in the end though he said all right these bastards can go but i am going to take it up with your superiors captain and heads will roll yours among em unless i miss my guess his eyes measured the confederate for a coffin what passed between the two captains afterwards pinkard never learned his company was marched away to the paymaster who gave each man what he was owedin banknotes not specie he also gave a word of advice dont waste your time before you spend it on account of it wont be worth as much tomorrow as it is today how come jeff asked governments gonna have a devil of a time payin its bills especially in gold the paymaster answered yankeesll soak us till our eyes popyou wait and see if im wrong and everybodys gonna wanna buy things and there wont be a hell of a lot of things to buy you put that all in the pot and cook it and you get prices going straight through the roof like i say wait and see peoplell be wiping their asses with dollar banknotes cause they wont be good for anything else with that cheery prediction ringing in his ears pinkard marched with the men with whom hed been through so much toward the nearest railhead it was he realized the last time he would ever march with them he tried to sort out how he felt about that he wouldnt miss marching or the trenches or the horror that went with war the men though and the comradeshipthose he would miss he wondered if he would ever know their like back in birmingham he kicked at the dirt hed thought he had that kind of comradeship with bedford cunningham and what was left there dust and ashes nothing more after bedford and emily had let him down could he ever trust anybody again he wasnt going to hold his breath he did hold his breath when the company got to the train almost all the cars were boxcars stenciled with the words men horses theyd held a lot of horses lately the stink made that plain he clambered up into a car and made himself as comfortable as he could on nonetoofresh straw after all the cars were filled the train headed east by the way the engine coughed and wheezed it like the boxcars was what remained after all the better rolling stock had been used in more important places nobody bothered feeding the soldiers or giving them water pinkard emptied his canteen and ate the tortillas and the chunk of sausage he had with him after that was gone he got hungrier and hungrier and thirstier and thirstier till some time in the middle of the night the train pulled into fort worth hed fallen into an uneasy unpleasant doze by then and woke with a start at the station men shouted through megaphones check the signboards find the train heading toward your hometown and get aboard men in uniform travel free this week only amid handclasps and goodluck wishes and promises to keep in touch the company broke apart jeff found a signboard and discovered to his surprise that a train that would stop in birmingham was leaving early in the morning he found the right platform after a couple of false starts and settled down to wait he hadnt been there more than a couple of minutes before a woman came up to him and snapped if you men hadnt been a pack of yellow cowards you would have whipped those damnyankees she stomped off before he could answer it was he decided a good thing hed had to turn in his tredegar otherwise he might have answered her with a bullet had he had the rifle he might have shot eight or ten people mostly women by the time his train pulled up to the station everyone who spoke to him seemed to think he was personally responsible for losing the war he boarded a secondclass passenger car with nothing but relief it didnt end there though about half the people on the car were eastbound soldiers like him the civilians who filled the other half of the seats showered them with abuse and the abuse got worse the farther east the train went every time a soldier got off and a civilian took his place the abuse got worse the farther from the front the train went the more convinced people were that the war should have been won and won in short order too one heckler a man who had plainly never seen the war at first hand went too far a soldier got up knocked him cold with one punch and said we might notve licked the damnyankees but i sure as hell licked you after that the rude remarks diminished but even then they did not stop the train pulled into the birmingham station just over a day after it set out from fort worth no one sat close to pinkard when he got on the trolley that would take him out to the factory housing by the sloss works maybe that was because he still wore his uniform maybe too it was because hed had no chance to bathe since coming out of the line he walked from the trolley stop toward his house he felt as if he were heading toward the doctors and likely to be diagnosed with a deadly disease he tried the front door it was locked emily had gone to work though how long shed keep her munitionsplant job was anyones guess he had a key in his trouser pocketabout the only thing he did have with him from when hed gone into the army he let himself in he wouldnt get that diagnosis till she came home doing nothing much felt strange and good he took hot water from the stoves reservoir and bathed and put on a shirt and trousers he found in the closet they hung loosely on him hed lost weight he got cold chicken out of the icebox then read an old richmond review so old one of the articles talked about how to drive back the yankees laughing bitterly he tossed the magazine aside at last the front door opened emily stared at him jeff she exclaimed and then darling was there too much hesitation between the one word and the other pinkard didnt get the chance to think much about that his wife threw herself into his arms they tightened around her hed never stopped wanting her even though he didnt get the chance to think about that either her kiss made him dizzy thank god youre home she breathed in his ear thank god youre safe everythings going to be fine now just fine her voice went low and throaty ill show you how fine she led him back toward the bedroom he went willingly even gladly that would do for now later ill just have to find out about later thats all jeff muttered what did you say darling emily was already getting out of her clothes never mind he said itll keep itll keep till later sam carsten sighed the exhalation hurt his lips were even more sunburned than the rest of him they cracked and bled at any excuse or none hed filled out the forms for every kind of cream alleged to help the pharmacists mates were all sick of the sight of him he was sick of the bakedmeat sight of himself as usual none of the creams did the slightest good against the onslaughts of the tropic sun god damn dom pedro iv to hell and gone he said stinking son of a bitch should have stayed out of the war vic crosetti laughed at him youre more worried about your hide than you are about licking the limeys ever since the dakota came up into brazilian waters my hides whats been taking the licking carsten said and we havent fought the royal navy or even seen more than a couple of british freighters waste of time anybody wants to know what i think of the whole business crosetti laughed harder than ever yeah im sure admiral fiske is gonna call you up into officers country any second now so he can find out whats on your mind he couldntve run the flotilla without you till now right makes sense to me sam said crosetti grimaced at him he was about to go on when his ears caught a distant buzzing he searched the heavens then pointed thats an aeroplane now god damn it is it one of ours or one of theirs escorts aint shooting at it so i guess its one of ours crosetti said hope to jesus its one of ours anyways me too carsten kept watching squinting his eyes half shut against the bright sky till he could make out the eagles and crossed swords under the wings of the aeroplane he breathed easier then aeroplanes he said who would have thought when the war started theyd matter so much bunch of damn nuisances is what they are crosetti said as this one splashed into the tropical atlantic a few hundred yards from the dakota and taxied across the water toward the battleship theyre sure as hell nuisances when they spot us or strafe us sam said but they couldnt do a quarter of what theyre doing now back in i bet they keep right on getting better too i think everybody on the dakota except maybe admiral fiske has listened to you go on like this crosetti said with exaggerated patience you like em so goddamn much go and get yourself a pair of wings after the wars done dont want wings carsten said i like being a sailor just fine but i like aeroplanes too look at that vicisnt that bully the dakota s crane was hauling the flying machine out of the water and up on deck crosetti yawned its boring is what it is i think everything about aeroplanes is boring till they start dropping bombs then they scare the shit out of me no thats not boring sam agreed tell you something else thoughid sooner be bored later that day the dakota and the flotilla with her which had been lazing along at ten or twelve knots suddenly changed course toward the northeast and put on speed carsten grunted waiting for the klaxons to cry out the orders to battle station one of the other aeroplanes from the flotilla must have spotted a british convoy he looked forward to knocking it to pieces then rumors started flying rumors that it wasnt a convoy after all but a goodsized chunk of the royal navy sam didnt like hearing that for beans hed fought the royal navy before in the tropical pacific and had high respect for what the limeys could do hed had a lot more of the us navy sailing along beside him then too if theyd run up against a major british fleet they would regret it as long as they lived which might not be long when the klaxons did begin to hoot running toward the forward starboard sponson was almost a relief once he started slamming shells into the breech of the fiveinch gun hed be too busy to worry whatever happened after that just happenedhe couldnt do anything about it hiram kidde put that same thought into words now we smash emor else its the other way around yeah sam said well if they smash us i hope to god we at least hurt them we can afford the losses and they cant not fighting us and kaiser bill both ill die for my country if i have to kidde said but id sooner live for it he puffed out his chest where the hell else are the united states going to find a better chief gunners mate under any flat rock i expect carsten answered which won him a glare commander grady looked into the sponson it is the royal navy he announced if the flyboy who spotted them had it straight theyve got a force about the same size as ours thats great luke hoskins muttered theyll sink all of us and well sink all of them last one standing wins why should this be any different than anything else in the war sam whispered hoskins chuckled and shrugged hiram kidde peered through the sponsons vision slit i see smoke he said and then jesus if i see smoke from down here the firecontrol boys up at the top of the mast have been seeing it the past five minutes and if they can see it the big guns can hit it why the hell arent they shooting as if to answer his question the klaxons wailed once more sam dug a finger in his ear wondering if that ear were playing tricks on him was that the allclear he asked not believing what hed heard sure as hell was hoskins said why are they sounding the allclear though capn kidde demanded the enemys in sight for christs sake he took off his cap and scratched his head and why the hell arent the limeys shooting at us somebody ran shouting down the corridor the shout held no words only joy sams brotherinlaw had shouted like that when his wife sams older sister was delivered of a boy what the hell is going on he asked though he didnt think anyone would have the answer but someone did when commander grady came into the sponson he looked as exalted as the other sailor had sounded boys we just got it on the wireless telegraph from philadelphia he said england has asked the kaiser and teddy roosevelt for an armistice its over carsten whispered hardly believing his own words to help see if they were if they could have been true he repeated them louder this time its over nobody called him a liar nobody said he was crazy little by little almost in spite of himself he began to believe maybe not quite over commander grady said theres still the japs out in the pacific but hell youre right carsten that scrap is liable to peter out by itself weve shot at each other but they havent taken anything of ours and we havent taken anything of theirs shouldnt be too hard to patch up a peace sam nodded yes sir and they wont have any big reason to fight us any more either now that all their allies have thrown in the sponge thats right grady nodded too matter of fact if i were england and france id worry about hong kong and indochina and maybe singapore too if the japs want em bad enough theyll fall into their hands like ripe fruit he brought his mind back to the hereandnow and since we have an armistice you men are dismissed from your posts here sir since weve won are we going to head back to the states hiram kidde asked i dont know the answer to that not yet grady replied i hope so but thats just me talking not admiral fiske or philadelphia go on up topside boys take a look at the limeys we didnt have to fight for once carsten was glad to go up on deck the glow of victory the glow of peace ahead made him forget about the glow of sunburn shading his eyes with a hand he peered across the atlantic at the royal navy force whose government had finally had to yield the longer he looked the gladder he was that the wireless telegraph had brought word when it had the enemy force looked large and formidable in an odd way he felt sorry for the englishmen aboard those warships theyd been top dogs for a hundred years and then some coming back to the pack would hurt them a lot he wondered who the top dog was now the united states or germany he looked east toward europe wouldnt that be an interesting fight he shrugged however interesting it was he didnt think it would happen any time soon teddy roosevelt and the kaiser had just won a war together theyd take a while to pick up the pieces afterwards maybe theyd even stay friends while they were doing it he hoped so one by one the royal navy ships turned away from the uschileanbrazilian flotilla and steamed off toward the northeast toward britain sam wondered what would happen to them there would the limeys get to keep them or would they have to surrender them to germany and the usa that wasnt for him to decide the boys in striped trousers would have to sort it out a us cruiser with the flotilla launched its aeroplane to shadow the british ships that must have been allowed under the terms of the armistice because nobody started shooting us aeroplanes could have tracked the british ships at the outbreak of the war too but neither they nor their wireless sets could have reached as far as they did now sam had had that same thought not long before when hed spotted the dakota s aeroplane before it landed by the battleship now reminded of it in a different context he muttered i wish that flying machine could follow those bastards all the way back to london he didnt notice commander grady standing behind him also watching the royal navy force withdraw that would be pretty fine wouldnt it carsten the commander of the starboard secondary armament said huh sam spun around startled uh yes sir he made himself think straight i expect the day is coming when theyll be able to do just that i expect its coming sooner than most people think too grady studied him i expect youre right if we dont do it some other navy will and theyll do it to us he rubbed his chin matter of fact i happen to know we are doing something along those lines would you by any chance be interested in becoming part of that would i sam said yes sir hell yes sir where do i sign up you dont not yet grady answered but youre a sharp fellowsharper than you let on sometimes i think when we get into port in the united states you remind me about this i think the effort could use you thank you very much sir carsten said part of that was real gratitudehed been talking about doing something like this part of it too was prudent calculation even if the navy did shrink after the war they wouldnt drop him on the beach if he was part of this new project having a job he was sure of wasnt the worst thing in the worldno not even close bartlett reginald confederate states army private first class reggie bartlett said to the paymaster in us greengray he rattled off his pay number and the date of his capture the paymaster found his name checked both the pay number and the date of capture against his own records and lined through them he gave reggie a sheaf of green banknotesbills the yankees called themand some pocket change here is the pay owed you under the geneva convention private first class bartlett he said frankly between you me and the wall youre damn lucky to get it in greenbacks instead of your own money these will still be worth something six months from now god only knows if the confederate dollar will reggie grunted from things hed heard the paymaster was likely to be right he put the money into a pocket of the butternut trousers the us authorities had given himalong with a matching tunicto wear on the train ride back to richmond where all released confederate prisoners were being shipped neither color nor cut was quite that of a cs uniform but both were close his shoulder ached when he bent his arm to put the money in his pocket but not too badly a yankee doctor had given him chloroform and then gone in there and drained an abscess that refused to clear up on its own now the wound really was healing for a long time hed wondered if it ever would he could walk with only a bare trace of a limp too and his leg hardly bothered him at all put everything together and the damnyankees had treated him pretty well of course they were also the ones whod shot him given a choice he would sooner not have been shot then he wouldnt have had to worry about how the damnyankees treated him but who ever gave a soldier a choice here came rehoboam on two sticks and an artificial foot the negro prisoner made slow but steady progress toward the paymaster with nothing better to do reggie waited till he too got paid off then asked what are you going to do when you get back to mississippi i be goddamned if i know rehoboam answered aint no use in the cotton fields no more aint no good on any kind o farm no more reckon i got to go to town but i be goddamned if i know what the hell i do there neither you have your letters bartlett said ive seen that its something it aint much rehoboam said with a scornful toss of his head aint like im gonna put on no necktie and sit behind no desk at the bank and loan the white folks money aint gonna be no doctor aint gonna be no lawyer or preacher aint gonna be no newspaperman neither so what the hell good my letters do me if you didnt have em how could you read all the lies the reds tell reggie asked innocently rehoboam started to give him a straight answer then the black man started to get angry and then grudgingly he started to laugh you aint no stupid white man he said at last wish to jesus you was stupid enough to get shot reggie said you come right down to it how can anybody get any stupider than that you in one piece rehoboam said i aint gonna see my foot again till judgment day and i dont believe in judgment day no more you are a damned red bartlett said he meant damned in a more literal way than he was in the habit of using it he didnt think of himself as all that pious but hed gone to church on sunday back in richmond hearing rehoboam casually deny the last judgment rocked him reckon bein a red is more dangerousn the other the negro answered but if the damn gummint aint cheatin me im gonna be a citizen like you been sayin so i reckon i can think any kind o damnfool thing i like an say so too thats what bein a citizens about aint it i suppose so reggie hadnt thought that much about it he hadnt needed to think much about it citizenship was natural to him as water to a fish and so he took it altogether for granted whatever else rehoboam did he wouldnt do that a military policeman in greengray came up you rebs been paid off he asked when they didnt deny it he jerked a thumb toward a doorway at the end of the hall shake a leg then trucks to take you to the train station are right through there you think well be sorry to get you off our hands youre crazy as the two men from the csa made their way toward the doorthey could hardly shake a legbartlett spoke in a sly voice see he treats you just like mefar as hes concerned were both scum im used to white folks what reckon im scum rehoboam said after a moment how about you outside reggie proved he wasnt used to it thinking to be helpful he asked a yankee guard which one of these trucks is for the coloreds we aint bothering with any of that shit here the us soldier answered you and snowball look like youre pals you can sit together reggie had to help rehoboam up into the back of the truck conscious of the negros eye on him he said not a word as they sat down side by side none of the other freed prisonersall of them whitealready in the truck said anything either most places in the usa negroesa relative handful not close to a third of the population as they were in the csahad to take a back seat to whites as they did in the confederacy bartlett figured the damnyankees were piling one last humiliation on his comrades and him he also figured he would survive itand that he would catch hell if he complained about it that made keeping quiet look like a smart idea the yankees also made no distinction between white and black cs prisoners on the train that set out from missouri toward richmond reggie and rehoboam ended up sitting side by side in a crowded beatup coach bartlett resigned himself to that too and told himself it wouldnt be so bad they knew each other anyhow after weeks of lying across the aisle from each other they couldnt help it until it crossed into virginia the train stayed in territory that had belonged to the usa before the war began reggie stared out through the dirty window glass at countryside confederate soldiers hadnt been able to reach or damage here and there in cincinnati and a couple of other towns he did see craters and wrecked buildings that had taken bomb hits but not till the train got into central pennsylvania more than a day after it set out did the landscape take on the lunar quality with which hed grown so unpleasantly familiar we fought like hell here he remarked to rehoboam reckon we did the negro answered or you white folks did anyways yankees licked you just the same bartlett sighed he could hardly argue with that he did say we might have done better if you red niggers hadnt jumped on our backs while we were fighting the usa mebbe rehoboam said you mightve did better if you didnt go an make all the black folks in the country hate you like pizen too since that held only too much truth reggie forbore from replying he kept looking out the window maryland seemed just like pennsylvania a hell of wreckage and shell craters and forests smashed to toothpicks the smell of death was fresher there and filled the train and when he rolled through washington dc he stared and stared the whole city was a field of rubble with most of the buildings knocked flat and then pounded to pieces the stub of the washington monument stuck up from the desolation all around like a broken tooth in a mouth otherwise empty rehoboam gaped at what was left of washington too didnt see nothin like this here in arkansas he allowed this here this is a hell of a mess didnt see anything like this in sequoyah either bartlett said but in the roanoke valley especially around big lickwe saw plenty of it there too many men smashed together into too small a space with no room for anybody to give way thats what does it over across the mississippi the fighting didnt get this crowded the yankees and us had more room to move when we was fightin to keep em away from memphis it got plenty bad but not like this rehoboam said no aint never seen nothin like this after the train crossed the potomac on a pontoon bridge and went into virginia reggie expected the devastation to be even worse than it had been in yankee country for the most part it wasnt it was fresher but not worse after a little while he thought he understood why by the time the fighting moved down into virginia us forces had gained such a preponderance over those of the csa that the army of northern virginia had to give ground before it and everything around it were pounded completely flat a war of movement didnt tear up the landscape so badly as one of position and then as soon as the train got south of the reach of us guns the countryside was the one reggie had always known with only an occasional bomb crater to remind him of the war coming into richmond though brought it home once more us aeroplanes had done their worst to the capital of the confederate states richmond was in better shape than washington but it wouldnt win prizes any time soon check the signboards for trains going toward your home towns railroad officialsor perhaps they were government functionariesshouted to his own surprise reggie reached out to shake rehoboams hand the negro took the offered hand looking a little surprised himself good luck to you reggie said i dont care if you are a red or not too much good luck same to you rehoboam said you aint the worst white man i ever run acrost he made that sound like high praise they got off the train together rehoboam slowly headed toward a platform from which a train would leave for mississippi he didnt need to hurry it wasnt scheduled to head out for another six hours and might well run late bartlett left the station he would have to stay in his parents home till he found work a taxi driver hailed him hey pal take you anywhere in town for three beans wont find anybody cheaper three dollars reggie stared at him as if hed started talking hindustani the paymaster back at the hospital had known what he was talking about bartletts hand went into his pocket and closed on a coin ill give you a quarter us deal the driver said at once reggie wondered if hed offered too much by the way the cabbie bounced out of the motorcara birmingham that had seen better daysand held the door open for him he probably had he clicked his tongue between his teeth no help for it now he gave the driver his parents address hope you didnt get hurt too bad the cab driver said evidently recognizing the kind of clothes bartlett had on reggie only grunted by way of reply not a bit put out the driver asked whatll you do now that youre home damned if i know reggie said try and find my life again i reckon by the way the cabbie nodded hed heard that answer plenty of times already colonel irving morrell scrambled down into the confederate works that would have defended murfreesboro tennessee without soldiers in them the trenches seemed unreal unnatural before the armistice morrell would have had to pay in blood and pay high for the privilege of examining them now he had colonel harley landis csa as his personal guide not that landis was delighted with the job if i had my choice colonel he said the only excavation of ours id show you would be six feet by three feet by six feet deep he raised an eyebrow nothing personal of course of course morrell agreed with a dry chuckle believe me if you were going through our trenches outside chicago id feel the same way chicago the confederate officer snorted ruefully in my dreams maybe you have the stronger power we aimed at nothing more than defending ourselves now morrell was the one to arch his brows aimed at philadelphia you mean aimed at kansas too for that matter and missouri talk straight colonel if you dont mind this poorlittleus business wears thin after the war of secession and the second mexican war colonel landis stared at him but surely you can see he checked himself then shook his head maybe notwho knows but if you cant the world must seem a very strange place from the yankee side of the hill looking at the world from the other fellows side of the hill is always a useful exercise morrell regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth landis was an enemylandis was the enemy if he hadnt figured that out for himself why hand it to him fortunately his thoughts seemed to be elsewhere all weve tried to do is hold you back a little and keep up with you ourselves you yankees have got to be the pushingest people in the whole wide world thank you morrell said which made his confederate counterparts mouth twist landis hadnt meant that as a compliment morrell held his smile inside too bad he took his own advice climbing up onto a firing step that was already starting to crumble and peering toward the northwest if hed been a cs officer defending this position against a whole great swarm of barrels what would he have done his first thought was turn tail and run like hell say what you would about the rebels he could count on the fingers of one hand the times theyd done anything like that he turned and looked back over his shoulder studying the earthworks he hadnt yet explored in person after perhaps half a minute of contemplation he grunted softly youd have mounted your guns up there he said pointing and fired at us over open sights or as near as makes no difference i dont know how many barrels you had left at the end but youd have put them behind that little swell of ground therehe pointed againto keep us from spotting them for as long as you could harley landis examined him the same way hed examined the terrain the cs colonel started to say something stopped and started again after a pause has anyone ever told you sir that you may be too damn smart for your own good a whole raft of people colonel landis morrell answered cheerfully once or twice theyve even been right he remembered all too well his own temporary eclipse after the mormon rebels in utah had hurt in a way he hadnt anticipated the us troops battling to put them down only once or twice landis was still eyeing him in speculative fashion well maybe im not too surprised he took a look at the ground too then asked how do you think we would have done youd have hurt us morrell said no doubt about that colonel not a bit youd have hurt usbut we would have got through you couldnt have had enough barrels to stop us he waited for landis irate disagreement but the confederate colonel had been the man who brought his commanders request for a ceasefire through the us lines as well as anyone could he knew how things stood with his army he looked as if hed bitten into something sour youre likely right dammit but how i wish you werent he got out a pack of raleighs scraped a match on the sole of his boot and lit a cigarette can i steal one of those from you morrell asked eagerly you wouldnt believe some of the dried horse manure that passes for tobacco in the united states these days yes i would landis said when wed capture yankees the mend always let em keep their smokes here keep the whole pack he tossed it to morrell the us officer tapped a cigarette against the palm of his hand then leaned forward to get a light from landis he sucked the fragrant smoke deep into his lungs at last reluctantly he exhaled thank you colonel that is the straight goods you rebels make better smokes than we do and thats the truth landis sighed id trade that for being somewhere up in illinois right now the way you said before morrell nodded as he took another drag i havent tasted tobacco like this in years though its bully stuff he walked rapidly along the firebay till he came to a communications trench then colonel landis in his wake he zigzagged back until he could inspect the gun position hed spotted from the front line he nodded to himself field guns there would have done some damage but not enough to stop a major assault he found a question for landis whats your opinion of our barrels as compared to youryou usually call them tanks dont you these days we say barrels more often too harley landis answered my opinion my opinion is that you had too damned many of them no matter what name you care to use past that he declined to say anything morrell hadnt expected him to say much but had hoped to prod the confederate a little more morrell said well probably confiscate the ones you do have you know and do our damnedest to make sure you dont build any more of them colonel landis muttered something under his breath chicken thieves morrell needed a few seconds to understand it when he did he thought it wiser to pretend he hadnt he did say if england and france and russia had smashed germany in a hurry and then helped you turn on us i dont think youd have given us a big kiss when the war was over no i reckon not landis admitted which made morrell like him better or at least respect him more he went on but thats the way things were supposed to work out and they didnt his chuckle had barbs i know youre not thinking the same thing i am here no not quite morrell said they both laughed then a couple of professionals who understood each other even though they stood on opposite sides of the hill ask you something landis said you can ask morrell said i dont promise to answer hereill ply you with liquor first colonel landis took a flask from his belt to show morrell it was safe he drank first morrell took a swig hed expected moonshine or at best its more dignified cousin bourbon what he got was a mouthful of damn fine cognac you are a man of parts sir he said bowing a little first the cigarettes now this ask away im putty in your hands landis snort had a skeptical ring he put the question even so suppose the war had gone on and you did break through here what would you have done next im not in command of first army morrell said which was true but also disingenuous considering the victories hed helped design he took another small sip of landis brandy and added general custer was talking about an advance to the tennessee though if you must know he handed the flask back to the confederate colonel landis almost dropped it to the tennessee his splutters had nothing to do with the second swig of cognac he took when were you planning on getting there the tennessee the very idea we were down by god but we werent out i think hewemight have done it morrell said not a lot of natural barriers in the way anyhow and how many divisions of colored troops did you have in the line when the shooting stopped if you dont know colonel ill be damned if im going to tell you harley landis answered i will tell you this though they fought about as well as the new white units we were raising toward the end there of course youll tell me that and not the otherit makes you look stronger morrell said landis nodded unembarrassed on the whole though the us officer thought his cs opposite number was right from what hed seen and from reports hed read confederate black units had fought about as well as rookie confederate white units that surprised him but a man who couldnt see truth when it tried to shoot him wouldnt live long and didnt deserve to he asked now that the war is overpoliter than saying now that youve lost are you folks going to keep on raising negro troops i dont know the answer to that colonel landis answered we didnt conscript niggers the way we did with our own people what we got were volunteers and probably a better crop than we would have had if wed scraped the bottom of the barrel he sent morrell a hooded glance other side of that coin is there are so goddamn many of you yankees morrells smile was bright and friendlyif you didnt look too close maybe youll think about that a little harder before you decide whether youll try picking a fight with us picking a fight with you landis shook his head no sir teddy roosevelt declared war on us not the other way around after wilson declared war on our allies morrell said we honored our commitments landis said so did we morrell returned they glared at each other then morrell laughed a sound more of bemusement than anything else and look what honoring our commitments got us betterno worsethan a million dead on our side likely not far from that for you and even more wounded and all the wreckagethey shouldnt let civilians start wars colonel because they dont know what the hell theyre getting into and getting their countries into you may be a damnyankee but im damned if i think youre wrong landis said this must never happen again irving morrell said solemnly never never colonel landis said never by god he took the flask off his belt again to peace he drank and offered it to morrell thank you sir morrell drank too to peace thegreatwar breakthroughs jake featherston slouched down the dirt road toward richmond at a pace that would have made him scream curses at any soldier using it no one would scream curses at him not now he still wore his uniform but he wasnt a soldier any more along with most of the rest of the army of northern virginia hed been mustered out and paid off and sent on his way with a pat on the head threw me out he snarled under his breath threw us all out so the war department wouldnt have to fret itself about feedin us or payin us any more payin us he snorted and slapped a pocket paper inside crinkled theyd paid him off in banknotes not real money he wondered how far the notes would go when he tried spending them not far enough he was already sure of that dust rose from the pocket when he slapped it a lot of paidoff soldiersno exsoldierswere on the road every time he took a step dust kicked up from under his battered boots any time any of them took a step dust kicked up thousands of men millions of steps a hell of a lot of dust youd think theyd want to keep a good artilleryman in the army he muttered hed been plenty good enough to command a battery but he hadnt been good enoughno the war department hadnt thought he was good enoughto get promoted past sergeant or good enough to keep either well to hell with jeb stuart jr he can go down there and toast his toes with jeb stuart iii a negro soldier trudging along the same road turned his head at the sound of featherstons voice jake stared unwinkingly back at him in the days before things had gone to hell in the csa a couple of seconds of that look from a white man would have been plenty to make any black buck lower his eyes now the negro a big burly fellow tried to stare him down it didnt work featherston might have been on the wiry side but rage had kept him going during the war and that rage hadnt got any smaller now that the war was lost it blazed out of him now almost tangibly and the colored soldier flinched away from it jake laughed instead of trying to start a fight the negro flinched again do jesus he said softly and let featherston pass that night featherston slept by the side of the road wrapped in a blanket as he had slept by a lot of different roads in several blankets during the war he had turned in his pistol when he was paid off again no he had turned in a pistol when he was paid off he took his pistol out of his pack and set it where he could grab it in a hurry the precaution proved needless he slept undisturbed when morning woke him he started walking again he took the fiftyfive miles from fredericksburg to richmond in three mediumeasy days not the two harsh ones he would have used if still in the army that meant he got into the confederate capital this side of exhausted but empty as a cave the men whod moved faster had got what food there was on the road richmond was full of dirty scarecrows in butternut the grayuniformed police seemed to have not a clue about what to do with so many men oddson to be tougher and shortertempered than they were the best answer they found was as little as we possibly can that struck jake as showing better sense than he expected from police he went into a saloon to take advantage of its freelunch spread the mealham and deviled eggs and pickles and salted peanuts and other thirstinducerswas indeed free but the mug of beer he had to buy to avail himself of it set him back a dollar not the prewar five cents christ he exclaimed ill take fifteen cents in silver if youve got that the barkeep said hell ill take a dime its just as well the banknotes are already brown on account of thats what people will be using them for dont have enough silver to want to spend it quick featherston said if a beer is a bean what do i have to pay for a bed paper five easy and the bugsll carry your mattress in for you you get anything that cheap the fat man in the black apron answered why didnt you bastards win the war instead of laying down for the damnyankees then theyd have to pay featherston reached across the bar and grabbed a handful of the white shirt showing above the apron you dont ever want to say anything like that again you hear me when the bartender didnt say anything he shook him lifting his feet off the floor with no particular effort you hear me i hear you the fat man wheezed jake set him down on the floor he went on drink your beer and get the hell out of here i will featherston said you aint crowded here and while im drinking it you keep both hands where i can see em hear you try hauling out whatever kind of persuader you got under the bar there i promise you wont like what happens after that he took his time finishing the beer then turned and walked toward the door he hadnt gone three paces before the bartender shouted dont even breathe soldier boy featherston looked back over his shoulder and found himself staring down the barrels of a sawedoff shotgun after gas and machine guns and yankee traveling forts that was not so much of a much if the bastard did pull the triggers it would be over in a hurry anyway fuck you jake said and kept walking no blast of shot tore into his back he stood on the street for a few seconds five dollars for a flophouse bed he shook his head and made for capitol square sleeping in the park was free maybe a congressman or a senator would come by and see what the aftermath of war looked like he was not the only soldier in capitol squarefar from it as evening fell several campfires started flickering that was probably against the rules but no policemen came in to do anything about it jake saw them on the sidewalk and clustered around the bombscarred capitol cowardly bastards he muttered wish they would try and break us up another ragged veteran said look at em there fat and happy nobody who aint been through what we been through can know what its like but wed give em a taste goddamn if we wouldnt thats right by jesus featherston said wonder who their pappies were so they didnt have to put on a real uniform amen the other soldier said you can sing that in my church any old day he stuck out a hand names ted weston im in the nd north carolina infantryor i was anyways im jake featherston first richmond howitzers ive heard of that outfit weston said pretty ladeda aint they you might could have had a pappy of your own get into a unit like that hell i did jake growled i was good at what i did is all good enough to lead a battery for a year and a half but not good enough to take the stripes off my sleeve and put a bar or two on my collar ladeda my asshadnt been for a ladeda officer with a fancy pa gettin hisself killedahh the hell with it he spat in disgust weston eyed him in the dim flickering light they werent close to a fire sounds like you got a powerful load of angry rilin your belly jake oh a touch featherston allowed just a touch dont get me started or ill sick it all up he waited to see if weston would ask him more he would have brought it all out he might even have purged himself of some of it but the infantryman from north carolina shrugged and moved away nobody gives a damn featherston thought nobody he went away himself to the base of the great statue of albert sidney johnston the confederacys chief martyr during the war of secession the war now ended had martyrs in plenty but he didnt think he would see statues to them any time soon he wrapped himself in his blanket and went to sleep when morning came he found a cheap cafe the saloons not yet being open ham and eggs and biscuits and coffee cost him two dollars he could not afford he fumed at the price as he fumed at everything these days and then he spotted a couple of neatly turnedout sentries in front of a building at the southwestern corner of capitol square those sentries drew him as a lodestone draws nails sure enough that was the war department building the source as he saw it of all his miseries and all his countrys miseries as well one of the sentries wrinkled his nose as featherston approached he turned his head and spoke to his comrade dogs find more rubbish to drag out these days jake didnt think he was meant to hear that but hear it he did artillerymans battered ears or not you can kiss my ass too pal he said and started past the spitandpolish boys into the war department the one whod spoken swung his rifle down horizontally to block his way where do you think youre going buddy he demanded state your business kiss my ass jake repeated im a citizen of this country and im a real soldier too goddammit id rather smell the way i do than be a perfumed pansy in a uniform that never once saw dirt now get the hell out of my way i aim to have me a word or two to say to the bonehead generals who cost us this war i dont think so sonny boy the sentry said theyve got better things to do with their time than listen toand smellthe likes of you like hell they do featherston said i want to tell you without a single telltale motion or glance he kicked the sentry in the crotch then whirled and coldcocked his chum while the other man was just beginning to raise his rifle the only difference between them was that the first went down with a groan the second silently whistling jake started to walk by them and into the war department then reluctantly he checked himself hed get caught in there he was liable to get caught out here a couple of men were coming across the street toward him he did what they must have expected leasthe charged straight at them neither of them cared to try tackling him they were middleaged and prosperous and no doubt thought anyone who did anything out of line would politely wait around for the police afterwards he taught them otherwise in a hurry then he was back in capitol square one discharged soldier among hundreds how were they supposed to find him after that they couldnt they didnt they didnt even try and the sentries whod got a better look at him were in no condition to help he stopped running and started sauntering looking like any of the rest of the men in the square who had more time on their hands than they knew what to do with at least one of those soldiers had seen what hed done as he strolled past the fellow said damn shame you couldnt give that bastard semmes a good shot in the nuts too youd best believe its a damn shame jake said one of these days though if this poor miserable country ever gets back on its feet again well pay back everybody who ever did us wrongand i mean everybody hope that day comes soon the other veteran said cant come soon enough if anybody wants to know what i think i dont know when featherston said well have to go some to put our own house in order i reckon but well walk tall again one of these days and thenand then everybody better look out thats all the other soldier clapped his hands not even a funeral sylvia enos thought that was worst of all when scarlet fever took her mother when her brother died in a trainwreck there had been an end to things dirt thudding down on the lid of a coffin and then a wake afterwards once that was done people had been able to pick up the threads of their lives and go on but fish and crabs and whatever lived at the bottom of the sea in the middle of the atlantic were giving george the only burial he would ever get fishermen shuddered when they talked of things like that along with all his friends george had hated the idea of going down at sea sylvia knew men who wouldnt eat crab or lobster because of what the shellfish might have been eating she stirred the dress shed thrown in the kettle full of black dye it would be ready pretty soon shed used a good deal of coal heating water to dye clothes for mourning that was cheaper than buying new black dresses and shirtwaists she hoped the coal board wouldnt cut the ration yet again though mary jane came into the kitchen and said i want to go out and play go on then sylvia said with a sigh mary jane wasnt really mourning how could she mourn a man she scarcely remembered she knew sylvia was upset but had trouble understanding why george jr had known his father well enough to miss him but he was also far less wounded than he would have been had george come home every night school seemed far more real and far more urgent to him than a father long at sea sylvia wished she felt the same way now that george was gone she found herself far more forgiving of his flaws than she had been while he was alive she evenalmostwished hed gone to bed with that colored strumpet to give him one more happy memory to hold on to when the torpedo slammed into the ericsson not fair she muttered stirring again the confederacy had already dropped out of the war and england had been on the point of giving up why how had a british submersible chosen her husbands ship in those waning moments of the war where was the sense in that george hadnt even mentioned british submersibles to her all hed ever written about were confederate boats why had the royal navy decided to move one of theirs into that part of the ocean she didnt suppose questions like that had any answers a minister would have called it gods will as far as she was concerned that wasnt any answer either why had god decided to take everybody on board the ericsson because her husband had wanted to screw a whore if god started taking every man whod ever wanted to do that men would get thin on the ground mighty quick men had got thin on the ground so many women wore mourning these days or had worn it and were now returning to less somber wear sylvia looked at the alarm clock which shed brought out of the bedroom the dress had been in the kettle long enough sylvia carried the kettle over to the sink and poured out the water in which shed dyed the dress then she wrung the dress as dry as she could and set it on a hanger to finish drying that done she scrubbed at her hands with floor soap to clean the dye from her knuckles and around and under her nails she was just drying her handsand noting that she hadnt got rid of all the dyewhen someone knocked on the door her mouth twisted bitterly as she went to open it shed already had the worst news she could get opening the door held no terror for her now brigid coneval stood in the hallway the irishwoman still wore black for her own dead husband and how is it today sylvia she asked where nothing else had their common loss left them on a firstname basis they understood each other in a way no one who had not shared that loss ever could itsabout the same as always sylvia said she stepped aside come in why dont you dont mind if i do brigid said she nodded when she saw the big kettle sticking up out of the kitchen sink which was not very deep and smelled the acrid odor of the dye still hanging in the air och i did enough of that and to spare so i did as long as im doing things i dont have to worry about what happened sylvia said and so i keep finding things to do she waved a hand this place has never been so clean my flatll never be clean im thinking but then im after having three boys brigid coneval said but i do know what youre saying indeed and i do in bed of nights i keep thinking what if hed stopped to piss or what if hed fallen down before that damned bullet came by oror i dont know what but anything to make it different than it was anything to make it different sylvia echoed oh christ yes what was that stinking english submarine doing where there hadnt been any english submarines it had no business being in that part of the ocean the confederates had already given up and it does no gooddwelling on it i mean brigid broke in i know that sometimes i cant help it though sylvia said sometimes even when im workingi was thinking about that damned submarineshe brought out the word not casually as her friend had done but with savage relisheven while i was dyeing my dress it does no good brigid coneval repeated well the truth is theres not a thing that does any good but there is a thing sure and there is that keeps you from thinking so much about it she opened her handbag and pulled out a flat pint bottle of whiskey sylvia got up went over to the cabinet by the kitchen sink and brought back a couple of glasses she watched as the coppery liquid gurgled into them she didnt drink that much or that often not least because whiskey tasted like medicine to her but brigid was rightwhiskey was medicine here because it kept her from thinking clearly when clear thought was the last thing she wanted ahh brigid smacked her lips and poured another shot into her glass she thrust the pint toward sylvia who shook her head brigid coneval shrugged and drank she wasnt shy about whiskey on the contrary george jr came in hello mrs coneval he said and hello to you she answered with an extravagant gesture that almost sloshed the refill out of her glass what a fine polite boy yare the fine polite boy had a new bruise on his cheek very possibly gained by roughhousing with one of brigid conevals sons he wrinkled his nose and said that dye stinks ma i know it does sylvia answered it cant be helped though she looked toward the clock go find your sister and tell her to come in its later than i thought ill feed the two of you and get you ready for bed i have to go back to work tomorrow and youre going back to school all right he said and hurried away he liked the idea of going back to school sylvia wondered where he came by that school had always bored her to tears and george had never been any sort of scholar either a good boy a fine boy the whiskey made brigid coneval even more emphatic than she would have been without it she got to her feet you tend to your wee ones now ill have to be laying hold of mine before long too sylvia also rose the two women hugged each other brigid left heading back to her apartment with great determination mary jane was mutinous when she came back with her big brother did you really tell him i had to go in she demanded of sylvia and looked surprised and disappointed when her mother nodded not even fried scrod for supper did much to cheer her up she seemed convinced sylvia had betrayed her nor was she enthusiastic about going to mrs dooleys the next morning once sylvia warmed her bottom for her she moved well enough george jr got off the trolley and bounded toward his school hed grown tired of being cooped up at home at the shoe factory everyone greeted sylvia with a warm show of sympathy gustav krafft the foreman was a man of few words even he was kind from your fellow workers he said as he handed her an envelope it not only crinkled but also clinked thank you so much sylvia said thank you all so much money could do only so much but she was glad to have it no one could do much without it eventually she would get a payment from the government but god only knew how long that would take if the coal board was any indication it might take forever you poor dear emma kilgore said jacks coming home thank the sweet lord but i know how you got to feel sylvia sweetheart if it was me id be out of my mind i feel like i am sometimes sylvia answered the redheaded woman at the sewing machine next to her did not know how she felt regardless of whether she thought she did she was counting the days till her husband came back to boston from tennessee what did sylvia have to count nothing at all the work was steady and demanded enough concentration that sylvia couldnt let her mind drift as she often had back at the mackerelcanning plant thinking about anything except the pieces of leather in front of her was asking for a punctured hand she couldnt dwell on losing george not unless she also wanted to dwell on what the doctor would have to do to repair her toward the middle of the afternoon the woman who had hired her came into the factory hall and said may i see you for a moment mrs enos of course let me finish this first please sylvia joined the pieces of leather together and tossed them into the box by the machine then she caught gustav kraffts eye only after he nodded permission did she rise and accompany the hiring clerk as she did she said i hope nothings wrong youve done a very good job with us as a matter of fact the woman said as they left the factory floor if she noticed sylvia was wearing mourning she didnt mention it she waved her to a chair the very chair in which shed been sitting in fact when she was hired miss could you please tell me whats going on sylvia asked yes i will tell you the hiring clerk answered like i said all the reports on your work have been very good and krafft isnt easy to please but our orders have been cut because of peace and we have men coming back and you are one of our most recent employees and so youre letting me go sylvia said dully i am sorry the woman said i do feel bad about it because youve worked out very well here that did sylvia exactly no good the woman whod hired her went on i wish we could keep you but business doesnt allow it and our brave men in uniform will be returning looking for the jobs they my brave man in uniform wont be returning sylvia broke in and my children and i will be going hungry because of this i am sorry the woman repeated ill be happy to give you the very best of good characters which will surely help you get a position at a firm that is hiring but firms arent hiring sylvia said firms are letting people go firms are letting women like me go so they can hire men like you said she sighed ill take that good character it wont do me any good but ill take it what am i going to do now she asked herself what can i do now the question was far easier to ask than to answer cincinnatus was walking to the trolley stop when someone whistled behind him he looked back over his shoulder and saw lucullus apicius son waving at him he didnt grimacenot on the outside where lucullus could see instead he waved lucullus came toward him at a heavy trot he was on his way to putting on his fathers massive bulk what you want cincinnatus asked him whatever it is you better make it snappy on account of im gonna be late for work if i miss this here trolley car well aint you high and mighty lucullus said he was getting his own mans confidence he wouldnt have been so sharp with cincinnatus a year before my pa says he got to figure out whether to fish or cut bait with you pretty damn quick anyou wont like it if he decide he got to cut bait you tell your pa that if anything happens to me i got myself a little book cincinnatus answered first thing that happens after somethin happens to me is that little book goes straight to luther bliss hed been bluffing when he said that to joe conroy he wasnt bluffing any more anyone who tried to bring him down would go down with him lucullus screwed up his face he could see that he was no fool cincinnatus would never have thought apiciusapicius woodsson could be a fool he said my pa says you aint got the right attitude cincinnatus you is for yourself fore you is for the people i take care of myself and i mind my business cincinnatus said thats all i want to do thats all i ever wanted to do anybody tries to keep me from doin that he can get lost far as im concerned i dont care who he is you do got the wrong attitude lucullus said reproachfully if the proletariat aint united against the oppressors it aint anything and what about if the party of the proletariat tries oppressin me cincinnatus returned instead of answering lucullus made another sour face and strode off cincinnatus watched him go then hurried on to the trolley stop the reds wouldnt leave him alone for no better reason than that he asked them to he knew that only too well he threw his nickel in the trolley fare box and went to the back of the car with something approaching relief while he rode the trolley as when he was driving a truck nobody bothered him he sometimes thought those were the only times when no one bothered him oh every once in a while at home but that wasnt the same new graffiti marked several buildings along the trolley route some were blue xs others three horizontal lines of paint redwhitered only after cincinnatus had seen several of them did he realize what they were supposed to suggest the confederate battle flag and the stars and bars the diehards were busy again then others in covington were bound to be quicker on the uptake than he was no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than he saw a work crew splashing whitewash over one of those blue xs no the yankees didnt miss a trick somehow cincinnatus was not surprised to find luther bliss waiting at the trolley stop where he got off the chief of the kentucky state police didnt get on the trolley either he fell into step beside cincinnatus as the negro headed toward the shed where lieutenant straubings crew gathered at the start of each new run mornin mr driver he said irony in his voice at addressing a negro by his surname hope i wont take up too much of your precious time today mornin to you mr bliss cincinnatus answered i hope you wont too suh i dont know nothin moren i did last time we talked and the army gets powerful riled if im late to workit dont matter how come bliss gave him a nasty glare hed mentioned the army on purpose it was the one institution that had more power in covington than bliss secret police after a couple of silent strides the chief said ill make you a dealyou tell me who punched that bastard kennedys ticket for him and youll never see my face again thats a promise cincinnatus laughed in the aforementioned face you dont know who done it an the reds dont know who done it an the confederate diehards dont know who done it anyou all reckon i know who done it only thing i know about tom kennedy is that i used to work for the man he knew a great deal more than that he also knew luther bliss did not know how much he knew had the secret policeman known that cincinnatus would not have been heading in to work he would have been in jail or more likely dead bliss did know he wasnt telling everything you only knew kennedy because you worked for him what was he doing on your doorstep better than two years later damned if i know cincinnatus answered he got shot before he could tell me anything maybe he was running from the kentucky state police not right then i dont reckon bliss said if he was running from us hed have been stupid to run to you because he mustve known we were keeping an eye on you too and whatever else you could say about the goddamn son of a bitch tom kennedy wasnt stupid bliss was undoubtedly rightnobody harassing cincinnatus was stupid cincinnatus didnt say anything about that the less he said the better the chance the kentucky state police chief would give upgive up for the time being anyhowand go away but bliss with his odd eyes the color of a hunting dogs stuck with him like a hunting dog on a scent side by side they approached the shed where lieutenant straubings drivers gathered straubing was waiting outside good morning cincinnatus he said youll have to tell your friend goodbye here goodbye friend cincinnatus said at once smiling in luther bliss direction now bliss laughed at him you dont get rid of me that easy i have some more questions that need answering ask them some other time lieutenant straubing said nothing interferes with my men when theyre supposed to be working nothing have you got that listen junior im luther bliss and im looking into a killing bliss said maybe the army didnt faze him after all maybe nothing fazed him that wouldnt have surprised cincinnatus one bit far as im concerned thats a hell of a lot more important than if one nigger hops in a truck on time have you got that straubing wasnt any older than cincinnatus he was skinny and on the pale side and as far as cincinnatus could tell he never backed down from anybody or anything sounds like youre trying to sell me the brooklyn bridge he answered cincinnatus didnt kill anybody if he had killed somebody you wouldnt be grilling him here hed be in prison if its about somebody else doing some killing i think it can keepdoesnt sound like fresh news anyhow now just whos supposed to be dead and why do you think cincinnatus knows the first thing about it that was lieutenant straubing to the core methodical precise unyielding why do i reckon he knows something about it bliss asked with a chuckle because the fellow whos dead got his head blown off right on your little darlings front stoop thats why bastard was a rebel diehard name of tom kennedy oh him straubing waved a hand in a careless gesture of dismissal you may as well leave cincinnatus alone if thats what youre exercised over he doesnt know anything about it and you do luther bliss asked calm as ever straubing nodded bliss spoke in an exasperated growl and how come you know so goddamn much lieutenant if you dont mind my asking of course its not very hard chief straubing answered still calm i shot that kennedy bastard myself you shot tom kennedy for once in their lives cincinnatus and luther bliss said the same thing at the same time with the same intonation one of astonished disbelief but lieutenant straubing only nodded i certainly did he needed shooting cincinnatus is one of my better men and kennedy was distracting him from his work he might even have managed to get cincinnatus involved in something subversive if hed kept pestering him long enough kennedy had got cincinnatus into several subversive things but straubing didnt know that neither did luther bliss who proved it by saying weve never pinned anything on cincinnatus here but you shot kennedy lieutenant why in hell didnt you say something about it to somebody i dont know straubing shrugged it never seemed that important i was only doing my job and making sure one of my men could do his its not like kennedy was anything but a rebel diehard i didnt think anything more about it than i would have thought about stepping on a cockroach cincinnatus believed that hed had a long time to watch straubings mind work after some small pause for thought luther bliss evidently decided he believed it too lieutenant youd have made a lot of peoples lives simpler if you didnt play your cards so goddamn close to your chest he said at last his eyes flicked to cincinnatus reckon this fellowd tell you the same thing thats a fact cincinnatus said everybody reckoned i had somethin to do with it folks kept tryinto cipher out who i done it for made my life livelier than i really cared for believe you me it did how unfortunate lieutenant straubing looked as distressed as he ever did which wasnt very i just thought of him as rubbish who wouldnt be missed but if that ends chief bliss business with you ends this business anyway bliss touched a finger to the brim of his straw hat obliged to you lieutenant would have been more obliged if youd spoken up sooner but obliged all the same off he went brisk and competent himself ends this business cincinnatus thought that would have to do though it was far less than he wanted once inside the shed lieutenant straubing wasted no time and no words lets get moving men weve got food and munitions heading down to first army one more thing you need to know with the armistice holding well be laying off our civilian drivers after this run were hauling less now and well be doing it with army personnel only from now on you civilians have done a good job and the united states are grateful to you what are we supposed to do now one of those drivers a white man demanded before cincinnatus could get the words out of his mouth find other work of course straubing answered i wish you the best of luck but im not your nursemaid some of us got killed haulin for you cincinnatus said is that all you got to say lieutenanti aint your nursemaid their families are taken care of straubing said if youd been killed your family would have been taken care of too since you werent you cant expect the government to hold your hand for you now that your labor is no longer required he cared about the job when the job was done he didnt care any more when the job was done nobody cared any more cincinnatus wondered where hed find work now he whistled softly under his breath god damn he said welcome to the united states secretary of state robert lansing had come before the transportation committee to discuss the integration of the railroads in lands conquered from canada and the confederate states into the rail network of the usa chairman taft plainly feared some members questions might go further afield but fearing that and being able to do much about it were two different things i recognize the distinguished representative from new york he said with a strange sort of polite reluctance thank you mr chairman flora hamburger said she knew she had to follow her course with care lest she be ruled out of order now mr secretary will these railroads be brought into our network to make trade easier with the csa and whatever is left of canada after peace is finally established yes maam lansing paused to draw on a cigarette and to run a hand through his fine head of gray hair that is one of the principal purposes of the integration the other of course is to provide for the defense of the united states railroads being so important to the transport of men and materiel he spoke with the precision of the longtime lawyer he had been i see flora nodded and against which parts of canada does the administration see a need for future defense those parts not annexed to the united states or to our ally the republic of quebec lansing answered i understand as much yes flora said which parts will those be we anticipate that the republic of quebec will have borders substantially similar to those of the former province of quebec the secretary of state said when he said no more flora asked and the rest of canada areas under military occupation we anticipate annexing lansing said areas not presently occupied are being negotiated with british and canadian representatives whatever we do not annex will naturally fall within our economic sphere of influence as holland and belgium will fall within germanys and serbia and albania within austriahungarys he made fewer bones about exploitation than flora had thought he would she asked and what of the confederate states again we shall annex such land as we now hold pending adjustments to create frontiers appropriate to our needs and acceptable to the confederate states which may be required to exchange territory for any we yield back to them lansing said i remind you that this land is different from that of canada as it was formerly part of the territory of the united states did we not abandon our claim of sovereignty over it when we recognized the csa flora asked sharply so the confederates now say lansing returnedhe might look dry and dusty but he was dangerous tarring her with the brush of the beaten enemy the view of the president is that recognition of the csa was granted under duress and maintained by coercion on the part of the confederates and their allies the peace then will be as harsh as you can make it flora said congressman taft looked unhappy but the question followed logically from others lansing had answered without hesitation he answered this one without hesitation too yes maam the stronger the peace from our point of view the better off we shall be and the longer our foes will need to recover from it and menace us again wouldnt we be better off making them our friends flora asked perhaps we might be if they showed any interest in friendship lansing said the next such interest they do show however will be the first democrats up and down the committee table laughed some of them even snickered the chairman rapped loudly for order flora felt her face flush the question while heartfelt had sounded naive if we do annex canada i expect a large influx of socialist voters she remarked no one as yet is speaking of making us states from canadian provinces so the question of voter affiliation in them is moot lansing replied again this differs from our approach to territory formerly under confederate administration of course it does flora said exconfederates are likely to make good democrats since theyre reactionary to the core tafts gavel came down again that is out of order miss hamburger is it out of order to suggest that the administration will make whatever peace is to its advantage and will worry about its advantage before it worries about the peoples advantage flora asked perhaps the administration is out of order and i am not bang bang bang taft plied the gavel with such vigor his beefy face turned red we shall have no more such outbursts he declared flora inclined her head to the committee chairman never ask any questions that might be difficult or inconvenient is what you mean isnt it mr chairman she said never ask any questions where the american people really need to know the answers never mind the first amendment is that what you mean if it is teddy roosevelt is a lot more like kaiser bill than he thinks or than he wants us to think a couple of other socialist congressmen on the transportation committee loudly clapped their hands and the lone republican with them william howard taft however turned redder still almost the color of a ripe beet it is intolerable that you should impugn the administration and the president in this way he boomed is it tolerable that the administration and the president should impugn the truth flora returned she got no answer what she got was an early adjournment of the committee robert lansing stuffed papers into his briefcase and scurried away looking back over his shoulder as if he expected dogs to come after him with teeth bared his alarmed expression gave flora some satisfaction but not enough she went back to her office and stared in dismay at the mountain of paperwork awaiting her there shed wanted to go visit david at the pennsylvania hospital but she wouldnt have the chance not today not if she was going to do the job shed been elected to do duty ran strong in her if she couldnt take the time to visit she could telephone when the hospital operator answered she said this is congresswoman hamburger id like to speak to one of the doctors seeing my brother in this matter she did not hesitate to use her influence she could learn from the doctor but she couldnt make him do anything he wouldnt have otherwise except talk to her please wait maam the operator said as flora had known she would flora impatiently drummed her fingers on the broad oak surface of the desk this is dr hanrahan congresswoman a mans voice said at last flora brightened of all davids doctors hanrahan seemed the most open we tried fitting a prosthesis on your brother this morning the stump isnt ready yet im afraid but he tolerated the padded end of the artificial leg better than he has things are healing in there no doubt about it and it was very good to see david upright if only for a little while tears stung her eyes i wish i could have been there to see that she said how soon will he be walking how well will he walk no way to tell how soon hanrahan said i wish we had some better way to fight infection than we do but his body will have to win that battle how wellhes always going to have a rolling motion to his stride maam thats the way the knee joint on the prosthesis works but i hope hell be able to get by without even a cane alevai flora said which surely meant nothing to an irishman she returned to english i hope youre right that would help a lot she wondered if it would help enough for her brother ever to find a wife maybe hanrahan was thinking along with her for he said a lot of good men got wounded in this war miss hamburger people wont hold injuries against them not nearly so much as they did before the fighting started you dont mind my saying so there ought to be a law against people who do dumb things like that anyhow i am going to write that down dr hanrahan flora said and she did the democrats no doubt would scream that such laws were not the federal governments job the only federal laws they liked readied the country for war maybe she could make them think about the aftermath of war too after she got off the telephone with the doctor she attacked the papers on her desk only to be interrupted by bertha her secretary who said congressman blackford would like to see you miss hamburger flora blinked but nodded into the inner office came hosea blackford a wide smile on his handsome face from everything i hear flora you sent mr lansing home with a tin can tied to his tail thats not easy hes a clever fellow yes i saw that flora said but if he insists on treating everyone else like an idiot hes not as smart as he thinks he is a song one could sing about a great many people from tr on down blackford said but what one could do and what one does are often different one thing youve become since you got here flora is the conscience of the congress nobody had ever called her anything like that before she felt herself flush and hoped blackford couldnt see her blushing thank you very much she said at last im just doing the best i can her smile was wry there have been times when youve said i was trying to do too much not here not now the congressman from dakota answered maybe i was wrong before too but certainly not now youll have given lansing and roosevelt both something to think about he hesitated then changed the subject will you let me take you out to supper to celebrate a splendid day of witness grilling flora hesitated too the memory of herman brucks pestering still grated on her but blackford was as smooth as bruck back in new york city wished he were an invitation to supper was not necessarily an invitation to anything else though it wasnt necessarily not such an invitation either well she always had a hatpin all right she said blackford ate shad at the bellevuestratford hotel not far from city hall i never got seafood in dakota but i make up for it here he said if only oysters were in season flora would never have thought of eating an oyster no matter how secular she became she contented herself with a beefsteak that did indeed provoke contentment over supper she told blackford of the idea shed got from dr hanrahan his eyes glowed i think we can pass that he said the democrats wont want peoplepeople like us for instanceto say they dont care about cripples no especially when their war made so many cripples flora scowled and speaking against it is useless everyone says but we won you warned me it would be that way i didnt believe it but you were right i wish id been wrong but thats the way the world works blackford beckoned to the waiter let me have the bill please he drove them back to the apartment building where they both lived it was natural for them to go upstairs together when their flats were across the hall from each other thank you for a very nice evening flora said in the hallway thank you for your excellent ideasand for your excellent company hosea blackford tipped his hat then leaned forward and kissed flora on the mouth he drew back before she even thought of yanking out a hatpin instead of trying to get into her apartment he went into his own good night he said and shut the door good night flora said slower than she should have she went into her own apartment locking the door behind her then she sat down on the frontroom sofa her thoughts whirled shed been glad of the kiss blackford was twice her age and a gentile to boot but shed been glad of the kiss she was too honest with herself to deny it and she was far too surprised and confused to have any idea what it meant she wished her familys apartment had a telephone but it didnt all she could do was go to bed and think and think and think after rumbling through tennessee inside a barrel colonel irving morrell found philadelphia mild and dry by comparison to anyone coming from anywhere else the de facto capital of the united states would have been its usual hot muggy summer self for once morrell was not sorry to return to the general staff with the shooting over the action such as it was would be here he sat in a little room with a littler window and an overhead fan doing a desultory job of stirring the air good to see you again colonel general leonard wood said you being one of our leading experts on barrels we want your ideas on how thoroughly to restrict the csa in building and deploying them sir my view on that is very simple morrell said i think we ought to forbid them to have anything to do with barrels on pain of war the more of them they have the more they do with them the more trouble theyll cause us those machines knock everything we thought we knew about defense in war into a cocked hat the chief of the us general staff frowned that wont be easy they have a sizable motorcar industry a plant that manufactures motorcars wont have any great trouble turning out barrels too yes sir i understand that morrell said if i had my way though id put that in the treaty no barrels i expect theyll cheat or try to cheat as soon as we catch them at it id take a new bite out of arkansas or texas or tennesseeand make them cough up the barrels too do that once and they arent so likely to take a chance on our doing it twice brigadier general mason patrick who wore a pilots wings on his left breast pocket said i told you the same thing in regard to aeroplanes didnt i general wood he nodded to morrell good to see theres someone else with his head on his shoulders we just licked these bastards i want to kick em while theyre down if they build up to where they can take another whack at us in ten or fifteen years weve wasted a lot of lives since leonard wood sighed the other side of the coin is if they sit tight for ten or fifteen years and then start building barrels and aeroplanes and submersibles and all the other tools of war we dont want them to have will we have the will to go in and set a foot on their necks or will we say look how much trouble we had beating them the last time theyve only got a few of these little toys so why should we worry about them thats what makes me wake up sweating of nights philadelphia is what makes me wake up sweating of nights said general patrick who had just come down from canada morrell stared at wood in a kind of horror hed never known on the battlefield sir as long as teddy roosevelt is president that gives us till march wood broke in march if he decides he wants a third term and if the people remember to be grateful after tr isnt president any morewhat then we spent a generation twiddling our thumbs after the war of secession we could do it again all the more reason to punish the rebels now sir morrell said the farther they have to climb the harder itll be for them bully brigadier general patrick clapped his hands together general wood this pup said it better than i could hes a bright lad wood said and morrell felt as if hed been given the accolade but the chief of the general staff went on the harder we hold the confederates down the more we make them hate us and want to get their own back i honestly dont see the problem sir morrell said they already hate us the same way we hated them before the war somebody licks you of course you hate him what we have to do is make sure they cant hurt us no matter how much they hate us general wood sighed again ive been in touch with general ludendorff in berlin if it makes you gentlemen feel any better our friends the germans are having these same sorts of arguments about how rough they should be on france the csa will have an easier time cheating than france will though morrell said hows that wood said i dont follow france isnt even as big as texas morrell said it is now general patrick said we carved a good chunk off texas when we made the state of houston how much will germany carve off france morrell gave the man he thought was his ally an annoyed look this was not the time for nitpicking precision having got the glare out of his system he resumed be that as it may the confederate states are a lot larger than france even after theyve lost houston and sequoyah and kentucky they have more room to hide armaments than the frogs do and they could go down into the empire of mexico too mason patrick said the only way wed hear about anything down there is by luck hell half the time the damn greasers dont know whats going on inside their own country so how are we supposed to we have more ways than youd think as a matter of fact general wood said but never mind that i take the point so you gentlemen agree we should squeeze the rebels till their eyes pop do you yes sir morrell and brigadier general patrick said in the same breath well im hearing that from the navy department too i will admit wood said they want to go and bombard charleston and habana and new orleans if the rebels ever even think of building submersibles again that sounds good to me morrell said wood looked grim as a matter of fact it sounds good to me too we had a destroyer the ericsson torpedoed the night after the csa quit the war the royal navy swears up and down that they had no boats anywhere near her if i had to guess id say a rebel skipper thought he could get away with onebut i cant prove it mind and the confederates deny everything i hadnt heard that before sir morrell said slowly were keeping it under wraps the chief of the general staff said dont see what else to do cant prove it as i say filthy piece of business morrell realized his right hand had folded into a fist he made it open they ever catch that rebif it was a rebthey ought to hang him you get no arguments from me wood said but back to the matter at hand in your view we allow the rebs enough in the way of guns to keep order inside their borders and put up a halfway decent fight in case mexico decides to invade them morrell let out a wry snort if mexico invades them sir they can shout for help as far as im concerned as he spoke he worried at the thought general wood had put in his mind how long could any country especially a republic like the usa keep watch on a neighbor sooner or later the voters would tire of the effort vigilance took when they did or maybe even before they did the onetime enemy would begin to rebuild and become an enemy once more we have to do the best we can he said at last we have to do the best we can for as long as we can if we drop the ball later on or if our kids do thats one thing but if we drop the ball now we dont deserve to have won the war thats the way it looks to me too mason patrick said the day the confederate states start building aeroplanes with machine guns in them again youll be able to see the next war from there very well thank you for your thoughts general colonel they will go into our recommendations to president roosevelt i assure you wood said morrell and patrick stood up to go casually wood went on colonel could you give me another minute or so of your time of course morrell answered he waited till the aviation officer had gone then asked whats up sir colonel president roosevelt has asked me to give you a choice of assignments in recognition of your outstanding service to your country wood said you may if you like remain in the field the president is keenly aware of how much you enjoy the strenuous life as he does himself yes sir i do morrell said i cant imagine a choice that would be preferable to staying in the field let me see if i can give you one wood said with a smile how would you like to have charge of what we might as well call the barrel works its plain the machines arent everything they ought to be its just as plain nobody has a sounder notion of doctrine for them or more experience with them in the field than you do what do you say to a free hand at making them better what do i say morrell asked the question as much of himself as of leonard wood he glared at the chief of the general staff sir with all due respect i say damn thats a job that needs doing its a job i can do its a job i should do because as you say i can do it well he hesitated grasping at a straw unless youd rather have colonel sherrard he recommended you wood said his opinion was that you had a better feel for all the issues involved than he did he said he never could have conceived much less brought off the crossing of the cumberland you did and that makes you the man for the slot hes extraordinarily generous morrell scowled hed never known this mix of elation and disappointment when would he ever get away to the woods and the mountains again sir youre right its such an important position that if you believe im the best man to fill it i dont see how i can possibly decline i was hoping you would say that colonel general wood replied the more work we do on barrels while were holding the confederate states downholding them down as best we can i should saythe further ahead of them well be and the harder the time theyll have catching up with us yes sir morrell said enthusiastically ive got some ideas i want to try and if we get far enough ahead of them maybe theyll never be able to catch up again youre reading my mind leonard wood said thats just what im hoping for solemnly the two men shook hands every train that pulled into st matthews south carolina brought a few more soldiers home some from virginia some from tennessee some from the distant battlefields west of the mississippi the men in beatup butternut tunics and trousers got off the trains and looked around the station looked around the slowly rebuilding town in worn wonder as if amazed even so much peace as st matthews provided was left in the world anne colleton saw a lot of the returning soldiers for she spent much of her time at the station waiting for her brother to get off one of those trains she didnt trust tom to wire ahead letting her know he was coming and sure enough one morning he stopped down from a passenger car looking about as battered about as bewildered as any other soldier anne had seen he looked even more bewildered when she threw herself into his arms what the devil are you doing here he demanded i wanted to surprise you didnt work this time anne said i wanted to surprise you and i got what i wanted she kissed him on the cheek some of the whiskers in the scar that seamed it were coming in white you generally do tom said after a moment with more of an edge to his voice than would have been there before the war then he sighed and shrugged wethe csa i meangenerally got what we wanted too not this time come back to my rooms with me anne said theres one more thing i want and you can help me get it can i her brother shrugged again ill come with you though why not with marshlands burned i havent got anywhere else to stay he walked through the streets of st matthews with his shoulders slumped but his eyes darting now here now there ever alert waiting and watching for shooting to start its not that bad anne said quietly we hit the niggers a good lick not so long ago one more good lick and theyre done i think wasnt worrying about reds tom colleton answered with an embarrassed chuckle i was worrying about damnyankees when they got back to her apartment anne poured him some whiskey hoping to ease him he drank it down but still seemed nervous as a cat pointing at her he asked whats this other thing you want sis another good lick against the reds anne said at once when we hit them from this side they go deeper into the swamp over by gadsden the militia on the other side of the congaree are worthless the redscassius and his pals mindwhip them every time they bump together get me another drink will you tom said and anne rose while she was pouring her brother went on how do i help you get it i figure i do or you wouldnt have mentioned it to me why lieutenant colonel colleton of course you do she said handing him the drink and its because youre lieutenant colonel colleton that you do i want you to recruit as many veterans as you can arm them and take most of them across to the north side of the congaree dont you think theyd be able to clean out the nest of reds thats been in the swamp the past year and a half if they cant the confederate states are in even more trouble than i reckoned they were whiskey hadnt fuzzed toms wits he asked what happens to the soldiers i dont take over to gadsden they stay on this side of the swamp anne answered you drive the niggers into them and they finish off any you dont get tom considered then slowly nodded and who commands the stayathomes i do his sister told him she waited for him to pitch a fit he didnt odds are youd be better at the job than any man i can think of he said slowly are you sure you wouldnt rather have the post you just assigned medriving i mean instead of catching anne shook her head you have much more real combat experience than i do she answered and youll be leading men who wont know so much about what ive done since the uprising because they havent been here to see it ill keep a lot of militiamen too theyre used to doing what i tell them and it should rub off on the soldiers youve got it all figured out dont you tom raised his glass have one yourself sis seems to me youve earned it anne got a glass of whiskey too but stared moodily at it instead of drinking right away the one thing i dont have figured out is how to be sure we kill cassius he killed jacob and he almost killed meand he wrecked marshlands hes kept the reds a going concern since we drove them back into the swamp and he knows the place better than anybody if we dont get him well only have to go back again later on kill the head and the body dies tom said anne nodded she knocked back the whiskey it snarled its way down her throat tom spoke with a certain grim anticipation kill enough of the body and the head wont live either he went about recruiting with both skill and persistence he wouldnt have shown before hed joined the army nor did he have any trouble gathering followers the exsoldiers hardly seemed to think of themselves as ex they obeyed his orders as readily as they would have done if still serving under the stars and bars anne couldnt help noting that with a touch of resentment when she thought of the cajolery shed had to use to get the militiamen to go along with her ideas even though theyd had none of their own a few negro soldiers came back to st matthews too tom colleton did not recruit themwho could guess which of them had fought for the congaree socialist republic no one quite knew what to make of them or how to behave toward them anne vowed to worry about that later for now she hoped none of st matthews blacks was bringing the rebels in the swamp word of the move against them she and the militia and some of toms recruits headed in the direction of marshlands and the swamps beyond as ostentatiously as they could hoping to draw as much attention to themselves as they could once at the edge of the ruined cotton fields the veterans automatically began to entrench she didnt argue in such matters she was willing to assume they knew what they were doing some of them laughed at the beatup old aeroplane buzzing above the swamp jesus i wish the damnyankees had been flying crates like that a sergeant said if the other side hasnt got any aeroplanes ours doesnt have to be up to date anne answered coolly no one she noted laughed at the pair of threeinch guns that deployed behind the infantry one veteran in fact respectfully tipped his tin hat to them as to a couple of old friends veterans and militiamen were still deploying when a brisk crackle of smallarms fire broke out to the north although anne knew shed chambered a round in her own tredegar she checked again to make sure the weapon was ready the aeroplane flew in the direction of the shooting a couple of minutes later the militiamen at the field guns began banging away presumably at instruction they got from the wireless telegraph the flying machine carried perhaps fifteen minutes after that a couple of ragged negroes a man and a woman emerged from the swamp a few hundred yards from anne both carried rifles both looked around to find the best road for escape they did not look long they found no escape a volley from the men in the new trenches knocked them over the man never moved after he fell the woman twitched for a little while then lay still before long another pair of negroes both men this time came trotting south as if they had not a care in the world the veterans and militiamen let them approach to near pointblank range before shooting them down a savage smile stretched across anne colletons face the reds had never met a trap with jaws on both north and south before come on cassius she crooned quietly come on some of the negro rebels in the swamp seeing the last bastion of the congaree socialist republic crumbling would fight to the death defending it having known cassius all her life not so well as shed thought she did but even so she did not believe he would be one of them his eye was always on the main chance as long as he lived he would figure the revolution lived too that held an unpleasant amount of truth he would try to escape a few more reds blundered out of the undergrowth and died before the rest realized the sort of trap they were in that was too late by then from the sounds of the gunfire toms men had drawn a good semicircle around them the only way out lay to the southand that was no way out either anne felt like alexander the great or julius caesar or robert e lee the whole design was hers and it was working paint a picture write a book she shook her head using men not paint or words to createthat beat everything but the men of the congaree socialist republic had tried to create using mens lives as their canvas too now realizing what sort of obstruction barred them from breaking free of their pursuers they tried once more in their own way they were also veterans and veteran bushwhackers to boot that made them too wily to charge headlong at their foes position but they had to get through it or they would never go anywhere again at a shouted word of commandwas that cassius voicethey attacked the trench line damnyankees couldnt have done it better a veteran said admiringly once the shooting was over the negroes advanced by rushes one group firing from cover to let another leapfrog past them then moving forward in turn a man next to anne staggered back with a gurgling croak clutching at his throat she spared him not a glanceshe was drawing a bead on a red the tredegar slammed against her shoulder the back of the black mans head blew out she worked the bolt and fired again for a few minutes the fighting was very hot the red rebels battled for escape with desperate courage annes men had skill anger and position on their side the negroes got into the trenches even so that was a worse business than shed ever imagined screams and shouts and bullets whippingseveral right past her headand the iron smell of blood and the outhouse stink of guts spilled in the mud the negroes got into the trenches they did not get past them not anywhere the veterans and militiamen outnumbered and outgunned them a handful of reds tried to flee back toward the swamp anne didnt think any of them made it cautiously her men began showing themselves they drew no fire she went up and down the trenches inspecting negro corpses she did not find cassius body cursing she blew out the brains of a black who wasnt quite dead had the revolutionary leader slipped through her net again halfway through the afternoon the veterans whod slogged down from gadsden began coming out of the swamp they had no prisoners with them when tom emerged so filthy she hardly knew who he was she cried cassius got away again oh no he didnt her brother grinned at her i shot him myself all she felt was envy bitter and poisonous as prussic acid god damn you she shouted i should have done it jacob was my brother too anne tom said quietly and that brought her back to herself anyhow you got cherry he went on cassius now cassius was sneaky to the last instead of coming south he tried to wait for my men to go on past him then he could have headed north and been home free hed done it in fact or he thought he had but i kept a few backstops and i was one because i had to drag myself out of some quicksand i was behind a cypress when along he came a big smile on his face cause hed outfoxed us but not this time i put two in his chest from inside thirty yards before he knew i was there he was still smiling when he fell in the water he wont come out again sis anne colleton heaved a long long sigh its over thenthe congaree socialist republic and cassius too i wonder if scipios dead in the swamp with him but i dont care so much about scipio cassius was the big fish tom agreed hes feeding the fish now its over anne repeated this whole stretch of south carolina can start picking up the pieces now the confederate states will have to start picking up the pieces now she looked north not into the swamp but far beyond weve got the damnyankees to catch up with after all thegreatwar

times between the wars thegreatwar breakthroughs read on for a preview of american empire blood and iron the first book in a new series by harry turtledove available in bookstores everywhere when the great war ended jake featherston had thought the silence falling over the battlefield as strange and unnatural as machinegun fire in richmond on a sunday afternoon now sitting at the bar of a saloon in the confederate capital a few weeks later he listened to the distant rattle of a machine gun nodded to himself and took another pull at his beer wonder who theyre shooting at this time the barkeep remarked before turning away to pour a fresh whiskey for another customer hope its the niggers jake set a hand on the grip of the artillerymans pistol he wore on his belt wouldnt mind shooting a few myself by jesus they shoot back these days the bartender said featherston shrugged people had called him a lot of different things during the war but nobody had ever called him yellow the battery of the first richmond howitzers hed commanded had held longer and retreated less than any other guns in the army of northern virginia much good it did me he muttered much good it did anything hed still been fighting the damnyankees from a good position back of fredericksburg virginia when the confederate states finally threw in the sponge he went over to the freelunch counter and slapped ham and cheese and pickles on a slice of nonetoofresh bread the bartender gave him a pained look it wasnt the first time hed raided the counter nor the second either he normally didnt give two whoops in hell what other people thought but this place was right around the corner from the miserable little room hed found he wanted to be able to keep coming here reluctantly he said give me another beer too he pulled a couple of brown dollar banknotes out of his pocket and slid them across the bar beer had only been a dollar a glass when he got into town or a quarter in specie before the war even through most of the war it had only been five cents as long as he was having another glass he snagged a couple of hardboiled eggs from the freelunch spread to go with his sandwich hed eaten a lot of saloon free lunches since coming home to richmond they werent free but they were the cheapest way he knew to keep himself fed a couple of rifle shots rang out closer than the machine gun had been any luck at all thats the war department jake said sipping at the new beer lot of damn fools down there nobodyd miss amen said the fellow down the bar who was drinking whiskey like featherston he wore butternut uniform trousers with a shirt that had seen better days though his unlike jakes did boast a collar plenty of bastards in there who dont deserve anything better than a blindfold and a cigarette letting us lose the war like that waste of cigarettes you ask me but what the hell jake took another pull at his beer it left him feeling generous in tones of great concession he said all right give em a smoke then shoot em plenty of bastards in congress too the bartender put in he was plump and bald and had a white mustache so he probably hadnt been in the trenches or just behind them even so he went on in tones of real regret if they hadnt fired on the marchers in capitol square last week reckon we might have seen some proper housecleaning featherston shook his head wouldnt matter for beans i say what do you mean it wouldnt matter the whiskeydrinking veteran demanded stringing a couple dozen congressmen to lampposts wouldnt matter go a long way toward making things better i think wouldnt jake said stubbornly could hang em all and it wouldnt matter theyd go and pick new congressmen after you did and who would they be more rich sons of bitches who never worked a day in their lives or got their hands dirty men of good family he loaded that with scorn same kind of jackasses they got in the war department if you want to hear gods truth he was not anyones notion of a classical orator with graceful carefully balanced sentences and smooth elegant gestures he was skinny and rawboned and awkward with a sharp nose a sharper chin and a harsh voice but when he got rolling he spoke with an intensity that made anyone who heard him pay attention what do you reckon ought to happen then the barkeep asked tear it all down jake said in tones that brooked no argument tear it down and start over cant see what in gods name else to do not when the men of good family he sneered harder than everlet the niggers rise up and then let em into the army to run away from the damnyankees and then gave em the vote to say thankyou christ he tossed down the last of the beer and stalked out hed fired canister at retreating negro troopsand as the rot spread through the army of northern virginia at retreating white troops too it hadnt helped nothing had helped we should have licked the damnyankees fast he thought a long war let them pound on us till we broke he glared in the direction of the war department your fault not the soldiers fault yours he tripped on a brick and almost fell cursing he kicked it toward the pile of rubble from which it had come richmond was full of rubble rubble and ruins us bombing aeroplanes had paid repeated nighttime visits over the last year of the war even windows with glass in them were exceptions not the rule negro laborers with shovels cleared bricks and timbers out of the street where one faction or another that had sprung up since the war effort collapsed had built a barricade a soldier with a bayoneted tredegar kept them working theoretically richmond was under martial law in practice it was under very little law of any sort discharged veterans far outnumbered men still under government command and paid them no more heed than they had to three other negroes strode up the street toward jake they were not laborers like him they wore a motley mix of uniforms and civilian clothing also like him they were armed two carried tredegars they hadnt turned in at the armistice the third wore a holstered pistol they did not look like men who had run from the yankees they did not look like men who would run from anything their eyes swept over jake he was not a man who ran from anything either he walked through them instead of going around crazy white man one of them said as they walked on he didnt keep his voice down but he didnt say anything directly to jake either with his own business on his mind jake kept walking he passed by capitol square hed slept under the huge statue of albert sidney johnston the night he got into richmond he couldnt do that now troops in sandbagged machinegun nests protected the confederate capitol from the confederate people neatly printed no loitering signs had sprouted like mushrooms after a rain several bore handwritten addenda this means you bloodstains on the sidewalk underscored the point posters covered every wall the most common showed the stars and bars and the phrase peace order prosperity that one featherston knew came from the governments printing presses president semmes and his flunkies remained convinced that if they said everything was all right it would be all right black severed chains on red was another oftenrepeated theme the negroes red uprisings of late had been crushed but reds remained join us some of the posters shoutedan appeal from black to white not likely jake said and spat at one of those posters no more than a handful of confederate whites had joined the revolutionaries during the uprisings no more than a handful would ever join them of so much featherston was morally certain yet another poster showed george washington and the slogan we need a new revolution jake spotted only a couple of copies of that one which was put out by the freedom party till that moment jake had never heard of the freedom party he wondered if it had existed before the war ended he studied the poster slowly he nodded sure as hell do need a new revolution he said he had no great use for washington though washington had been president of the united states that made him suspect in jakes eyes but in spite of the crude illustration in spite of the cheap printing the message struck home and struck hard the freedom party sounded honest at any rate the ruling whigs were trying to heal an amputation with a sticking plaster the radical liberals as far as he was concerned played the same song in a different key as for the socialistshe spat at another red poster niggers and niggerlovers every one of them the bombthrowing maniacs wanted a revolution too but not the kind the country needed he peered more closely at the freedom party poster it didnt say where the party headquarters were or how to go about joining his lip curled goddamn amateurs he said one thing spending his whole adult life in the army had taught him the virtue of organization with a shrug he headed back toward his mean little room if the freedom party didnt know how to attract any members odds were it wasnt worth joining no matter how good its ideas they didnt matter if nobody could find out about them even the damned socialists knew that much too bad he muttered too stinking bad congressional elections were coming this fall a shame the voters couldnt send the cheaters and thieves in the capitol the right kind of message back in the roomhed had plenty of more comfortable bivouacs on campaignhe wrote for a while in a gray eagle scratchpad hed picked up the habit toward the end of the war over open sights he called the work in progress it let him set down some of his anger on paper once the words were out they didnt fester quite so much in his mind he might have killed somebody if he hadnt had a release like this when day came he went out looking for work colored laborers werent the only ones clearing rubble in richmond not by a long chalk he hauled bricks and dirt and chunks of broken stone from not long after sunrise to just before sunset the strawboss of course paid off in paper money though his own pockets jingled knowing the banknotes would be worth less tomorrow than they were today jake made a beeline for the local saloon and the freelunch counter hed drawn better rations in the army too but he was too hungry to care as before the barkeep gave him a reproachful look for making a pig of himself as before he bought a second beer to keep the fellow happy or not too unhappy he was stuffing a pickled tomato into his mouth when the fellow with whom hed talked politics the day before came in and ordered himself a shot then he made a run at the free lunch too they got to talking again featherston learned his name was hubert slattery after a while jake mentioned the freedom party posters hed seen to his surprise slattery burst out laughing oh them he said my brother took a look at those fellows but he didnt want any part of em by what horace told me theres only four or five of em and they run the whole party out of a shoebox but theyve got posters and everything jake protested startled to find how disappointed he was not good posters mind you but posters only reason they do is that one of ems a printer the other veteran told him they meet in this little dive on seventh near canal most of the way toward the tredegar steel works you want to waste your time pal go see em for yourself maybe i will featherston said hubert slattery laughed again but that just made him more determined by god maybe i will congresswoman flora hamburger clapped her hands together in delight dr hanrahans smile was broader than a lot of those seen at the pennsylvania hospital and david hamburger intense concentration on his face brought his cane forward and then took another step on his artificial leg how does it feel flora asked her younger brother stumps not too sore he answered panting a little but its harder work than i thought it would be you havent been upright since you lost your leg dr hanrahan reminded him come on give me another step you can do it david did and nearly fell hanrahan steadied him before flora could youve got to swing the prosthesis out so the knee joint locks and takes your weight when you straighten up on it the doctor said you dont learn that the leg wont work thats why everybody with an amputation above the knee walks like a sailor who hasnt touched land in a couple of years but you are walking david flora said she dropped from english into yiddish danken gott dafahr omayn seeing her brother on his feetor on one foot of his and one of wood and metal and leatherdid a little to ease the guilt that had gnawed at her ever since he was wounded nothing would ever do more than a little after her new york city district sent her to congress shed had the chance to slide david from the trenches to a quiet post behind the lines he wouldnt have wanted her to do that but she could have shed put socialist egalitarianism above family tiesand this was the result her brother shrugged awkwardly i only need one foot to operate a sewingmachine treadle i wont starve when i go homeand i wont have to sponge off your congresswomans salary either he gave her a wry grin as a us representative flora made a year far more than the rest of her family put together she didnt begrudge sharing the money with her parents and brothers and sisters and she knew david knew she didnt he took a brotherly privilege in teasing her he also took a brotherly privilege in picking her brains whats the latest on the peace with the rebs she grimaced for a couple of reasons for one he hadnt called the confederates by that scornful nickname before he went into the army for anotherpresident roosevelt is still being very hard and very stubborn i can understand keeping some of the territory we won from the csa but all hes willing to restore is the stretch of tennessee south of the cumberland we took as fighting wound down and he wont give that back he wants to trade it for the little piece of kentucky the confederates still hold bully for him david exclaimed he had been a good socialist before he went off to war now a lot of the time he sounded like a hidebound democrat of the roosevelt stripe that distressed flora too she went on and hes not going to let them keep any battleships or submersibles or military aeroplanes or barrels and hes demanded that they limit their army to a hundred machine guns bully this time her brother and dr hanrahan said it together flora looked from one of them to the other in exasperation and he wont come a dime below two billion dollars in reparations all of it to be paid in specie or in steel or oil at prices thats a crushing burden to lay on the proletariat of the confederate states i hope it crushes them david said savagely knock on wood theyll never be able to lift a finger against us again instead of knocking on the door or on a window sill he used his own artificial leg which drove home the point flora had given up trying to argue with him he had his full share of the hamburger familys stubbornness instead she turned to dr hanrahan and asked how much longer will he have to stay here now that hes started to get back on his feet he should be able to leave in about a month provided he makes good progress and provided the infection in the stump doesnt decide to flare up again hanrahan said flora nodded shed seen he gave her straight answers he finished with a brisk nod well shoot for november first then after giving her brother a careful hug and an enthusiastic kiss flora left the pennsylvania hospital fall was in the air sure enough some of the leaves in the trees on the hospital grounds were beginning to turn she flagged a cab the congressional office building she told the driver yes maam he touched the shiny leather brim of his cap put the oldsmobile in gear and went out to do battle with philadelphia traffic the traffic won as it often did philadelphia had been the de facto capital of the usa since the confederates bombarded washington during the second mexican war more than thirtyfive years before starting even before then a great warren of federal buildings had gone up in the center of town getting to them was not always for the faint of heart i have a message for you said floras secretary a plump middleaged woman named bertha she waved a piece of paper congressman blackford wants you to call him back does he flora said as neutrally as she could all right ill do that thank you she went into her inner office and closed the door after her she didnt turn around to see whether bertha was smiling behind her back she hoped not but she didnt really want to know dakota a solidly socialist state had been returning hosea blackford to the house since flora was a girl he was about twice her age now a senior figure in the party even if on the soft side ideologically as far as she was concerned and he was a widower whose philadelphia apartment lay right across the hall from hers he had left no doubt he was interested in her though hed never done anything to tempt her into defending herself with a hatpin to her own surprise she found herself interested in return even if he was both a moderate and a gentile now she muttered as she picked up the telephone and waited for the operator to come on the line is he calling about party business orsomething else hello flora blackford said when the call went through i just wanted to know if you had seen the newspaper stories about strikes in ohio and indiana and illinois party business then im afraid i havent flora said i just got back from visiting david how is he blackford asked theyve fitted the artificial leg and he was up on it flora shook her head though blackford couldnt see that even with one leg gone he talks like a democrat she inked a pen and slid a piece of paper in front of her so she could take notes now tell me about these strikes from what ive read factory owners are trying to hold down wages by pitting workers against each other he said with soldiers starting to come home from the war they have more people wanting jobs than there are jobs to give so theyre seeing who will work for the lowest pay that sounds like capitalists flora said with a frown a moment later she brightened it also sounds like a political opportunity for us if the factory owners keep doing things like thatand they probably willtheyll radicalize the workers and theyll do a better job of it than we ever could i happen to know weve urged the strikers to stay as peaceful as they can unless the bosses turn goons loose on them or their state governments or the us government move troops against them blackford said good flora nodded blackford couldnt see that either but she didnt care something hed said touched off another thought has roosevelt made any statement about this yet one of the wire reports quotes him as calling the factory owners a pack of greedy fools the congressman from dakota said but it doesnt say hell do anything to make them stop playing games with peoples lives that sounds like him flora said he talks about a square deal for the workers but he doesnt deliver he delivered a war he delivered a victory hosea blackford corrected the country was starved for one the countrys been starved for one for more than fifty years you may not like that but you cant stick your head in the sand and pretend it isnt so i dont intend to do any such thing flora said sharply the people were starved for a victory ive seen as much even with my own brother but after a while theyll discover they have the victory and theyre still starved and still maimed and still orphaned and theyll remember teddy roosevelt delivered that too blackfords silence was thoughtful after a few seconds he said you may very well be right he did his best to hold down the excitement in his voice but she heard it if you are right that would give us a fighting chance in the elections of and maybe even in a lot of people now are afraid well be so badly swamped the democrats will have everything their own way everywhere a lot of things can happen between now and the congressional elections she said even more things can happen between now and thats true too blackford said but youve seen how many socialists are wearing long faces these days even senator debs is looking gloomy maybe they should cheer up maybe the real troubleflora took a deep breathis that weve never won a presidential election weve never had a majority in either house of congress too many people i think dont really believe we ever can ive had doubts myself blackford admitted being permanently in the minority is hard to stomach sometimes if you know what i mean oh yes flora said quietly im jewish if youll remember on the lower east side in new york city jews were a majority everywhere else in the country everywhere else in the world permanently in the minority was as polite a way to put it as shed ever heard she wondered if reminding blackford she was jewish would make him decide he wasnt interested in her after all she wondered if she wanted him to decide that in many ways her life would be simpler if he did with a large family though shed rarely known a simple life would she want it or know what to do with it if she had it the only thing blackford said was of course i remember it means i have to eat crab cakes and pork chops by myself his voice held nothing but a smile would you care to have dinner with me tonight if you like i wont eat anything that offends you im not offended if you eat things i cant flora said any more than an irishman or an italian would be offended if i ate corned beef on friday id be offended if you tried to get me to eat pork but youd never do anything like that i should hope not blackford exclaimed you still havent said whether youll have dinner with me though id like to flora said can we wait till after six though ive got a shirtwaist manufacturer coming in to see me at five and i aim to give him a piece of my mind sixthirty say would be fine shall i come to your office all right flora smiled im looking forward to it she hung up the telephone and went to work feeling better about the world than she had in some time reginald bartlett was discovering that he did not fit into the richmond of late nearly so well as he had in fighting on the roanoke valley front and in sequoyah getting captured twice and shot once shot twice too actually in the leg and the shoulder from the same machinegun burst by the yankees had left him a different man from the jaunty young fellow whod gaily gone off to war richmond was different too then it had been bursting with july exuberance and confidence now the chilly winds of october sliding into november fit the citys mood only too well defeat and autumn went together going to rain tomorrow i reckon reggie said to bill foster as the two druggists assistants walked along seventh street together he reached up with his right hand to touch his left shoulder says so right here foster nodded which set his jowls wobbling he was short and round and dark where bartlett was above average height on the skinny side and skinnier after his wound and blond he said i heard enough people say that in the trenches and they were right a lot of the time hed spent his war in kentucky and tennessee and come home without a scratch after touching his shoulder again reggie said this isnt so much of a much hed had a different opinion while the wound stayed hot and full of pus but hed been a long way from objective fellow i worked for before the war man name of milo axelrod he stopped a bullet with his face up in maryland he wasnt a bad bossbetter than this mcnally im working for now anyhow from what youve said about mcnally that wouldnt be hard foster might have gone on but a small crowd had gathered at the corner of seventh and cary he pointed i wonder whats going on there shall we find out without waiting for an answer from his friend reggie hurried over toward the crowd shrugging foster followed oh i see bartlett said a moment later its a political rally that figures with the congressional election next tuesday but what the devil is the freedom party ive never heard of em before ive seen a couple of their posters bill foster said dont rightly know what they stand for though lets get an earful maybe itll be something good reggie scowled as his wounded leg gave a twinge which it hadnt done in a while couldnt be worse than the pap the radical liberals and the whigs are handing out thats about right foster nodded everybody whos in is making noise about how he never much cared for the war and everybody whos out is saying that if hed been in he never wouldve voted one thin dime for it and its all a pack of lies too bartlett said with deep contempt why dont they admit they were all screaming their heads off for the war when it started do they think weve forgotten and when arango ran against semmes for president two years ago he said hed do a better job of fighting the yankees than the whigs were he didnt say anything about getting out of the war not one word the freedom party spokesman didnt have a fancy platform or a fancy suit which proved he belonged to neither of the csas major parties he stood in his shirtsleeves on a box or a barrel of some kind and harangued the couple of dozen people who were listening to him traitors to their country he was shouting as reggie and bill foster came up traitors and fools thats what they are a crackpot bartlett whispered he folded his arms across his chest and got ready to listen lets hang around for a while he may be funny somebody in the crowd already thought he was funny calling by what youre saying there the whole government is nothing but traitors and fools youve got to be a fool yourself to believe that i do not the speaker said he was an overweight balding fellow of about fiftyfive whose fringe of gray hair blew wildly in the fall breeze his name was anthony dresserso said a little sign reggie needed a while to notice i do not i tell you the plain unvarnished truth and nothing else but his eyes enormous behind thick spectacles stared out at his small audience and you my friends you hug the viper to your bosom and think it is your friend congress is full of traitors the war department is full of traitors the administration reggie stopped paying much attention to him about then and the moon is full of green cheese the heckler shouted drawing a roar of laughter from the crowd dresser sputtered and fumed the thread of his speech had it ever had one now thoroughly lost reggie and foster grinned at each other enjoying his discomfiture the speech surely would have been boring this was anything but not as easy to get up on the stump as the old boy thought is it foster said with a chuckle you are all traitors to your country for not listening to the plain and simple truth dresser shouted furiously and youre a maniac and they ought to lock you up in the asylum and lose the key it wasnt the first heckler but another man dresser looked to be on the point of having a fit somebody reached up and tugged at his trousers he leaned over cupping a hand behind his ear then with a fine scornful snort he jumped down from his perch all right he said all right you show them then if you think you know so much i can tell you what you will show themyou will show them you do not have any notion of what to say or how to say it up onto the platform scrambled a lean man somewhere in his thirties in a day laborers collarless cotton shirt and a pair of uniform pants he looked around for a moment then said tonys right a blind man should be able to see it too the government is full of traitors and fools dresser had been argumentative querulous the newcomer spoke with absolute conviction so much so that before he caught himself reginald bartlett looked north toward capitol square as if to spy the traitors in the act yeah you cant prove it either any more than the other jerk could a heckler yelled you want proof ill give you proof by jesus the lean man said he didnt talk as if he had any great education but he didnt seem to feel the lack as did so many selfmade men look what happened when the red niggers rose up back at the end of they damn near overran the whole country now why is that do you reckon its on account of nobody in the whole stinking government had the least notion they were plotting behind our backs if that doesnt make everybody from the president on down a damn fool you tell me what in the hell it does do hes got something by god foster said staring at the new speaker hes got a lot of nerve anyhow reggie said thats why you ought to vote for tony dresser for congress the lean man continued on account of he can see the plain truth and you cant now the next thing youre going to say is well theyre a pack of fools up there all right with their fancy motorcars and their whores but they cant be traitors because they fought as long as they could and the yankees are pretty damn tough well this here is what ive got to say about that the lean man let loose with a rich ripe raspberry i know for a fact that people tried to warn the government the niggers were going to rise on account of i was one of those people did anybody listen hell no contempt dripped from his voice like water from a leaky roof some of those niggers were servants to rich mens sons important mens sons and the rich men in the capitol and the important men in the war department shoveled everything under the rug if that doesnt make em traitors what the devil does he has got something bill foster said in an awed voice hes got a big mouth bartlett said you throw charges like that around youd better be able to name names instead of naming names the newcomer on the stump charged ahead and after thatafter that mind you after the niggers rose upwhat did the government go and do come on you remember youre white men youre smart men what did they go and do the lean mans voice sank to a dramatic whisper they went and put rifles in those same niggers hands thats what they did he whispered no more but shouted furiously if that doesnt make em traitors what the devil does reggie remembered rehoboam the negro prisoner of war whod shared his us hospital ward after losing a foot in arkansasand after being a red rebel in mississippi things werent so straightforward as this new freedom party speaker made them out to be the older reggie got the more complicated the world looked the lean man was older than he but still saw things in harsh shades of black and white and he contrived to make his audience see them the same way you want to put tony dresser into congress to give the real people of the confederate states a voice he shouted the working men the men who get their hands dirty the men who went out and fought the war the fools and the traitors and the niggerlovers got us into oh you can throw your vote away for somebody with a diamond on his pinkywith alarming effectiveness he mimed a capitalistbut whos the fool if you do why the hell aint you runnin for congress instead of that longwinded son of a bitch somebody shouted tonys the chairman of the freedom party the lean man answered easily you promote the commander of the unit not a new recruit he took out his billfold and displayed something bartlett could not make out heres my membership cardnumber seven from back in september where do we sign up two men asked the question at the same time one of them added you aint gonna stay a new recruit long pal not the way you talk who the hell are you anyway my names featherstonjake featherston the lean man answered sergeant confederate states artillery retired he scowled the fools in the war department retired damn near the whole army with what looked like a deliberate effort of will he made himself smile party office is a couple blocks down seventh toward the tredegar works come on by hope you do anyways damned if im not tempted to bill foster said as the little rally began to break up damned if im not that fellow featherston hes got a good way of looking at things hes got a good line thats for certain reggie bartlett said if he were selling can openers door to door there wouldnt be a closed can in richmond this time tomorrow but just because something sounds good doesnt make it so come on bill do you think a stage magician really pulls a stonewall out of your nose wish somebodyd pull one out of somewhere foster answered reggies laugh was rueful fivedollar goldpieces being in notably short supply in his pockets too he said the worlds not as simple as he makes it out to be well what if it isnt his friend returned i wish it was that simple dont reckon im the only one who does either reckon youre not bartlett agreed but most folks are the same as you and me they know the difference between what they wish and whats really out there yeah foster raised an eyebrow how come we just fought this damn war then reggie thought about that for a while but found no good answer guided by a pilot intimately familiar with the local minefields the uss dakota made a slow cautious entrance into new york harbor sailors on tugs and freighters waved their caps at the battleship steam whistles bellowed and hooted fireboats shot streams of water high into the air sam carsten stood by the port rail enjoying the show the latenovember day was bleak and gloomy and cold but that didnt bother the petty officer at all anything more clement than clouds and gloom bothered him he was so blond and pink he sunburned in less time than he needed to blink after brazil entered the war on the side of the usa and germany and their allies the dakota had gone up into the tropical atlantic after convoys bound for britain from argentina he was only now recovering from what the cruel sun had done to him off to the west on bedloe island stood the great statue of remembrance the sword of vengeance gleaming in her hand carsten turned to his bunkmate and said seeing her gives you a whole different feeling now that weve gone and won the war sure as hell does vic crosetti nodded vigorously he was as small and swarthy as carsten was tall and fair every time i seen that statue before it was like she was saying what the hell you gapin at me for get out there and kick the damn rebs in the belly now we gone and done it cant you see the smile on that bronze broads kisser remembrance looked as cold and stern and forbidding as she had since shed gone up not long after the second mexican war even so carsten said yeah he and crosetti grinned at each other victory tasted sweet carsten somebody said behind him he turned and stiffened to attention sir as you were commander grady said and sam eased out of his brace the commander of the dakota s starboard secondary armament was a pretty good fellow sam cranked shells into the forwardmost fiveinch gun under his charge grady said do you recall that matter we were discussing the day the limeys gave up the fight for a moment carsten didnt then he nodded about aeroplanes you mean sir thats right grady nodded too were you serious about what you meant about getting in on the ground floor there yes sir i sure was sir sam answered aeroplanes were the coming thing anyone with an eye in his head could see that anyone with an eye in his head could also see the navy wouldnt stay as big as it had been during the war since sam wanted to make sure he didnt end up on the beach getting involved with aeroplanes looked like a good insurance policy commander grady said all right then i have some orders cut for you if youd said no youd have stayed here there wouldnt have been any trouble about that as things are though we both catch the train for boston tomorrow morning youll see why when we get there his smile made him look years younger youre leaving the dakota vic crosetti demanded when sam nodded crosetti clapped a hand to his forehead jesus christ whom i gonna rag on now i figure youll find somebody carsten said his voice dry crosetti gave him a dirty look that melted into a chuckle then slapped him on the back sam had a gift for getting in digs without making people angry at him only problem with this is the train ride commander grady said this spanish influenza thats going around is supposed to be pretty nasty we might be better staying aboard the dakota sir if the limeys couldnt sink us and the japs couldnt sink us and whoever was flying that damn bombing aeroplane out from argentina couldnt sink us i dont figure we need to be afraid of any germs sam said grady laughed thats the spirit all right carsten pick up your new orders get your paperwork taken care of and well go ashore tomorrow morningif you can stand an officer for company that is im a tough guy sir carsten answered i expect ill put up with it grady laughed and mimed throwing a punch at him then went on his way whats this about aeroplanes crosetti asked dont even know exactly sam said i joined the navy five years before the war started and here i am buying a pig in a poke maybe i need my head examined but maybe im smart too smart i mean besides getting away from you i hope i am anyway good luck i think youre crazy but good luck crosetti shook sams hand then walked off shaking his own head getting orders was the easy part of getting off the dakota carsten filled out endless separation forms only after the last of them was signed would the paymaster grudgingly give him greenbacks with money in his billfold and a duffel bag on his shoulder he walked down the gangplank from the dakota to the pier with commander grady even at the edge of the harbor new york boiled with life when grady flagged a cab for the ride to the new york central railroad depot three different automobiles almost ran him and sam down in the zeal for a fare the drivers hopped out and screamed abuse at one another in both english and a language that seemed entirely compounded of gutturals grady knew his way through the crowded old depot which was fortunate because sam didnt he had to step smartly to keep from being separated from the officer the only place where hed felt more crowded was the tripledecked bunkroom of the dakota everyone here was moving intent on his own business about every third man woman and child was sneezing or sniffling or coughing some of them were likely to have influenza carsten tried not to inhale that didnt work very well he and grady got a couple of seats in a secondclass car the navy saved money on train fares that way they were the only navy men there though soldiers in greengray occupied a fair number of seats the civilians ranged from drummers in cheap flashy suits to little old ladies who might still have been in russia once grady and carsten pulled into boston the officer paid for another cab ride this one over the charlestown bridge to the navy yard on the north side of the charles river seeing the battleships and cruisers and submersibles and tenders tied up there made sams heart swell with pride a few ships from the western squadron of germanys high seas fleet stood out from their american allies because of their less familiar lines and light gray paint jobs sam followed commander grady each of them with duffel bag bouncing on his back then all at once sam stopped in his tracks and stared and stared grady walked on for a couple of steps before he noticed he didnt have company any more he turned and looked back a grin on his rabbity features whats the matter carsten he asked sounding like a man trying hard not to laugh out loud sir sam said plaintively ive seen every type of ship in the us navy and i reckon damn near every type of ship in the high seas fleet too he pointed ahead in all my born days though ive never seen anything that looked like that and i hope to god i never do again what the hell is it supposed to be now grady did laugh out loud thats the remembrance carsten thats what you signed up for jesus sam said i must have been out of my goddamn mind the remembrance looked as if somebody had decided to build a battleship and then about a third of the way through the job got sick of it and decided to flatten out most of the deck to hurry things along an aeroplane sat on the deck aft of the bridge not a seaplane that would land in the water and be picked up by the ships crane but a wright twodecker fighting scouta us copy of a german albatroswith utterly ordinary landing gear and not a trace of a float anywhere sam shook his head in disbelief laughing still commander grady clapped him on the back cheer up it wont be so bad youll still mess forward and bunk aft and a fiveinch gun is a fiveinch gun he pointed to the sponson under that unbelievably long unbelievably level deck youll do your job and the flyboys will do theirs and everybody will be happy except the poor enemy bastards who bump into us yes sir sam said dubiously what the devil did she start out to be anyway and why didnt she turn out to be whatever that was they started to build her as a fast lightarmored battle cruiser to slide in close to the confederate coast blast hell out of it and then scoot before the rebs could do anything about ita monitor with legs you might say grady answered but that idea never went anywhere some bright boy got to thinking how handy it would be to take aeroplanes along wherever you needed them andtheres the remembrance i thought of that myself after the dakota got bombed off argentina carsten said but i never imaginedthis he wondered if hed get into fights because sailors on ordinary respectable vessels would call the remembrance the ugliest ship in the navy dammit she was the ugliest ship in the navy come on lets go aboard grady said she wont look anywhere near so strange from the inside even that didnt turn out to be true the hangars that held nearly three dozen fighting scouts and the supply and maintenance areas that went with them took up an ungodly amount of space leaving the bunkrooms cramped and feeling like afterthoughts as a petty officer carsten did get a bottom bunk but the middle one in the threetier metal structure was only a few inches above him he could stand it but he didnt love it the only place in which he did feel at home was the sponson the fiveinch gun was the same model hed served on the dakota and the sponson itself might have been transferred bodily from the battleship the chief gunners mate in charge of the crew a burly veteran named willie moore wore a splendid gray kaiser bill mustache he wasnt half brother to his counterpart from the dakota hiram kidde but sam couldnt have proved it by the way he acted he turned out to know kidde which surprised sam not at all if you served with the capn reckon youll do for me he rumbled when carsten mentioned the name of his former gun commander a couple of days after coming aboard thanks chief hope so sam said and punctuated that with a sneeze damn im coming down with a cold he was off his feed at supper that evening which surprised him the remembrance however ugly she was boasted a firstclass galley everything was fresh tooan advantage of sitting in port but sam didnt realize how sick he was till the next morning when he almost fell out of his bunk he stood swaying in front of it you all right asked george moerlein who slept just above him sam didnt answer he had trouble figuring out what the words meant moerlein peered at him touched his forehead and then jerked back his hand as if hed tried picking up a live coal we better get this guy to sick bay he said i think hes got the influenza sam didnt argue either he couldnt he let them lead him away arthur mcgregor took a certain somber satisfaction in listening to the wind howl around his farmhouse that was just as well the wind in manitoba was going to howl through the winter whether he took any satisfaction in it or not one thing he said to his wife in weather like this the yanks stay indoors i wish to heaven theyd stayed in their own country maude answered she was short and redheaded a contrast to his rangy inches and dark hair that was beginning to show frost as he edged into his forties her eyes went to the photograph of their son alexander that hung on the wall of the front room the photograph was all they had of him the us troops who occupied manitoba had executed him for plotting sabotage a year and a half before mcgregors eyes went there too he was still paying the americans back for what theyd done to alexander he would never be done paying them back as long as he lived if they ever found out he made bombs he wouldnt live long he couldnt drive the yanks out of canada singlehanded if they were going to try to rule his country though he could make their lives miserable julia came in from the kitchen she also looked toward alexander these days the family almost made a ritual of it mcgregor looked at his daughter in what was as close to wonderment as his solid stolid nature could produce some time while he wasnt looking julia had turned into a woman shed been eleven when the americans invaded and hardly even coltish she was fourteen now and not coltish any more she looked like her mother but taller and leaner as mcgregor himself was what are you going to do about that school order pa she asked the wind gusted louder mcgregor could have pretended not to hear her his own sigh was gusty too im going to pretend i dont know the first thing about it for as long as i can he answered hed pulled julia and her younger sister mary out of school a couple of years before the americans were using it to teach canadian children their lies about the way the world worked since then mcgregor and maude had taught reading and ciphering at home now though the occupying authorities had sent out an edict requiring all children between the ages of six and sixteen to attend school at least six months out of the year they didnt intend to miss any chances to tell their stories to people they wanted to grow up to be americans not canadians itll be all right pa julia said i really think it will you can send mary and me and we wont end up yanks truly we wont she looked toward alexanders photograph again i know you wont chick he said but i dont know that mary would be able to keep from telling the teacher what she really thinks at nine mary wore her heart on her sleeve even more than alexander had she also hated americans with a pure clear hatred that made even her fathers pale beside it letting the yanks know how she felt struck mcgregor as most unwise julia had washed the supper dishes mary was drying them after the last one clattered into the cupboard she came out to join the rest of the family she was sprouting up too like wheat after planting she would mcgregor judged make a tall woman but she still kept some of the feline grace shed had since she was very small and also some of a cats selfcontainment mcgregor hadnt needed to teach her much about conspiracy she understood it as if by instinct now he said mary if you have to do you suppose you can put up with listening to the yanks lies in school without telling them off why would i have to do that pa she answered maybe they can make me go to school but she caught herself her gray eyes so like those of her father and her dead brother widened oh you mean put up with them so i wouldnt get in troubleso we wouldnt get in trouble thats right arthur mcgregor nodded no no one needed to teach mary about conspiracy she thought it over if i have to i suppose i could she said at last but telling lies is a sin on their heads isnt it so it is mcgregor smiled to hear that but not too much hed passed his own stern presbyterian ethic down to the new generation the yanks have so many other sins on the book against them though that lying doesnt look like so much to them well it should mary said it should all count against them every bit of it and it will god counts everything she spoke with great assurance mcgregor wished he felt so sure himself he believed yes but hed lost that simple certainty if hed had any left alexanders death would have burned it out of him leaving ashes behind he said you will go to school then and be a good little parrot so we can show the americans were obeying their law his younger daughter sighed if i have to she said again good mcgregor said the more we look like were doing what they want us to the more we can do what we want to when they arent looking julia said thats good pa thats very good thats just what well do thats what well have to do maude said thats what everyone will have to do for however long it takes till were free again or till we turn into americans arthur mcgregor said bleakly he held up a workroughened hand no i dont mean us some of our neighbors will turn into americans but not us some of our neighbors have already turned into americans julia said they dont care about what they were so they dont care what they are we know better were canadians well always be canadians always mcgregor wondered if with the strongest will in the world his grandchildren and greatgrandchildren would remember they were canadians and then perhaps wondering the same thing maude spoke as if to reassure herself germany took alsace and lorraine away from france almost fifty years ago but the people there still remember theyre frenchmen canadians had heard a great deal about their allys grievances against the kaiser and his henchmen till the americans overran them after which theyd had to endure lies about germanys grievances against france now france had more reasons to grieve for the germans were biting off more of her land and mcgregor still in his bleak mood said the germans settled a lot of their own people in alsace and lorraine to help hold them down if the americans did that his wife and daughters stared at him in horror mary spoke first i wouldnt live next to americans pa i wouldnt if they came here idi dont know what id do but itd be pretty bad we wont have to worry about that till next spring at the earliest mcgregor said wont be any yanks settling down to farm in the middle of winter not here in manitoba there wont his chuckle was grim and the ones who come in the spring if any do theyre liable to turn up their toes when they find out what winters are like weve seen that the americans dont fancy our weather too bad for them julia said after the children had gone to sleep mcgregor lay awake beside his wife in the bed the two of them shared what am i going to do maude he whispered his voice barely audible through the whistling wind by myself i can hurt the americans but thats all i can do they wont leave on account of me youve made them pay maude said hed never admitted making bombs not in so many words shed never asked not in so many words she knew he knew she knew but they formally kept the secret even from each other not enough he said now nothing could ever be enough except driving them out of canada but no one man can do that no one man can maude said in a musing tone of voice he understood where she was going and shook his head one man can keep a secret maybe two can and maybe three can but only if two of them are dead that came from the pen of benjamin franklin an american but mcgregor had forgotten where hed first run across it i suppose youre right maude said it seems a pity though if alexander hadnt hung around with a pack of damnfool kids who didnt have anything better to do than run their mouths and make foolish plots hed still be alive today mcgregor said harshly maude caught her breath i see what youre saying she answered after a long pause and the strange thing is if he was still alive we wouldnt hate the yanks the way we do mcgregor said they caused themselves more harm shooting him than he ever would have given them if theyd let him go theyre fools maude said that mcgregor agreed with wholeheartedly but the american fools ruled canada today god must have loved them for hed made so very many the notion of god loving americans was so unlikely mcgregor snorted and fell asleep bemused by it when he woke up it was still dark december nights fifty miles south of winnipeg were long he groped for a match scraped it alight and lit the kerosene lamp on the nightstand he didnt want to get out from under the thick wool blankets he could see his own breath inside the bedroom he threw a shirt and overalls over his long johns and was still shivering maude got out of bed too she carried the lamp downstairs as soon as she was dressed he followed her she built up the fire in the stove and started a pot of coffee it wasnt good coffee if the americans had any good coffee they kept it for themselves but it was hot he stood by the stove too soaking in the warmth radiating from the black iron maude melted butter in a frying pan and put in three eggs mcgregor ate them along with bread and butter then he shrugged on a long heavy coat and donned mittens reluctantly he opened the door and went outside it had been cold in the bedroom as he slogged his way to the barn he wondered if he would turn into an icicle before he got there a wry chuckle made a fogbank swirl around his face for a moment till the fierce wind blew it away people said there wasnt so much work on a farm in winter in a way they were right for he didnt have to go out to the fields in spring and summer though he didnt have to work in weather like this the body heat of the livestock kept the barn warmer than the weather outside but warmer wasnt warm he fed the horse and cow and pigs and chickens and cleaned up their filth by the time he was done with that he was warmer too his eye fell on an old wagon wheel the sort of junk any barn accumulated under it hidden in a hole beneath a board beneath dirt lay dynamite and fuses and blasting caps and crimpers and other tools of the bombmakers art mcgregor nodded to them they would come out again rain some of it freezing poured down out of a bleak gray sky a barrel rumbled across the muddy kansas prairie toward colonel irving morrell the cannon projecting from its slightly pointed prow was aimed straight at him two machine guns stuck out from each side of the riveted steel hull two more covered the rear a pair of white truck engines powered the traveling fortress stinking steaming exhaust belched from the twin pipes the charge would have been more impressive had it been at something brisker than a walking pace it would have been much more impressive had the barrel not bogged down in a mud puddle that aspired to be a pond when it grew up the machines tracks were not very wide and it weighed almost thirtythree tons it could have bogged on ground better than that it was traveling morrell snapped his fingers in annoyance at himself for not having brought out a slate and a grease pencil with which he could have taken notes here in the field he was a lean man nearing thirty with a long face weathered features that bespoke a lot of time out in the sun and wind and closecropped sandy hair at the moment hidden under a wool cap and the hood of a rain slicker his boots made squelching noises as he slogged through the ooze toward the barrel the commander of the machine stuck his head out of the central cupola that gave him and his driver a place to perch and a better view than the machine gunners and artillerymen enjoyed the engineers who tended the two motors had no view being stuck in the bowels of the barrel sorry sir he said couldnt spot that one till too late one of the hazards of the game jenkins morrell answered you cant go forward thats as plain as the nose on my face see if you can back out yes sir lieutenant jenkins ducked down into the cupola clanging the hatch shut after himself the engines changed note as the driver put the barrel into reverse the barrel moved back a few inches then bogged down again jenkins had spunk having shifted position he tried to charge forward once more and escape the grip of the mud all he succeeded in doing was getting deeper into it morrell waved for him to stop and called you keep going that way youll need a periscope to see out just like a submersible he doubted jenkins heard him with the engines hammering away nobody inside a barrel could hear the man next to him screaming in his ear even so the engines fell silent a few seconds later the traveling fortress commander could see for himself that he wasnt going anywhere when the young lieutenant popped out through the hatch again he was grinning well sir you said you wanted to test the machine under extreme conditions id say youve got your wish id say youre right morrell answered id also say these critters need wider tracks to carry their weight better lieutenant jenkins nodded emphatically yes sir they could use stronger engines too to help us get out of this kind of trouble if we do get into it thats a point morrell also nodded we used what we had when we designed them it would have taken forever to make a new engine and work all the teething pains out of it and we had a war to fight with the new model though weve got the chance to do things right not just fast that was his job to figure out what right would be he would have a lot to say about what the next generation of barrels looked like it was a great opportunity it was also a great responsibility more than anything else barrels had broken two years of stalemated struggle in the trenches and made possible the us victory over the csa having the best machines and knowing what to do with them would be vital if no when he thoughtthe united states and confederate states squared off again for the moment his concerns were more immediate you and your men may as well come out he told jenkins weve got a couple of miles of muck to go before we get back to fort leavenworth leave the barrel here for now sir the young officer asked its not going anywhere by itself thats for sure morrell answered with which jenkins could hardly disagree rebs arent about to steal it either well need a recovery vehicle to pull it loose but we cant bring one out now because it would bog too recovery vehicles mounted no machine guns or cannon but were equipped with stout towing chains and sometimes with bulldozer blades more hatches opened up as the engineers and machine gunners and artillerymen emerged from their steel shell even in a kansas december it was warm in there it had been hotter than hell in summertime tennessee as morrell vividly remembered it had been hot outside there too it wasnt hot here all eighteen men in the barrel crew jenkins included started shivering and complaining they hadnt brought rain gearwhat point in the belly of the machine morrell sympathized but he couldnt do anything about it come on he said you wont melt listen to him one of the machine gunners said to his pal hes got a raincoat so what the devil has he got to worry about here morrell said sharply the machine gunner looked alarmed he hadnt intended to be overheard morrell stripped off the slicker and threw it at him now youve got the raincoat feel better no sir the machine gunner let the coat fall in the mud not fair for me to have it either sir now nobody does that was a better answer than morrell had expected from him lieutenant jenkins said lets get moving so we stay as warm as we can were all asking for the spanish influenza thats true morrell said first thing we do when we get in is soak in hot water to get the mud off and to warm us up inside and if thinking about that isnt enough to start you moving ill give two dollars to any man who gets back to the fort ahead of me that set the crew of the barrel into motion sure enough morrell was the oldest man among them by three or four years they were all veterans they were all convinced they were in top shape every one of them hustled east in the direction of the fort they all thought they would have a little extra money jingling in their pockets before the day was through morrell wondered how much his big mouth was going to cost him as he picked up his own pace his right leg started to ache it lacked the chunk of flesh a confederate bullet had blown from it in the opening weeks of the war morrell had almost lost the leg when the wound festered he still limped a little but never let the limp slow him down and he got to fort leavenworth ahead of any of the barrel men as soon as he reached the perimeter of the fort he realized how worn he was ridden hard and put away wet was the phrase that came to mind hed ridden himself hard all right and he was sure as hell wet but he hadnt been put away yet he wanted to fall into the mud to save himself the trouble soaking in a steaming tub afterwards did help so even more did the admiring looks he got from his competitors as they came onto the grounds of the fort in his wake he savored those command was more than a matter of superior rank if the men saw he deserved that rank they would obey eagerly not just out of duty that evening he pored over german accounts of meetings with british and french barrels the germans had used only a few of the traveling fortresses fewer than their foes theyd won anyhow with england distracted from the continent because of the fighting in canada and with mutinies spreading through the french army after russia collapsed morrell was familiar with british barrels the csa had copied them he knew less about the machines the french had built when he looked at photographs of some of the french barrelstheir equivalent of the rhomboids england and the csa usedhe snickered their tracks were very short compared to the length of their chassis which meant they easily got stuck trying to traverse trenches another french machine though made him thoughtful the germans had only one example of that model the text said it was a prototype hastily armed and thrown into the fight in a desperate effort to stem the decay of the french army it was a little barrel hardly more than a keg morrell thought with a grin with only a twoman crew and mounted a single machine gun in a rotating turret like the ones armored cars used not enough firepower there to do you as much good as youd like morrell said into the quiet of his barracks room still the design was interesting it had room for improvement he grabbed a piece of paper and a pencil and started sketching whoever designed the first us barrels had thought of nothing past stuffing as many guns as possible inside a steel box and making sure at least one of them could shoot every which way the price of success was jamming a couple of squads worth of soldiers into that hellish steel box along with the guns if you put the twoinch cannon into that turret instead of a machine gun you got a gun firing every which way all by itself youd still want a machine gun in front if the cannon were in the turret the driver would have to go down into the lower front of the machine could he handle a machine gun and drive too not likely morrell muttered all right that meant another gunner or two down there with him you wouldnt always want to use the turret cannon though sometimes that would be like swatting a fly with an anvil morrell sketched another machine gun alongside the cannon it would rotate too of course and the gunners who tended the large gun could also serve it that cut the crew from eighteen men down to five or sixyoud likely need an engineer too but the machine had better have only one engine and one strong enough to move at a decent clip morrell shook his head no six or seven he said somebodys got to tell everybody else what to do a boat without a commander would be like a boatno a ship navy men would laugh at himwithout a captain he was forgetting something he stared at the paper then at the plain whitewashed plaster of the wall forcing it wouldnt work he had to try to think around it that was as hard as not thinking about a steak dinner hed had practice though soon it would come to him soon wireless telegraph he exclaimed and added an aerial to his sketch maybe that would require another crewman or maybe the engineer could handle it if it did it did hed wanted one of those gadgets in his barrel during the war just finished controlling the mechanical behemoths was too hard without them he studied the sketch he liked it better than the machines in which hed thundered to victory against the csa he wondered what the war department would think it was different and a lot of senior officers prided themselves on not having had a new thought in years he shrugged hed send it in and find out
