michael crichton airframe aviation legend charley norton speaking to reporters in after an airplane crash the irony of the information age is that it has given new respectability to uninformed opinion the damn things weigh half a million pounds fly a third of the way around the world and they carry passengers in greater comfort and safety than any vehicle in the history of mankind now are you fellas really going to stand there and tell us you know how to do the job better are you going to pretend you know anything about it at all cause it looks to me like you boys are just stirring folks up for your own reasons veteran reporter john lawton speaking to the american association of broadcast journalists in monday aboard tpa am emily jansen sighed in relief the long flight was nearing an end morning sunlight streamed through the windows of the airplane in her lap little sarah squinted in the unaccustomed brightness as she noisily sucked the last of her bottle and pushed it away with tiny fists that was good wasnt it emily said okay up we go she raised the infant onto her shoulder began to pat her back the baby gave a gurgling belch and her body relaxed in the next seat tim jansen yawned and rubbed his eyes he had slept through the night all the way from hong kong emily never slept on planes she was too nervous morning tim said looking at his watch just a couple of hours more hon any sign of breakfast not yet emily said shaking her head they had taken transpacific airlines a charter from hong kong the money they saved would be useful when they set up housekeeping at the university of colorado where tim was going to be an assistant professor the flight had been pleasant enoughthey were in the front of the planebut the stewardesses seemed disorganized the meals coming at odd times emily had turned down dinner because tim was asleep and she couldnt eat with sarah sleeping in her lap and even now emily was surprised by the casual behavior of the crew they left the cockpit door open during the flight she knew asian crews often did that but it still struck her as inappropriate too informal too relaxed the pilots strolled around the plane at night kibitzing with the stewardesses one was leaving right now walking to the back of the plane of course they were probably stretching their legs stay alert all of that and certainly the fact that the crew was chinese didnt trouble her after a year in china she admired the efficiency and attention to detail of the chinese but somehow the whole flight just made her nervous emily put sarah back down in her lap the baby stared at tim and beamed hey i should get this tim said fumbling in the bag under his seat he brought out a video camera trained it on his daughter he waggled his free hand to get her attention sarah sarah smile for daddy smile sarah smiled and made a gurgling sound how does it feel to be going to america sarah ready to see where your parents are from sarah gurgled again she waved her tiny hands in the air shed probably think everybody in america looks weird emily said their daughter had been bom seven months ago in hunan where tim had studied chinese medicine emily saw the camera lens pointed at her and what about you mom tim said are you glad to be going home oh tim she said please she must look like hell she thought all those hours come on em what are you thinking she needed to comb her hair she needed to pee she said well what i really wantwhat i have dreamed about for monthsis a cheeseburger with xuxiang hot bean sauce tim said god no a cheeseburger she said with onions and tomatoes and lettuce and pickles and mayonnaise mayonnaise god and frenchs mustard you want a cheeseburger too sarah tim said turning the camera back to their daughter sarah was tugging at her toes with one tiny fist she pulled her foot into her mouth and looked up at tim taste good tim said laughing the camera shook as he laughed is that breakfast for you sarah not waiting for the stewardess on this flight emily heard a low rumbling sound almost a vibration that seemed to come from the wing she snapped her head around what was that take it easy em tim said still laughing sarah laughed too giggling delightfully were almost home honey tim said but even as he spoke the plane seemed to shudder the nose of the plane turning down suddenly everything tilted at a crazy angle emily felt sarah sliding forward off her lap she clutched at her daughter pulling her close now it felt like the plane was going straight down and then suddenly it was going up and her stomach was pressed into the seat her daughter was a lead weight against her tim said what the hell abruptly she was lifted off the seat her seat belt cutting into her thighs she felt light and sick to her stomach she saw tim bounce out of his seat his head slamming into the luggage compartments overhead the camera flying past her face from the cockpit emily heard buzzing insistent alarms and a metallic voice that said stall stall she glimpsed the bluesuited arms of the pilots moving swiftly over the controls they were shouting in chinese all over the aircraft people were screaming hysterical there was the sound of shattering glass the plane went into another steep dive an elderly chinese woman slid down the aisle on her back screaming a teenage boy followed tumbling head over heels emily looked at tim but her husband wasnt in his seat any more yellow oxygen masks were dropping one swinging in front of her face but she could not reach for it because she was clutching her baby she was pressed back into her seat as the plane descended steeply an incredibly loud whining dive shoes and purses ricocheted across the cabin clanging and banging bodies thumped against seats the floor tim was gone emily turned looking for him and suddenly a heavy bag struck her in the heada sudden jolt pain blackness and stars she felt dizzy and faint the alarms continued to sound the passengers continued to scream the plane was still in a dive emily lowered her head clutched her infant daughter to her chest and for the first time in her life began to pray socal approach control am socal approach this is transpacific we have an emergency in the darkened building that housed southern california air traffic approach control senior controller dave marshall heard the pilots call and glanced at his radar screen transpacific was inbound from hong kong to denver the flight had been handed over to him from oakland arinc a few minutes earlier a perfectly normal flight marshall touched the microphone at his cheek and said go ahead request priority clearance for emergency landing in los angeles the pilot sounded calm marshall stared at the shifting green data blocks that identified each aircraft in the air tpa was approaching the california coastline soon it would pass over marina del rey it was still half an hour out of lax marshall said okay understand you request priority clearance to land say the nature of your emergency we have a passenger emergency the pilot said we need ambulances on the ground i would say thirty or forty ambulances maybe more marshall was stunned tpa say again are you asking for forty ambulances affirmative we encountered severe turbulence during flight we have injuries of passengers and flight crew marshall thought why the hell didnt you tell me this before he spun in his chair beckoned to his supervisor jane levine who picked up the extra headset punched in and listened marshall said transpacific i copy your ground request for forty ambulances jesus levine said making a face forty the pilot was still calm as he replied ah roger approach forty do you need medical personnel too what is the nature of the injuries you are bringing in i am not sure levine made a spinning gesture keep the pilot talking marshall said can you give us an estimate i am sorry no an estimate is not possible is anyone unconscious no i do not think so the pilot answered but two are dead holy shit jane levine said nice of him to tell us who is this guy marshall hit a key on his panel opening a data block in the upper corner of the screen it listed the manifest for tpa captains john chang senior pilot for transpacific lets not have any more surprises levine said is the aircraft all right marshall said tpa what is the condition of your aircraft we have damage to the passenger cabin the pilot said minor damage only what is the condition of the flight deck marshall said right deck is operational fdau is nominal that was the flight data acquisition unit which tracked faults within the aircraft if it said the plane was okay it probably was marshall said i copy that what is the condition of your flight crew captain and first officer in good condition ah you said there were injuries to the crew yes two stewardesses have been hurt can you specify the nature of the injuries i am sorry no one is not conscious the other one i dont know marshall was shaking his head he just told us nobody was unconscious im not buying any of this levine said she picked up the red phone put a fire crew on level one alert get the ambulances order neuro and ortho teams to meet the plane and have medical notify the westside hospitals she looked at her watch ill call the la fsdo thisll make his damn day lax am daniel greene was the duty officer at the faa flight standards district office on imperial highway half a mile from lax the local fsdosor fizdos as they were called supervised the flight operations of commercial carriers checking everything from aircraft maintenance to pilot training greene had come in early to clear the paper off his desk his secretary had quit the week before and the office manager refused to replace her citing orders from washington to absorb attrition so now greene went to work muttering congress was slashing the faa budget telling them to do more with less pretending the problem was productivity and not workload but passenger traffic was up four percent a year and the commercial fleet wasnt getting younger the combination made for a lot more work on the ground of course the fsdos werent the only ones who were strapped even the ntsb was broke the safety board only got a million dollars a year for aircraft accidents and the red phone on his desk rang the emergency line he picked it up it was a woman at traffic control weve just been informed of an incident on an inbound foreign carrier she said uhhuh greene reached for a notepad incident had a specific meaning to the faa referring to the lower category of flight problems that carriers were required to report accidents involved deaths or structural damage to the aircraft and were always serious but with incidents you never knew go ahead its transpacific flight incoming from hong kong to denver pilots requested emergency landing at lax says they encountered turbulence during flight is the plane airworthy they say it is levine said theyve got injuries and theyve requested forty ambulances forty theyve also got two stiffs great greene got up from his desk whens it due in eighteen minutes eighteen minutesjeez why am i getting this so late hey the captain just told us were telling you ive notified ems and alerted the fire crews fire crews i thought you said the planes okay who knows the woman said the pilot is not making much sense sounds like he might be in shock we hand off to the tower in seven minutes okay greene said im on my way he grabbed his badge and his cell phone and went out the door as he passed karen the receptionist he said have we got anybody at the international terminal kevins there beep him greene said tell him to get on tpa inbound hong kong landing in fifteen tell him to stay at the gateand dont let the flight crew leave got it she said reaching for the phone greene roared down sepulveda boulevard toward the airport just before the highway ran beneath the runway he looked up and saw the big transpacific airlines widebody identifiable by its bright yellow tail insignia taxiing toward the gate transpacific was a hong kongbased charter carrier most of the problems the faa had with foreign airlines occurred with charters many were lowbudget operators that didnt match the rigorous safety standards of the scheduled carriers but transpacific had an excellent reputation at least the bird was on the ground greene thought and he couldnt see any structural damage to the widebody the plane was an n built by norton aircraft in burbank the plane had been in revenue service five years with an enviable dispatch and safety record greene stepped on the gas and rushed into the tunnel passing beneath the giant aircraft he sprinted through the international building through the windows he saw the transpacific jet pulled up to the gate and the ambulances lined up on the concrete below the first of them was already driving out its siren whining greene came to the gate flashed his badge and ran down the ramp passengers were disembarking pale and frightened many limped their clothes torn and bloody on each side of die ramp paramedics clustered around the injured as he neared the plane the nauseating odor of vomit grew stronger a frightened transpac stewardess pushed him back at the door chartering at him rapidly in chinese he showed her his badge and said faa official business faa the stewardess stepped back and greene slid past a mother clutching an infant and stepped into the plane he looked at the interior and stopped oh my god he said softly what happened to this plane glendale california am mom who do you like better mickey mouse or minnie mouse standing in the kitchen of her bungalow still wearing her jogging shorts from her fivemile morning run casey singleton finished making a tuna sandwich and put it in her daughters lunch box singleton was thirtysix years old a vicepresident at norton aircraft in burbank her daughter sat at the breakfast table eating cereal well allison said who do you like better mickey mouse or minnie mouse she was seven and she ranked everything i like them both casey said i know mom allison said exasperated but who do you like better minnie me too she said pushing the carton away casey put a banana and a thermos of juice in the lunch box closed the lid finish eating allison we have to get ready whats quart quart its a measure of liquid no mom quaurt she said casey looked over and saw that her daughter had picked up her new laminated plant id badge which had caseys picture and beneath that c singleton and then in large blue letters qairt whats quaurt its my new job at the plant im the quality assurance rep on the incident review team are you still making airplanes ever since the divorce allison had been extremely attentive to change even a minor alteration in caseys hairstyle prompted repeated discussions the subject brought up again and again over many days so it wasnt surprising she had noticed the new badge yes allie she said im still making airplanes everythings the same i just got a promotion are you still a bum she said allison had been delighted the year before to learn that casey was a business unit manager a bum moms a bum shed tell her friends parents to great effect no allie now get your shoes on your dadll be picking you up any minute no he wont allison said dads always late whats your promotion casey bent over and began pulling on her daughters sneakers well she said i still work at qa but i dont check the planes in the factory any more i check them after they leave the plant to make sure they fly yes honey we check them and fix any problems they better fly allison said or else theyll crash she began to laugh theyll all fall out of the sky and hit everybody in their houses right while theyre eating their cereal that wouldnt be too good would it mom casey laughed with her no that wouldnt be good at all the people at the plant would be very upset she finished tying the laces swung her daughters feet away now wheres your sweatshirt i dont need it allison mom its not even cold it may be cold later in the week get your sweatshirt please she heard a horn honk on the street outside saw jims black lexus in front of the house jim was behind the wheel smoking a cigarette he was wearing a jacket and tie perhaps he had a job interview she thought allison stomped around her room banging drawers she came back looking unhappy the sweatshirt hanging from the comer of her backpack how come youre always so tense when dad picks me up casey opened the door and they walked to the car in the hazy morning sunshine allison cried hi daddy and broke into a run jim waved back with a boozy grin casey walked over to jims window no smoking with allison in the car right jim stared at her sullenly good morning to you too his voice was raspy he looked hung over his face puffy and sallow we had an agreement about smoking around our daughter jim do you see me smoking im just saying and youve said it before katherine he said ive heard it a million times for christs sake casey sighed she was determined not to fight in front of allison the therapist had said that was the reason allison had begun stuttering the stuttering was better now and casey always made an effort not to argue with jim even though he didnt reciprocate on the contrary he seemed to take special pleasure in making every contact as difficult as possible okay casey said forcing a smile see you sunday their arrangement was that allison stayed with her father one week a month leaving monday and returning the following sunday sunday jim nodded curtly same as always sunday at six oh christ im just checking jim no youre not youre controlling the way you always do jim she said please lets not fine with me he snapped she bent over bye allie allison said bye mom but her eyes were already distant her voice cool she had transferred her allegiance to her father even before her seat belt was fastened then jim stepped on the gas and the lexus drove away leaving her standing there on the sidewalk the car rounded the comer and was gone down at the end of the street she saw the hunched figure of her neighbor amos taking his snarly dog for a morning walk like casey amos worked at die plant she waved to him and he waved back casey was turning to go back inside to dress for work when her eye caught a blue sedan parked across the street there were two men inside one was reading a newspaper the other stared out the window she paused her neighbor mrs alvarez had been robbed recently who were these men they werent gang bangers they were in their twenties with a cleancut vaguely military appearance casey was thinking about taking down the license plate when her beeper went off with an electronic squeal she undipped it from her shorts and read she sighed three stars signaled an urgent message john marder who ran the factory was calling an irt meeting for am in the war room that was a full hour before the regular morning call something was up the final notation confirmed it in plant slangbtoya be there or its your ass burbank airport am rush hour traffic crept forward in the pale morning light casey twisted her rearview mirror and leaned over to check her makeup with her short dark hair she was appealing in a tomboyish sort of waylong limbed and athletic she played first base on the plant softball team men were comfortable around her they treated her like a kid sister which served her well at the plant in fact casey had had few problems there she had grown up in the suburbs of detroit the only daughter of an editor at the detroit news her two older brothers were both engineers at ford her mother died when she was an infant so she had been raised in a household of men she had never been what her father used to call a girly girl after she graduated from southern illinois in journalism casey had followed her brothers to ford but she found writing press releases uninteresting so she took advantage of the companys continuing education program to get an mba from wayne state along the way she married jim a ford engineer and had a child but allisons arrival had ended the marriage confronted by diapers and feeding schedules jim started drinking staying out late eventually they separated when jim announced he was moving to the west coast to work for toyota she decided to move out too casey wanted allison to grow up seeing her father she was tired of the politics at ford and the bleak detroit winters california offered a fresh start she imagined herself driving a convertible living in a sunny house near the beach with palm trees outside her window she imagined her daughter growing up tanned and healthy instead she lived in glendale an hour and a half inland from the beach casey had indeed bought a convertible but she never put the top down and although the section of glendale where they lived was charming gang territories began only a few blocks away sometimes at night while her daughter slept she heard the faint pop of gunfire casey worried about allisons safety she worried about her education in a school system where fifty languages were spoken and she worried about the future because the california economy was still depressed jobs scarce jim had been out of work for two years now since toyota fired him for drinking and casey had survived wave after wave of layoffs at norton where production had slumped thanks to the global recession she had never imagined she would work for an aircraft company but to her surprise she had found that her plainspoken midwestern pragmatism was perfectly suited to the culture of engineers that dominated the company jim considered her rigid and by the book but her attention to detail had served her well at norton where she had for the last year been a vicepresident of quality assurance she liked qa even though the division had a nearly impossible mission norton aircraft was divided into two great factionsproduction and engineeringwhich were perpetually at war quality assurance stood uneasily between the two qa was involved in all aspects of production the division signed off every step of fabrication and assembly when a problem emerged qa was expected to get to the bottom of it that rarely endeared them to mechanics on the line or the engineers at the same time qa was expected to deal with customer support problems customers were often unhappy with decisions they themselves had made blaming norton if the galleys they had ordered were in the wrong place or if there were too few toilets on the plane it took patience and political skill to keep everybody happy and get the problems resolved casey a born peacemaker was especially good at this in return for walking a political tightrope workers in qa had the run of the plant as a vicepresident casey was involved in every aspect of the companys work she had a lot of freedom and wideranging responsibility she knew her title was more impressive than the job she held norton aircraft was awash in vicepresidents her division alone had four veeps and competition among them was fierce but now john marder had just promoted her to liaison for the irt this was a position of considerable visibility and it put her in line to head the division marder didnt make such appointments casually she knew he had a good reason for doing it she turned her mustang convertible off the golden state freeway onto empire avenue following the chainlink fence that marked the south perimeter of burbank airport she headed toward the commercial complexesrockwell lockheed and norton aircraft from a distance she could see the rows of hangars each with the winged norton logo painted above her car phone rang casey its norma you know about the meeting norma was her secretary im on my way she said whats going on nobody knows anything norma said but it must be bad marders been screaming at the engineering heads and hes pushed up the irt john marder was the chief operating officer at norton marder had been program manager on the n which meant he supervised the manufacture of that aircraft he was a ruthless and occasionally reckless man but he got results marder was also married to charley nortons only daughter in recent years hed had a lot to say about sales that made marder the second most powerful man in the company after the president it was marder who had moved casey up and it was do with your assistant norma said my what your new assistant what do you want me to do with him hes waiting in your office you havent forgotten oh right the truth was she had forgotten some nephew of the norton family was working his way through the divisions marder had assigned the kid to casey which meant shed have to babysit him for the next six weeks whats he like norma well hes not drooling norma hes better than the last one that wasnt saying much the last one had fallen off a wing in major join and had nearly electrocuted himself in radio rack how much better im looking at his resume norma said yale law school and a year at gm but hes been in marketing for the last three months and he doesnt know anything about production youre going to have to start him from the beginning right casey said sighing marder would expect her to bring him to the meeting have the kid meet me in front of administration in ten minutes and make sure he doesnt get lost okay you want me to walk him down yeah you better casey hung up and glanced at her watch traffic was moving slowly still ten minutes to the plant she drummed her fingers on the dashboard impatiently what could the meeting be about there might have been an accident or a crash she turned on the radio to see if it was on the news she got a talk station a caller saying not fair to make kids wear uniforms to school its elitist and discriminatory casey pushed a button changing the station trying to force their personal morality on the rest of us i dont believe a fetus is a human being she pushed another button these media attacks are all coming from people who dont like free speech where she thought is the news had an airplane crashed or not she had a sudden image of her father reading a big stack of newspapers from all over the country every sunday after church muttering to himself thats not the story thats not the story as he dropped the pages in an untidy heap around his living room chair of course her father had been a print journalist back in the s it was a different world now now everything was on television television and the mindless chatter on the radio up ahead she saw the main gate of the norton plant she clicked the radio off norton aircraft was one of the great names of american aviation the company had been started by aviation pioneer charley norton in during world war ii it made the legendary b bomber the p skycat fighter and the c transport for the air force in recent years norton had weathered the hard times that had driven lockheed out of the commercial transport business now it was one of just four companies that still built large aircraft for the global market the others were boeing in seattle mcdonnell douglas in long beach and the european consortium airbus in toulouse she drove through acres of parking lots to gate pausing at the barrier while security checked her badge as always she felt a lift driving into the plant with its threeshift energy the yellow tugs hauling bins of parts it wasnt a factory so much as a small city with its own hospital newspaper and police force sixty thousand people had worked here when she first came to the company the recession had trimmed that to thirty thousand but the plant was still huge covering sixteen square miles here they built the n the narrowbody twinjet the n the widebody and the kc the air force fuel tanker she could see the principal assembly buildings each more than a mile in length she headed for the glass administration building in the center of the plant pulling into her parking space she left the engine running she saw a young man looking collegiate in a sport coat and tie khaki slacks and penny loafers the kid waved diffidently as she got out of the car bldg am bob richman he said im your new assistant his handshake was polite reserved she couldnt remember which side of the norton family he was from but she recognized the type plenty of money divorced parents an indifferent record at good schools and an unshakable sense of entitlement casey singleton she said get in were late late richman said as he climbed into the car its not even seven first shift starts at six casey said most of us in qa work the factory schedule dont they do that at gm i wouldnt know he said i was in legal spend any time on the floor as little as possible casey sighed it was going to be a long six weeks with this guy she thought youve been over in marketing so far yeah a few months he shrugged but selling isnt really my thing she drove south toward building the huge structure where the widebody was built casey said by the way what do you drive a bmw richman said you might want to trade it in she said for an american car why its made here its assembled here she said its not made here the values added overseas the mechanics in the plant know the difference theyre all uaw they dont like to see a beamer in the parking lot richman stared out the window what are you saying something might happen to it guaranteed she said these guys dont screw around ill think about it richman said he suppressed a yawn jesus its early what are we rushing to the irt its been pushed up to seven she said the incident review team every time something happens to one of our planes the irt meets to figure out what happened and what we should do about it how often do you meet roughly every two months that often the kid said you re going to have to start him from the beginning actually casey said two months is pretty infrequent we have three thousand aircraft in revenue service around the world with that many birds in the air things happen and were serious about customer support so every morning we hold a conference call with the service reps around the world they report everything that caused a dispatch delay the day before most of its minor stuff a lav door jammed a cockpit light failed but we track it in qa do a trend analysis and pass that on to product support uhhuh he sounded bored then casey said once in a while we hit a problem that warrants an irt it has to be serious something that affects flight safety apparently weve got one today if marders pushed the meeting up to seven you can bet its not a bird strike marder john marder was the program manager for the widebody before he became chief operating officer so its probably an incident involving the n she pulled over and parked in the shadow of building the gray hangar loomed above them eight stories high and nearly a mile long the asphalt in front of the building was strewn with disposable earplugs which the mechanics wore so they wouldnt go deaf from the rivet guns they walked through the side doors and entered an interior corridor that ran around the perimeter of the building the corridor was dotted with food dispensers in clusters a quarter of a mile apart richman said we got time for a cup of coffee she shook her head coffees not allowed on the floor no coffee he groaned why not its made overseas coffees corrosive aluminum doesnt like it casey led richman through another door onto the production floor jesus richman said the huge partially assembled widebody jets gleamed under halogen lights fifteen aircraft in various stages of construction were arranged in two long rows under the vaulted roof directly ahead of them she saw mechanics installing cargo doors in the fuselage sections the barrels of the fuselage were surrounded by scaffolding beyond the fuselage stood a forest of assembly jigsimmense tools painted bright blue richman walked under one of the jigs and looked up openmouthed it was as wide as a house and six stories tall amazing he said he pointed upward at a broad flat surface is that the wing the vertical stabilizer casey said the what its the tail bob thats the tail richman said casey nodded the wing is over there she said pointing across the floor its two hundred feet longalmost as long as a football field a klaxon sounded one of the overhead cranes began to move richman turned to look this your first time on the floor yeah richman was turning around looking in all directions awesome he said theyre big casey said why are they all lime green we coat the structural elements with epoxy to prevent corrosion and the aluminum skins are covered so they dont get dinged during assembly the skins are highly polished and very expensive so we leave that coating on until paint shed sure doesnt look like gm richman said still turning and looking thats right casey said compared to these aircraft cars are a joke richman turned to her surprised a joke think about it she said a pontiac has five thousand parts and you can build one in two shifts sixteen hours thats nothing but these thingsshe gestured to the aircraft looming high above themare a completely different animal the widebody has one million parts and a span time of seventyfive days no other manufactured product in the world has the complexity of a commercial aircraft nothing even comes close and nothing is built to be as durable you take a pontiac and run it all day every day and see what happens itll fall apart in a few months but we design our jets to fly for twenty years of troublefree service and we build them to twice the service life forty years richman said incredulous you build them to last forty years casey nodded weve still got lots of ns in service around the worldand we stopped building them in weve got planes that have accumulated four times their design lifethe equivalent of eighty years of service norton planes will do that douglas planes will do that but no one elses birds will do that you understand what im saying wow richman said swallowing we call this the bird farm casey said the planesre so big its hard to get a sense of the scale she pointed to one aircraft to their right where small clusters of people worked at various positions with portable lights shining up on the metal doesnt look like many people right no not many theres probably two hundred mechanics working on that planeenough to run an entire automobile line but this is just one position on our lineand we have fifteen positions in all theres five thousand people in this building right now the kid was shaking his head amazed it looks sort of empty unfortunately casey said it is sort of empty the widebody lines running at sixty percent capacityand three of those birds are whitetails whitetails planes were building without customers we build at a minimum rate to keep the line open and we havent got all the orders we want the pacific rims the growth sector but with japan in recession that markets not placing orders and everybody else is flying their planes longer so business is very competitive this way she started up a flight of metal stairs walking quickly richman followed her footsteps clanging they came to a landing went up another flight im telling you this she said so youll understand the meeting were going into we build the hell out of these planes people here are proud of what they do and they dont like it when something s wrong they arrived at a catwalk high above the assembly floor and walked toward a glasswalled room that seemed to be suspended from the roof they came to the door casey opened it and this she said is the war room war room am she saw it freshly through his eyes a large conference room with gray indooroutdoor carpeting a round formica table tubular metal chairs the walls were covered with bulletin boards maps and engineering charts the far wall was glass and overlooked the assembly line five men in ties and shirtsleeves were there a secretary with a notepad and john marder wearing a blue suit she was surprised he was here the coo rarely chaired irts in person marder was dark intense in his mid forties with slickedback hair he looked like a cobra about to strike casey said this is my new assistant bob richman marder stood up and said bob welcome and shook the kids hand he gave a rare smile apparently marder with his finely tuned sense of corporate politics was ready to fawn over any norton family member even a nephew on loan it made casey wonder if this kid was more important than she thought he was marder introduced richman to the others at the table doug doherty in charge of structure and mechanical he gestured to an overweight man of fortyfive with a potbelly bad complexion and thick glasses doherty lived in a state of perpetual gloom he spoke in a mournful monotone and could always be counted on to report that everything was bad and getting worse today he wore a checked shirt and a striped tie he must have gotten out of the house before his wife saw him doherty gave richman a sad thoughtful nod nguyen van trung avionics trung was thirty trim and quiet selfcontained casey liked him the vietnamese were the hardestworking people at the plant the avionics guys were mis specialists involved with the aircraft computer programs they represented the new wave at norton younger better educated better manners ken burne powerplant kenny was red haired and freckled his chin thrust forward ready to fight notoriously profane and abusive he was known in the plant as easy burne because of his quick temper ron smith electrical bald and timid nervously fingering pens in his pocket ron was extremely competent it often seemed he carried the schematics for the aircraft around in his head but he was painfully shy he lived with his invalid mother in pasadena mike lee who represents the carrier a well dressed man of fifty gray hair cropped short in a blue blazer with a striped tie mike was a former air force pilot a retired onestar general he was transpacifics rep at the plant and barbara ross with the notepad the irt secretary was in her forties and overweight she glared at casey with open hostility casey ignored her marder waved the kid to a seat and casey sat down beside him first item marder said casey is now liaising qa to the irt considering the way she handled the rto at dfw shell be our press spokesman from now on any questions richman looked bewildered shaking his head marder turned to him and explained singleton did a good job with the press on a rejected takeoff at dallasfort worth last month so shell handle any press inquiries we get okay we all on the same page lets get started barbara the secretary handed around stapled packets of paper transpacific flight marder said an n fuse number flight originated at kaitak hong kong at hours yesterday uneventful takeoff uneventful flight until approximately hours this morning when the aircraft encountered what the pilot described as severe turbulence there were groans throughout the room turbulence the engineers shook their heads severe turbulence producing extreme pitch excursions in flight ah christ burne said the aircraft marder continued made an emergency landing at lax and medical units were on hand our preliminary report indicates fiftysix injured and three dead oh thats very bad doug doherty said in a sad monotone blinking behind his thick glasses i suppose this means weve got the ntsb on our backs he said casey leaned over to richman and whispered national transportation safety board usually gets involved when there are fatalities not in this case marder said this is a foreign carrier and the incident occurred in international airspace ntsb has its hands full with the colombia crash we think theyre going to pass on this one turbulence kenny burne said snorting is there any confirmation no marder said the plane was at thirtyseven thousand feet when the incident took place no other aircraft at that altitude and position reported weather problems satellite weather maps casey said coming what about the passengers she said did the captain make an announcement was the seatbelt sign on nobodys interviewed the passengers yet but our preliminary information suggests no announcement was made richman was looking bewildered again casey scribbled a note on her yellow pad tilted it so he could read no turbulence trung said have we debriefed the pilot no marder said the flight crew caught a connecting flight out and left the country oh great kenny burne said throwing his pencil on the table just great we got a damn hitandrun hold on now mike lee said in a cool tone on behalf of the carrier i think we have to recognize the flight crew acted responsibly they have no liability here but they face possible litigation from the civil aviation authorities in hong kong and they went home to deal with it casey wrote flight crew unavailable do uh we know who the captain was ron smith asked timidly we do mike lee said he consulted a leather notebook his name is john chang fortyfive years old resident of hong kong six thousand hours experience hes transpacifics senior pilot for the n very skilled oh yeah burne said leaning forward across the table and when was he last recertified three months ago where right here mike lee said on norton flight simulators by norton instructors burne sat back snorting unhappily do we know how he was rated casey asked outstanding lee said you can check your records casey wrote not human error marder said to lee do you think we can get an interview with him mike will he talk to our service rep at kaitak im sure the crew will cooperate lee said especially if you submit written questions im sure i can get them answered within ten days hmm marder said distressed that long unless we get a pilot interview van trung said we may have a problem the incident occurred one hour prior to landing the cockpit voice recorder only stores the last twentyfive minutes of conversation so in this case the cvr is useless true but you still have the fdr casey wrote flight data recorder yes we have the fdr trung said but this clearly didnt assuage his concerns and casey knew why flight recorders were notoriously unreliable in the media they were the mysterious black boxes that revealed all the secrets of a flight but in reality they often didnt work ill do what i can mike lee promised casey said what do we know about the aircraft aircrafts brandnew marder said three years service its got four thousand hours and nine hundred cycles casey wrote cycles takeoffs and landings what about inspections doherty asked gloomily i suppose well have to wait weeks for the records it had a c check in march where lax so maintenance was probably good casey said correct marder said as a first cut we cant attribute this to weather human factors or maintenance so were in the trenches lets run the fault tree did anything about this aircraft cause behavior that looks like turbulence structural oh sure doherty said miserably a slats deploy would do it well function hydraulics on all the control surfaces avionics trung was scribbling notes right now im wondering why the autopilot didnt override the pilot soon as i get the fdr download ill know more electrical its possible we got a slats deploy from a sneak circuit ron smith said shaking his head i mean its possible powerplant yeah powerplant could be involved burne said running his hand through his red hair the thrust reversers could have deployed in flight thatd make the plane nose over and roll but if the reversers deployed therell be residual damage well check the sleeves casey looked down at her pad she had written structural slats deploy hydraulics slats deploy avionics autopilot electrical sneak circuit powerplant thrust reversers that was basically every system on the aircraft youve got a lot of ground to cover marder said standing and gathering his papers together dont let me keep you oh hell burne said well nail this in a month john im not worried i am marder said because we dont have a month we have a week cries around the table a week jeez john come on john you know an irt always takes a month not this time marder said last thursday our president hal edgarton received an loi from the beijing government to purchase fifty ns with an option for another thirty first delivery in eighteen months there was stunned silence the men all looked at each other a big china sale had been rumored for months the deal had been reported as imminent in various news accounts but nobody at norton really believed it its true marder said and i dont need to tell you what it means its an eightbilliondollar order from the fastestgrowing airframe market in the world its four years of fullcapacity production itll put this company on solid financial footing into the twentyfirst century itll fund development for the n stretch and the advanced nxx widebody hal and i agree this sale means the difference between life and death for the company marder placed the papers in his briefcase and snapped it shut i fly to beijing sunday to join hal and sign the letter of intent with the minister of transport hes going to want to know what happened to flight and i better be able to tell him or hell turn around and sign with airbus in which case im in deep shit this company is in deep shitand everybody at this table is out of a job the future of norton aircraft is riding on this investigation so i dont want to hear anything but answers and i want them inside a week see you tomorrow he turned on his heel and walked out of the room war room am what an asshole burne said this is his idea of motivating the troops fuck him trung shrugged its the way he always is what do you think smith said i mean this could be great great news has edgarton really got an loi from china i bet he does trung said because the plants been quietly gearing up theyve made another set of tools to fab the wing the tools are about to be shipped to atlanta ill bet hes got a deal what hes got said burne is a major case of cover my ass meaning edgarton might have a tentative from beijing but eight billion dollars is a big order from a big gorilla boeing douglas and airbus are all chasing that order the chinese could give it to any of them at the last minute thats their style they do it all the time so edgartons shitting rivets worrying he wont close the deal and hell have to tell the board he lost the big one so what does he do he lays it on marder and what does marder do makes it our fault trung said right this tpa flight puts them in perfect position if they close with beijing theyre heroes but if the deal falls apart its because we blew it trung said right were the reason an eightbilliondollar deal cratered well trung said standing i think we better look at that plane administration am harold edgarton the newly appointed president of norton aircraft was in his office on the tenth floor staring out the window overlooking the plant when john marder walked in edgarton was a big man an exfullback with a ready smile and cold watchful eyes he had previously worked at boeing and had been brought in three months earlier to improve nortons marketing edgarton turned and frowned at marder this is a hell of a mess he said how many died three marder said christ edgarton said he shook his head of all the times for this to happen did you brief the investigation team on the loi tell them how urgent this is i briefed them and youll clear it up this week im chairing the group myself ill get it done marder said what about press edgarton was still worried i dont want media relations handling this one bensons a drunk the reporters all hate him and the engineers cant do it they dont speak english for christs sake ive got it handled hal you do i dont want you talking to the fucking press youre grounded i understand marder said ive arranged for singleton to do the press singleton that qa woman edgarton said i looked at that tape you gave me where she talked to the reporters about the dallas thing shes pretty enough but she comes off as a straight arrow well thats what we want isnt it marder said we want honest allamerican nononsense and shes good on her feet hal shed better be edgarton said if the shit hits the fan she has to perform she will marder said i dont want anything to undermine this china deal nobody does hal edgarton looked at marder thoughtfully for a moment you better be real clear about that he said because i dont give a damn who youre married toif this deal doesnt close a lot of people are going to get taken out not just me a lot of other heads will roll i understand marder said you picked the woman shes your call the board knows it if anything goes wrong with her or the irtyoure out on your ass nothing will go wrong marder said its under control it damn well better be edgarton said and turned away again to look out the window marder left the room lax maintenance hangar am the blue minivan crossed the runway and raced toward the line of maintenance hangars at los angeles airport from the rear of the nearest hangar the yellow tail of the transpacific widebody protruded its emblem shining in the sun the engineers began to talk excitedly as soon as they saw the plane the minivan rolled into the hangar and came to a stop beneath the wing the engineers piled out the rams team was already at work a halfdozen mechanics up on the wing wearing harnesses scrabbling on their hands and knees lets do it burne shouted as he climbed a ladder to the wing he made it sound like a battle cry the other engineers scrambled up after him doherty followed last climbing the ladder with a dejected air casey stepped out of the van with richman they all go right to the wing richman said thats right the wings the most important part of an aircraft and the most complicated structure theyll look at it first then do a visual inspect on the rest of the exterior this way where are we going inside casey walked to the nose and climbed a rollin staircase to the forward cabin door just behind the cockpit as she came to the entrance she smelled the nauseating odor of vomit jesus richman said behind her casey went inside she knew the forward cabin would have the least damage but even here some of the seat backs were broken armrests had torn free and swung into the aisles overhead luggage bins were cracked the doors hanging open oxygen masks dangled from the ceiling some missing there was blood on the carpet blood on the ceiling puddles of vomit on the seats my god richman said covering his nose he looked pale this happened because of turbulence no she said almost certainly not then why would the pilot we dont know yet she said casey went forward to the flight deck the cockpit door was latched open and the flight deck appeared normal all the logs and paperwork were missing a tiny infants shoe was on the floor bending to look at it she noticed a mass of crumpled black metal wedged beneath the cockpit door a video camera she pulled it free and it broke apart in her hands an untidy heap of circuit boards silver motors and loops of tape hanging from a cracked cassette she gave it to richman what do i do with this keep it casey headed aft knowing it would be worse in the back already she was forming a picture in her mind of what had happened on this flight theres no question this aircraft underwent severe pitch oscillations thats when the plane noses up and down she explained how do you know richman said because thats what makes passengers vomit they can take yaw and roll but pitching makes them puke why are the oxygen masks missing richman said people grabbed them as they fell she said it must have happened that way and the seat backs are brokendo you know how much force it takes to break an airplane seat theyre designed to withstand an impact of sixteen gs people in this cabin bounced around like dice in a cup and from the damage it looks like it went on for a while how long at least two minutes she said an eternity for an incident like this she thought passing a shattered midships galley they came into the center cabin here damage was much worse many seats were broken there was a broad swath of blood across the ceiling the aisles were cluttered with debrisshoes torn clothing childrens toys a cleanup crew in blue uniforms marked norton irt was collecting the personal belongings putting them into big plastic bags casey turned to a woman have you found any cameras five or six so far the woman said couple of video cameras theres all sorts of stuff here she reached under a seat came out with a brown rubber diaphragm like i said stepping carefully over the litter in the aisles casey moved farther aft she passed another divider and entered the aft cabin near the tail richman sucked in his breath it looked as if a giant hand had smashed the interior seats were crushed flat overhead bins hung down almost touching the floor ceiling panels had split apart exposing wiring and silver insulation there was blood everywhere some of the seats were soaked deep maroon the aft lavs were ripped apart minors shattered stainlesssteel drawers hanging open twisted caseys attention was drawn to the left of the cabin where six paramedics were struggling to hold a heavy shape wrapped in white nylon mesh that hung near a ceiling bin the paramedics adjusted their position the nylon webbing shifted and suddenly a mans head flopped out of the mesh the face gray mouth open eyes sightless wisps of hair dangling oh god richman said he turned and fled casey went over to the paramedics the corpse was a middleaged chinese man whats the problem here she said sorry maam one of the medics said but we cant get him out we found him wedged here and hes stuck pretty good his left leg one of the paramedics shined a light upward the left leg was jammed through the overhead bin into the silver insulation above the window panel she tried to remember what cabling ran there whether it was flight critical just be careful getting him out she said from the galley she heard a cleanup woman say strangest damn thing i ever saw another woman said howd it get here damned if i know honey casey went over to see what they were talking about the cleaning woman was holding a blue pilots cap it had a bloody footprint on the top casey reached for it whered you find this right here the cleaning woman said outside the aft galley long way from the cockpit isnt it yes casey turned the cap in her hands silver wings on the front the yellow transpacific medallion in the center it was a pilots cap with a stripe for a captain so it probably belonged to one of the backup crew if this plane carried a backup crew she didnt know that yet oh dear me this is awful just awful she heard the distinctive monotone and looked up to see doug doherty the structural engineer striding into the aft cabin what did they do to my beautiful plane he moaned then he saw casey you know what this is dont you its not turbulence they were porpoising maybe casey said porpoising was the term for a series of dives and climbs like a porpoise leaping in water oh yes doherty said gloomily thats what happened they lost control terrible just terrible one of the paramedics said mr doherty doherty looked over oh dont tell me he said this is where the guy got wedged yes sir wouldnt you know he said gloomily moving closer it had to be the aft bulkhead right where every flightcritical system comes together tookay let me see what is it his foot yes sir they shone the light for him doherty pushed up against the body which swayed in the harness can you hold him okay anybody got a knife or something you probably dont but one of the paramedics gave him a pair of scissors and doherty began to cut bits of silver insulation floated to the ground doherty cut again and again his hand moving quickly finally he stopped okay he missed the a cable run he missed the a cable run hes left of the hydraulic lines left of the avionics pack okay i cant see he hurt the plane in any way the paramedics holding the dead body stared at doherty one of them said can we cut him out sir doherty was still looking intently what oh yeah sure cut him out he stepped back and the paramedics applied the big metal jaws to the upper portion of the plane they wedged the jaws between the overhead luggage bins and the ceiling then opened them there was a loud cracking sound as the plastic broke doherty turned away i cant watch he said i cant watch them tear up my beautiful aircraft he headed back to the nose the paramedics stared as he left richman came back looking slightly embarrassed he pointed out the windows whatre those guys doing on the wing casey bent down looked through the windows at the engineers on the wing theyre inspecting the slats she said leading edge control surfaces and what do slats do youii have to start him from the beginning casey said you know anything about aerodynamics no well an aircraft flies because of the shape of the wing the wing looked simple she explained but it was actually the most complicated physical component of the aircraft and it took the longest to build by comparison the fusethe fuselagewas simple just a lot of round barrels riveted together and the tail was just a fixed vertical vane with control surfaces but a wing was a work of art nearly two hundred feet long it was incredibly strong capable of bearing the weight of the plane but at the same time precisely shaped to within a hundredth of an inch the shape casey said is whats crucial its curved on top flat on the bottom that means air going across the top of the wing has to move faster and because of bernoullis principle i went to law school he reminded her bernoullis principle says the faster a gas moves the lower its pressure so the pressure within a moving stream is less than the air surrounding it she said since air moves faster across the top of the wing it creates a vacuum which sucks the wing upward the wing is strong enough to support the fuselage so the whole plane is lifted up thats what makes a plane fly okay now two factors determine how much lift is created the speed the wing moves through the air and the amount of curvature the greater the curvature the greater the lift okay when the wing is moving fast during flight going maybe point eight mach it doesnt need much curvature it actually wants to be almost flat but when the aircraft is moving slower during takeoff and landing the wing needs greater curvature to maintain lift so at those times we increase the curvature by extending sections in the front and backflaps at the back and slats at the leading edge slats are like flaps but in the front right i never noticed them before richman said looking out the window smaller planes dont have them casey said but this aircraft weighs close to threequarters of a million pounds fully loaded youve got to have slats on a plane this size as they watched the first of the slats moved outward then tilted down the men on the wing stuck their hands in their pockets and watched richman said why are the slats so important because casey said one possible cause of turbulence is slat extension in mid flight remember at cruise speed the wing should be almost flat if the slats extend the plane may become unstable and what would make the slats extend pilot error casey said thats the usual cause but supposedly this plane had a very good pilot right supposedly and if it wasnt pilot error she hesitated there is a condition called uncommanded slats deployment it means the slats extend without warning all by themselves richman frowned can that happen its been known to occur she said but we dont think its possible on this aircraft she wasnt going to get into the details with this kid not now richman still frowned if its not possible why are they checking because it might have happened and our job is to check everything maybe theres a problem with this particular aircraft maybe the control cables arent properly rigged maybe theres an electrical fault in the hydraulics actuators maybe the proximity sensors failed maybe the avionics code is buggy well check every system until we find out what happened and why and right now we havent got a clue four men were squeezed into the cockpit hunched over the controls van trung who was certified for the aircraft sat in the captains seat kenny bume was in the first officers seat on the right trung was functioning the control surfaces one after anotherflaps slats elevators rudder with each test the flight deck instrumentation was verified visually casey stood outside the cockpit with richman she said you got anything van nothing yet trung said weve got diddlysquat kenny burne said this bird is cherry theres nothing wrong with this plane richman said then maybe turbulence caused it after all turbulence my ass burne said who said that is that the kid yes richman said straighten the kid out casey burne said glancing over his shoulder turbulence casey said to richman is a famous catchall for anything that goes wrong on the flight deck turbulence certainly occurs and in the old days planes had some rough times but these days turbulence bad enough to cause injuries is unusual because radar pal burne snapped commercial aircraft are all equipped with weather radar pilots can see weather formations ahead and avoid them theyve also got much better communications between aircraft if a plane hits rough weather at your flight level two hundred miles ahead of you youll hear about the sigmet and get a course change so the days of serious turbulence are over richman was annoyed by burnes tone i dont know he said ive been on planes where turbulence got pretty rough ever see anybody get killed on one of those planes well no seen people thrown from their seats no seen injuries of any kind no richman said i havent thats right burne said but surely it is possible that possible bume said you mean like in court where anything is possible no but youre a lawyer right yes i am but well you better get one thing straight right now were not doing law here law is a bunch of bullshit this is an aircraft its a machine and either something happened to this machine or it didnt its not a matter of opinion so why dont you shut the fuck up and let us work richman winced but didnt back down fine he said but if it wasnt turbulence therell be evidence thats right burne said the seatbelt sign pilot hits turbulence the first thing he does is flash the seatbelt sign and make an announcement everybody buckles up and nobody gets hurt this guy never made an announcement maybe the sign doesnt work look up with a ping the seatbelt sign came on above their heads maybe the announcement doesnt burnes amplified voice said working working you better believe its working the pa clicked off dan greene the chubby operations inspector from the ifsdo came on board puffing from the climb up the metal stairs hey guys i got your certificate to ferry the plane to burbank i figured you want to take the bird to the plant yeah we do casey said hey dan kenny burne called nice job keeping the flight crew here fuck you greene said i had my guy at the gate a minute after the plane arrived the crew was already gone he turned to casey they get the stiff out not yet dan hes wedged in pretty tight we got the other dead bodies off and sent the seriously injured to westside hospitals heres the list he handed a sheet of paper to casey only a few are still at the port infirmary casey said how many are still here six or seven including a couple of stewardesses casey said can i talk to them dont see why not greene said casey said van how much longer figure an hour minimum okay she said im going to take the car and take fucking clarence darrow with you bume said lax am driving in the van richman gave a long exhale jeez he said are they always so friendly casey shrugged theyre engineers she said she was thinking what did he expect he must have dealt with engineers at gm emotionally theyre all thirteen years old stuck at the age just before boys stop playing with toys because theyve discovered girls theyre all still playing with toys they have poor social skills dress badlybut theyre extremely intelligent and well trained and they are very arrogant in their way outsiders are definitely not allowed to play especially lawyers anybody theyre like chess masters they dont waste time with amateurs and theyre under a lot of pressure now youre not an engineer me no and im a woman and im from qa three reasons why i dont count now marders made me irt liaison to the press which is another strike the engineers all hate the press will there be press on this probably not she said its a foreign carrier foreigners died the incident didnt occur in the united states and they dont have visuals they wont pay any attention but it seems so serious serious isnt a criterion she said last year there were twentyfive accidents involving substantial airframe damage twentythree occurred overseas which ones do you remember richman frowned the crash in abu dhabi that killed fiftysix people casey said the crash in indonesia that killed two hundred bogota that killed a hundred and fiftythree you remember any of those no richman said but wasnt there something in atlanta thats right she said a dc in atlanta how many people were killed none how many were injured none why do you remember it because there was film at eleven the van left the runway went through the chainlink gate and out onto the street they turned onto sepulveda and headed toward the rounded blue contours of the centinela hospital anyway casey said we have other things to worry about now she handed richman a tape recorder clipped a microphone to his lapel and told him what they were going to do centinela hospital pm you want to know what happened the bearded man said in an irritable voice his name was bennett he was forty years old a distributor for guess jeans he had gone to hong kong to visit the factory he went four times a year and always flew transpacific now he was sitting up in bed in one of the curtainedoff infirmary cubicles his head and right arm were bandaged the plane almost crashed thats what happened i see casey said i was wondering if who the hell are you people anyway he said she handed him her card introduced herself again norton aircraft what do you have to do with it we build the airplane mr bennett that piece of shit fuck you lady he threw the card back at her get the fuck out of here both of you mr bennett go on get out get out outside the curtained cubicle casey looked at richman i have a way with people she said ruefully casey went to the next cubicle and paused behind the curtain she heard chinese being spoken rapidly first a womans voice and then a mans voice responding she decided to move on to the next bed she opened the curtains and saw a sleeping chinese woman in a plaster neck brace a nurse in the room looked up held her finger to her lips casey went on to the next cubicle it was one of the flight attendants a twentyeightyearold woman named kay liang she had a large abrasion on her face and neck the skin raw and red she sat in a chair by the empty bed thumbing through a sixmonthold issue of vogue she explained that she had remained in the hospital to stay with shayan hao another stewardess who was in the next cubicle she is my cousin she said im afraid she was hurt badly they will not let me be in the room with her she spoke english well with a british accent when casey introduced herself kay liang looked confused youre from the manufacturer she said but a man was just here what man a chinese man he was here a few minutes ago i dont know about that casey said frowning but wed like to ask you some questions of course she put the magazine aside folded her hands in her lap composed how long have you been with transpacific casey asked three years kay liang answered and before that three years with cathay pacific she always flew international routes she explained because she had languages english and french as well as chinese and where were you when this incident occurred in the midcabin galley just behind business class the flight attendants were preparing breakfast she explained it was about five am perhaps a few minutes later and what happened the plane began to climb she said i know that because i was setting out drinks and they started to slide off the trolley then almost immediately there was a very steep descent what did you do she could do nothing she explained except hold on the descent was steep all the food and drinks fell she thought the descent lasted about ten seconds but she wasnt sure then there was another climb extremely steep and then another steep descent on the second descent she struck her head against the bulkhead did you lose consciousness no but that was when i scraped my face she gestured to her injury and what happened next she was not sure she said she was confused because the second stewardess in the galley miss jiao fell against her and they were both knocked to the floor we could hear the cries of the passengers she said and of course we saw them in the aisles afterward she said the plane became level again she was able to get up and help the passengers the situation was very bad she said particularly aft many injured and many bleeding in pain the flight attendants were overwhelmed also miss hao my cousin was not conscious she had been in the aft galley this upset the other stewardesses and three passengers were dead the situation was very distressing what did you do i got the emergency medical kits to care for the passengers then i went to the cockpit she wanted to see if the flight crew was all right and i wanted to tell them the first officer had been injured in the aft galley the first officer was in the aft galley when the incident occurred casey said kay liang blinked of the relief crew yes not the flight crew no the first officer of the relief crew you had two crews on board yes when did the crews change perhaps three hours earlier during the night what was the name of the injured first officer casey asked again she hesitated i i am not sure i had not flown with the relief crew before i see and when you went to the cockpit captain chang had the plane in control the crew was shaken but not injured captain chang told me that he had requested an emergency landing at los angeles youve flown with captain chang before yes he is a very good captain excellent captain i like him very much protesting too much casey thought the stewardess previously calm now appeared uneasy liang glanced at casey then looked away did there appear to be any damage to the flight deck casey asked the stewardess frowned thinking no she said the flight deck appeared normal in every respect did captain chang say anything else yes he said they had an uncommanded slats deployment she said he said that had caused the upset and the situation was now under control uhoh casey thought this was not going to make the engineers happy but casey was troubled by the stewardesss technical phrasing she thought it unlikely that a flight attendant would know about uncommanded slats deployment but perhaps she was just repeating what the captain had said did captain chang say why the slats deployed he just said uncommanded slats deployment i see casey said and do you know where the slats control is located kay liang nodded it is a lever in the center pillar between the chairs that was correct casey thought did you notice the lever at that time while you were in the cockpit yes it was in the up and locked position again casey noted the terminology a pilot would say up and locked would a flight attendant did he say anything else he was concerned about the autopilot he said the autopilot kept trying to cut in to take over the plane he said i had to fight the autopilot for control i see and what was captain changs manner at this time he was calm as always he is a very good captain the girls eyes flickered nervously she twisted her hands in her lap casey decided to wait for a moment it was an old interrogators trick let the subject break the silence captain chang comes from a distinguished family of pilots kay liang said swallowing his father was a pilot during the war and his son is a pilot as well i see the flight attendant lapsed into silence again there was a pause she looked down at her hands then back up so is there anything else i can tell you outside the cubicle richman said isnt this the thing you said couldnt happen uncommanded slats deployment i didnt say it couldnt happen i said i didnt believe it was possible on this aircraft and if it did it raises more questions than it answers and what about the autopilot too early to tell she said and went into the next cubicle it must have been around six oclock emily jansen said shaking her head she was a slender woman of thirty with a purple bruise on her cheek an infant slept on her lap her husband lay in the bed behind her a metal brace ran from his shoulders to his chin she said his jaw was broken i had just fed the baby i was talking to my husband and then i heard a sound what sort of a sound a rumbling or a grinding sound i thought it came from the wing not good casey thought so i looked out the window at the wing did you see anything unusual no it all looked normal i thought the sound might be coming from the engine but the engine looked normal too where was the sun that morning on my side shining in on my side so was there sunlight on the wing yes reflecting back at you emily jansen shook her head i dont really remember was the seatbelt sign on no never did the captain make an announcement no going back to this soundyou described it as a rumble something like that i dont know if i heard it or felt it it was almost like a vibration like a vibration how long did this vibration last several seconds five seconds longer i would say ten or twelve seconds a classic description of a slats deployment in flight casey thought okay she said and then the plane started going down jansen gestured with the flat of her hand like that casey continued to make notes but she no longer really listened she was trying to put together the sequence of events trying to decide how the engineers should proceed there was no question that both witnesses were telling a story consistent with slats deployment first rumbling for twelve seconds exactly the time it took the slats to extend then a slight nose up which would occur next and then porpoising as the crew tried to stabilize the aircraft what a mess she thought emily jansen was saying since the cockpit door was open i could hear all the alarms there were warning soundsand voices in english that sounded recorded do you remember what they said it sounded like fall fall something like that it was the stall alarm casey thought and the audio reminder was saying stall stall damn she stayed with emily jansen a few minutes more and then went back outside in the corridor richman said does that rumbling sound mean the slats deployed it might she said she was tense edgy she wanted to get back to the aircraft and talk to the engineers from one of the curtained cubicles farther downthe corridor she saw a stocky grayhaired figure emerge she was surprised to see it was mike lee she felt a burst of irritation what the hell was the carrier rep doing talking to passengers it was very inappropriate lee had no business being here she remembered what kay liang had said a chinese man was just here lee came up toward them shaking his head mike she said im surprised to see you here why you should give me a medal he said a couple of the passengers were considering lawsuits i talked them out of it but mike she said you talked to crew members before we did thats not right what do you think i fed them a story hell they gave me the story and theres not much doubt about what happened lee stared at her im sorry casey but flight had an uncommanded slats deploy and that means youve still got problems on the n walking back to the van richman said what did he mean youve still got problems casey sighed no point in holding back now she said weve had some incidents of slats deployment on the n wait a minute richman said you mean this has happened before not like this she said weve never had serious injuries but yes weve had problems with slats en route pm the first episode occurred four years ago on a flight to san juan casey said as they drove back slats extended in midflight at first we thought it was an anomaly but then there were two additional incidents within a couple of months when we investigated we found that in every case the slats had deployed during a period of flight deck activity right after a crew change or when they punched in coordinates for the next leg of the flight or something like that we finally realized the slats lever was getting knocked loose by the crews banged by clipboards caught on uniform sleeves youre kidding richman said no she said wed built a locking slot for the lever like park on an automobile transmission but despite the slot the lever was still being accidentally dislodged richman was staring at her with the skeptical expression of a prosecuting attorney so the n does have problems it was a new aircraft she said and all aircraft have problems when theyre first introduced you cant build a machine with a million parts and not have snags we do everything we can to avoid them first we design then we test the design then we build then we flight test but there are always going to be problems the question is how to resolve them how do you resolve them whenever we discover a problem we send the operators a headsup called a service bulletin which describes our recommended fix but we dont have the authority to mandate compliance some carriers implement some dont if the problem persists the faa gets into the act and issues an airworthiness directive to the carriers requiring them to fix the planes in service within a specified time but there are always ads for every model aircraft were proud of the fact that norton has fewer than anyone else so you say go look it up theyre all on file at oak city at what every ad thats ever been issued is on file at the faas technical center in oklahoma city so you had one of these ads on the n is that what youre telling me we issued a service bulletin recommending the carriers install a hinged metal cover that sits over the lever that meant the captain had to flip up the cover before he could deploy the slats but it solved the problem as usual some carriers made the fix others didnt so the faa issued an ad making it mandatory that was four years ago theres been only one incident since then but that involved an indonesian carrier who didnt install the cover in this country the faa requires carriers to comply but abroad she shrugged the carriers do what they want thats it thats the whole history thats the whole history the irt investigated the metal covers were installed on the fleet and there havent been any more slats problems on the n until now richman said thats right until now lax maintenance hangar pm a what kenny burne said shouting from the cockpit of transpacific they said it was what uncommanded slats deployment richman said aw blow me burne said he started climbing out of the seat what a crock of shit hey clarence come in here see that seat thats the first officers seat sit down there richman was hesitant come on clarence get in the damn seat awkwardly richman squeezed between the other men in the cockpit and got into the first officers chair on the right okay burne said you comfy in there clarence youre not a pilot by any chance no richman said okay good so here you are all set to fly the plane now you see straight aheadhe pointed to the control panel directly in front of richman which consisted of three video screens each four inches squareyou got your three color crts showing your primary flight display navigation display and on the left systems display all those little semicircles represent a different system all green meaning everythings fine now on the roof above your head thats your overhead instrument panel all the lights are out which means everything is fine its dark unless theres a problem now to your left is what we call the pedestal burne pointed to a boxy structure that protruded between the two seats there were a halfdozen levers in slots on the pedestal now from right to left flapsslats two throttles for the engines spoilers brakes thrusters slats and flaps are controlled by that lever nearest you the one with the little metal cover over it see it i see it richman said good flip up the cover and engage the slats engage the pull the slats lever down burne said richman flicked up the cover and struggled for a moment to move the lever no no grab it firmly pull it up then right then down burne said just like a gearshift on a car richman closed his fingers around the handle he pulled the lever up across and down there was a distant hum good burne said now look at your display see that amber slats extd indicator its telling you the slats are coming out of the leading edge okay takes twelve seconds to fully extend now theyre out and the indicator is white and says slats i see richman said okay now retract the slats richman reversed his actions pushing the lever up sliding it left and down to locked position then closing the cover over the handle that bume said is a commanded slats extension okay richman said now lets perform an uncommanded slats extension how do i do that any way you can pal for starters hit it with the side of your hand richman reached across the pedestal brushing the lever with his left hand but the cover protected it nothing happened come on hit that sucker richman swung his hand laterally back and forth banging against the metal he hit it harder and harder each time but nothing happened the cover protected the handle the slats lever remained up and locked maybe you could knock it with your elbow burne said or tell you what try this clipboard here he said pulling a clipboard from between the seats and giving it to richman go on give it a good whack im looking for an accident here richman struck the lever with the clipboard it clanged against the metal he turned the clipboard and pushed the lever with one edge nothing happened you want to keep trying burne said or are you starting to get the point it cant be done clarence not with that cover in place maybe the cover wasnt in place richman said hey burne said thats good thinking maybe you can knock the cover up by accident try that with your clipboard clarence richman swung the clipboard at the edge of the cover but the surface was smoothly curved and the clipboard just slid off the cover remained closed no way to do it burne said not by accident so whats the next thought maybe the cover was already up good idea burne said theyre not supposed to be flying with the cover up but who the hell knows what they did go ahead and lift die cover up richman lifted the cover up on its hinge the handle was now exposed okay clarence go to it richman swung his clipboard at the handle banging it hard but with most lateral movements the raised cover still acted as a protection the clipboard hit die cover before it struck the handle several times on impact the cover dropped back down again richman had to keep stopping to lift the cover up again before he could proceed maybe if you used your hand burne suggested richman tried swiping at the handle with his palm in a few moments the side of his hand was red and the lever remained firmly up and locked okay he said sitting back in the seat i get the point it cant be done bume said it simply cant be done an uncommanded slats deploy is impossible on this aircraft period from outside the cockpit doherty said are you guys finished screwing around because i want to pull the recorders and go home as they came out of the cockpit burne touched casey on the shoulder and said see you a minute sure she said he led her back in the plane out of earshot of the others he leaned close to her and said what do you know about that kid casey shrugged hes a norton relative what else marder assigned him to me you check him out no casey said if marder sent him i assume hes fine well i talked to my friends in marketing burne said they say hes a weasel they say dont turn your back on him kenny im telling you somethings wrong with that kid casey check him out with a metallic whir from the power screwdrivers the floor panels came away revealing a maze of cables and boxes under the cockpit jesus richman said staring ron smith was directing the operation running his hand over his bald head nervously thats fine he said now get the panel to the left how many boxes we got on this bird ron doherty said a hundred and fiftytwo smith said anybody else casey knew would have to thumb through a thick sheaf of schematics before he answered but smith knew the electrical system by heart whatre we pulling doherty said pull the cvr the dfdr and the qar if they got one smith said you dont know if theres a qar doherty said teasing him optional smith said its a customer install i dont think they put one in usually on the n its in the tail but i looked and didnt find one richman turned to casey he was looking puzzled again i thought they were getting the black boxes we are smith said theres a hundred and fiftytwo black boxes oh hell smith said theyre all over the aircraft but were only after the main ones nowthe ten or twelve nvms that count nvms richman repeated you got it smith said and he turned away bending over the panels it was left to casey to explain the public perception of an aircraft was that it was a big mechanical device with pulleys and levers that moved control surfaces up and down in the midst of this machinery were two magic black boxes recording events in the flight these were the black boxes that were always talked about on news programs the cvr the cockpit voice recorder was essentially a very sturdy tape deck it recorded the last half hour of cockpit conversation on a continuous loop of magnetic tape then there was the dfdr the digital flight data recorder which stored details of the behavior of the airplane so that investigators could discover what had happened after an accident but this image of an aircraft casey explained was inaccurate for a large commercial transport commercial jets had very few pulleys and leversindeed few mechanical systems of any sort nearly everything was hydraulic and electrical the pilot in the cockpit didnt move the ailerons or flaps by force of muscle instead the arrangement was like power steering on an automobile when the pilot moved the control stick and pedals he sent electrical impulses to actuate hydraulic systems which in turn moved the control surfaces the truth was that a commercial airliner was controlled by a network of extraordinarily sophisticated electronicsdozens of computer systems linked together by hundreds of miles of wiring there were computers for flight management for navigation for communication computers regulated the engines the control surfaces the cabin environment each major computer system controlled a whole array of subsystems thus the navigation system ran the ils for instrument landing the dme for distance measuring the atc for air traffic control the tcas for collision avoidance the gpws for ground proximity warning in this complex electronic environment it was relatively easy to install a digital flight data recorder since all the commands were already electronic they were simply routed through the dfdr and stored on magnetic media a modern dfdr records eighty separate flight parameters every second of the flight every second how big is this thing richman said its right there casey said pointing ron was pulling an orangeandblack striped box from the radio rack it was the size of a large shoe box he set it on the floor and replaced it with a new box for the ferry flight back to burbank richman bent over and lifted the dfdr by one stainlesssteel handle heavy thats the crashresistant housing ron said the actual doohickey weighs maybe six ounces and the other boxes what about them the other boxes existed casey said to facilitate maintenance because the electronic systems of the aircraft were so complicated it was necessary to monitor the behavior of each system in case of errors or faults during flight each system tracked its own performance in what was called non volatile memory thats nvm they would download eight nvm systems today the flight management computer which stored data on the flight plan and the pilotentered waypoints the digital engine controller which managed fuel bum and powerplant the digital air data computer which recorded airspeed altitude and overspeed warnings okay richman said i think i get the point none of this would be necessary ron smith said if we had the qar qar its another maintenance item casey said maintenance crews need to come on board after the plane lands and get a fast readout of anything that went wrong on the last leg dont they ask the pilots pilots will report problems but with a complex aircraft there may be faults that never come to their attention particularly since these aircraft are built with redundant systems for any important system like hydraulics theres always a backupand usually a third as well a fault in the second or third backup may not show in the cockpit so the maintenance crews come on board and go to the quick access recorder which spits out data from the previous flight they get a fast profile and do the repairs on the spot but theres no quick access recorder on this plane apparently not she said its not required faa regulations require a cvr and a dfdr the quick access recorder is optional looks like the carrier didnt put one on this plane at least i cant find it ron said but it could be anywhere he was down on his hands and knees bent over a laptopcomputer plugged into the electrical panels data scrolled down the screen as pwr test ail servo comp ada inv cfds sens fail crz cmd mon inv el servo comp eprn tra fms speed inv press alt inv gs speed ang slat xsit t gs dev inv gnd spd inv tas inv this looks like data from the flight control computer casey said most of the faults occurred on one leg when the incident occurred but how do you interpret this richman said not our problem ron smith said we just offload it and bring it back to norton the kids in digital feed it to mainframes and convert it to a video of the flight we hope casey said she straightened how much longer ron ten minutes max smith said oh sure doherty said from inside the cockpit ten minutes max oh sure not that it matters i wanted to beat rush hour traffic but now i guess i cant its my kids birthday and i wont be home for the party my wifes going to give me hell ron smith was starting to laugh can you think of anything else that might go wrong doug oh sure lots of things salmonella in the cake all the kids poisoned doherty said casey looked out the door the maintenance people had all climbed off the wing burne was finishing up his inspection of the engines trung was loading the dfdr into the van it was time to go home as she started down the stairs she noticed three norton security vans parked in a corner of the hangar there were about twenty security guards standing around the plane and in various parts of the hangar richman noticed too whats this about he said gesturing to the guards we always put security on the plane until its ferried to the plant she said thats a lot of security yeah well casey shrugged its an important plane but she noticed that the guards all wore sidearms casey couldnt remember seeing armed guards before a hangar at lax was a secure facility there wasnt any need for the guards to be armed was there bldg pm casey was walking through the northeast corner of building past the huge tools on which the wing was built the tools were crisscrossed blue steel scaffolding rising twenty feet above the ground although they were the size of a small apartment building the tools were precisely aligned to within a thousandth of an inch up on the platform formed by the tools eighty people were walking around putting the wing together to the right she saw groups of men packing tools into large wooden crates whats all that richman said looks like rotables casey said rotables spare tooling that we rotate into the line if something goes wrong with the first set we built them to gear up for the china sale the wings the most timeconsuming part to build so the plan is to build the wings in our facility in atlanta and ship them back here she noticed a figure in a shirt and tie shirtsleeves rolled up standing among the men working on the crates it was don brull the president of the uaw local he saw casey called to her and started toward her he made a flicking gesture with his hand she knew what he wanted casey said to richman give me a minute ill see you back at the office who is that richman said ill meet you back at the office richman remained standing there as brull came closer maybe you want me to stay and bob she said get lost reluctantly richman headed back toward the office he kept glancing over his shoulder as he walked away brull shook her hand the uaw president was a short and solidly built man an exboxer with a broken nose he spoke in a soft voice you know casey i always liked you thanks don she said feelings mutual those years when you were on the floor i always kept my eye on you kept you out of trouble i know that don she waited brull was notorious for long windups i always thought casey isnt like the others whats going on don she said we got some problems with this china sale brull said what kind of problems problems with the offset what about it she said shrugging you know theres always offset with a big sale in recent years airframe manufacturers had been obliged to send portions of the fabrication overseas to the countries ordering planes a country that ordered fifty planes expected to get a piece of the action it was standard procedure i know brull said but in the past you guys sent part of the tail maybe the nose maybe some interior fab just parts thats right but these tools were crating up he said are for the wing and the teamsters on the loading dock are telling us these crates arent going to atlanta theyre going to shanghai the companys going to give the wing to china i dont know the details of the agreement she said but i doubt that the wing casey he said thats core technology nobody ever gives away the wing not boeing nobody you give the chinese the wing you give away the store they dont need us any more they can build the next generation of planes on their own ten years from now nobody here has a job don she said ill check into this but i cant believe the wing is part of the offset agreement brull spread his hands im telling you it is don ill check for you but right now im pretty busy with this incident and youre not listening casey the locals got a problem with the china sale i understand that but a big problem he paused looked at her understand she did the uaw workers on the floor had absolute control over production they could slow down sick out break tooling and create hundreds of other intractable problems ill talk to marder she said im sure he doesnt want a problem on the line marder is the problem casey sighed typical union misinformation she thought the china sale had been made by hal edgarton and the marketing team marder was just the coo he ran the plant he didnt have anything to do with sales ill get back to you tomorrow don thats fine brull said but im telling you casey personally id hate to see anything happen don she said are you threatening me no no brull said quickly with a pained expression dont misunderstand but hear that if the thing isnt cleared up fast it could kill the china sale thats true and youre speaking for the irt thats true too brull shrugged so im telling you feelings are strong against the sale some of the guys are pretty hot about it i was you id take a week off i cant do that im right in the middle of the investigation brull looked at her don ill talk to marder about the wing she said but i have to do my job in that case brull said putting his hand on her arm you take real good care honey administration pm no no marder said pacing in his office this is nonsense casey theres no way wed send the wing to shanghai what do they think were crazy thatd be the end of the company but brull said the teamsters are screwing with the uaw thats all you know how rumors run through the plant remember when they all decided composites made you sterile damn guys wouldnt come to work for a month but it wasnt true and this ones not true either those tools are going to atlanta he said and for one very good reason were fabbing the wing in atlanta so that the senator from georgia will stop messing with us every time we go to the exim bank for a big loan its a jobs program for the senior senator from georgia got it then somebody better get the word out casey said christ marder said they know this the union reps sit in on all the management meetings its usually brull himself but he didnt sit in on the china negotiations ill speak to him marder said casey said id like to see the offset agreement and you will as soon as its final what are we giving them part of the nose and the empennage marder said same as we did for france hell we cant give them anything else theyre not competent to build it brull was talking about interfering with the irt to stop the china sale interfering how marder said frowning at her did he threaten you casey shrugged what did he say he recommended a weeks vacation oh for christs sake marder said throwing up his hands this is ridiculous ill talk to him tonight straighten him out dont worry about this just stay focused on the job okay okay thanks for the headsup ill take care of this for you norton qa pm casey rode the elevator from the ninth floor down to her own offices on the fourth floor she replayed the meeting with marder and decided he wasnt lying his exasperation had been genuine and it was true what marder saidrumors flew through the plant all the time a couple of years back there was a week when the uaw guys had all come up to her asking solicitously how do you feel it was days before she learned there was a rumor she had cancer just a rumor another rumor she walked down the corridor past the photographs of famous norton aircraft from the past with a celebrity posed in front franklin delano roosevelt beside the b that carried him to yalta errol flynn with smiling girls in the tropics in front of an n henry kissinger on the n that had taken him to china in the photographs were sepiatoned to convey a sense of age and the stability of the company she opened the doors to her offices frosted glass with raised lettering quality assurance division she came into a large open room the secretaries sat in the bullpen executive offices lined the walls norma sat by the door a heavyset woman of indeterminate age with bluerinse hair and a cigarette dangling from her mouth it was against regulations to smoke in the building but norma did as she pleased she had been with the company as long as anyone could remember it was rumored that she had been one of the girls in the picture with errol flynn and that she had had a hot affair with charley norton back in the fifties whether any of that was true or not she certainly knew where all the bodies were buried within the company she was treated with a deference bordering on fear even marder was cautious around her casey said whatve we got norma the usual panic norma said telexes are flying she handed a stack to casey the fizer in hong kong phoned three times for you but hes gone home now fizer in vancouver was on the horn half an hour ago you can probably still get him casey nodded it was not surprising that the flight service representatives in the major hubs would be checking in the fsrs were norton employees assigned to the carriers and the carriers would be worried about the incident and lets see norma said the washington office is all atwitter theyve heard the jaa is going to exploit this on airbuss behalf what a surprise fizer in dusseldorf wants a confirm it was pilot error fizer in milan wants information fizer in abu dhabi wants a week in milan fizer in bombay heard engine failure i straightened him out and your daughter said to tell you she did not need her sweatshirt great casey took the faxes back to her office she found richman sitting at her desk he looked up in surprise and rose quickly from her chair sorry casey said didnt norma find you an office yes i have one richman said walking around the desk i was just ah just wondering what you wanted me to do with this he held up a plastic bag with the video camera they had found on the plane ill take it he gave it to her so what happens now she dropped the stack of telexes on her desk id say youre through for the day she said be here tomorrow at seven he left and she sat down in her chair everything seemed to be as she had left it but she noticed that the second drawer on the desk was not quite closed had richman been going through her desk casey pulled the drawer open revealing boxes of computer disks stationery a pair of scissors some felttip pens in a tray it all looked undisturbed but still she heard richman leave then went back down the hall to normas desk that kid she said was sitting behind my desk tell me norma said the little twerp asked me to get him coffee im surprised marketing didnt straighten him out casey said they had him a couple of months as a matter of fact norma said i was talking to jean over there and she says they hardly ever saw him he was always on the road on the road a new kid a norton relative marketing would never send him on the road whered he go norma shook her head jean didnt know you want me to call travel and find out yeah casey said i do back in her office she turned to the plastic bag on the desk opened it and pulled the videotape from the shattered camera she set the tape to one side then she dialled jims number hoping to talk to allison but she got the answering machine she hung up without leaving a message she thumbed through the telexes the only one that interested her was from the fsr in hong kong as always he was way behind the curve from rick rakoski fsr hk to casey singleton qairt norton bbk transpacific airlines today reports flight an n fuse foreign registry hb flying from hk to denver experienced a turbulence upset during cruise fl approximately utc position north east some passengers and crew suffered minor injuries aircraft made emergency landing lax flight plan passenger and crew manifest attached pls advise soonest the telex was followed by four pages of passenger manifest and crew list she glanced at the crew list john zhen chang captain leu zan ping first officer richard yong first officer gerhard reimann first officer henri marchand engineer thomas chang engineer robert sheng engineer harriet chang flight attendant linda ching flight attendant nancy morley flight attendant kay liang flight attendant john white flight attendant m v chang flight attendant sha yan hao flight attendant yee jiao flight attendant harriet king flight attendant b choi flight attendant yee chang flight attendant it was an international crew of the kind that often flew for charter companies hong kong crews had often flown for the royal air force and were extremely well trained she counted the names eighteen in all including seven flight crew such a large flight crew was not strictly necessary the n was designed to be flown by a twoman crew just a captain and first officer but all the asian carriers were expanding rapidly and they generally carried larger crews for extra training hours casey went on the next telex was from the fsr in vancouver from s nieto fsr vanc to c singleton qairt fyi flight crew tpa deadhead on tpa from lax to vancouver first officer lu zan ping taken off the aircraft at vancouver medical emergency due to previously unrecognized head injury f comatose in vanc gen hosp details tf remaining crew of tpa transit back to hong kong today so the first officer had been seriously injured after all he must have been in the tail when the incident occurred the man whose cap they had found casey dictated a telex to the fsr in vancouver asking him to interview the first officer as soon as possible she dictated another to the fsr in hong kong suggesting an interview with captain chang on his return norma buzzed her no luck on the kid she said why not i talked to maria in travel they didnt make richmans arrangements his trips were charged to a special company account a setaside for foreign offbudget stuff but she heard the kid ran up a hell of a big charge how big casey said she didnt know norma sighed but im having lunch tomorrow with evelyn in accounting shell give me everything okay thanks norma casey turned back to the telexes on her desk they were all other business steve young from the faas certification office asking about fireretardant test results on seat cushions the previous december a query from mitsubishi about burnouts of then fiveinch displays in the firstclass section of american n widebodies a list of revisions to the n aircraft maintenance manual mr a revision of the prototype virtual headsup display units to be delivered in the next two days a memo from honeywell advising replacement of die d electrical bus on all fdau units numbered a through a casey sighed and went to work glendale pm she was tired when she got home the house seemed empty without allisons lively chatter too tired to cook casey went into the kitchen and ate a cup of yogurt allisons colorful drawings were taped on the refrigerator door casey considered calling her but it was right around her bedtime and she didnt want to interrupt if jim was putting her to sleep she also didnt want jim to think she was checking up on him that was a sore point between them he always felt she was checking casey went into the bathroom and turned on the shower she heard the phone ring and went back into the kitchen to answer it it was probably jim she picked up the receiver hello jim dont be stupid bitch a voice said you want trouble youll get it accidents happen were watching you right now click she stood in the kitchen holding the phone in her hand casey had always thought of herself as levelheaded but her heart was pounding she forced herself to take a deep breath as she hung up the receiver she knew these calls happened sometimes shed heard of other vicepresidents getting threatening calls at night but it had never happened to her and she was surprised at how frightened she felt she took another deep breath tried to shrug it off she picked up her yogurt stared at it put it down she was suddenly aware that she was alone in a house with all the blinds open she went around the living room closing the blinds when she came to the front window she looked out at the street in the light of the overhead street lamps she saw a blue sedan parked a few yards up from her house there were two men inside she could see their faces clearly through the windshield the men stared at her as she stood at the window shit she went to the front door bolted it locked the security chain she set the burglar alarm her ringers trembling and clumsy as she punched in the code then she flicked off the living room lights pressed her body to the wall and peered out the window the men were still in the car they were talking now as she watched one of them pointed toward her house she went back to the kitchen fumbled in her purse found her pepper spray she clicked off the safety with her other hand she grabbed the phone and pulled it on the long cord back to the dining room still watching the men she called the police glendale police she gave her name and address there are men parked outside my house theyve been here since this morning ive just gotten a threatening call okay maam is anybody in the house with you now no im alone okay maam lock your door and set the alarm if you have one a car is on the way hurry she said on the street the men were getting out of the car and walking toward her house they were dressed casually in polo shirts and slacks but they looked grim and tough as they came forward they split up one walking onto the lawn the other heading toward the back of the house casey felt her heart thump in her chest had she locked the back door gripping the pepper spray she moved back to the kitchen turning off the light there then past the bedroom to the back door looking through the window in the door she saw one of the men standing in the back alley he was looking around cautiously then his gaze turned toward the back door she crouched down slipped the chain across the door she heard the sound of soft footsteps coming closer to the house she looked up at the wall just above her head there was a keypad for the alarm and a big red button marked emergency if she hit that button a screeching alarm would sound would that scare him away she wasnt sure where were the damned police anyway how long had it been she realized she could not hear the footsteps any more cautiously she raised her head until she could peer out the bottom corner of the window the man was walking down the alley away from her now then he turned circling the house heading back to the street staying low casey ran back to the front of the bungalow to the dining room the first man was no longer on her lawn she felt panic where was he the second man appeared on the lawn squinted at the front of her house then headed back toward the car she saw the first man was already in the car sitting in the passenger seat the second man opened the door and got in behind the wheel moments later a blackandwhite squad car pulled up behind the blue sedan the men in the car seemed surprised but they didnt do anything the squad car turned on its spotlight and one officer got out moving cautiously forward he talked to the men in the sedan for a moment then the two men got out they all walked up the steps to her front doorthe policeman and the two men from the car she heard the doorbell ring and answered it a young police officer said maam is your name singleton yes she said you work for norton aircraft yes i do these gentlemen are norton security they say theyre guarding you casey said what would you like to see their credentials yes she said i would the policeman shone a flashlight while the two men each held out their wallets for her she recognized credentials for norton security services were sorry maam one of the guards said we thought you knew weve been told to check the house every hour is that all right with you yes she said its fine the policeman said to her is there anything else she felt embarrassed she mumbled thanks and went back inside make sure you lock that door maam the guards said politely yeah i got em parked in front of my house too kenny burne said scared the hell out of mary whats going on anyway labor negotiations arent for another two years ill call marder she said everybody gets guards marder said on the phone the union threatens one of our team we detail guards dont worry about it did you talk to brull she said yeah i straightened him out but itll take a while for the word to filter down to the rank and file until it does everybody gets guards okay she said this is a precaution marder said nothing more okay she said get some sleep marder said and hung up tuesday glendale am she awoke uneasily before the alarm went off she pulled on a bathrobe walked to the kitchen to turn on the coffee and looked out the front window the blue sedan was still parked on the street the men inside she considered taking her fivemile run she needed that exercise to start her day but decided against it she knew she shouldnt feel intimidated but there was no point in taking chances she poured a cup of coffee sat in the living room everything looked different to her today yesterday her little bungalow felt cozy today it felt small defenseless isolated she was glad allison was spending the week with jim casey had lived through periods of labor tension in the past she knew that the threats usually came to nothing but it was wise to be cautious one of the first lessons casey had learned at norton was that the factory floor was a very tough world tougher even than the assembly line at ford norton was one of the few remaining places where an unskilled high school graduate could earn a year with overtime jobs like that were scarce and getting scarcer the competition to get those jobs and to keep them was fierce if the union thought the china sale was going to cost jobs they could very well act ruthlessly to stop it she sat with the coffee cup on her lap and realized she dreaded going to the factory but of course she had to go casey pushed the cup away and went into the bedroom to dress when she came outside and got into her mustang she saw a second sedan pull up behind the first as she drove down the street the first car pulled out following her so marder had ordered two sets of guards one to watch her house and one to follow her things must be worse than she thought she drove into the plant with an uncharacteristic feeling of unease first shift had already started the parking lots were full acres and acres of cars the blue sedan stayed right behind her as casey pulled up to the security guard at gate the guard waved her through and by some unseen signal allowed the blue sedan to follow directly without putting the barrier down the sedan stayed behind her until she parked at her spot in administration she got out of the car one of the guards leaned out the window have a nice day maam he said thanks i will the guard waved the sedan sped off casey looked around at the huge gray buildings building to the south building to the east where the twinjet was built building the paint shed the maintenance hangars in a row off to the west lit by the sun rising over the san fernando mountains it was a familiar landscape shed spent five years here but today she was uncomfortably aware of the vast dimensions the emptiness of the place in early morning she saw two secretaries walking into the administration building no one else she felt alone she shrugged her shoulders shaking off her fears she was being silly she told herself it was time to go to work norton aircraft am rob wong the young programmer at norton digital information systems turned away from the video monitors and said sorry casey we got the flight recorder databut theres a problem she sighed dont tell me yeah there is she was not really surprised to hear it flight data recorders rarely performed correctly in the press these failures were explained as the consequence of crash impacts after an airplane hit the ground at five hundred miles an hour it seemed reasonable to think that a tape deck might not be working but within the aerospace industry the perception was different everyone knew flight data recorders failed at a very high rate even when the aircraft didnt crash the reason was that the faa did not require they be checked before every flight in practice they were usually functionchecked about once a year the consequence was predictable the flight recorders rarely worked everybody knew about the problem the faa the ntsb the airlines and the manufacturers norton had conducted a study a few years back a random check of dfdrs in active service casey had been on that study committee theyd found that only one recorder in six worked properly why the faa would mandate the installation of fdrs without also requiring that they be in working order before each flight was a frequent subject of latenight discussion in aerospace bars from seattle to long beach the cynical view was that malfunctioning fdrs were in everybodys interest in a nation besieged by rabid lawyers and a sensational press the industry saw little advantage to providing an objective reliable record of what had gone wrong were doing the best we can casey rob wong said but the flight recorder data is anomalous meaning what it looks like the numberthree bus blew about twenty hours before the incident so the frame syncs are out on the subsequent data the frame syncs yeah see the fdr records all the parameters in rotation in data blocks called frames you get a reading for say airspeed and then you get another reading four blocks later airspeed readings should be continuous across the frames if theyre not the frames are out of sync and we cant build the flight ill show you he turned to the screen pressing keys normally we can take the dfdr and generate the airplane in triaxis theres the plane ready to go a wireframe image of the norton n widebody appeared on the screen as she watched the wire frame filled in until it took on the appearance of an actual aircraft in flight okay now we feed it your flight recorder data the airplane seemed to ripple it vanished from the screen then reappeared it vanished again and when it reappeared the left wing was separated from the fuselage the wing twisted ninety degrees while the rest of the airplane rolled to the right then the tail vanished the entire plane vanished reappeared again vanished again see the mainframes trying to draw the aircraft rob said but it keeps hitting discontinuities the wing data doesnt fit the fuse data which doesnt fit the tail data so it breaks up what do we do she said resync the frames but thatll take time how long marders on my back it could be a while casey the datas pretty bad what about the qar there isnt one well if youre really stuck id take this data to flight sims they have some sophisticated programs there they may be able to fill in the blanks faster and tell you what happened but rob no promises casey he said not with this data sorry bldg am casey met richman outside building they walked together in the earlymorning light toward the building richman yawned you were in marketing werent you thats right richman said we sure didnt keep these hours what did you do there not much he said edgarton had the whole department doing a full court press on the china deal very hushhush no outsiders allowed they threw me a little legal work on the iberian negotiation any travel richman smirked just personal hows that she said well since marketing had nothing for me to do i went skiing sounds like fun whered you go casey said you ski richman said personally i think the best skiing outside of gstaad is sun valley thats my favorite you know if you have to ski in the states she realized he hadnt answered her question by then they had walked through the side door into building casey noticed the workers were openly hostile the atmosphere distinctly chilly whats this richman said we got rabies today union thinks were selling them out on china selling them out how they think managements shipping the wing to shanghai i asked marder he says no a klaxon sounded echoing through the building directly ahead the big yellow overhead crane cranked to life and casey saw the first of the huge crates containing the wing tooling rise five feet up into the air on thick cables the crate was constructed of reinforced plywood it was as broad as a house and probably weighed five tons a dozen workers walked alongside the crate like pallbearers hands up steadying the load as it moved toward one of the side doors and a waiting flatbed truck if marder says no richman said then whats the problem they dont believe him really why not casey glanced to her left where other tools were being crated for shipment the huge blue tools were first packed in foam then braced internally and then crated all that padding and bracing was essential she knew because even though the tools were twenty feet in length they were calibrated to thousandths of an inch transporting them was an art in itself she looked back at the crate moving on the hoist all the men standing beneath it were gone the crate was still moving laterally ten yards from where they stood uhoh she said what richman said she was already pushing him go she said shoving richman to the right toward the shelter of the scaffolding that stood beneath a partially assembled fuselage richman resisted he didnt seem to understand that run she shouted its going to break loose he ran behind her casey heard the creak of rending plywood and a metallic twang as the first of the hoist cables snapped and the giant crate began to slide from its harness they had just reached the fuselage scaffolding when she heard another twang and the crate smashed down onto the concrete floor slivers of plywood exploded in all directions whistling through the air they were followed by a thunderous whomp as the crate toppled over on its side the sound reverberated through the building jesus christ richman said turning to look back at her what was that that she said is what we call a job action men were running forward hazy forms in the cloud of lingering dust there were shouts and calls for help the medic alarm sounded ringing through the building at the opposite side of the building she saw doug doherty shaking his head mournfully richman looked over his shoulder and pulled a fourinch splinter of plywood from the back of his jacket jeez he said he took the jacket off inspected the tear putting his finger through the hole that was a warning casey said and theyve also wrecked the tool now itll have to be uncrated and rebuilt this means weeks of delay floor supervisors in white shirts and ties ran forward into the group around the fallen crate what happens now richman said theyll take names and kick ass casey said but it wont do any good therell be another incident tomorrow theres no way to stop it this was a warning richman said he put the jacket back on to the irt she said a clear signal watch your backs watch your heads well see falling wrenches all sorts of accidents whenever were on the floor well have to be careful two workmen broke away from the group around the crate and started walking toward casey one man was burly wearing jeans and a redchecked work shirt the other was taller and wore a baseball cap the man in the work shirt held a steel drillpress stanchion in his hand swinging it at his side like a metal club uh casey richman said i see them she said she was not going to get rattled by a couple of floor goons the men walked steadily toward her suddenly a supervisor appeared in front of them holding his clipboard demanding the men show their badges the men stopped to talk to the supervisor glaring at casey over his head we wont have any trouble with them she said an hour from now theyll be gone she went back to the scaffolding picked up her briefcase come on she said to richman were late bldg irt am chairs scraped as everyone pulled up to the formica table okay marder said lets get started were having some union activity aimed at stalling this investigation dont let it get to you keep your eye on the ball first item weather data the secretary passed sheets around the room it was a report from the la traffic control center on a form marked federal aviation administration report of aircraft accident casey read weather data jal a br was minutes ahead of tpa on the same route and above jal made no report of turbulence ual a br reported moderate chop at the fir north east at fl this was miles north and minutes ahead of tpa ual made no other reports of turbulence aal reported continuous light chop at north east at fl aal was on the same route below and approximately minutes behind tpa aal made no report of turbulence we still have satellite data coming but i think the evidence speaks for itself the three aircraft nearest in time and location to transpacific report no weather except light chop im ruling out turbulence as a cause of this accident there were nods around the table no one disagreed anything else for the record yes casey said passenger and crew interviews agree the seatbelt sign was never illuminated okay then were done with weather whatever happened to that plane wasnt turbulence flight recorder datas anomalous casey said theyre working on it visual inspection of the plane the interior was severely damaged doherty said but the exterior was fine cherry leading edge no problem we could see well have the aircraft here today and ill look at the drive tracks and latches but so far nothing you test the control surfaces no problem instrumentation bravo zulu how many times you test em after we heard the passengers story from casey we did ten extensions trying to get a disagree but everythings normal what story casey you got something from the interviews yes she said one passenger gave a report of a slight rumble coming from the wing lasting ten to twelve seconds shit marder said followed by a slight nose up then a dive goddamn it and then a series of violent pitch excursions marder glared at her are you telling me its the slats again have we still got a slats problem on this aircraft i dont know casey said one of the flight attendants reported that the captain said he had an uncommanded slats deployment and that hed had problems with the autopilot christ and problems with the autopilot screw him burne said this captain changes his story every five minutes tells traffic control hes got turbulence tells the stewardess hes got slats right now i bet hes telling the carrier a whole different story fact is we dont know what happened in that cockpit its obviously slats marder said no its not bume said the passenger casey talked to said the rumbling sound came from the wing or the engines isnt that right right casey said but when she looked at the wing she didnt see the slats extend which she would have seen if it happened also true casey said but she couldnt have seen the engines because theyd be hidden by the wing its possible the thrust reversers deployed burne said at cruise speed thatd produce a definite rumble followed by a sudden drop in airspeed probably a roll the pilot shits tries to compensate overreactsbingo any confirmation thrusters deployed marder said damage to the sleeves unusual rubstrips we looked yesterday bume said and we didnt find anything well do ultrasound and x rays today if theres something there well find it okay marder said so were looking at slats and thrusters and we need more data what about the nvms ron the faults suggest anything they turned to ron smith under their gaze ron hunched lower in his seat as if trying to pull his head between his shoulders he cleared his throat well marder said uh yeah john we have a slats disagree on the fdau printout so the slats did deploy well actually and the plane started porpoising beat hell out of the passengers and killed three is that what youre telling me no one spoke jesus marder said what is the matter with you people this problem was supposed to be fixed four years ago now youre telling me it wasnt the group fell silent and stared at the table embarrassed and intimidated by marders rage goddamn it marder said john lets not get carried away it was trung the avionics head speaking quietly were overlooking a very important factor the autopilot there was a long silence marder glared at him what about it he snapped even if the slats extend in cruise flight trung said the autopilot will maintain perfect stability its programmed to compensate for errors like that the slats extend the ap adjusts the captain sees the warning and retracts them meanwhile the plane continues no problem maybe he went out of autopilot he must have but why maybe your autopilots screwed up marder said maybe you got a bug in your code trung looked skeptical its happened marder said there was an autopilot problem on that usair flight in charlotte last year put the plane into an uncommanded roll yes trung said but that wasnt caused by a bug in the code maintenance pulled the a flight control computer to repair it and when they reinstalled it they didnt push it in the shelf far enough to fully engage the connector pins the thing kept making intermittent electrical connection thats all but on flight the stewardess said the captain had to fight the autopilot for control and id expect that trung said once the aircraft exceeds flight params the autopilot actively attempts to take over it sees erratic behavior and assumes nobody is flying the plane did that show up on the fault records yes they indicate the autopilot tried to kick in every three seconds i assume the captain kept overriding it insisting on flying the plane himself but this is an experienced captain which is why i think kenny is right trung said we have no idea what took place in that cockpit they all turned to mike lee the carrier representative how about it mike marder said can we get an interview or not lee sighed philosophically you know he said ive spent a lot of time in meetings like this and the tendency is always to blame the guy whos not there its human nature ive already explained to you why the flight crew left the country your own records confirm the captain is a firstrate pilot its possible he made an error but given the history of problems with this aircraftslats problemsid look first at the aircraft and id look hard we will marder said of course we will but because its to no ones advantage lee said to get into a pissing match you are focused on your pending deal with beijing fine i understand but i would remind you transpacific is also a valued customer of this company weve bought ten planes to date and we have twelve more on order were expanding our routes and we are negotiating a feeder deal with a domestic carrier we dont need any bad press at the moment not for the planes weve bought from you and certainly not for our pilots i hope im being clear clear as a fucking bell marder said i couldnt have said it better myself guys you have your marching orders get on with it i want answers bldg ofsim am flight felix wallerstein said its very disturbing very disturbing indeed wallerstein was a silverhaired courtly man from munich he ran the norton flight simulator and pilot training program with germanic efficiency casey said why do you say is disturbing because he shrugged how could it happen it does not seem possible they walked through the large main room of building the two flight simulators one for each model in service stood above them they appeared to be truncated nose sections of the aircraft held up by a spidery array of hydraulic lifts did you get the data from the flight recorder rob said you might be able to read it i tried he said with no success i hesitate to say it is useless butwhat about the qar no qar felix ah wallerstein sighed they came to the command console a series of video screens and keyboards to one side of the building here the instructors sat while they monitored the pilots being trained in the simulator two of the simulators were being used as they watched casey said felix were concerned the slats extended in cruise flight or possibly the thrust reversers so he said why should that matter weve had problems with slats before yes but that is long since fixed casey and slats cannot explain such a terrible accident where people are killed no no not from slats casey youre sure absolutely i will show you he turned to one of the instructors at the console whos flying the n now ingram first officer from northwest any good average hes got about thirty hours on the closedcircuit video screen casey saw a man in his mid thirties sitting in the pilots seat of the simulator and where is he now felix said uh lets see the instructor said consulting his panels hes over the midatlantic fl threethirty point eight mach good felix said so hes at thirtythree thousand feet eighttenths the speed of sound hes been there awhile and everything seems to be fine hes relaxed maybe a little lazy yes sir good deploy mr ingrams slats the instructor reached over and pushed a button felix turned to casey watch carefully please on the video screen the pilot remained casual unconcerned but a few seconds later he leaned forward suddenly alert frowning at his controls felix pointed to the instructors console and the array of screens here you can see what he is seeing on his flight management display the slats indicator is flashing and hes noticed it meanwhile you see the plane gives a slight nose up the hydraulics whirred and the big cone of the simulator tilted upward a few degrees mr ingram now checks his slats lever as he should he finds it is up and locked which is puzzling since it means he has an uncommanded slats deploy the simulator remained tilted up so mr ingram is thinking it over he has plenty of time to decide what to do the aircraft is quite stable on autopilot lets see what he decides ah he decides to play with his controls he pulls the slats lever down then up hes trying to clear the warning but that doesnt change anything so he now realizes he has a system problem on his aircraft but he remains calm hes still thinking what will he do he changes the autopilot params he descends to a lower altitude and reduces his airspeed absolutely correct he is still in the noseup attitude but now at more favorable conditions of altitude and speed he decides to try the slats lever again the instructor said should i let him off the hook why not felix said i believe we have made the point the instructor punched a button the simulator tilted back to level and so felix said mr ingram is restored to normal flight he makes a note of his problem for the maintenance crews and he continues on his way to london but he stayed in the autopilot casey said what if he went out of it why should he do that hes in cruise flight the autopilot has been operating the plane for at least half an hour but suppose he did felix shrugged turned to the instructor fail his autopilot yes sir an audible alarm sounded on the video screen they saw the pilot look at the controls and take the stick in his hands the audible alarm ended the cockpit became silent the pilot continued to hold the stick is he flying the plane now felix asked yes sir the instructor said hes at fl twoninety point sevenone mach with autopilot disabled okay felix said deploy his slats the instructor pushed a button on the systems monitor in the training console the slats warning flashed first amber then white casey looked at the adjacent video screen and saw the pilot leaning forward he had noticed the warning in the cockpit now felix said once again we see the aircraft noseup but this time mr ingram must control it himself so he brings the stick back very slightly very delicately good and now he is stable he turned to casey you see he shrugged it is very puzzling whatever happened to that transpacific flight it cannot be the slats and not thrusters either in either case the autopilot will compensate and maintain control i tell you casey what happened to that aircraft is a mystery back in the sunlight felix walked over to his jeep with a surfboard on top i have a new henley board he said like to see it felix she said marder is starting to scream so let him he enjoys it what do you think happened to well let us be frank flight characteristics of an n are such that if slats deploy at cruise speed and the captain goes out of the autopilot the aircraft is rather sensitive you remember casey you did the study on it three years ago right after we made the final fix on the slats thats right she said thinking back we put together a special team to review flight stability issues on the n but we concluded there wasnt a controlsensitivity problem felix and you were correct felix said there is no problem all modern aircraft maintain flight stability with computers a jet fighter cannot be flown at all without computers fighters are inherently unstable commercial transports are less sensitive but even so computers shift fuel adjust attitude adjust cg adjust thrust on the engines moment to moment the computers continuously make small changes to stabilize the aircraft yes casey said but the planes can be flown out of autopilot as well absolutely felix said and we train our captains to do that because the aircraft is sensitive when the nose goes up the captain must very gently bring it back again if he corrects too strongly the plane noses over in that case he must pull up but again very gently or he is likely to overcorrect so the plane would climb sharply then nose down once more and this is precisely the pattern that occurred on the transpacific flight youre saying it was pilot error ordinarily i would think so except the pilot was john chang hes a good pilot no felix said john chang is a superb pilot i see a lot of pilots here and some are truly gifted its more than quick reflexes and knowledge and experience its more than skill its a kind of instinct john chang is one of the five or six best captains i have ever trained on this aircraft casey so whatever happened to flight it cannot be pilot error not with john chang in the chair i am sorry but in this case it has to be a problem with the aircraft casey it has to be that aircraft to hangar am as they walked back across the vast parking lot casey was lost in thought so richman said after a while where are we nowhere no matter how she put the evidence together that was the conclusion she came to they had nothing solid so far the pilot had said it was turbulence but it wasnt turbulence a passenger gave a story consistent with slats deployment but slats deployment couldnt explain the terrible damage to the passengers the stewardess said the captain fought the autopilot which trung said only an incompetent captain would do felix said the captain was superb nowhere they were nowhere beside her richman trudged along not saying anything he had been quiet all morning it was as if the puzzle of flight so intriguing to him yesterday had now proven too complex but casey was not discouraged she had come to this point many times before it was no surprise the early evidence appeared to conflict because aircraft accidents were rarely caused by a single event or error the ir teams expected to find event cascades one thing leading to another and then another in the end the final story would be complex a system failed a pilot responded the aircraft reacted unexpectedly and the plane got in trouble always a cascade a long chain of small errors and minor mishaps she heard the whine of a jet looking up she saw a norton widebody silhouetted against the sun as it passed over her she saw the yellow transpacific insignia on the tail it was the ferry flight from lax the big jet landed gently puffed smoke at the wheels and headed toward maintenance hangar her beeper went off she unclipped it from her belt n rotr burst miami tv now btoya oh hell she said lets find a tv why whats the matter richman said we have trouble bldg irt am this was the scene just moments ago at miami international airport when a sunstar airlines jet burst into flames after its left starboard engine exploded without warning showering the crowded runway with a hail of deadly shrapnel aw blow me kenny burne shouted a halfdozen engineers were crowded around the tv set blocking caseys view as she came into the room miraculously none of the two hundred and seventy passengers on board were injured the n norton widebody was revving for takeoff when passengers noticed clouds of black smoke coming from the engine seconds later the plane was rocked by an explosion as the left starboard engine literally blew to pieces and was quickly engulfed in flames the screen didnt show that it just showed an n aircraft seen from a distance with dense black smoke gushing from beneath the wing left starboard engine burne snarled as opposed to the right starboard engine you silly twit the tv now showed closeups of passengers milling around the terminal there were quick cuts a young boy of seven or eight said all the people got excited because of the smoke then they cut to a teenage girl who shook her head tossing her hair over her shoulder and said it was rully rully scary i just saw the smoke and like i was rully scared the interviewer said what were your thoughts when you heard the explosion i was rully scared the girl said did you think it was a bomb she was asked absolutely she said a terrorist bomb kenny burne spun on his heel throwing his hands in the air do you believe this shit theyre asking kids what they thought this is the news what did you think golly i swallowed my popsicle he snorted airplanes that kill and the travelers who love them on the screen the tv program now showed an elderly woman who said yes i thought i was going to die of course you have to think that then a middleaged man my wife and i prayed our whole family knelt down on the runway and thanked the lord were you frightened the interviewer asked we thought we were going to die the man said the cabin was filled with smokeits a miracle we escaped with our lives bume was yelling again you asshole in a car you would have died in a nightclub you would have died but not in a norton widebody we designed it so youd escape with your miserable fucking life calm down casey said i want to hear this she was listening intently waiting to see how far theyd take the story a strikingly beautiful hispanic woman in a beige armani suit stood facing the camera holding up a microphone while passengers now appear to be recovering from their ordeal their fate was far from certain earlier this afternoon when a norton widebody blew up on the runway orange flames shooting high into the sky the tv again showed the earlier telephoto shot of the plane on the runway with smoke billowing from under the wing it looked about as dangerous as a doused campfire wait a minute wait a minute kenny said a norton widebody exploded a sunstar pieceofshit engine exploded he pointed to the screen image thats a goddamn rotor burst and the blade fragments broke through the cowling which is just what i told them would happenl casey said you told them hell yes kenny said i know all about this sunstar bought six engines from aerocivicas last year i was the norton consultant on the deal i borescoped the engines and found a shitload of damageblade notch breakouts and vane cracks so i told sunstar to reject them kenny was waving his hands but why pass up a bargain he said sunstar rebuilt them instead during teardown we found a lot of corrosion so the paper on the overseas overhauls was probably faked i told them again junk em but sunstar put them on the planes so now the rotor blowsbig fucking surprise and the fragments cut into the wing so that nonflammable hydraulic fluid is smoking it aint on fire because the fluid wont burn and its our fault he spun pointing back to the screen seriously frightening all two hundred and seventy passengers on board fortunately there were no injuries thats right burne said no penetration of the fuse lady no injury to anybody the wing absorbed itour wing and we are waiting to speak to officials from the airline about this frightening tragedy more later back to you ed the camera cut back to the newsroom where a sleek anchorman said thank you alicia for that uptotheminute report on the shocking explosion at miami airport well have more details as they emerge now back to our regularly scheduled program casey sighed relieved i cant believe this horseshitl kenny burne shouted he turned and stomped out of the room banging the door behind him whats his problem richman said for once id say hes justified casey said the fact is if theres an engine problem its not nortons fault what do you mean he said he was the consultant look casey said you have to understand we build airframes we dont build engines and we dont repair them we have nothing to do with engines nothing i hardly think our engines are supplied by other companiesge pratt and whitney rollsroyce but reporters never understand that distinction richman looked skeptical it seems like a fine point its nothing of the sort if your electricity goes out do you call the gas company if your tires blow do you blame the car maker of course not richman said but its still your airplaneengines and all no its not casey said we build the plane and then install the brand of engine the customer selects just the way you can put any one of several brands of tires on your car but if michelin makes a batch of bad tires and they blow out thats not fords fault if you let your tires go bald and get in an accident thats not fords fault and its exactly the same with us richman was still looking unconvinced all we can do casey said is certify that our planes fly safely with the engines we install but we cant force carriers to maintain those engines properly over the life of the aircraft thats not our joband understanding that is fundamental to knowing what actually occurred the fact is the reporter got the story backward backward why that aircraft had a rotor burst casey said fan blades broke off the rotor disk and the cowling around the engine didnt contain the fragments the engine blew because it wasnt correctly maintained it should never have happened but our wing absorbed the flying fragments protecting passengers in the cabin so the real meaning of this event is that norton aircraft are so well built that they protected two hundred and seventy passengers from a bad engine were actually heroesbut norton stock will fall tomorrow and some of the public may be afraid to fly on a norton aircraft is that an appropriate response to what actually happened no but its an appropriate response to whats being reported thats frustrating for people here well richman said at least they didnt mention transpacific casey nodded that had been her first concern the reason she had rushed across the parking lot to the tv set she wanted to know if the news reports would link the miami rotor burst to the tpa inflight incident the day before that hadnt happenedat least not yet but sooner or later it would well start getting calls now she said the cat is out of the bag hangar am there were a dozen security guards standing outside hangar where the transpacific jet was being inspected but this was standard procedure whenever a rams team from recovery and maintenance services entered the plant rams teams circled the globe troubleshooting stranded aircraft they were faalicensed to repair them in the field but since members were chosen for expertise rather than seniority they were nonunion and there was often friction when they came into the factory within the hangar the transpacific widebody stood in the glare of halogen lights nearly hidden behind a gridwork of rollup scaffolding technicians swarmed over every part of the plane casey saw kenny burne working the engines cursing his powerplant crew they had deployed the two thrust reverser sleeves that flared out from the nacelle and were doing fluorescent and conductivity tests on the curved metal cowls ron smith and the electrical team were standing on a raised platform beneath the midships belly higher up she saw van trung through the cockpit windows his crew testing the avionics and doherty was out on the wing leading the structure team his group had used a crane to remove an eightfoot aluminum section one of the inboard slats big bones casey said to richman they inspect the biggest components first it looks like theyre tearing it apart richman said a voice behind them its called destroying the evidence casey turned ted rawley one of the flight test pilots sauntered up he was wearing cowboy boots a western shirt dark sunglasses like most of the test pilots teddy cultivated an air of dangerous glamour this is our chief test pilot casey said teddy rawley they call him rack em rawley hey teddy protested i havent drilled a hole yet anyway its better than casey and the seven dwarfs is that what they call her richman said suddenly interested yeah casey and her dwarfs rawley gestured vaguely to the engineers the little fellas heighho heighho he turned away from the plane punched casey on the shoulder so how you doing kid i called you the other day i know she said ive been busy ill bet you have teddy said i bet marders got the screws on everybody so whatve the engineers found wait a minute let me guessthey found absolutely nothing right their beautiful plane is perfect so must be pilot error am i right casey said nothing richman looked uncomfortable hey teddy said dont be shy ive heard it all before lets face it the engineers are all cardcarrying members of the screw the pilots club thats why they design planes to be practically automatic they just hate the idea that somebody might actually fly them its so untidy to have a warm body in the seat makes em crazy and of course if anything bad happens it must be the pilot gotta be the pilot am i right come on teddy she said you know the statistics the overwhelming majority of accidents are caused by it was at that point that doug doherty crouched on the wing above them leaned over and said dolefully casey bad news youll want to see this what is it im pretty sure i know what went wrong on flight she climbed the scaffolding and walked out on the wing doherty was crouched over the leading edge the slats were now removed exposing the innards of the wing structure she got down on her hands and knees next to him and looked the space for the slats was marked by a series of drive trackslittle rails spaced three feet apart that the slats slid out on driven by hydraulic pistons at the forward end of the rail was a rocker pin which allowed the slats to tilt downward at the back of the compartment she saw the folding pistons which drove the slats along the tracks with the slats removed the pistons were just metal arms poking out into space as always whenever she saw the innards of an aircraft she had a sense of enormous complexity what is it she said here doug said he bent over one of the protruding arms pointing to a tiny metal flange at the back curved into a hook the part was not much larger than her thumb yes doherty reached down pushed the flange back with his hand it flicked forward again thats the locking pin for the slats he said its springloaded actuated by a solenoid back inside when the slats retract the pin snaps over holds them in place yes look at it he said shaking his head its bent she frowned if it was bent she couldnt see it it looked straight to her eye doug no look he set a metal ruler against the pin showing her that the metal was bent a few millimeters to the left and thats not all he said look at the action surface of the hinge its been worn see it he handed her a magnifying glass thirty feet above the ground she leaned over the leading edge and peered at the part there was wear all right she saw a ragged surface on the locking hook but you would expect a certain amount of wear where the metal of the latch engaged the slats doug do you really think this is significant oh yes he said in a funereal tone you got maybe two three millimeters of wear here how many pins hold the slat just one he said and if this one is bad the slats could pop loose in flight they wouldnt necessarily fully extend they wouldnt have to remember these are lowspeed control surfaces at cruise speed the effect magnifies a slight extension would change the aerodynamics casey frowned squinting at the little part through the magnifying glass but why would the lock suddenly open twothirds of the way through the flight he was shaking his head look at the other pins doherty said pointing down the wing theres no wear on the action surface maybe the others were changed out and this one wasnt no he said i think the others are original this one was changed look at the next pin down see the parts stamp at the base she saw a tiny embossed figure an h in a triangle with a sequence of numbers all parts manufacturers stamped their parts with these symbols yeah now look at this pin see the difference on this part the triangle is upside down this is a counterfeit part casey for aircraft manufacturers counterfeiting was the single biggest problem they faced as they approached the twentyfirst century media attention focused mostly on counterfeit consumer items like watches cds and computer software but there was a booming business in all sorts of manufactured items including auto parts and airplane parts here the problem of counterfeiting took a new and ominous turn unlike a phony cartier watch a phony airplane part could kill you okay she said ill check the maintenance records find out where it came from the faa required commercial carriers to keep extraordinarily detailed maintenance records every time a part was changed out it was noted in a maintenance log in addition the manufacturers though not required to maintained an exhaustive ships record of every part originally on the plane and who had manufactured it all this paperwork meant that every one of the aircrafts one million parts could be traced back to its origin if a part was swapped out from one plane to another that was known if a part was taken off and repaired that was known each part on a plane had a history of its own given enough time they could find out exactly where this part had come from who had installed it and when she pointed to the locking pin in the wing have you photographed it oh sure were fully documented then pull it she said ill take it to metals by the way could this situation give you a slats disagree warning doherty gave a rare smile yes it could and my guess is it did you got a nonstandard part casey and it failed the aircraft coming off the wing richman was chattering excitedly so is that it its a bad part is that what happened its solved he was getting on her nerves one thing at a time she said we have to check check what do we have to check check how first of all we have to find out where that part came from she said go back to the office tell norma to make sure the maintenance records are coming from lax and have her telex the fizer in hong kong to ask for the carriers records tell him the faa requested them and we want to look at them first okay richman said he headed off toward the open doors of hangar out into the sunlight he walked with a sort of swagger as if he were a person of importance in possession of valuable information but casey wasnt sure that they knew anything at all at least not yet outside hangar am she came out of the hangar blinking in the morning sun she saw don brull getting out of his car over by building she headed toward him hello casey he said as he slammed the door i was wondering when youd get back to me i talked to marder she said he swears the wing isnt being offset to china brull nodded he called me last night said the same thing he didnt sound happy marder insists its just a rumor hes lying brull said hes doing it no way casey said it doesnt make sense look brull said it doesnt matter to me personally they close this plant in ten years ill be retired but thatll be about the time your kid starts college youll be looking at those big tuition payments and you wont have a job you thought about that don she said you said it yourself it doesnt make sense to offset the wing itd be pretty reckless to marders reckless he squinted at her in the sunlight you know that you know what hes capable of don look brull said i know what im talking about those tools arent being shipped to atlanta casey theyre going to san pedroto the port and down in san pedro theyre building special marine containers for shipment so that was how the union was putting it together she thought those are oversize tools don she said we cant ship them by road or rail big tools always go by boat theyre building containers so they can send them through the panama canal thats the only way to get them to atlanta brull was shaking his head ive seen the bills of lading they dont say atlanta they say seoul korea korea she said frowning thats right don that really doesnt make sense yes it does because its a cover brull said theyll send them to korea then transship from korea to shanghai you have copies of the bills she said not with me id like to see them she said brull sighed i can do that casey i can get them for you but youre putting me in a very difficult situation here the guys arent going to let this sale happen marder tells me to calm em downbut what can i do i run the local not the plant what do you mean its out of my hands he said don i always liked you casey he said but you hang around here i cant help you and he walked away outside hangar am the morning sun was shining the plant around her was cheerfully busy mechanics riding their bicycles from one building to another there was no sense of threat or danger but casey knew what brull had meant she was now in nomans land anxious she pulled out her cell phone to call marder when she saw the heavyset figure of jack rogers coming toward her jack covered aerospace for the telegraphstar an orange county paper in his late fifties he was a good solid reporter a reminder of an earlier generation of print journalists who knew as much about their beat as the people they interviewed he gave her a casual wave hi jack she said whats up i came over he said about that wing tool accident this morning in the one the crane dropped tough break she said they had another accident with the ajs this morning tool was loaded onto the flatbed truck but the driver took a turn too fast over by building tool slid off onto the ground big mess uhhuh casey said this is obviously a job action rogers said my sources tell me the unions opposed to the china sale ive heard that she said nodding because the wings going to be offset to shanghai as part of the sales agreement come on jack she said thats ridiculous you know that for a fact she took a step back from him jack she said you know i cant discuss the sale no one can until the inks dry okay rogers said he took out his notepad it does seem like a pretty crazy rumor no companys ever offset the wing itd be suicide exactly she said in the end she kept coming back to that same question why would edgarton offset the wing why would any company offset the wing it just made no sense rogers glanced up from his pad i wonder why the union thinks the wings being sent offshore she shrugged youll have to ask them he had sources in the union certainly brail probably others as well i hear theyve got documents that prove it casey said they show them to you rogers shook his head no i cant imagine why not if they have them rogers smiled he made another note shame about the rotor burst in miami all i know is what i saw on television you think it will affect the public perception of the n he had his pen out ready to take down what she said i dont see why the problem was powerplant not airframe my guess is theyre going to find it was a bad compressor disk that burst i wouldnt doubt it he said i was talking to don peterson over at the faa he told me that incident at sfo was a sixthstage compressor disk that blew the disk had brittle nitrogen pockets alpha inclusions she said thats right jack said and there was also dwelltime fatigue casey nodded engine parts operated at a temperature of degrees fahrenheit well above the melt temperature of most alloys which turned to soup at degrees so they were manufactured of titanium alloys using the most advanced procedures fabricating some of the parts was an artthe fan blades were essentially grown as a single crystal of metal making them phenomenally strong but even in skilled hands the manufacturing process was inherently delicate dwelltime fatigue was a condition in which the titanium used to make rotor disks clumped into microstructure colonies rendering them vulnerable to fatigue cracks and how about the transpacific flight rogers said was that an engine problem too transpacific happened yesterday jack we just started our investigation youre qa on the irt right right yes are you pleased with how the investigation is going jack i cant comment on the transpacific investigation its much too early not too early for speculation to start rogers said you know how these things go casey lot of idle talk misinformation that can be difficult to clear up later id just like to set the record straight have you ruled out engines jack she said i cant comment then you havent ruled out engines no comment jack he made a note on his pad without looking up he said and i suppose youre looking at slats too were looking at everything jack she said given the has a history of slats problems ancient history she said we fixed the problem years ago you wrote a story about it if i recall but now youve had two incidents in two days are you worried that the flying public will start to think the n is a troubled aircraft she could see the direction his story was going to take she didnt want to comment but he was telling her what he would write if she didnt it was a standard if minor form of press blackmail jack she said weve got three hundred ns in service around the world the model has an outstanding safety record in fact in five years of service there had been no fatalities involving the aircraft until yesterday that was a reason for pride but she decided not to mention it because she could see his lead the first fatalities to occur on a norton n aircraft happened yesterday instead she said the public is best served by getting accurate information and at the moment we have no information to offer to speculate would be irresponsible that did it he took his pen away okay you want to go off sure she knew she could trust him off the record underwent very severe pitch oscillations we think the plane porpoised we dont know why the fdrs anomalous itll take days to reconstruct the data were working as fast as we can will it affect the china sale i hope not pilot was chinese wasnt he chang he was from hong kong i dont know his nationality does that make it awkward if its pilot error you know how these investigations are jack whatever the cause turns out to be its going to be awkward for somebody we cant worry about that we just have to let the chips fall where they fall of course he said by the way is that china sale firm i keep hearing its not she shrugged i honestly dont know has marder talked to you about it not to me personally she said her reply was carefully worded she hoped he wouldnt follow up on it he didnt okay casey he said ill leave this alone but whatve you got i need to file today how come youre not doing cheapskate airlines she said using the derogatory inhouse term for one of the lowcost carriers nobodys done that story yet are you kidding rogers said everybody and his brothers covering mat one yeah but nobodys doing the real story she said supercheap carriers are a stock scam a stock scam sure casey said you buy some aircraft so old and poorly maintained no reputable carrier will use them for spares then you subcontract maintenance to limit your liability then you offer cheap fares and use the cash to buy new routes its a pyramid scheme but on paper it looks great volumes up revenues up and wall street loves you youre saving so much on maintenance that your earnings skyrocket your stock price doubles and doubles again by the time the bodies start piling up as you know they will youve made your fortune off the stock and can afford the best counsel thats the genius of deregulation jack when the bill comes nobody pays except the passengers exactly casey said flight safetys always been an honor system the faas set up to monitor the carriers not to police them so if deregulations going to change the rules we ought to warn the public or triple faa funding one or the other rogers nodded barry jordan over at the la times told me hes doing the safety angle but that takes a lot of resourceslead time lawyers going over your copy my paper cant afford it i need something i can use tonight off the record casey said ive got a good lead but you cant source it sure rogers said the engine that blew was one of six that sunstar bought from aerocivicas casey said kenny burne was our consultant he borescoped the engines and found a lot of damage what kind of damage blade notch breakouts and vane cracks rogers said they had fatigue cracks in the fan blades thats right casey said kenny told them to reject the engines but sunstar rebuilt them and put them on the planes when that engine blew kenny was furious so you might get a name at sunstar from kenny but we cant be the source jack we have to do business with these people i understand rogers said thanks but my editors going to want to know about the accidents on the floor today so tell me are you convinced the china offset stories are groundless are we back on she said yes im not the person to ask she said youll have to talk to edgarton i called but his office says hes out of town where is he beijing i cant comment and what about marder rogers said what about him rogers shrugged everybody knows marder and edgarton are at each others throats marder expected to be named president but the board passed him over but they gave edgarton a oneyear contractso hes got only twelve months to produce and i hear marders undercutting edgarton every way he can i wouldnt know about that she said casey had of course heard such rumors it was no secret that marder was bitterly disappointed about edgartons appointment what marder could do about it was another story marders wife controlled eleven percent of company stock with marders connections he could probably pull together five percent more but sixteen percent wasnt enough to call the shots particularly since edgarton had the strong support of the board so most people in the plant thought that marder had no choice except to go along with edgartons agendaat least for the moment marder might be unhappy but he had no option the company had a cashflow problem they were already building planes without buyers yet they needed billions of dollars if they hoped to develop the next generation of planes and stay in business in the future so the situation was clear the company needed the sale and everybody knew it including marder rogers said you havent heard marders undercutting edgarton no comment casey said but off the record it makes no sense everybody in the company wants this sale jack including marder right now marders pushing us hard to solve so the sale goes through do you think the image of the company will be hurt by the rivalry between its two top officers i couldnt say okay he said finally closing his notepad call me if you get a break on okay sure jack thanks casey walking away from nun she realized she was exhausted by the effort of the interview talking to a reporter these days was like a deadly chess match you had to think several steps ahead you had to imagine all the possible ways a reporter might distort your statement the atmosphere was relentlessly adversarial it hadnt always been that way there was a time when reporters wanted information their questions directed to an underlying event they wanted an accurate picture of a situation and to do that they had to make the effort to see things your way to understand how you were thinking about it they might not agree with you in the end but it was a matter of pride that they could accurately state your view before rejecting it the interviewing process was not very personal because the focus was on the event they were trying to understand but now reporters came to the story with the lead fixed in their minds they saw their job as proving what they already knew they didnt want information so much as evidence of villainy in this mode they were openly skeptical of your point of view since they assumed you were just being evasive they proceeded from a presumption of universal guilt in an atmosphere of muted hostility and suspicion this new mode was intensely personal they wanted to trip you up to catch you in a small error or in a foolish statementor just a phrase that could be taken out of context and made to look silly or insensitive because the focus was so personal the reporters asked continuously for personal speculations do you think an event will be damaging do you think the company will suffer such speculation had been irrelevant to the earlier generation of reporters who focused on the underlying events modem journalism was intensely subjectiveinterpretive and speculation was its lifeblood but she found it exhausting and jack rogers she thought was one of the better ones the print reporters were all better it was the television reporters you really had to watch out for they were the really dangerous ones outside hangar am crossing the plant she fished her cell phone out of her purse and called marder his assistant eileen said he was in a meeting i just left jack rogers casey said i think hes planning a story that says were shipping the wing to china and theres trouble in the executive suite uhoh eileen said thats not good edgarton better talk to him and put it to rest edgarton isnt doing any press eileen said john will be back at six oclock you want to talk to him then i better yes ill put you down eileen said proof test am it looked like an aviation junkyard old fuselages tails and wing sections littered the landscape raised up on rusty scaffolding but the air was filled with the steady hum of compressors and heavy tubing ran to the airplane parts like intravenous lines to a patient this was proof test also known as twistandshout the domain of the infamous amos peters casey saw him off to the right a hunched figure in shirtsleeves and baggy pants bent over a readout stand beneath an aft fuselage section of the norton widebody amos she called waving as she walked over to him he turned glanced at her go away amos was a legend at norton reclusive and obstinate he was nearly seventy long past mandatory retirement age yet he continued to work because he was vital to the company his specialty was the arcane field of damage tolerance or fatigue testing and fatigue testing was of vastly greater importance than it had been ten years before since deregulation the carriers were flying aircraft longer than anybody ever expected three thousand aircraft in the domestic fleet were now more than twenty years old that number would double in five years nobody really knew what would happen to all those aircraft as they continued to age except amos it was amos who had been brought in by the ntsb as a consultant on the famous aloha accident back in aloha was an interisland carrier in hawaii one of their airplanes was cruising at feet when suddenly eighteen feet of the airplanes outer skin peeled off the fuselage from the cabin door to the wing the cabin decompressed and a stewardess was sucked out and killed despite the explosive pressure loss the plane managed to land safely at maui where it was scrapped on the spot the rest of alohas fleet was examined for corrosion and fatigue damage two more hightime s were scrapped and a third underwent months of repairs all three had extensive skin cracks and other corrosion damage when the faa issued an airworthiness directive mandating inspections of the rest of the fleet fortynine more planes operated by eighteen different carriers were found to have extensive cracking industry observers were perplexed by the accident because boeing aloha and the faa were supposedly all watching the carriers fleet corrosion cracking was a known problem on some earlyproduction s boeing had already warned aloha that the salty humid hawaiian climate was a severe corrosion environment afterward the investigation found multiple causes for the accident it turned out that aloha making short hops between islands was accumulating flight cycles of takeoff and landing at a faster rate than maintenance was scheduled to handle this stress combined with corrosion from ocean air produced a series of small cracks in the aircraft skin these were unnoticed by aloha because they were short of trained personnel the faa didnt catch them because they were overworked and understaffed the faas principal maintenance inspector in honolulu supervised nine carriers and seven repair stations around the pacific from china to singapore to the philippines eventually a flight occurred in which the cracks extended and the structure failed following the incident aloha boeing and the faa formed a circular firing squad the undetected structural damage in alohas fleet was variously attributed to poor management poor maintenance poor faa inspection poor engineering accusations ricocheted back and forth for years afterward but the aloha flight had also focused industry attention on the problem of aging aircraft and it had made amos famous within norton hed convinced management to begin buying more old aircraft turning wings and fuselages into proof test articles day after day his test fixtures applied repetitive pressures to aging aircraft stressing them to simulate takeoffs and landings wind shear and turbulence so amos could study how and where they cracked amos she said coming up to him its me casey singleton he blinked myopically oh casey didnt recognize you he squinted at her doctor gave me a new prescription oh huh how are you he gestured for her to walk with him and he headed toward a small building a few yards away no one at norton could understand how casey was able to get along with amos but they were neighbors he lived alone with his pug dog and she had taken to cooking him a meal every month or so in return amos regaled her with stories of aircraft accidents hed worked on going back to the first bo ac comet crashes in the s amos had an encyclopedic knowledge of airplanes she had learned a tremendous amount from him and he had become a sort of adviser to her didnt i see you the other morning he said yes with my daughter thought so want coffee he opened the door to a shed and she smelted the sharp odor of burned grounds his coffee was always terrible sounds great amos she said he poured her a cup hope black is okay ran out of that creamer stuff black is fine amos he hadnt had creamer for a year amos poured a cup for himself in a stained mug and waved her to a battered chair facing his desk the desk was piled high with thick reports faanasa international symposium on advanced structural integrity airframe durability and damage tolerance thermographic inspection techniques corrosion control and structures technology he put his feet up on the desk cleared a path through the journals so he could see her i tell you casey its tedious working with these old hulks i long for the day when we have another t article in here t she said of course you wouldnt know amos said youve been here five years and we havent made a new model aircraft in all that time but when theres a new aircraft the first one off the line is called tl test article it goes to static testwe put it on the test bed and shake it to pieces find out where the weaknesses are the second plane off the line is t its used for fatigue testinga more difficult problem over time metal loses tensile strength gets brittle so we take t put it in a jig and accelerate fatigue testing day after day year after year we simulate takeoffs and landings nortons policy is we fatigue test to more than twice the design life of the aircraft if the engineers design an aircraft for a twentyyear life span say fifty thousand hours and twenty thousand cycleswell do more than twice that in the pit before we ever deliver to a customer we know the planes will stand up hows your coffee she took a small sip managed not to wince amos ran water through the same old grinds all day long that was how it got this distinctive flavor good amos just ask theres more where that came from anyway most manufacturers test to twice the design life we test up to four times the spec thats why we always say the other companies make doughnuts norton makes croissants casey said and john marder always says thats why the others make money and we dont marder amos snorted its all money with him all bottom line in the old days the front office told us make the best damn airplane you can now they say make the best airplane you can for a price different instruction you know what i mean he slurped his coffee so what is it casey she nodded cant help you there he said why do you say that the planes new fatigues not a factor theres a question about a part amos she said she showed him the pin in a plastic bag hmm he turned it over in his hands held it up to the light this would bedont tell methis would be an anterior locking pin for the second inboard slat thats right of course its right he frowned but this parts bad yes i know so whats your question doherty thinks it failed the aircraft could it well amos stared at the ceiling thinking no i got a hundred bucks says it didn t fail the aircraft casey sighed she was back to square one they had no leads discouraged amos said yes frankly then youre not paying attention he said this is a very valuable lead but why you just said yourselfit didnt fail the aircraft casey casey amos shook his head think she tried to think sitting there smelling his bad coffee she tried to see what he was driving at but her mind was blank she looked at him across the desk just tell me what am i missing were the other locking pins replaced no just this one yes why just this one casey he said i dont know find out he said why what good will that do amos threw up his hands casey come on now think it through you have a problem with slats on thats a wing problem correct now youve found a part thats been replaced on the wing correct why was it replaced i dont know was that wing damaged in the past did something happen to it so that this part had to be replaced were other parts replaced as well are there other bad parts on the wing is there residual damage to the wing not that you can see amos shook his head impatiently forget what you can see casey look at the ships record and the maintenance records trace this part and get a history of the wing because something else is wrong my guess is youll find more fake parts amos stood sighing more and more planes have fake parts these days i suppose its to be expected these days everybody seems to believe in santa claus hows that because they believe in something for nothing amos said you know government deregulates the airlines and everybody cheers we got cheaper fares everybody cheers but the carriers have to cut costs so the food is awful thats okay there are fewer direct flights more hubs thats okay the planes look grubby because they redo the interiors less often thats okay but still the carriers have to cut more costs so they run the planes longer buy fewer new ones the fleet ages thatll be okayfor a while eventually it wont be and meanwhile cost pressures continue so where else do they cut maintenance parts what it cant go on indefinitely just cant of course now congress is helping them out by cutting appropriations for the faa so therell be less oversight carriers can ease up on maintenance because nobodys watching and the public doesnt care because for thirty years this countrys had the best aviation safety record in the world but the thing is we paid for it we paid to have new safe planes and we paid for the oversight to make sure they were well maintained but those days are over now everybody believes in something for nothing so wheres it going to end she said i got a hundred bucks he said theyll reregulate within ten years therell be a string of crashes and theyll do it the free marketeers will scream but the fact is free markets dont provide safety only regulation does that you want safe food you better have inspectors you want safe water you better have an epa you want a safe stock market you better have the sec and you want safe airlines you better regulate them too believe me they will and on amos shrugged foreign carriers operate with much less stringent regulation its pretty looseygoosey out there look at the maintenance recordsand look hard at the paper for any part youre suspicious of she started to leave but casey she turned back yes you understand the situation dont you to check that part youll have to start with the ships record i know thats in building i wouldnt go there right now at least not alone come on amos she said i used to work on the floor ill be okay amos was shaking his head flight s a hot potato you know how the guys think if they can mess up the investigation they willany way they can be careful i will be very very careful bld am running down the center of building was a series of onestory chainlink cages that housed parts for the line and terminal workstations the workstations were placed inside small partitions each containing a microfiche reader a parts terminal and a main system terminal in the parts cage casey bent over a microfiche reader scrolling through photocopies of the ships record for fuse which was the original factory designation for the aircraft involved in the tpa accident jerry jenkins the parts flow control manager on the floor stood beside her nervously tapping his pen on the table and saying find it yet find it yet jerry she said take it easy im easy he said glancing around the floor im just thinking you know you could have done this between shifts between shifts would have drawn less attention jerry she said were in kind of a rush here he tapped his pen everybodys pretty hot about the china sale what do i tell the guys you tell the guys she said that if we lose that china sale then this line will shut down and everybody will be out of a job jerry swallowed that true because i hear jerry let me look at the record will you the ships record consisted of the mass of documentationa million pieces of paper one for every part on the aircraftused to assemble the aircraft this paper and the even more extensive documentation required for faa type certification contained norton proprietary information so the faa didnt store these records because if they did competitors could obtain it under the freedom of information act so norton warehoused five thousand pounds of paper running eighty feet of shelf space for each aircraft in a vast building in compton all this was copied onto microfiche for access at these readers on the floor but finding the paper for a single part was timeconsuming she thought and find it yet find it yeah she said at last i got it she was staring at a photocopy of a sheet of paper from hoffman metal works in montclair california the slats locking pin was described in a code that matched the engineering drawings abl ant si lteh ssht a typed date of manufacture a stamped date of delivery to the factory and a date of installation followed by two stamps one signed by the mechanic who installed the part on the aircraft and a second by the qa inspector who approved the work so he said that the oem or what yeah its the oem hoffman was the original equipment manufacturer the part had come direct from them no distributor was involved jerry was looking out through the chain link at the factory floor beyond nobody seemed to be paying any attention but casey knew that they were being watched jerry said you leaving now yes jerry im leaving now she headed across the floor staying on the aisle that ran by the parts cages away from the overhead cranes glancing up at the overhead walkways to be sure nobody was up there nobody was so far they were leaving her alone what she had learned so far was clear the original installed part on tpa had come direct from a reputable supplier the original part was good the part doherty found on the wing was bad so amos was right something had happened to that wing causing it to be repaired sometime in the past but what she still had more work to do and very little time to do it norton qa pm if the part was bad where had it come from she needed maintenance records and they hadnt arrived yet where was richman back in her office she flipped through a stack of telexes all the fsrs around the world were asking for information about the n one from the right service rep in madrid was typical from s ramones fsr madrid to c singleton qairt persistent reports via my iberia contact b alonso that due to miami incident jaa will announce continued delay of certification of n aircraft citing airworthiness concerns pls advise she sighed what the fsr was reporting was entirely predictable the jaa was the joint aviation authorities the european equivalent of the faa recently american manufacturers had had a good deal of difficulty with it the jaa was flexing new regulatory muscles and the agency had many bureaucrats who didnt clearly distinguish between negotiated trade advantage and airworthiness issues for some time now the jaa had been making special efforts to force the american manufacturers to use european jet engines the americans had resisted so it was logical that the jaa would take advantage of the rotor burst in miami to put greater pressure on norton by withholding certification but in the end it was a political problem not her area she went to the next telex from s nieto fsr vanc to c singleton qairt first officer lu zan ping underwent emergency surgery for subdural hematoma at vanc gen hospital hrs today fo not available for questions at least hrs further details tf casey had been hoping for an interview with the injured first officer sooner than that she wanted to know why he was in the back of the plane and not in the cockpit but it seemed an answer to that question would have to wait until the end of the week she came to the next telex and stared in astonishment from rick rakoski fsr hk to casey singleton qairt received your request maintenance records for tpa flight fuse foreign registry hb and passed it on to the carrier in response to faa request transpacific released all records from repair station kaitak hk repair station singapore repair station melbourne these uploaded to norton online systems as of local time still working on crew interviews much more difficult details tf a smart move by the carrier she thought since they didnt want to grant crew interviews they had decided to provide everything else in an apparent display of cooperation norma came into her office records from lax are corning in now she said and hong kong already delivered i see that have you got the storage address right here she handed her a slip of paper and casey typed it into the terminal behind her desk there was a delay for the call to the mainframe and then a screen flashed up dd as mod rs kaitak maint rec ac rs sngpor maint rec b only rs melb maint rec a b only all right she said she went to work it was the better part of an hour before casey had her answers but at the end of mat time she had a good picture of what had happened to the slats locking pin on the transpacific aircraft on november of the previous year on a flight from bombay to melbourne the transpacific aircraft had experienced a problem with radio communications the pilot made an unscheduled stop on the island of java in indonesia there the radio was repaired without difficulty a blown circuit panel was changed out and javanese ground crews refueled the plane for the continuing flight to melbourne after the aircraft landed in melbourne australian ground crews noted that the right wing was damaged thank you amos the wing was damaged mechanics in melbourne noted that the fuel coupling was bent on the right wing and the adjacent slats locking pin was slightly damaged this was thought to have been caused by ground personnel in java during the previous fueling stop the fuel line couplings on the n were located on the underside of the wing just behind the leading edge an inexperienced ground person had used the wrong power lift truck for the n and had jammed the platform railing into the fuel hose while the hose was hooked into the wing this bent the hose bracket into the wing coupler bent the coupler plate and damaged the nearby slats pin slats locking pins were an infrequent change item and melbourne repair station did not have one in stock rather than delay the aircraft in australia it was decided to allow the plane to continue to singapore and change the part there however a sharpeyed maintenance person in singapore noticed that the paper on their replacement locking pin appeared suspect maintenance crews were uncertain whether the replacement pin was genuine or not since the part already in place functioned normally singapore elected not to replace it and the aircraft was sent on to hong kong the home terminal for transpacific where a genuine replacement part was assured hong kong repair stationfully aware they were located in a world center for counterfeitingtook special precautions to insure their spare aviation parts were genuine they ordered parts directly from the original equipment manufacturers in the united states on november of the previous year a brandnew slats locking pin was installed on the aircraft paper for the part appeared to be proper a photocopy came up on caseys screen the part had come from hoffman metal works in montclair californianortons original supplier but casey knew the paper was fake because the part itself was fake she would run it down later and find out where the part had actually come from but right now the only question was the one amos had posed were other parts replaced as well sitting at her terminal casey scrolled through the maintenance summary records for hong kong repair station for november to find what else had been done to the aircraft mat day it was slow going she had to look at photocopies of maintenance cards with scrawled handwritten notations after each checkbox but eventually she found a list of work that had been done on the wing there were three notations chg rt ldlt fz change the right landing light fuse chg rt slts lk pin change the right slats locking pin ck ass eq pkg check the associated equipment package this was followed by a mechanics notation nrml meaning it was checked and normal the associated equipment package was a maintenance subgrouping of related parts that had to be checked whenever a faulty part was detected for example if seals on the right fuel lines were found to be worn it was standard practice to check seals on the left side as well since they were part of the associated equipment package changing the slats locking pin had triggered a maintenance check of associated equipment but which equipment she knew the associated equipment packages were specified by norton but she couldnt pull up the list on her office computer to do that she would have to go back to the terminal on the floor she pushed away from her desk bld pm building was nearly deserted the widebody line seemingly abandoned between shifts there was a onehour delay between first and second shifts because it took that long for the parking lots to clear first shift ended at pm second shift started at this was the time that jerry jenkins had said she should examine the records because there wouldnt be an audience she had to admit he was right there was nobody around now casey went directly to the parts cage looking for jenkins but he wasnt there she saw the qa section manager and asked where jerry jenkins was jerry he went home the manager said why said he wasnt feeling good casey frowned jenkins shouldnt have left until after five she went to the terminal to bring up the information herself typing at the keyboard she soon had called up the database of associated maintenance packages she keyed in rt slats lk pin and got the answer she was looking for rt slats erv trk rw sls rt slats lvr rw sls rt slats hvd act rw sls rt slats pstn rw sls rt slats fd cplng rw slc rt prx snsr rw prc rt prx snsr cplng rw prc rt prx snsr plt rw prc rt prx snsr wc rw prw it made sense the associated parts package consisted of the other five elements of the slats drive track the track the lever the hydraulic actuator the piston the forward coupling in addition the list instructed mechanics to check the nearby proximity sensor its coupling cover plate and wiring she knew doherty had already inspected the drive track if amos was right they ought to look very carefully at that proximity sensor she didnt think anybody had done that yet the proximity sensor it was located deep in the wing difficult to get to difficult to inspect could that have caused a problem yes she thought it was possible she shut down the terminal and crossed the plant floor heading back to her office she needed to call ron smith to tell him to check the sensor she walked beneath deserted aircraft toward the open doors at the north end of the building as she neared the doors she saw two men enter the hangar they were silhouetted against the midday sunlight but she could see that one wore a red checked shirt and the other had on a baseball cap casey turned to ask the qa floor manager to call security but he was gone the wire cage stood empty casey looked around and suddenly realized the floor was deserted she saw no one except an elderly black woman at the far end of the building pushing a broom the woman was half a mile away casey looked at her watch it would be another fifteen minutes before people started showing up the two men were walking toward her casey turned and started to walk away from them heading back the way she had come she could handle this she thought calmly she opened her purse pulled out her cell phone to call security but the phone didnt work she didnt get a signal she realized she was in the center of the building which was hung with copper mesh along the ceiling to block extraneous radio transmissions while the aircraft systems were being tested she wouldnt be able to use her cell phone until she reached the other side of the building half a mile away she walked faster her shoes clicked on the concrete the sound seemed to echo through the building could she really be alone here of course not there were several hundred people in the building with her right now it was just that she couldnt see them they were inside the airplanes or standing behind the big tools around the planes hundreds of people all around her any minute shed see some of them she glanced over her shoulder the men were gaining on her she picked up her pace almost starting to jog unsteady in her low heels and she suddenly thought this is ridiculous im an executive of norton aircraft and i am running through this plant in the middle of the day she slowed to a normal walk she took a deep breath she glanced back the men were closer now should she confront them no she thought not unless other people were around she walked faster to her left was a parts staging area ordinarily there would be dozens of men inside there fetching parts kits working the bins but now the cage was empty deserted she looked over her shoulder the men were fifty yards behind and closing she knew that if she started to scream a dozen mechanics would suddenly appear the goons would slip away vanishing behind tools and scaffolding and shed look like a fool shed never live it down the girl who lost it that day on the floor she wouldnt scream no where the hell were the fire alarms the medic alert alarms the hazardous materials alarms she knew they were scattered all over the building shed spent years working in this building she ought to be able to remember where they were located she could hit one and say it was an accident but she saw no alarms the men were now thirty yards behind if they broke into a run theyd reach her in a few seconds but they were being cautiousapparently they too expected to see people at any moment but she saw nobody on her right she saw a forest of blue beamsthe big industrial jigs that held the fuselage barrels in place while they were riveted together the last place she might hide im an executive of norton aircraft and its the hell with it she turned right ducking among the beams scrambling through them she passed staircases and hanging lamps she heard the men behind her shout in surprise and start to follow but by then she was moving in near darkness through the girders moving fast casey knew her way around here she moved quickly with assurance always glancing up hoping to see someone above usually there were twenty or thirty men at each position on the scaffolding overhead joining the barrels in a glare of fluorescent light now she saw nobody behind her she heard the men grunt heard them bang into the crossbeams swearing she started to run dodging lowhanging beams jumping over cables and boxes and then suddenly she came out into a clearing station fourteen a plane stood on its landing gear high above the floor and higher still all around the tail she saw the hanging gardens rising sixty feet into the air she looked up at the widebody and she saw the silhouette of someone inside someone in the window someone inside the plane finally casey climbed the stairs to the plane her feet clanging on the steel steps she went two stones up then paused to look high above her in the hanging gardens she saw three burly mechanics in hard hats they were only ten feet below the ceiling working on the topmost hinge of the rudder she heard the quick sputtering buzz of power tools she looked down and saw the two men following her on the floor below they broke clear of the forest of blue jigs looked up saw her and started after her she continued up she reached the aft door of the plane and ran inside the unfinished widebody was huge and empty a succession of dully gleaming curved arcs like the belly of a metal whale halfway down she saw a solitary asian woman attaching silver insulation blankets to the walls the woman looked at casey timidly is anybody else working here she said the woman shook her head no she looked frightened as if shed been caught doing something wrong casey turned ran back out the door down below she saw the men just one level beneath her she turned and ran up the stairs into the hanging gardens the metal staircase had been ten feet wide when she started now it narrowed to two feet in width and it was steeper more like a ladder climbing into the air surrounded by a dizzying crosswork of scaffolding power lines hung down like jungle vines on all sides her shoulders banged into metal junction boxes as she scrambled higher the staircase swayed beneath her feet it turned abruptly at right angles every ten steps or so casey was now forty feet above the ground looking down on the broad crown of the fuselage and up at the tail rising above her she was high up and suddenly flooded with panic looking up at the men working on the rudder above she shouted hey hey they ignored her below she saw the other two men pursuing her their bodies intermittently visible through the scaffolding as they climbed hey hey but the men still ignored her continuing upward she saw why they had not responded they were wearing audiopads black plastic cups like earmuffs over their ears they couldnt hear anything through them she climbed fifty feet above the floor the stairs abruptly angled right around the black horizontal surface of the elevators protruding from the vertical tail the elevators obscured her viewof the men above casey worked her way around the elevators the surfaces were black because they were made of composite resin and she remembered she must not touch them with her bare hands she wanted to grab on to them the stairs up here were not constructed for running they swayed wildly and her feet slipped off the steps she clutched at the railing with sweaty hands as she slid five feet down before coming to a stop she continued upward she could no longer see the floor below it was obscured by the layers of scaffolding beneath her she couldnt see if the second shift had arrived or not she continued up as she went higher she began to feel the thick hot air trapped beneath the roof of building she remembered what they called this high perch the sweatbox working her way upward she finally reached the elevators as she continued above them the stairs angled back now close to the broad flat vertical surface of the tail blocking her view of the men working on the other side she no longer wanted to look down she saw the wooden beams of the ceiling above her only five more feet one more turn of the stairs coming around the rudder and then she would be she stopped stared the men were gone she looked down and saw the three yellow hard hats beneath her they were on a motorized lift descending to the factory floor hey hey the hard hats did not look up casey looked back hearing the clang of the two men still racing up the stairs toward her she could feel the vibration of their footsteps she knew they were close and she had nowhere to go directly ahead of her the stairs ended in a metal platform four feet square set alongside the rudder there was a railing around the platform and nothing beyond she was sixty feet up in the air on a tiny platform astride the huge expanse of the widebody tail the men were coming and she had nowhere to go she should never have started to climb she thought she should have stayed on the ground now she had no choice casey swung her foot over the platform railing she reached for the scaffolding gripped it the metal was warm in the high air she swung her other leg over and then she began to climb down the outside of the scaffolding reaching for handholds working her way down almost immediately casey realized her mistake the scaffolding was constructed of xangled girders wherever she grabbed her hands slid down jamming her fingers into the crossjoint with searing pain her feet slipped along the angled surfaces the scaffolding bars were sharp edged difficult to hold after only a few moments of climbing she was gasping for air she hooked her arms through the bars bending her elbows and caught her breath she did not look down looking to her left she saw the two men on the small high platform the man in the red shirt and the man in the baseball cap they were standing there staring at her trying to decide what to do she was about five feet below them on the outside of the girders hanging on she saw one of the men pull on a pair of heavy work gloves she realized she had to get moving again carefully she unhooked her arms and started down five feet another five feet now she was level with the horizontal elevators which she could see through the crisscrossed girders but the girders were shaking looking up she saw the man in the red shirt climbing down after her he was strong and moved quickly she knew he would reach her in just a few moments the second man was climbing back down the stairs pausing now and again to peer at her through the girders the man in the red shirt was only about ten feet above her casey went down her arms burned her breath came in ragged gasps the scaffolding was greasy in unexpected places her hands kept slipping she felt the man above her descending toward her looking up she saw his big orange work boots heavy crepe soles in a few moments he would be stomping on her fingers as casey continued to scramble down something banged against her left shoulder she looked back and saw a power cable dangling from the ceiling it was about two inches thick covered in gray plastic insulation how much weight would it support above her the man was descending the hell with it she reached out tugged at the cable it held firm she looked up saw no junction boxes above her she pulled the cable close wrapping her arm around it then her legs just as the mans boots came down she released the scaffolding and swung out on the cable and began to slide she tried to go hand over hand but her arms were too weak she slid hands burning she was going down fast she couldnt control it the pain from the friction was intense she went ten feet another ten feet she lost track her feet slammed into a junction box and she stopped swinging in the air she lowered her legs around the junction box gripped the cable between her feet let her body weight go down she felt the cable pull away a shower of sparks flared from the box and emergency alarms began to sound loudly throughout the building the cable was swinging back and forth she heard shouts from below looking down she realized with a shock that she was only about seven or eight feet above the floor hands were reaching up to her people shouting she let go and fell she was surprised how quickly she recovered getting right to her feet embarrassed brushing herself off im fine she kept saying to the people around her im fine really the paramedics ran over she waved them away im fine by now the workers on the floor had seen her badge seen the blue stripe and were confusedwhy was an executive hanging from the gardens they were hesitant stepping away a little unsure what to do im fine everything is fine really just go on with what youre doing the paramedics protested but she pushed through the crowd moving away until suddenly kenny burne was at her side his arm around her shoulder what the hell is going on nothing she said this is no time to be on the floor casey remember yeah i remember she said she let kenny walk her out of the building into the afternoon sun she squinted in the glare the huge parking lot was now filled with cars for the second shift sunlight glinting off row after row of windshields kenny turned to her you want to be more careful casey you know what i mean yeah she said i do she looked down at her clothes there was a big streak of grease running across her blouse and skirt bume said you got a change of clothes here no i have to go home i better drive you burne said she was about to protest but didnt thanks kenny she said administration pm john marder looked up from behind his desk i heard there was a little upset in what was that about nothing i was checking something he nodded i dont want you on the floor alone casey not after that nonsense with the crane today if you need to go down there have richman or one of the engineers go with you okay this is no time to take chances i understand now he shifted in his chair whats this about a reporter jack rogers is working on a story that might turn ugly casey said union allegations were sending the wing offshore leaked documents that allegedly say were offsetting the wing and hes relating the leaks to ah friction in the executive suite friction marder said what friction hes been told that you and edgarton are at loggerheads he asked if i thought management conflicts would affect the sale oh christ marder said he sounded annoyed thats ridiculous im behind hal one hundred percent on this its essential for the company and nobodys leaked anything what did you tell him i stalled him casey said but if we want to kill the story we have to give him something better an interview with edgarton or an exclusive on the china sale its the only way to do it thats fine marder said but hal wont do any press i can ask him but i know he wont do it well somebody needs to casey said maybe you should that could be difficult marder said hal has instructed me to avoid the media until the sale is finalized i have to be careful here is this guy trustworthy in my experience yes if i give him something on deep background hell cover me sure he just needs something to file all right then ill talk to him marder scribbled a note was there anything else no thats all she turned to leave by the way hows richman working out fine she said hes just inexperienced he seems bright marder said use him give him something to do all right casey said that was the problem with marketing they didnt give him anything to do okay she said marder stood see you tomorrow at the irt after casey had gone a side door opened richman walked in you dumb fuck marder said she almost got hurt in this afternoon where the hell were you well i was get this straight marder said i dont want anything to happen to singleton you understand me we need her in one piece she cant do this job from a hospital bed got it john you better pal i want you next to her at all times until we finish this thing qa pm she went back down to her fourth floor offices norma was still at her desk a cigarette dangling from her lip you got another stack on your desk waiting for you okay richmans gone home for the day okay he seemed eager to leave anyway but i talked to evelyn in accounting and richmans travel at marketing was billed to customer services in the program office thats a slush fund they use for baksheesh and the kid spent a fortune how much are you ready two hundred and eightyfour thousand dollars wow casey said in three months right thats a lot of ski trips casey said how were the charges billed entertainment customer not specified then who approved the charges its a production account norma said which means its controlled by marder marder approved these charges apparently evelyns checking for me ill get more later norma shuffled papers on her desk not much else here faas going to be late with the transcript of the cvr theres a lot of chinese spoken and their translators are fighting about the meaning the carriers also doing their own translation so casey sighed what else is new she said in incidents like this one the cockpit voice recorders were sent to the faa which generated a written transcript of the cockpit conversation since the pilots voices were owned by the carrier but disputes over the translation were the rule on foreign flights it always happened did allison call no honey the only personal call you got was from teddy rawley casey sighed never mind thatd be my advice norma said in her office she thumbed through the files on her desk most of it was paper on transpacific the first sheet summarized the stack that followed faa form accidentincident preliminary notice faa form report of aircraft accident faa form report of aircraft accident continuation faa form position loos honolulu arinc los angeles artcc southern california atac automatic signinsignoff log southern california atac faa form daily record of facility operation los angeles artcc southern california atac faa form flight progress strip los angeles artcc southern california atac flight plan icao she saw a dozen pages of flight path charts transcriptions of air traffic control voice recordings and more weather reports next was material from norton including a sheaf of fault record dataso far the only hard data they had to work with she decided to take it home she was tired she could look at it at home glendale pm he sat up in bed abruptly turned put his feet on the floor so listen babe he said not looking at her she stared at the muscles of his bare back the ridge of his spine the strong lines of his shoulders this was great he said its great to see you uhhuh she said but you know big day tomorrow she would have preferred he stay the truth was she felt better having him here at night but she knew he was going to go he always did she said i understand its okay teddy that made him turn back to her he gave her his charming crooked smile youre the best casey he bent over and kissed her a long kiss she knew this was because she wasnt begging him to stay she kissed him back smelling the faint odor of beer she ran her hand around his neck caressing the fine hairs almost immediately he pulled away again so anyway hate to run sure teddy by the way teddy said i hear you toured the gardens between shifts yeah i did you dont want to piss off the wrong people i know he grinned im sure you do he kissed her cheek then bent over reaching for his socks so anyway i probably should be heading out sure teddy she said you want coffee before you go he was pulling on his cowboy boots uh no babe this was great great to see you not wanting to be left alone in the bed she got up too she put on a big tshirt walked him to the door kissed him briefly as he left he touched her nose grinned great he said good night teddy she said she locked the door set the alarm walking back through the house she turned off the stereo glanced around to see if he had left anything other men usually left something behind because they wanted a reason to come back teddy never did all trace of his presence was gone there was only the unfinished beer on the kitchen table she threw it in the trash wiped away the ring of moisture she had been telling herself for months to end it end what end what a voice said but she somehow never got around to saying the words she was so busy at work it was such an effort to meet people six months earlier she had gone with eileen marders assistant to a countryandwestern bar in studio city the place was frequented by young movie people disney animatorsa fun crowd eileen said casey found it agonizing she wasnt beautiful and she wasnt young she didnt have the effortless glamour of the girls that glided through the room in tight jeans and crop tops the men were all too young for her their smooth faces unformed and she couldnt make small talk with them she felt herself too serious for this setting she had a job a child she was looking at forty she never went out with eileen again it wasnt that she had no interest in meeting someone but it was just so difficult there was never enough time never enough energy in the end she didnt bother so when teddy would call say he was in the neighborhood shed go unlock the door for him and get in the shower get ready that was how it had been for a year now she made tea and got back in bed she propped herself up against the headboard reached for the stack of papers and began to review the records from the fault data recorders she started to thumb through the printout as pwr test ail servo comp aoa inv cfds sens fail crz cmd mon el servo comp eprn tra fms speed inv press alt inv gs speed ang slat xsit to gs dev inv gnd spd inv tas inv tat inv aux aux aux aux coa as roxp rdr prox there were nine more pages of dense data she wasnt sure what all the readings represented particularly the aux fault checks one was probably the auxiliary power unit the gas turbine in the rear of the fuselage which provided power when the plane was on the ground and backup power in the event of electrical failure during flight but what were the others auxiliary line readings checks of redundant systems and what was aux coa shed have to ask ron she flipped ahead to the deu listing which stored faults by each leg of the flight she scanned them quickly yawning and then suddenly she stopped deu fault review leg faults rl sib prox sens miscompare apr flt fch alt as she frowned she could hardly believe what she was seeing a fault in the proximity sensor exactly what her check of maintenance records told her to look for more than two hours into the flight a proximity sensor error was noted on the inboard electrical bus the wing had many proximity sensorslittle electronic pads which detected the presence of metal nearby the sensors were needed to confirm that the slats and flaps were in the proper position on the wing since the pilots couldnt see them from the cockpit according to this fault a miscompare had occurred between sensors on the right and left sides if the main electrical box in the fuselage had had a problem faults would have been generated on both wings but the right wing alone had generated the miscompare she looked ahead to see if the fault repeated she skipped through the listing quickly shuffling papers she didnt see anything at once but a single fault in the sensor meant it should be checked again she would have to ask ron it was so difficult to try and assemble a picture of the flight from these bits and pieces she needed the continuous data from the flight recorder shed call rob wong in the morning and see how he was coming with that meanwhile casey yawned settled lower on the pillows and continued to work wednesday glendale am the telephone was ringing she awoke groggy and rolled over hearing the crunch of paper beneath her elbow she looked down and saw the data sheets scattered all over the bed the phone continued to ring she picked it up mom solemn close to tears hi allie mom dad is making me wear the red dress and i want to wear the blue one with the flowers she sighed what did you wear yesterday the blue one but its not dirty or anything this was an ongoing battle allison liked to wear the clothes she had worn the day before some innate sevenyearold conservatism at work honey you know i want you to wear clean clothes to school but it is clean mom and i hate the red dress last month the red dress had been her favorite allison had fought to wear it every day casey sat up in bed yawned stared at the papers the dense columns of data she heard her daughters complaining voice on the phone and thought do i need this she wondered why jim didnt handle it everything was so difficult over the phone jim didnt hold up his endhe wasnt firm with her and the kids natural tendency to play one parent against the other led to an interminable string of longdistance encounters like this trivial problems childish power plays allison she said interrupting her daughter if your father says to wear the red dress you do what he says but mom hes in charge now but mom thats it allison no more discussion the red dress oh mom she started to cry i hate you and she hung up casey considered calling her daughter back decided not to she yawned got out of bed walked into the kitchen and turned on the coffeemaker her fax machine was buzzing in the comer of the living room she went over to look at the paper coming out it was a copy of a press release issued by a public relations firm in washington although the firm had a neutral name the institute for aviation researchshe knew it was a pr firm representing the european consortium that made airbus the release was formatted to look like a breaking wireservice story complete with headline at the top it said jaa delays certification of n widebody jet citing continued airworthiness concerns she sighed it was going to be a hell of a day war room am casey climbed the metal stairs to the war room when she reached the catwalk john marder was there pacing back and forth waiting for her casey morning john youve seen this jaa thing he held up the fax yes i have its nonsense of course but edgarton drilled a hole hes very upset first two n incidents in two days and now this hes worried were going to get creamed in the press and he has no confidence that bensons media relations people will handle this right bill benson was one of the old norton hands he had handled media relations since the days when the company lived on military contracts and didnt tell the press a damned thing testy and blunt benson had never adjusted to the postwatergate world where journalists were celebrities who brought down governments he was famous for feuding with reporters this fax may generate press interest casey especially among reporters who dont know how screwed up the jaa is and lets face it they wont want to talk to press flacks theyll want an executive in the company so hal wants all the inquiries on the jaa routed to you to me she said she was thinking forget it she already had a job benson wont be very happy if you do that hals talked to him personally bensons on board are you sure i also think marder said we ought to prepare a decent press package on the n something besides the usual pr crap hal suggested you compile a comprehensive package to refute the jaa stuffyou know service hours safety record dispatch reliability data sdrs all of that okay that was going to be a lot of work and i told hal you were busy and that this was an added burden marder said hes approved a twograde bump in your ic incentive compensation the companys bonus package was a large part of every executives income a twograde increase would mean a substantial amount of money for her okay she said the point is marder said weve got a good response to this faxa substantive response and hal wants to make sure we get it out can i count on you to help us sure casey said good marder said and he walked up the stairs into the room richman was already in the room looking preppy in a sport coat and tie casey slipped into a chair marder shifted into high gear waving the jaa fax in the air berating the engineers youve probably already seen that the jaa is playing games with us perfectly timed to jeopardize the china sale but if you read the memo you know that its all about the engine in miami and nothing about transpacific at least not yet casey tried to pay attention but she was distracted calculating what the change in c would mean a twograde bump was she did the figures in her head something like a twentypercent raise jesus she thought twenty percent she could send allison to private school and they could vacation someplace nice hawaii or someplace like that theyd stay in a nice hotel and next year move to a bigger house with a big yard so allison could run around and everyone at the table was staring at her marder said casey the dfdr when can we expect the data sorry she said i talked to rob this morning the calibrations going slowly hell know more tomorrow okay structure doherty began in his unhappy monotone john its very difficult very difficult indeed we found a bad locking pin on the numbertwo inboard slat its a counterfeit part and well verify it at flight test marder said interrupting him hydraulics still testing but so far they check out cables rigged to spec youll finish when end of first shift today electrical ron said weve checked the principal wiring pathways nothing yet i think we should schedule a cet on the entire aircraft i agree can we run it overnight to save time ron shrugged sure its expensive but the hell with expense anything else well theres one funny thing yes ron said the deu faults indicate there may have been a problem with proximity sensors in the wing if the sensors failed we might get a slats misread in the cockpit this was what casey had noticed the night before she made a note to ask ron about it later and also the matter of the aux readings on the printout her mind drifted again thinking of the raise allison could go to a real school now she saw her at a low desk in a small classroom marder said powerplant were still not sure he deployed the thrust reversers kenny burne said itll be another day go until you can rule it out avionics trung said avionics check out so far this autopilot thing havent gotten to autopilot yet its the last thing in the sequence that we confirm well know by flight test all right marder said so new question regarding proximity sensors check that today still waiting on flight recorder powerplant avionics that cover it everyone nodded dont let me keep you marder said i need answers he held up the jaa fax this is the tip of the iceberg people i dont have to remind you what happened to the dc most advanced aircraft of its time a marvel of engineering but it had a couple of incidents and some bad visuals and bang the dcs history history so get me those answers norton aircraft am walking across the plant toward hangar richman said marder seemed pretty worked up didnt he does he believe all that about the dc yes one crash finished the aircraft what crash it was an american airlines flight from chicago to la casey said may nice day good weather right after takeoff the left engine fell off the wing the plane stalled and crashed next to the airport killing everybody on board very dramatic it was all over in thirty seconds a couple of people taped the flight so the networks had film at eleven the media went crazy called the plane a winged coffin travel agents were flooded with calls canceling dc bookings douglas never sold another one of them why did the engine fall off bad maintenance casey said american hadnt followed douglass instructions on how to remove the engines from the plane douglas told them to first remove the engine and then the pylon that holds the engine to the wing but to save time american took the whole enginepylon assembly off at once thats seven tons of metal on a forklift one forklift ran out of gas during the removal and cracked the pylon but the crack wasnt noticed and eventually the engine fell off the wing so it was all because of maintenance maybe so richman said but isnt an airplane still supposed to fly even missing an engine yes it is casey said the dc was built to survive that kind of failure the plane was perfectly airworthy if the pilot had maintained airspeed hed have been fine he could have landed the plane why didnt he because as usual there was an event cascade leading to the final accident casey said in this case electrical power to the captains cockpit controls came from the left engine when the left engine fell off the captains instruments were shut off including the cockpit stall warning and the backup warning called a stick shaker thats a device that shakes the stick to tell the pilot the plane is about to stall the first officer still had power and instruments so the first officers chair didnt have a stick shaker its a customer option for the first officer and american hadnt ordered it and douglas hadnt built any redundancy into their cockpitstall warning system so when the dc began to stall the first officer didnt realize he had to increase throttle okay richman said but the captain shouldnt have lost his power in the first place no that was a designedin safety feature casey said douglas had designed and built the aircraft to survive those failures when the left engine tore off the aircraft deliberately shut down the captains power line to prevent further shorts in the system remember all aircraft systems are redundant if one fails the backup kicks in and it was easy to get the captains instrumentation back again all the flight engineer had to do was trip a relay or turn on emergency power but he didnt do either one why not no one knows casey said and the first officer lacking the necessary information on his display intentionally reduced his airspeed which caused the plane to stall and crash they were silent for a moment walking consider all the ways this might have been avoided casey said the maintenance crews could have checked the pylons for structural damage after servicing them improperly but they didnt continental had already cracked two pylons using forklifts and they could have told american the procedure was dangerous but they didnt douglas had told american about continentals problems but american didnt pay any attention richman was shaking his head and after the accident douglas couldnt say it was a maintenance problem because american was a valued customer so douglas wasnt going to put the story out in all these incidents its always the same storythe story never gets out unless the media digs it out but the storys complicated and thats difficult for television so they just run the tape the tape of the accident which shows the left engine falling off the plane veering left and crashing the visual implies the aircraft was poorly designed that douglas hadnt anticipated a pylon failure and hadnt built the plane to survive it which was completely inaccurate but douglas never sold another dc well richman said i dont think you can blame the media for that they dont make the news they just report it thats my point casey said they didnt report it they just ran the film the chicago crash was a kind of turning point in our industry the first time a good aircraft was destroyed by bad press the coup de grace was the ntsb report it came out on december nobody paid any attention so now when boeing introduces their new they arrange a complete press campaign to coincide with the launch they allow a tv company to film the years of development and at the end theres a sixpart show on public television theres a book to go with it theyve done everything they can think of to create a good image for the plane in advance because the stakes are too high richman walked along beside her i cant believe the media has that much power he said casey shook her head marder is right to be worried she said if anybody in the media gets onto flight then the n will have had two incidents in two days and were in big trouble newsline new york pm in midtown manhattan in the twentythirdfloor offices of the weekly news show newsline jennifer malone was in the editing bay reviewing tape of an interview with charles manson her assistant deborah walked in dropped a fax on her desk and said casually pacino dumped jennifer hit her pause button what al pacino just dumped when ten minutes ago blew marty off and walked what we shot four days of broll on the set in tangier his picture opens this weekendand hes slated for the full twelve a twelve minute segment on newsline the mostwatched news show on television was the kind of publicity that money couldnt buy every star in hollywood wanted on the show what happened marty was chatting with him during makeup and mentioned that pacino hadnt had a hit in four years and i guess he got offended and walked on camera no before jesus jennifer said pacino cant do that his contract calls for him to do publicity this was set up months ago yeah well he did whats marty say marty is pissed marty is saying what did he expect this is a news show we ask hardhitting questions you know typical marty jennifer swore this was just what everyone was worried about marty reardon was a notoriously abrasive interviewer although he had left the news division to work on newsline at a much higher salarytwo years before he still viewed himself as a hardhitting newsman tough but fair noholdsbarredthough in practice he liked to embarrass interviewees putting them on the spot with intensely personal questions even if the questions werent relevant to the story nobody wanted to use marty on the pacino shoot because he didnt like celebrities and didnt like doing puff pieces but frances who usually did the celeb pieces was in tokyo interviewing the princess has dick talked to marty can we salvage this dick shenk was the executive producer of newsline in just three years he had skillfully built the show from a throwaway summer replacement into a solid primetime success shenk made all the important decisions and he was the only person with enough clout to handle a prima donna like marty dick is still at lunch with mr early shenks lunches with early the president of the network always lasted late into the afternoon so dick doesnt know not yet great jennifer said she glanced at her watch it was pm if pacino had dumped they had a twelveminute hole to fill and less than seventytwo hours to do it whatve we got in the can nothing mother teresas being recut mickey mantle isnt in yet all we have is that wheelchair little league segment jennifer groaned dick will never go with that i know deborah said it sucks jennifer picked up the fax her assistant had dropped on the console it was a press release from some pr group one of hundreds that every news show received each day like all such faxes this one was formatted to look like a breaking news story complete with a headline at the top it said jaa delays certification of n widebody jet citing continued airworthiness concerns whats this she said frowning hector said give it to you why he thought there might be something in it why what the fucks the jaa jennifer scanned the text it was a lot of aerospace babble dense and impenetrable she thought no visuals apparently deborah said its the same plane that caught fire in miami oh hector wants to do a safety segment good luck everybodys seen the tape of the burning plane already and it wasnt that good to begin with jennifer tossed the fax aside ask him if he has anything else deborah went away alone jennifer stared at the frozen image of charles manson on the screen in front of her then she clicked the image off and decided to take a moment to think jennifer malone was twentynine years old the youngest segment producer in the history of newsline she had advanced quickly because she was good at her job she had shown talent early while still an undergraduate at brown working as a summer intern like deborah she had done research late into the night hammering away at the nexis terminals combing the wire services then with her heart in her mouth she had gone in to see dick shenk to propose a story about this strange new virus in africa and the brave cdc doctor on the scene that led to the famous ebola segment the biggest newsline break of the year and another peabody award for dick shenks wall of fame in short order she had followed with the darryl strawberry segment the montana stripmining segment and the iroquois gambling segment no college intern in memory had ever gotten a segment on air before jennifer had four shenk announced he liked her spunk and offered her a job the fact that she was bright beautiful and an ivy leaguer did not hurt either the following june when she graduated she went to work for newsline the show had fifteen producers doing segments each was assigned to one of the oncamera talent each was expected to deliver a story every two weeks the average story took four weeks to build after two weeks of research producers met with dick to get the goahead then they visited the locations shot broll for background and did the secondary interviews the story was shaped by the producer and narrated by the onair star who flew in for a single day did the standups and the major interviews and then flew on to the next shoot leaving the producer to cut the tape sometime before air the star would come into the studio read the script the producer had prepared and do the voiceovers for visuals when the segment finally aired the oncamera star would come off as a real reporter newsline jealously protected the reputations of its stars but in fact the producers were the real reporters the producers picked the stories researched and shaped them wrote the scripts and cut the tape the oncamera talent just did as they were told it was a system jennifer liked she had considerable power and she liked working behind the scenes her name unknown she found the anonymity useful often when she conducted interviews she would be treated as a flunky the interviewees speaking freely even though tape was rolling at some point the interviewee would say when will i get to meet marty reardon she would solemnly answer that that hadnt been decided yet and continue with her questions and in the process nail the stupid bozo who thought she was just a dress rehearsal the fact was she made the story she didnt care if the stars got the credit we never say they do the reporting shenk would intone we never imply they are interviewing someone they didnt actually interview on this show the talent is not the star the star is the story the talent is just a guide leading the audience through the story the talent is someone they trust someone theyre comfortable inviting into their home that was true she thought and anyway there wasnt time to do it any other way a media star like marty reardon was more heavily booked than the president and arguably more famous more recognizable on the street you couldnt expect a person like marty to waste his valuable time doing spadework stumbling over false leads putting together a story there just wasnt time this was television there was never enough time she looked again at her watch dick wouldnt return from lunch until three or threethirty marty reardon was not going to apologize to al pacino so when dick came back from lunch he was going to blow his top rip reardon a new one and then be desperate for a package to fill the hole jennifer had an hour to find him one she turned on her tv and started idly flipping channels and she looked again at the fax on her desk jaa delays certification of n widebody jet citing continued airworthiness concerns wait a minute she thought continued airworthiness concerns did that mean an ongoing safety problem if so there might be a story here not air safetythat had been done a million times those endless stories about air traffic control how they were using s computers how outdated and risky the system was stories like mat just made people anxious the audience couldnt relate because there was nothing they could do about it but a specific aircraft with a problem that was a product safety story dont buy this product dont fly this airplane that might be very very effective she thought she picked up the phone and dialed hangar am casey found ron smith with his head in the forward accessory compartment just back of the nose wheel all around him his electrical team was hard at work ron she said tell me about this fault list she had brought the list with her all ten pages what about it theres four aux readings here lines one two three and coa what do they service is this important thats what im trying to determine well ron sighed aux is the auxiliary power generator the turbine in the tail aux and aux are redundant lines in case the system gets an upgrade and needs them later aux coa is an auxiliary line for customer optional additions thats the line for customer addons like a qar which this plane doesnt have casey said these lines are registering a zero value does that mean theyre being used not necessarily the default is zero so youd have to check them okay she folded up the data sheets and what about the proximity sensor faults were doing that now we may turn up something but look the fault readings are snapshots of a moment in time well never figure out what happened to this flight with snapshots we need the dfdr data youve got to get it for us casey ive been pushing rob wong push him harder smith said the flight recorder is the key from the back of the airplane she heard a pained shout fuck a hairy duck i dont believe this it had come from kenny burne he was standing on a platform behind the left engine waving his arms angrily the other engineers around him were shaking their heads casey went over you found something let me count the ways bume said pointing to the engine first off the coolant seals are installed wrong some maintenance idiot put them in backward affecting flight sooner or later yeah but thats not all take a look at this inboard cowl on the reversers casey climbed the scaffolding to the back of the engine where the engineers were peering inside the open cowls of the thrust reversers show her guys burne said they shone a work light on the interior surface of one cowl casey saw a solid steel surface precisely curved covered with fine soot from the engine they held the light close to the pratt and whitney logo which was embossed near the leading edge of the metal sleeve see it kenny said what you mean the parts stamp casey said the pratt and whitney logo was a circle with an eagle inside it and the letters p and w thats right the stamp what about it burne shook his head casey he said the eagle is backward its facing the wrong way oh she hadnt noticed that now do you think pratt and whitney put their eagle on backward no way this is a goddamn counterfeit part casey okay she said but did it affect flight that was the critical point theyd already found counterfeit parts on the plane amos had said there would be more and he was undoubtedly right but the question was did any of them affect the behavior of the plane during the accident could have kenny said stomping around but i cant tear down this engine for chrissakes thatd be two weeks right there then how will we find out we need that flight recorder casey weve got to have that data richman said you want me to go over to digital see how wong is coming no casey said it wont do any good rob wong could be temperamental putting more pressure on him wouldnt accomplish anything he was likely to walk out and not return for two days her cell phone rang it was norma its starting she said you got calls from jack rogers from barry jordan at the la times from somebody named winslow at the washington post and a request for background material on the n from newsline newsline that tv show yeah they doing a story i dont think so norma said it sounded like a fishing expedition okay casey said ill call you back she sat down in a corner of the hangar and took out her notepad she began to write out a list of documents to be included in a press package summary of faa certification procedures for new aircraft announcement of faa certification of the n norma would have to dig that up from five years ago last years faa report on aircraft safety the companys internal report on n safety in flight from to presentthe record was outstanding the annual updated history of die n the list of ads issued for the aircraft to datethere were very few the onesheet features summary on the plane basic stats on speed and range size and weight she didnt want to send too much but that would cover the bases richman was watching her what now he said she tore off the sheet gave it to him give this to norma tell her to prepare a press packet and send it to whoever asks for it okay he stared at the list im not sure i can read norma will know just give it to her okay richman walked away humming cheerfully her phone rang it was jack rogers calling her directly i keep hearing the wings being offset im told norton is shipping the tools to korea but theyre going to be transshipped from there to shanghai did marder talk to you no weve traded calls talk to him casey said before you do anything will marder go on the record just talk to him okay rogers said but hell deny it right talk to him rogers sighed look casey i dont want to sit on a story that ive got rightand then read it two days from now in the la times help me out here is there anything to the wing tooling story or not i cant say anything tell you what rogers said if i were to write that several highlevel norton sources deny the wing is going to china i assume you wouldnt have a problem with that i wouldnt no a careful answer but then it was a careful question okay casey thanks ill call marder he hung up newsline pm jennifer malone dialed the number on the fax and asked for the contact alan price mr price was still at lunch and she spoke to his assistant ms weld i understand theres a delay in european certification of the norton aircraft whats the problem you mean the n thats right well this is a contentious issue so id prefer to go off the record how far off background okay in the past the europeans accepted faa certification of a new aircraft because that certification was thought to be very rigorous but lately jaa has been questioning the us certification process they feel that the american agency the faa is in bed with the american manufacturers and may have relaxed its standards really perfect jennifer thought inept american bureaucracy dick shenk loved those stories and the faa had been under attack for years there must be plenty of skeletons there what s the evidence she asked well the europeans find the whole system unsatisfactory for example the faa doesnt even store certification documents they allow the aircraft companies to do that it seems entirely too cozy uhhuh she wrote faa in bed with mfrs corrupt anyway the woman said if you want more information i suggest you call the jaa directly or maybe airbus i can give you the numbers she called the faa instead she got put through to their public affairs office a man named wilson i understand the jaa is refusing to validate certification of the norton n yes wilson said theyve been dragging their feet for a while now the faa has already certified the n oh sure you cant build an airplane in this country without faa approval and certification of the design and manufacturing process from start to finish and do you have the certification documents no theyre kept by the manufacturer norton has them ahha she thought so it was true norton keeps certification not faa fox guarding chicken coop does it bother you that norton holds the documentation no not at all and youre satisfied that the certification process was proper oh sure and like i said the plane was certified five years ago ive been hearing that the europeans are dissatisfied with the entire process of certification well you know wilson said adopting a diplomatic tone the jaas a relatively new organization unlike the faa they have no statutory authority so i think theyre still trying to decide how they want to proceed she called the information office for airbus industries in washington and got put through to a marketing guy named samuelson he reluctantly confirmed that he had heard of the jaa confirmation delays though he didnt have any details but nortons having a lot of problems these days he said for example i think the china sale is not as firm as they pretend it is this was the first she had heard of a china sale she wrote china sale n she said uhhuh i mean lets face it samuelson continued the airbus a is a superior plane in every way its newer than the norton widebody better range its better in every way weve been trying to explain this to the chinese and they are starting to understand our perspective anyway if i had to guess id guess the norton sale to the peoples republic is going to fall apart and of course safety concerns are part of that decision off the record i think the chinese are very concerned the plane is unsafe c thinks airplane unsafe who would i talk to about that she said well as you know the chinese are generally reluctant to discuss negotiations in progress samuelson said but i know a guy over at commerce who may be able to help you hes with the exim bank which provides longterm financing for overseas sales whats his name she said his name was robert gordon it took fifteen minutes for the operator at the commerce department to find him jennifer doodled finally the secretary said im sorry mr gordon is in a meeting im calling from newsline she said oh a pause just a minute please she smiled it never failed gordon came on and she asked him about the jaa certification and the norton sale to the peoples republic is it true the sale is in jeopardy every airplane sale is in jeopardy until its concluded ms malone gordon said but as far as i know the china sale is in good standing i did hear a rumor that norton is having trouble with jaa certification for europe whats the trouble there well gordon said im not really an aircraft expert but the companys had an awful lot of problems norton has problems gordon said there was that thing in miami yesterday and of course you heard about that incident in dallas whats that last year they had an engine flameout on the runway and everybody jumped off the plane a bunch of people broke their legs jumping off the wings dallas incidentenginebroken legs tape she said uhhuh i dont know about you gordon said but i dont like to fly very much and uh jesus christ people are jumping off the airplane thats not a plane id want to be on she wrote jumping off plane yow unsafe aircraft and beneath it in large block letters she wrote deathtrap she called norton aircraft for their version of the story she got a pr guy named benson he sounded like one of those drawling halfasleep corporate guys she decided to hit him right between the eyes i want to ask you about the dallas incident dallas his voice sounded startled good last year she said you had a flameout of the engine and people jumped off the plane broke their legs oh right that incident involved a benson said incident w uhhuh well what can you tell me about it nothing benson said that wasnt our plane oh come on she said look i already know about the incident thats a boeing plane she sighed jesus give me a break it was so tedious the way these pr types stonewalled as if a good investigative reporter would never find out the truth they seemed to think if they didnt tell her no one would im sorry ms malone but we dont make that plane well if thats really true she said her tone openly sarcastic i suppose you can tell me how i can confirm it yes maam benson said you dial area code and ask for boeing theyll help you click jesus what a prick how could these companies treat the media this way you piss off a reporter youll always get paid back didnt they understand that she called boeing asked for the pr department she got an answering machine some bitch reciting a fax number and saying questions should be faxed and they would get back to her unbelievable jennifer thought a major american corporation and they didnt even answer the phone irritably she hung up there was no point in waiting if the dallas incident involved a boeing plane she had no story no damn story she drummed her fingers on the desk trying to decide what to do she called norton back saying she wanted to talk to someone in management not pr she was put through to the presidents office then was transferred to some woman named singleton how can i help you the woman said i understand theres been a delay in european certification of the n whats the problem with the plane jennifer asked no problem at all singleton said weve been flying the n in this country for five years well ive been hearing from sources that this is an unsafe aircraft jennifer said you had an engine flameout on the runway at miami yesterday actually we had a rotor burst thats being investigated now the woman was speaking smoothly calmly as if it was the most normal thing in the world for an engine to blow up rotor burst uhhuh jennifer said i see but if its true your plane has no problems why is the jaa withholding certification the woman at the other end paused i can only give you background on this she said off the record she sounded unsettled tense good getting somewhere there is no problem with the aircraft ms malone the issue concerns powerplant in this country the plane flies with pratt and whitney engines but the jaa is telling us that if we want to sell the plane in europe were going to have to equip it with iae engines iae a european consortium that makes engines like airbus a consortium uhhuh jennifer said iae consortium europe now allegedly singleton continued the jaa wants us to equip the aircraft with the iae engine to meet european noise and emission standards which are more stringent than those in the us but the reality is we make airframes not engines and we believe the engine decision should be left up to the customer we install the engine the customer asks for if they want an iae we put an iae on if they want a pratt and whitney we put pratt and whitney on they want ge we put ge on thats the way its always been in this business the customer picks the engine so we consider this an unwarranted regulatory intrusion by the jaa were happy to put on iae engines if lufthansa or sabena tells us to do it but we dont think jaa should dictate the terms of market entry in other words the issue has nothing to do with airworthiness listening jennifer frowned youre saying its a regulatory dispute exactly this is a trading bloc issue the jaa is trying to force us to use european engines but if thats their goal we think they should force it on the european airlines not us regulatory dispute and why havent they forced it on the europeans youd have to ask jaa but frankly i imagine theyve already tried and been told to go to hell aircraft are custom built to the carriers specs the operators choose the engines the electronics packages the interior configuration its their choice jennifer was now doodling she was listening to the tone of the womans voice at the other end of the line trying to sense the emotion this woman sounded slightly bored like a schoolteacher at the end of the day jennifer detected no tension no hesitation no hidden secrets fuck she thought no story she made one last try she called the national transportation safety board in washington she got put through to a man named kenner in public affairs im calling about the jaa certification of the n kenner sounded surprised well you know thats really not our area you probably want to talk to someone at the faa can you give me anything on background well faa aircraft certification is extremely rigorous and has served as the model for foreign regulatory bureaucracies as long as i can remember foreign agencies around the world have accepted faa certification as sufficient now the jaa has broken that tradition and i dont think its any secret why its politics ms malone the jaa wants the americans to use european engines so theyre threatening to withhold certification and of course nortons about to make a sale of ns to china and airbus wants that sale so the jaa is trashing the plane well theyre certainly raising doubts legitimate doubts not as far as im concerned the ns a good plane a proven plane airbus says they have a brandnew plane norton says they have a proven plane the chinese are probably going to take the proven product its also somewhat less expensive but is the plane safe oh absolutely ntsb says plane is safe jennifer thanked him and hung up she sat back in her chair and sighed no story nothing period the end shit she said she punched the intercom deborah she said about this aircraft thing are you watching deborah said squealing watching what cnn its unfuckingbelievable jennifer grabbed her remote el torito restaurant pm the el torito offered acceptable food at a reasonable price and fiftytwo kinds of beer it was a local favorite of the engineers the irt members were all sitting at a center table in the main room right off the bar the waitress had taken their order and was leaving when kenny burne said so i hear edgartons got a few problems dont we all doug doherty said reaching for the chips and salsa marder hates him so what ron smith said marder hates everybody yeah but the thing is kenny said i keep hearing marder is not going to oh jesus look doug doherty pointed across the room toward the bar they all turned to stare at the television set mounted above the bar the sound was down but the image was unmistakable the interior of a norton widebody jet as seen by a badly shaking video camera passengers were literally flying through the air bouncing off luggage racks and wall panels tumbling over the seats holy shit kenny said they got up from the table ran into the bar shouting sound turn up the sound the horrifying images continued by the time casey got into the bar the video segment had ended the television now showed a thin man with a moustache wearing a carefully cut blue suit which somehow suggested a uniform she recognized bradley king an attorney who specialized in airline accidents well that figures burne said its sky king i think this footage speaks for itself bradley king was saying my client mr song provided it to us and it vividly portrays the terrible ordeal passengers were subjected to on this doomed flight this aircraft went into an unprovoked and uncontrolled diveit came within five hundred feet of crashing in the pacific ocean what kenny burne said it did what as you know im a pilot myself and i can say with absolute conviction that what occurred is a result of wellknown design flaws on the n jet norton has known about these design flaws for years and has done nothing pilots operators and faa specialists have all complained bitterly about the aircraft i personally know pilots who refuse to fly the n because it is so unsafe especially the ones on your payroll burne said on the television king was saying yet the norton aircraft company has done nothing substantive to address these safety concerns its inexplicable really that they could know about these problems and do nothing given their criminal negligence it was only a matter of time until a tragedy like this occurred now three people are dead two passengers paralyzed the copilot in a coma as we speak all together fiftyseven passengers required hospitalization thats a disgrace to aviation that sleazebag kenny burne said he knows its not true but the television was showing the cnn tape again this time in slow motion the bodies spiraling through the air alternately blurred and sharp watching it casey started to sweat she felt dizzy and cold her chest tight the restaurant around her became dim pale green she dropped quickly to a bar stool took a deep breath now the television showed a bearded man with a scholarly air standing near one of the runways at lax aircraft were taxiing in the background she couldnt hear what the man was saying because the engineers around her were screaming at the image you asshole fuckface weenyprick lying dipshit will you guys shut up she said the bearded man on the screen was frederick barker a former faa official no longer with the agency barker had testified in court against the company several times in recent years the engineers all hated him barker was saying oh yes im afraid theres no question about the problem about what problem she thought but now the television cut back to the cnn studio in atlanta the female anchor in front of a photograph of the n beneath the photograph it said unsafe in huge red letters christ do you believe that shit burne said sky king and then that scumbag barker dont they know barker works for king the television now showed a bombedout building in the middle east casey turned away got off the bar stool took a deep breath goddamn i want a beer kenny burne said he headed back to the table the others followed him muttering about fred barker casey picked up her purse got her cell phone out and called the office norma she said call cnn and get a copy of the tape they just ran on the n i was just going out to now casey said do it right now newsline pm deborah jennifer screamed watching the tape call cnn and get a copy of that norton tape jennifer watched transfixed now they were running it again this time in slow motion six frames a second and it held up fantastic she saw one poor bastard tumble through the air like a diver out of control arms and legs flailing in all directions the guy smashed into a seat and his neck snapped the body twisting before he bounced up in the air again and hit the ceiling incredible his neck being broken right on tape it was the greatest piece of tape shed ever seen and the sound fabulous people screaming in pure terrorsounds you couldnt fakepeople shouting in chinese which made it very exotic and all these incredible crashing noises as people and bags and shit smashed into the walls and ceilingsjesus it was fabulous tape unbelievable and it went on for an eternity fortyfive secondsand all of it good because even when the camera wobbled when it streaked and blurred that just added to it you couldnt pay a cameraman to do that deborah she screamed deborah she was so excited her heart was pounding she felt like she was going to jump out of her skin she was dimly aware of the guy on camera now some weasel lawyer feeding the segment his opening arguments it must be his tape but she knew he would give it to newsline hed want the exposure which meantthey had a story fantastic a little frill and build and they were there deborah came in flushed excited jennifer said get me the clips on norton aircraft for the last five years do a nexis search on the n on a guy named bradley king and a guy namedshe looked back at the screenfrederick barker download it all i want it now twenty minutes later she had the outlines of the story and the background on the key figures la times story from five years ago on the rollout certification and maiden flight for the launch customer of the norton n advanced avionics advanced electronic control systems and autopilot blah blah blah new york times story on

orange county telegraphstar barker accuses faa of failing to clamp down on unsafe norton aircraft orange county telegraphstar barker key witness for bradley king lawsuit settled out of court jennifer was beginning to see the shape that the story would take clearly they should stay away from the ambulance chaser bradley king but barker a former faa official would be useful he would probably also be able to criticize certification practices by the faa and she noticed that jack rogers the reporter for the orange county telegraphstar took a particularly critical view of norton aircraft she noted several recent stories under rogerss byline orange county telegraphstar edgarton under pressure to make new sales for troubled company dissension among directors top management doubts he will succeed orange county telegraphstar drug and gang activity on norton twinjet assembly line orange county telegraphstar rumors of union trouble workers oppose the china sale which they say will ruin the company jennifer smiled things were definitely looking up she called jack rogers at his newspaper ive been reading your pieces on norton theyre excellent i gather you think the companys got some problems a lot of problems rogers said you mean with the airplanes well yes but theyre also having union problems whats that about its not clear but the plants in turmoil and managements not leading the unions angry about the china sale thinks it shouldnt happen will you talk about this on camera sure i cant give you my sources but ill tell you what i know of course he would jennifer thought it was the dream of every print reporter to somehow get on television the print guys all understood the real money came from appearing on the box no matter how successful you were in print you were nothing unless you could get on tv once you had name recognition from tv you could migrate to the lucrative lecture circuit getting five ten thousand dollars just to speak at a lunch ill probably be out later in the week my office will contact you just tell me when rogers said she called fred barker in los angeles he almost seemed to be expecting her call thats pretty dramatic videotape she said its frightening barker said when an aircrafts slats deploy at nearly the speed of sound thats what happened on the transpacific flight its the ninth such incident since the aircraft entered service the ninth oh yes this is nothing new ms malone at least three other deaths are attributable to nortons shoddy design and yet the company has done nothing you have a list give me your fax number she stared at the list it was a little too detailed for her taste but still compelling norton n slats deployment incidents january slats deployed at fl at mach the flapslat handle moved inadvertently april slats deployed while the airplane was in cruise at mach a clipboard reportedly fell on the flapslat handle july initially reported as severe turbulence however it was later learned that the slats had extended as a result of inadvertent flapslat handle movement five passenger injuries three serious december slats extended in cruise flight without movement of the flapslat handle in cockpit two passenger injuries march airplane entered a prestall buffet at mach the slats were found to be extended and the handle was not in the up and locked position april first officer rested his arm on the flapslat handle moved the handle down extending the slats several passenger injuries july pilot reported the flapslat handle moved and slats extended aircraft was in cruise flight at mach june the slats extended while the airplane was in cruise flight without movement of the flapslat handle she picked up the phone and called barker back will you talk about these incidents on camera ive testified in court about this on numerous occasions barker said ill be happy to speak to you on the record the fact is i want this airplane fixed before more people die and nobody has been willing to do itnot the company and not the faa its a disgrace but how can you be so sure this flight was a slats accident i have a source inside norton barker said a disgruntled employee who is tired of all the lying my source tells me it is slats and the company is covering up jennifer got off the phone with barker and pushed the intercom button deborah she screamed get me travel jennifer closed the door to her office and sat quietly she knew she had a story a fabulous story the question now was whats the angle how do you frame it on a show like newsline the frame was allimportant older producers on the show talked about context which to them meant putting the story in a larger setting indicating what the story meant by reporting what had happened before or reporting similar things that had occurred the older guys thought context so important they seemed to regard it as a kind of moral or ethical obligation jennifer disagreed because when you cut out all the sanctimonious bullshit context was just spin a way of pumping the storyand not a very useful way because context meant referring to the past jennifer had no interest in the past she was one of the new generation that understood that gripping television was now events happening now a flow of images in a perpetual unending electronic present context by its very nature required something more than now and her interest did not go beyond now nor she thought did anyone elses the past was dead and gone who cared what you ate yesterday what you did yesterday what was immediate and compelling was now and television at its best was now so a good frame had nothing to do with the past fred barkers damning list of prior incidents was actually a problem because it drew attention to the fading boring past shed have to find a way around itgive it a mention and go on what she was looking for was a way to shape the story so that it unfolded now in a pattern that the viewer could follow the best frames engaged the viewer by presenting the story as a conflict between good and bad a morality story because the audience got that if you framed a story that way you got instant acceptance you were speaking their language but because the story also had to unfold quickly this morality tale had to hang from a series of hooks that did not need to be explained things the audience already knew to be true they already knew big corporations were corrupt their leaders greedy sexist pigs you didnt have to prove that you just had to mention it they already knew that government bureaucracies were inept and lazy you didnt have to prove that either and they already knew that products were cynically manufactured with no concern for consumer safety from such agreedupon elements she must construct her morality story a fastmoving morality story happening now of course there was still another requirement for the frame before anything else she must sell the segment to dick shenk she had to come up with an angle that would appeal to shenk that would fit his view of the world and that was no easy matter shenk was more sophisticated than the audience more difficult to please within the newsline offices shenk was known as the critic for the harsh way he shot down proposed segments walking around the office shenk adopted an affable air playing the grand old man but all that changed when he listened to a proposal then he became dangerous dick shenk was well educated and smartvery smartand he could be charming when he wanted to but at bottom he was mean he had grown meaner with age cultivating his nasty streak regarding it as a key to his success now she was going to take a proposal in to him she knew shenk would want a story badly but he would also be angry about pacino angry about marty and his anger could quickly turn against jennifer and her proposed segment to avoid his anger to sell him this segment she would have to proceed carefully she would have to fashion the story into a shape that more than anything else gave vent to dick shenks hostility and anger and turned it in a useful direction she reached for a notepad and began to sketch the outlines of what she would say administration pm casey got into the elevator in administration richman following her i dont understand he said why is everybody so angry with king because hes lying casey said he knows the aircraft didnt come within five hundred feet of the pacific ocean everybodyd be dead if it did the incident happened at thirtyseven thousand feet at most the aircraft dropped three or four thousand feet thats bad enough so hes getting attention making the case for his client he knows what hes doing yes he does hasnt norton settled out of court with him in the past three times she said richman shrugged if you have a strong case take him to trial yes casey said but trials are very expensive and the publicity doesnt do us any good its cheaper to settle and just add the cost of his greenmail to the price of our aircraft the carriers pay that price and pass it on to the customer so in the end every airline passenger pays a few dollars extra for their ticket in a hidden tax the litigation tax the bradley king tax thats how it works in the real world the doors opened and they came out on the fourth floor she hurried down the corridor toward her department where are we going now richman said to get something important mat i forgot all about she looked at him and you did too newsline pm jennifer malone headed toward dick shenks office on the way she passed his wall of fame a tight arrangement of photographs plaques and awards the photographs showed intimate moments with the rich and famous shenk riding horses with reagan shenk on a yacht with cronkite shenk in a southampton softball game with tisch shenk with clinton shenk with ben bradlee and in the far corner a photograph of an absurdly young shenk with shoulderlength hair an arriflex mounted on his shoulder filming john kennedy in the oval office dick shenk had begun his career in the sixties as a scrappy documentary producer back in the days when the news divisions were prestige loss leaders for the networks autonomous handsomely budgeted and lavishly staffed those were the great days of the cbs white papers and nbc reports back then when shenk was a kid running around with an arri he was in the world getting real stuff that mattered with age and success shenks horizons had narrowed his world was now limited to his weekend house in connecticut and his brownstone in new york if he went anywhere else it was in a limousine but despite his privileged upbringing his yale education his beautiful exwives his comfortable existence and his worldly success shenk at sixty was dissatisfied with his life riding around in his limousine he felt unappreciated not enough recognition not enough respect for his accomplishments the questing kid with the camera had aged into a querulous and bitter adult feeling he had been denied respect himself shenk in turn denied it to othersadopting a pervasive cynicism toward everything around him and that was why she felt certain he would buy her frame on the norton story jennifer entered the outer office stopped by marians desk going to see dick marian said is he in she nodded you want company do i need it jennifer said raising an eyebrow well marian said hes been drinking its okay jennifer said i can handle him dick shenk listened to her eyes closed fingers pressed together to make a steeple from time to time he nodded slightly as she spoke she ran through the proposed segment hitting all the beats the miami incident the jaa certification story the transpacific flight the jeopardized china sale the former faa expert who says the plane has a long history of uncorrected design problems the aviation reporter who says the company is mismanaged drugs and gang activity on the factory floor a controversial new president trying to boost flagging sales portrait of a onceproud company in trouble the way to frame the piece she said was rot beneath the surface she laid it out badly run company makes a shoddy product for years knowledgeable people complain but the company never responds faa is in bed with the company and wont force the issue now at last the truth comes out the europeans balk at certification the chinese have cold feet the plane continues to kill passengers just as critics said it would and theres tape riveting tape showing the agonies passengers went through as several died at the close its obvious to all the n is a deathtrap she finished there was a long moment of silence then shenk opened his eyes not bad he said she smiled whats the companys response he asked in a lazy voice stonewall the planes safe the critics are lying just what youd expect shenk said shaking his head american stuff is so shitty dick drove a bmw his tastes ran to swiss watches french wines english shoes everything this country makes is crap he said he slumped back in his chair as if fatigued by the thought then his voice became lazy again thoughtful but what can they offer as proof not much jennifer said the miami and transpacific incidents are still under investigation reports due when not for weeks ah he nodded slowly i like it i like it very much its compelling journalismand it beats the shit out of minutes they did unsafe airplane parts last month but were talking about a whole unsafe aircraft a deathtrap perfect scare the hell out of everybody i think so too she said she was smiling broadly now he had bought it and id love to stick it to hewitt dick said don hewitt the legendary producer of minutes was shenks nemesis hewitt consistently got better press than shenk which rankled those jerkoffs he said remember when they did their hardhitting segment on offseason golf pros she shook her head actually no it was a while back dick said he got fuzzy for a moment staring into space and it was clear to her that he had been drinking heavily at lunch never mind okay where are we you got the faa guy you got the reporter you got tape of miami the peg is the home video we lead with that right she said nodding but cnn is going to run it day and night he said by next week itll be ancient history we have to go with this story saturday right she said you got twelve minutes he said he spun in his chair looked at the colored strips on the wall representing the segments in production where the talent was going to be and you got uh marty hes doing bill gates in seattle on thursday well shuttle him to la friday youll have him six seven hours okay he spun back go do it okay she said thanks dick you sure you can put it together in time she started collecting her notes trust me as she headed out through marians office she heard him shout just remember jenniferdont come back with a parts story i dont want a fucking parts story qanorton pm casey came into the qa office with richman norma was back from lunch lighting another cigarette norma she said have you seen a videotape around here one of those little eightmillimeter things yeah norma said you left it on your desk the other night i put it away she rummaged in her drawer brought it out she turned to richman and you got two calls from marder he wants you to call him right away okay richman said he walked down the hall to his office when he was gone norma said you know he talks to marder a lot i heard it from eileen marders getting in with the norton relatives norma was shaking her head hes already married charleys only daughter for christs sake whatre you saying casey said richmans reporting to marder about three times a day casey frowned why good question honey i think youre being set up for what i have no idea norma said something about the china sale norma shrugged i dont know but marder is the best corporate infighter in the history of the company and hes good at covering his tracks id be real careful around this kid she leaned across her desk lowered her voice when i got back from lunch she said nobody was around the kid keeps his briefcase in his office so i had a look and richmans copying everything in sight hes got a copy of every memo on your desk and hes xeroxed your phone logs my phone logs whats the point of that i couldnt begin to imagine norma said but theres more i also found his passport hes been to korea five times in the last two months korea casey said thats right honey seoul went almost every week short trips one two days only never more than that but theres more norma said the koreans mark entry visas with a flight number but the numbers on richmans passport werent commercial flight numbers they were tail numbers he went on a private jet thats what it looks like a norton jet norma shook her head no i talked to alice in flight ops none of the company jets has been to korea in the last year theyve been shuttling back and forth from beijing for months but none to korea casey frowned theres more norma said i talked to the fizer in seoul hes an old beau of mine remember when marder had that dental emergency last month and took three days off yeah he and richman were together in seoul fizer heard about it after theyd gone and was annoyed to be kept out of the loop wasnt invited to any of the meetings they attended took it as a personal insult what meetings casey said nobody knows norma looked at her but be careful around that kid she was in her office going through the most recent pile of telexes when richman poked his head in whats next he said cheerfully somethings come up casey said i need you to go to the flight standards district office see dan greene over there and get copies of the flight plan and the crew list for tpa dont we already have that no we just have the preliminaries by now dan will have the finals i want them in time for the meeting tomorrow the office is in el segundo el segundo thatll take me the rest of the day i know but its important he hesitated i think i could be more help to you if i stayed here get going she said and call me when you have them video imaging systems pm the back room of video imaging systems in glendale was packed with row after row of humming computers the squat purplestriped boxes of silicon graphics indigo machines scott harmon his leg in a cast hobbled over the cables that snaked across the floor okay he said we should have it up in a second he led casey into one of the editing bays it was a mediumsize room with a comfortable couch along the back wall beneath movie posters the editing console wrapped around the other three walls of the room three monitors two oscilloscopes and several keyboards scott began punching the keys he waved her to a seat alongside him i whats the material he said home video plain vanilla high eight he was looking at an oscilloscope as he spoke thats what it looks like dolby encoded standard stuff i guess so okay according to this we got nineforty on a sixtyminute cassette the screen flickered and she saw mountain peaks shrouded in fog the camera panned to a young american man in his early thirties walking up a road carrying a small baby on his shoulder in the background was a village beige roofs bamboo on both sides of the road wheres this harmon said casey shrugged looks like china can you fastforward sure the images flicked quickly past streaked with static casey glimpsed a small house the front door open a kitchen black pots and pans an open suitcase on a bed a train station a woman climbing on the train busy traffic in what looked like hong kong an airport lounge at night the young man holding the baby on his knees the baby crying writhing then a gate tickets being taken by a flight attendant stop she said he punched buttons ran at normal speed this what you want yes she watched as the woman holding the baby walked down the ramp to the aircraft then there was a cut and the image showed the baby in the womans lap the camera panned up and showed the woman giving a theatrical yawn they were on the aircraft during the flight the cabin was lit by night lights windows in the background were black the steady whine of the jet engines no kidding casey said she recognized the woman she had interviewed in the hospital what was her name she had it in her notes beside her at the console harmon shifted his leg grunted thatll teach me he said whats that not to ski blackdiamond runs in chowder casey nodded kept her eyes on the video monitor the camera panned back to the sleeping baby again then blurred before turning black harmon said guy couldnt turn off the camera the next image showed glaring daylight the baby was sitting up smiling a hand came into the frame wiggling to get the babys attention the mans voice said sarah sarah smile for daddy smile the baby smiled and made a gurgling sound cute kid harmon said on the monitor the mans voice said how does it feel to be going to america sarah ready to see where your parents are from the baby gurgled and waved her hands in the air reaching for the camera the woman said something about everybody looking weird and the lens panned up to her the man said and what about you mom are you glad to be going home oh tim she said turning her head away please come on em what are you thinking the woman said well what i really wantwhat i have dreamed about for monthsis a cheeseburger with xuxiang hot bean sauce god no a cheeseburger she said with onions and tomatoes and lettuce and pickles and mayonnaise now the camera panned back down to the kid who was tugging her foot into her mouth slobbering over her toes taste good the man said laughing is that breakfast for you sarah not waiting for the stewardess on this flight abruptly the wife jerked her head around looking past the camera what was that she said in a worried tone take it easy em the man answered still laughing casey said stop the tape harmon hit a key the image froze on the wifes anxious expression run it back five seconds casey said the white frame counter appeared at the bottom of the screen the tape ran backward streaking jags again okay casey said now turn the sound up the baby sucked its toes the slobbering so loud it almost sounded like a waterfall the hum inside the cabin became a steady roar taste good the man said laughing very loudly his voice distorted is that breakfast for you sarah not waiting for the stewardess on this flight casey tried to listen between the mans sentences to hear the sounds of the cabin the soft murmur of other voices rustle of fabric moving the intermittent clink of knives and forks from the forward galley and now something else another sound the wifes head jerked around what was that damn casey said she couldnt be sure the roar of ambient cabin sound drowned out anything else she leaned forward straining to hear the mans voice broke in his laugh booming take it easy em the baby giggled again a sharp earsplitting noise casey was shaking her head in frustration was there a lowpitched rumble or not perhaps they should go back and try to hear it again she said can you put this through an audio filter the husband said were almost home honey oh my god harmon said staring at the tape on the monitor everything seemed to be crazy angles the baby slid forward on the mothers lap she grabbed at the kid clutched it to her chest the camera was shaking and twisting passengers in the background were yelling grabbing the armrests as the plane went into a steep descent then the camera twisted again and everybody seemed to sink in the seats the mother slumping down under the gforce her cheeks sagging shoulders falling baby crying then the man shouted what the hell and the wife rose into the air restrained only by the seat belt then the camera flew up in the air and there was an abrupt crunching sound after which the image began to spiral rapidly when the image became steady again it showed something white with lines before she could register what it was the camera moved and she saw an armrest from below fingers gripping the pad the camera had fallen in the aisle and was shooting straight up the screams continued my god harmon said again the video image began to slide gaining speed moving past seat after seat but it was going aft she realized the plane must be climbing again before she could get her bearings the camera lifted into the air weightless she thought the plane must have reached the end of the climb and now it was nosing over again for a moment of weightlessness before the image crashed down twisting and tumbling rapidly there was a thunkl and she glimpsed a blurred gaping mouth teeth then it was moving again and apparently landed on a seat a large shoe swung toward the lens kicked it the image spun rapidly settled again it was back in the aisle facing the rear of the plane the briefly steady image was horrifying arms and legs stuck out into the aisle from the rows of seats people were screaming clutching anything they could the camera immediately began to slide again this time forward the plane was in a dive the camera slid faster and faster banging into a midships bulkhead spinning so it was now facing forward it raced toward a body lying in the aisle an elderly chinese woman looked up in time for the camera to strike her in the forehead and then the camera flew into the air tumbling crazily and came down again there was a close view of something shiny like a belt buckle and then it was sliding forward once more into the forward compartment still going banging into a womans shoe in the aisle twisting racing forward it went into the forward galley where it lodged for a moment a wine bottle rolled across the floor banged into it and the camera spun several times then began to fall end over end the image flipping as the camera went all the way past the forward galley to the cockpit the cockpit door was open she had a brief glimpse of sky through the flight deck windows blue shoulders and a cap and then with a crash the camera came to rest giving a steady view of a uniform gray field after a moment she realized the camera had at this point lodged beneath the cockpit door right where casey had found it and it was taping the carpet there was nothing more to see just the gray blur of carpet but she could hear the alarms in the cockpit the electronic warnings and the voice reminders coming one after another airspeed airspeed and stall stall more electronic warnings excited voices shouting in chinese stop the tape she said harmon stopped it jesus christ he said she ran through the tape once more and then did it in slow motion but even in slow motion she realized much of the movement was an indistinguishable blur she kept saying i cant see i cant see whats happening harmon who had by now become accustomed to the sequence said i can do an enhanced frame analysis for you whats that i can use the computers to go in and interpolate frames where the movement is too fast interpolate the computer looks at the first frame and the frame following and generates an intermediate frame between the two its a pointmapping decision basically but it will slow down no she said i dont want anything added by the computers what else can you do i can double or triple the frames in fast segments it would give you a little jerkiness but at least youd be able to see here look he went to one segment where the camera was tumbling through the air then slowed it down now here all these frames are just a blurits camera movement not subject movementbut here see this one frame here you get a readable image it showed a view looking back down the aircraft passengers falling over the seats their arms and legs streaks from swift movement so thats a usable frame harmon said she saw what he was driving at even in rapid movement the camera was steady enough to create a useful image every dozen frames or so okay she said do it we can do more he said we can send it out and she shook her head under no circumstances does this tape leave this building she said okay i need you to run me two copies of this videotape she said and make sure you run it all the way to the end iaahangar pm the rams team was still swarming over the transpacific aircraft in hangar casey walked past to the next hangar in the line and went inside there working in near silence in the cavernous space mary ringers team was doing interior artifact analysis across the concrete floor strips of orange tape nearly three hundred feet long marked the interior walls of the transpacific n crosswise strips indicated the principal bulkheads parallel strips were placed for each row of seats here and there white flags stood in wooden blocks indicating various critical points six feet overhead still more strips had been pulled taut demarcating the ceiling and upper luggage compartments of the aircraft the total effect was a ghostly orange outline of the dimensions of the passenger cabin within this outline five women all psychologists and engineers moved carefully and quietly the women were placing articles of clothing carryon bags cameras childrens toys and other personal objects on the floor in some cases thin blue tape ran from the object to some other location indicating how the object had moved during the accident all around them on the hangar walls hung large blowup photographs of the interior taken on monday the iaa team worked in near silence thoughtfully referring to the photos and notes interior artifact analysis was rarely done it was a desperation effort seldom yielding useful information in the case of tpa ringers team had been brought in from the start because the large number of injuries carried with it the threat of litigation passengers literally would not know what happened to them assertions were often wild iaa attempted to make sense of the movement of people and objects within the cabin but it was a slow and difficult undertaking she saw mary ringer a heavyset grayhaired woman of fifty near the aft section of the plane mary she said where are we on cameras i figured youd want to know mary consulted her notes we found nineteen cameras thirteen still and six video of the thirteen still cameras five were broken the film exposed two others had no film the remaining six were developed and three had shots all taken before the incident but were using the pictures to try and place passengers because transpacific still hasnt provided a seating chart and videos uh lets see she consulted her notes sighing again six video cameras two with footage on board the aircraft none during the incident i heard about the video on television i dont know where that came from passenger must have carried it off at lax probably what about the flight data recorder we really need it to you and everybody else casey said im working on it she glanced around the aft compartment laid out by tape she saw the pilots cap lying on the concrete in the corner wasnt there a name in that cap yeah on the inside mary said its zen ching or something like that we got the label translated who translated it eileen han in marders office she reads and writes mandarin helps us out why i just had a question not important casey headed for the door casey mary said we need that flight recorder i know casey said i know she called norma who can translate chinese for me you mean besides eileen right besides her she felt she should keep this away from marders office let me see norma said how about ellen fong in accounting she used to work for the faa as a translator isnt her husband in structure with doherty yeah but ellens discreet you sure i know norma said in a certain tone bldg oaccounting pm she went to the accounting department in the basement of building arriving just before six she found ellen fong getting ready to go home ellen she said i need a favor sure ellen was a perpetually cheerful woman of forty a mother of three didnt you used to work for the faa as a translator a long time ago ellen said i need something translated casey you can get a much better translator id rather you do it she said this is confidential she handed ellen the tape i need the voices in the last nine minutes okay and id prefer you not mention this to anybody including bill that was her husband casey nodded is that a problem not at all she looked at the tape in her hand when tomorrow friday at the latest done ellen fong said nail pm casey took the second copy of the tape to the norton audio interpretation lab in the back of building nail was run by a former cia guy from omaha a paranoid electronics genius named jay ziegler who built his own audio filter boards and playback equipment because he said he didnt trust anyone to do it for him norton had constructed nail to help the government agencies interpret cockpit voice recorder tapes after an accident the government took cvrs and analyzed them in washington this was done to prevent them from being leaked to the press before an investigation was completed but although the agencies had experienced staff to transcribe the tapes they were less skilled at interpreting sounds inside the cockpitthe alarms and audio reminders that often went off these sounds represented proprietary norton systems so norton had built a facility to analyze them the heavy soundproof door as always was locked casey pounded on it and after a while a voice on the speaker said give the password its casey singleton jay give the password jay for christs sake open the door there was a click and silence she waited the thick door pushed open a crack she saw jay ziegler hair down to his shoulders wearing dark sunglasses he said oh all right come ahead singleton youre cleared for this station he opened the door a fraction wider and she squeezed past him into a darkened room ziegler immediately slammed the door shut threw three bolts in succession better if you call first singleton we have a secure line in fourlevel scramble encoded im sorry jay but somethings come up securitys everybodys business she handed him the spool of magnetic tape he glanced at it this is oneinch mag singleton we dont often see this at this station can you read it ziegler nodded can read anything singleton anything you throw at us he put the tape on a horizontal drum and threaded it then he glanced over his shoulder are you cleared for the contents of this its my tape jay just asking she said i should tell you that this tape is dont tell me anything singleton better that way on all the monitors in the room she saw oscilloscope squiggles green lines jumping against black as the tape began to play uh okay ziegler said we got higheight audio track dolby d encoded got to be a home video camera over the speaker she heard a rhythmic crunching sound ziegler stared at his monitors some of them were now generating fancy data building threedimensional models of the sound which looked like shimmering multicolored beads on a string the programs were also generating slices at various hertz footsteps ziegler announced rubbersoled feet on grass or dirt countryside no urban signature footsteps probably male and uh slight dysrhythmic hes probably carrying something not too heavy but consistently offbalance casey remembered the first image on the videotape a man walking up the path away from a chinese village with the child on his shoulder youre right she said impressed now there was a tweeting soundsome sort of birdcall hold on hold on ziegler said punching buttons the tweet replayed again and again the beads jumping on the string huh ziegler said finally not in the database foreign locale china oh well i cant do everything the footsteps continued there was the sound of wind on the tape a male voice said shes fallen asleep ziegler said american height fivenine to sixtwo mid thirties she nodded impressed again he pushed a button and one of the monitors showed the video image the man walking up the path the tape froze okay ziegler said so what am i doing here casey said the last nine minutes of tape were shot on flight this camera recorded the whole incident really ziegler said rubbing his hands together that should be interesting i want to know what you can tell me about unusual sounds in the moments just prior to the event i have a question about dont tell me he said holding up his hand i dont want to know i want to take a clean look when can you have something twenty hours ziegler looked at his watch tomorrow afternoon okay and jay id appreciate if youd keep this tape to yourself ziegler looked at her blankly what tape he said qa pm casey was back at her desk a little after pm there were more telexes waiting for her from s nieto fsr vanc to c singleton qairt fo zan ping at vanc gen hospital following complications from surgery reported unconscious but stable carrier rep mike lee was at the hospital today i will try to see fo tomorrow to verify his condition and interview him if possible norma she called remind me to call vancouver tomorrow morning ill make a note she said by the way you got this she handed casey a fax the single sheet appeared to be a page from an inflight magazine the top read employee of the month followed by an inky unreadable photograph underneath the photo was a caption captain john zhen chang senior pilot for transpacific airlines is our employee of the month captain changs father was a pilot and john himself has flown for twenty years seven of those with transpacific when not in the cockpit captain chang enjoys biking and golf here he relaxes on the beach at lantan island with his wife soon and his children erica and tom casey frowned whats this beats me norrna said whered it come from there was a phone number at the top of the page but no name a copy shop on la tijera norma said near the airport casey said yes its a busy place they had no idea who sent it casey stared at the photo its from an inflight magazine transpacifics but not this month they pulled the contents of the seat pocketsyou know passenger announcements safety cards barf bags monthly magazineand sent it over but that page isnt in the magazine can we get back copies im working on it she said id like to get a better look at this picture casey said i figured norma said she went back to the other papers on her desk from t korman prod support to c singleton qairt we have finalized the design parameters of the n virtual headsup display vhud for use by ground personnel at domestic and foreign repair stations the cdrom player now clips to the belt and the goggles have been reduced in weight the vhud allows maintenance personnel to scroll maintenance manuals a a including diagrams and parts cutaways preliminary articles will be distributed for comments tomorrow production will begin this virtual headsup display was part of nortons ongoing effort to help the customers improve maintenance airframe manufacturers had long recognized that the majority of operational problems were caused by bad maintenance in general a properly maintained commercial aircraft would run for decades some of the old norton ns were sixty years old and still in service on the other hand an improperly maintained aircraft could get in trouble or crash within minutes under financial pressure from deregulation the airlines were cutting personnel including maintenance personnel and they were shortening the turnaround time between cycles time on the ground had in some cases gone from two hours to less than twenty minutes all this put intense pressure on maintenance crews norton like boeing and douglas saw it as in their interest to help crews work more effectively that was why the virtual headsup display which projected the repair manuals on the inside of a set of glasses for maintenance people was so important she went on next she saw the weekly summary of parts failures compiled to enable the faa to track parts problems more carefully none of the failures in the previous week was serious an engine compressor stalled an engine eot indicator failed an oil filter clog light illuminated incorrectly a fuel heat indicator went on erroneously then there were more irt followup reports from past incidents product support checked all incident aircraft every two weeks for the next six months to make sure that the assessment of the incident review team had been accurate and that the aircraft was not experiencing further trouble then they issued a summary report like the one she now saw on her desk privileged information for internal use only report no irt todays date april model n incident date march operator jet atlantic fuselage no nfa reported by j ramones location ps portugal fsr reference a avnsvcadh subject it was reported that during takeoff roll the wheel not turning alert came on and the flight crew aborted the takeoff the nose landing gear nlg tires blew and there was a fire in the wheel well which was extinguished by fire trucks on the ground passengers and flight crew exited via evacuation slides no reported injuries inspection of the aircraft revealed the following damage both flaps sustained significant damage the number engine sustained heavy soot damage the inboard flap hinge fairing sustained minor damage the number wheel was flat spotted with approximately percent missing there was no damage to nlg axle or piston review of human factors revealed the following flight deck procedures require added carrier scrutiny foreign repair procedures require added carrier scrutiny the aircraft is in the process of being repaired internal procedures are being reviewed by the carrier david levine technical integration product support norton aircraft company burbankca summary reports were always diplomatic in this incident she knew ground maintenance had been so inept that the nose wheel locked on takeoff blowing the tires causing what was very nearly a serious incident but the report didnt say that you had to read between the lines the problem lay with the carrier but the carrier was also the customerand it was bad form to knock the customer eventually casey knew transpacific flight would end up summarized in an equally diplomatic report but there was much to do before then norma came back transpacifics office is closed ill have to find that magazine tomorrow okay hon what go home she sighed youre right norma and get some rest will you glendale pm her daughter had left a message saying she was having a sleepover at amys house and that dad said it was all right casey wasnt happy about it she thought her daughter shouldnt have sleepovers on school nights but there was nothing she could do now she got into bed pulled her daughters photograph on the bedside table over to look at it and then turned to her work she was going through the flight tapes of tpa checking the waypoint coordinates for each leg against the written radio transcripts from honolulu arinc and oakland center when the phone rang casey singleton hello casey john marder here she sat up in bed marder never called her at home she looked at the clock it was after pm marder cleared his throat i just got a call from benson in pr hes had a request from a network news crew to film inside the plant he turned them down uhhuh that was standard news crews were never allowed inside the plant then he got a call from a producer on that program newsline named malone she said newsline was making the request for plant access and insisted they be allowed in very pushy and full of herself he told her to forget it uhhuh he said he was nice about it uhhuh she was waiting this malone said newsline was doing a story on the n and she wanted to interview the president he told her hal was overseas and unavailable uhhuh then she suggested we reconsider her request because the newsline story was going to focus on flight safety concerns two problems in two days an engine problem and slats deployment several passengers killed she said shed spoken to criticsno names but i can guessand she wanted to give the president an opportunity to respond casey sighed marder said benson said he might be able to get her an interview with the president next week and she said no that wouldnt work newsline was running the story this weekend this weekend thats right marder said timing couldnt be worse the day before i leave for china its a very popular show the whole damned country will see it yes she said then the woman said she wanted to be fair that it always looked bad if the company didnt respond to allegations so if the president wasnt available to talk to newsline maybe some other highly placed spokesman would uhhuh so im seeing this twit in my office tomorrow at noon marder said on camera casey said no no background only no cameras but well cover the irt investigation so i think youd better be there of course apparently theyre going to do some terrible story on the n marder said its that damn cnn tape thats whats started it all but were in it now casey we have to handle this as best we can ill be there she said thursday airport marina am jennifer malone awoke to the soft insistent buzz of the bedside alarm she turned it off and looked over at the tanned shoulder of the man next to her and felt a burst of annoyance he was a stuntman on a tv series shed met him a few months back he had a craggy face and a nice muscular body and he knew how to perform but jeez she hated it when guys stayed over she had hinted politely after the second time but hed just rolled over and gone to sleep and now here he was snoring away jennifer hated to wake up with some guy in the room she hated everything about it the sounds they made breathing the smell coming off their skin their greasy hair on the pillow even the catches the celebrities who made her heart skip over candlelight looked like soggy beached whales the next day it was like the guys didnt know their place they came over they got what they wanted she got what she wanted everyone was happy so why didnt they go the fuck home shed called him from the plane hi im coming into town what are you doing tonight and he said without hesitation doing you which was fine with her it was sort of funny sitting in an airplane seat next to some accountant bent over his laptop the voice in her ear saying im doing you tonight in every room of your suite which to his credit he did not subtle this guy but he had lots of energy that pure california body energy that you never found in new york no reason to talk about anything just fuck but now sunlight streaming through the windows damn she got up from the bed feeling the cold airconditioned air on her naked skin and went to the closet to choose the clothes she would wear she was doing pretty straight types so she picked jeans a white agnes b tshirt and a navy jil sander jacket she carried them into the bathroom ran a shower while the water was getting warm she called the cameraman and told him to have the crew ready in the lobby in an hour while she took her shower she reviewed the coming day barker first at nine shed film him briefly with some aviation background to warm him up then break to do the rest at his office next the reporter rogers no time to do him at his newsroom in orange county shed start him at burbank another airport different look hed talk about norton with the norton buildings behind him then at noon shed talk to the norton guy by then shed already know the arguments from the other two guys and shed try to scare norton enough that theyd give her access to the president and then lets see the ambulance chaser later in the day briefly someone from the faa on friday for balance someone from norton on friday as well marty would do a standup outside norton the script wasnt prepared but all she needed was the intro and the rest was voiceover broll of passengers boarding going to their doom takeoffs and landings then some good crash shots and she was done this segment was going to work she thought as she stepped out of the shower there was only one thing that troubled her that damned guy in the bed why didnt he go home qa am as casey came into the qa offices norma glanced up at her then pointed down the hall casey frowned norma jerked her thumb he was here when i came in this morning she said been on the phone for an hour solid mr sleepyheads suddenly not so sleepy casey went down the hall as she came to richmans office she heard him say absolutely not we are very confident of how this will turn out no no im sure hasnt a clue no idea casey stuck her head in richman was leaning back in his chair with his feet up on the desk while he spoke on the phone he appeared startled when he saw her he put his hand over the phone ill just be a minute here fine she went back to her office shuffled through papers she didnt want him around it was time for another errand she thought good morning he said as he came in he was very cheerful big smile i got those faa documents you wanted i left them on your desk thank you she said today i need you to go to transpacifics main office transpacific isnt that at the airport actually i think theyre in downtown la norma will get you the address i need you to pick up back issues of their inflight magazine as far back as they go at least a year gee richman said couldnt we have a messenger do that this is urgent casey said but ill miss the irt youre not needed at the irt and i want these magazines as soon as possible inflight magazines what are they for he said bob she said just get them he gave a crooked smile youre not trying to get rid of me are you pick up the magazines get them to norma and call me war room am john marder was late he came striding into the room with an irritable distracted look and dropped into a seat all right he said lets have it where are we on flight flight recorder nothing yet casey said we need that datamake it happen casey structure well its very difficult very difficult indeed doherty said dolefully i still worry about that bad locking pin i think we ought to be more cautious doug marder said i already told you well check it at flight test now what about hydraulics hydraulics are fine cable rigging fine of course were at ambient have to cold soak to be sure okay well do that at right test electrical ron said weve scheduled the cycle electrical test beginning at pm running through the night if theres a problem well know in the morning any suspicions now just those proximity sensors in the right wing have we functioned them yes and they appear normal of course to really check them wed have to remove the sensors from the housings take them out of the wing and that means delaying everything marder said forget it powerplant zip kenny burne said engines are fine some seals on the cooling system were installed backward and we got a counterfeit reverser cowl but its nothing that would cause the accident okay powerplant is eliminated avionics trung said avionics check out within normal limits what about the autopilot the pilot fighting to override autopilot is fine i see marder looked around the room so we have nothing is that right seventytwo hours into this investigation and we have no damned idea what happened to flight is that what youre telling me there was silence around the table christ marder said disgusted he pounded the table dont you people understand i want this fucking thing solved sepulveda blvd am fred barker was solving all her problems to start jennifer needed a walktowork shot for martys voiceover intro we talked to frederick barker a former faa official now a controversial crusader for aircraft safety barker suggested a location on sepulveda with a sweeping view of the south runways of los angeles international airport it was perfect and he was careful to mention that no other film crew had used it before next she needed an atwork shot again for voiceover since leaving the faa barker has worked tirelessly to bring defective aircraft designs to the publics attention particularly the design of the norton n barker suggested a corner of his office where he placed himself in front of a bookshelf of thick faa documents at a desk heaped nigh with technicallooking pamphlets which he thumbed through for camera next she needed his basic spiel in the kind of detail that reardon wouldnt have time to bother with during the interview barker was ready for this too he knew where the switches were for the airconditioning the refrigerator the telephones and all the other noise sources theyd need to turn off for filming barker also had a video monitor ready to replay the cnn tape from flight while he commented on it the monitor was a studiograde trinitron placed in a dark corner of the room so they could get an image off it there was a vplug so they could take the feed directly to sync his audio comments and barker was running oneinch tape so image quality was excellent he even had a large model of the n aircraft with moving parts on the wing and tail that he could use to demonstrate what had gone wrong in flight the model sat on a stand on his desk so it didnt look like a prop and barker was dressed for the part informal shirtsleeves and tie reminiscent of an engineer an authoritative look barker was good on camera too he appeared relaxed he didnt use jargon his answers were short he seemed to understand how she would cut the tape together so he didnt lock her into anything for example he didnt reach for the model airplane in the middle of an answer instead he gave his answer then said at this point id like to refer to the model when she agreed he repeated the previous answer picking up the model at the same time everything he did was smooth with no fumbling or awkwardness of course barker was experienced not only on television but in the courtroom the only problem was that he didnt give her strong emotionno shock no outrage on the contrary his tone his manner his body language suggested profound regret it was unfortunate that this situation arose it was unfortunate that steps hadnt been taken to correct the problem it was unfortunate that authorities hadnt listened to him for all these years there have been eight previous problems with slats on the airplane he said he held the model up near his face turned it so that it didnt gleam in the crew lights these are the slats he said pulling out a sliding panel from the front of the wing he took his hand away and said you get that in closeup i was late the cameraman said could you do it again sure are you starting wide two ts the cameraman said barker nodded he paused then began again there have been eight previous problems with slats on this airplane again he held the model up this time already correctly turned so it didnt reflect in the light these are the slats he said and pulled out the panel in front of the wing then he paused again got it that time the cameraman said barker continued the slats are only deployed for takeoff and landing during flight they are tucked back in the wing but on the norton n the slats have been known to extend by themselves during flight its a design error another pause im going to demonstrate what happens now so you may want to be wide enough to see the whole plane widening the cameraman said barker waited patiently for a moment then said the consequence of this design error is that when the slats extend the airplane noses upward like this threatening to stall he tilted the model up slightly at this point it is almost impossible to control if the pilot tries to restore the plane to level flight the plane overcompensates and goes into a dive again the pilot corrects to come out of the dive the plane climbs then dives then climbs again that is what happened to flight that is why people died barker paused now were through with the model he said so im going to put it down okay jennifer said she had been watching barker on the monitor on the floor and now she was thinking that she might nave difficulty cutting from the wider shot to a shot of putting the model down what she really needed was a repetition of barker said the plane dives then climbs then dives again that is what happened to flight that is why people died with a regretful look he put the model down although he did it gently his very gesture seemed to suggest a crash jennifer had no illusions about what she was watching this wasnt an interview it was a performance but a skilled approach was not rare these days more and more interview subjects seemed to understand camera angles and editing sequences she had seen executives show up in full makeup for an interview at first television people had been alarmed by this new sophistication but lately theyd become used to it there was never enough time they were always rushing from one location to the next a prepared subject made their work so much easier but just because barker was smooth and camera savvy she wasnt going to let him get away without a little probing the final part of her job today was to cover the basic questions in case marty ran out of time or forgot to ask them she said mr barker yes he turned toward her check the look she said to the cameraman his look is wide move a little closer to camera jennifer slid her chair over so she was right beside the lens barker turned slightly to face her at her new position his look is fine now mr barker jennifer said you are a former faa employee i used to work for the faa barker said but i left the agency because i disagreed with their handsoff attitude toward manufacturers the norton plane is a result of those lax policies barker was again demonstrating his skill his answer was a complete statement he knew that he was more likely to get his comments on camera if they were not responses to a question jennifer said there is some controversy surrounding your departure i am familiar with some of the allegations about why i left the faa barker said again making a statement but the fact is my departure was an embarrassment to the agency i criticized the way they worked and when they refused to respond i left so im not surprised they are still trying to discredit me she said the faa claims you leaked materials to the press they say they fired you for that theres never been any proof of the allegations the faa has made about me i have never seen any faa official produce one shred of evidence to back their criticisms of me you work for bradley king the attorney i have served as an expert aviation witness on a number of legal cases i think its important that somebody with knowledge speak out you are paid by bradley king any expert witness is reimbursed for time and expenses thats standard procedure isnt it true that youre a fulltime employee of bradley king that your office everything in this room everything we see here is paid for by king i am funded by the nonprofit institute for aviation research in washington my job is to promote safety in civil aviation i do whatever i can to make the skies safe for travelers mr barker come on arent you an expert for hire i certainly have strong opinions about air safety its only natural that i would be hired by employers who share my concerns what is your opinion of the faa the faa is well intentioned but it has a dual mandate both to regulate air travel and to promote it the agency needs complete reform it is much too cozy with the manufacturers can you give me an example it was a feed she knew from previous conversations what he would say again barker made a statement one good example of this cozy relationship is the way the faa treats certification the documents required to certify a new airplane are not maintained by the faa but by the manufacturers themselves this hardly seems proper the fox is guarding the chicken coop is the faa doing a good job im afraid the faa is doing a very poor job american lives are needlessly put at risk frankly its time for a thorough overhaul otherwise i am afraid passengers will continue to die as they did on this norton aircraft he gesturedslowly so the camera could followto the model on his desk in my opinion he said what happened on that airplane is a disgrace the interview ended while her crew was packing up barker came over to her who else are you seeing jack rogers is next hes a good man and someone from norton she consulted her notes a john marder ah what does that mean well marder is a fasttalker hell give you a lot of doubletalk about airworthiness directives a lot of faa jargon but the fact is that he was the program manager on the n he supervised the development of that aircraft he knows theres a problemhes part of it outside norton after the practiced smoothness of barker the reporter jack rogers was a bit of a shock he showed up wearing a limegreen sport coat that screamed orange county and his checkpatterned tie jumped on the monitor he looked like a golf pro spruced up for a job interview jennifer said nothing at first she just thanked the reporter for coming and positioned him in front of the chainlink fence with norton aircraft in the background she went over her questions with him he gave tentative little answers excited eager to please gee its hot she said she turned to the cameraman how we coming george almost there she turned back to rogers the sound guy unbuttoned rogerss shirt threaded the microphone up to his collar as preparations continued rogers began to sweat jennifer called for the makeup girl to wipe him down he seemed relieved then pleading the heat she convinced rogers to remove his sport coat and sling it over his shoulder she said it would give him a workingjournalist look he gratefully agreed she suggested he loosen his tie which he did she went back to the cameraman how is it better without the jacket but that tie is a nightmare she returned to rogers smiled this is working so well she said how would it be if you take off the tie and roll up your sleeves oh i never do that rogers said i never roll up my sleeves it would give you that strong but casual look you know rolledup shirtsleeves ready to fight hardhitting journalist that idea i never roll up my sleeves she frowned never no i never do well its just a look were talking about here youd come off stronger on camera more emphatic more forceful im sorry she thought what is this most people would do anything to get on newsline theyd do the interview in their underwear if she asked them to several had and here was this fucking print journalist what did he make anyway thirty grand a year less than jennifers monthly expense account i uh cant rogers said because uh i have psoriasis no problem makeup standing with his jacket slung over his shoulder his tie removed shirtsleeves rolled up jack rogers answered her questions he rambled speaking thirty forty seconds at a time if she asked him the same question twice hoping for a shorter answer he just started to sweat and gave a longer answer they had to keep breaking for makeup to wipe him down she had to reassure him again and again that he was doing great just great that he was giving her really good stuff and he was but he couldnt punch it he didnt seem to understand she was making an assembled piece that the average shot would be less than three seconds and they would cut to him for a sentence or a fragment of a sentence before they cut to something else rogers was earnest trying to be helpful but he was burying her in detail she couldnt use and background she didnt care about finally she began to worry that she couldnt use any of the interview that she was wasting her time with this guy so she followed her usual procedure in a situation like this thats all perfect she said now were coming to the conclusion of the piece we need something punchyshe made a fistto close so ill ask you a series of questions and you answer them with one punchy sentence okay rogers said mr rogers could the n cost norton the china sale given the frequency of incidents involving im sorry she said i just need a simple sentence could the n cost norton the china sale yes it certainly could im sorry she said again jack i need a sentence like the n might very well cost norton the china sale oh okay he swallowed could the n cost norton the china sale yes im afraid i have to say that it might cost the china sale jesus she thought jack i need you to say norton in the sentence otherwise we wont know what youre referring to oh go ahead the n might very well cost norton the china sale in my opinion she sighed it was dry no emotional force he might as well be talking about his phone bill but she was running out of time excellent jennifer said very good lets go on tell me is norton a troubled company absolutely he said nodding and swallowing she sighed jack oh sorry he took a breath then standing there he said i think that wait a minute she said put your weight on your forward foot so youre leaning in toward camera like this he shifted his body weight turned slightly yeah thats it perfect now go ahead standing there in front of the fence outside norton aircraft with his jacket slung over his shoulder and his shirtsleeves rolled up reporter jack rogers said i think theres no doubt that norton aircraft is a company in serious trouble then he paused he looked at her jennifer smiled thank you very much she said you were great norton administration am casey came into john marders office a few minutes before noon and found him smoothing his tie shooting his cuffs i thought we would sit here he said pointing to a coffee table with chairs in the corner of his office you all set for this i think so casey said just let me take it at the beginning marder said ill turn to you for assistance if i need it okay maider continued to pace security says there was a film crew out by the south fence he said they were doing an interview with jack rogers uhhuh casey said that idiot christ i can imagine what he had to say did you ever talk to rogers casey said the intercom buzzed eileen said ms malone is here mr marder send her in marder said and he strode to the door to greet her casey was shocked by the woman who walked in jennifer malone was a kid hardly older than richman she couldnt be more than twentyeight or nine casey thought malone was blond and quite prettyin an uptight new york sort of way she had short bobbed hair that downplayed her sexuality and she was dressed very casually jeans and a white tshirt and a blue blazer with a weird collar the trendy hollywood look casey felt uncomfortable just looking at her but now marder had turned and was saying ms malone id like to introduce casey singleton our quality assurance specialist on the incident review team the blond kid smirked casey shook her hand you got to be kidding jennifer malone thought this is a captain of industry this jumpy guy with slicked back hair and a bad suit and who was this woman out of a talbots catalog singleton was taller than jenniferwhich jennifer resented and goodlooking in a wholesome midwestern way she looked like an athlete and she seemed to be in pretty good shapealthough she was long past the age where she could get by with the minimal makeup she wore and her features were strained tense under pressure jennifer felt disappointed she had been preparing for this meeting all day honing her arguments but she had imagined a much more commanding adversary instead she was back in high schoolwith the assistant principal and the timid librarian little people with no style and this office small with gray walls and cheap utilitarian furniture it had no character it was just as well she wasnt filming here because this room wouldnt photograph did the presidents office look like this too if so they would have to tape his interview somewhere else outside or on the assembly line because these shabby little offices just didnt work for the show airplanes were big and powerful the audience wouldnt believe that they were made by crummy little people in drab offices marder led her to a seating arrangement to one side he gestured grandly as if he were taking her to a banquet since he gave her a choice of where to sit she took a chair with her back to the window so the sun would be in their eyes she got out her notes shuffled through them marder said would you like something to drink coffee coffee would be great how do you take it black jennifer said casey watched as jennifer malone set out her notes ill be frank malone said weve gotten some damning material on the n from critics and on the way this company operates but there are two sides to every story we want to make sure we include your response to the criticism marder said nothing just nodded he was sitting with his legs crossed a notepad on his lap to begin malone said we know what happened on the transpacific flight really casey thought because we dont malone said the slats came outdeployedin midair and the airplane became unstable went up and down killing passengers everyone has seen the film of that tragic accident we know passengers have filed lawsuits against the company we also know the n has a long history of slats problems which neither the faa nor the company has been willing to deal with this despite nine separate incidents in recent years malone paused for a moment then went on we know that the faa is so lax in its regulatory policies that it doesnt even require certification documents to be submitted the faa has allowed norton to keep the certification documents here jesus casey thought she doesnt understand anything let me dispose of your last point first marder said the faa doesnt have physical possession of certification documents from any manufacturer not boeing not douglas not airbus not us frankly wed prefer the faa do the warehousing but the faa cant store them because the documents contain proprietary information if they were in possession of the faa our competitors could obtain this information under the freedom of information act some of our competitors would like nothing better airbus in particular has been lobbying for a change in faa policyfor the reasons ive just explained so i presume you got this idea about the faa from someone at airbus casey saw malone hesitate glance down at her papers it was true she thought marder had nailed her source airbus had fed her that tidbit probably through its publicity arm the institute for aviation research did malone realize the institute was an airbus front but dont you agree malone said coolly that the arrangement is a little too cozy if the faa lets norton store its own documents ms malone marder said ive already told you wed prefer the faa do the storage but we didnt write the freedom of information act we dont make the laws we do think that if we spend billions of dollars developing a proprietary design it should not be made available free of charge to our competitors as i understand it foia wasnt enacted to enable foreign competitors to pillage american technology so you oppose the freedom of information act not at all im simply saying that it was never designed to facilitate industrial espionage marder shifted in his chair now you mentioned flight yes first of all we dont agree that the accident was the result of slats deployment uhoh casey thought marder was going out on a limb what he was saying wasnt true and it might very well marder said were currently investigating this situation and although its premature for me to discuss the findings of our inquiry i believe you have been misinformed on the situation i presume youve gotten this slats information from fred barker we are talking to mr barker among others have you spoken to the faa about mr barker marder said we know hes controversial to put it mildly lets just say he adopts an advocacy position that is factually incorrect you believe it is incorrect no ms malone it is factually incorrect marder said testily he pointed to the papers malone had spread out on the table i couldnt help noticing your list of slats incidents did you get that from barker malone hesitated a fraction yes may i see it sure she handed the paper to marder he glanced at it malone said is it factually incorrect mr marder no but its incomplete and misleading this list is based on our own documents but it is incomplete do you know about airworthiness directives ms malone airworthiness directives marder got up went to his desk every time there is an inflight incident involving our aircraft we review the incident thoroughly to find out what happened and why if theres a problem with the aircraft we issue a service bulletin if the faa feels compliance with our bulletin should be mandatory it then issues an airworthiness directive after the n went into active service we discovered a slats problem and an airworthiness directive was issued to correct the problem domestic carriers are required by law to fix the airplanes to prevent further occurrences he came back with another sheet of paper which he handed to malone this is a complete list of incidents slats events of norton n january do slats deployed at fl at mach the flapslat handle moved inadvertently april do slats deployed while the airplane was in cruise at mach a clipboard reportedly fell on the flapslat handle july do initially reported as severe turbulence it was later learned that the slats had extended as a result of inadvertent flapslat handle movement december do slats extended in cruise flight without movement of the flapslat handle in cockpit confirmed slat cable rigging was out of tolerance in three places ad was issued as a result of march fo airplane entered a prestall buffet at mach the slats were found to be extended and the handle was not in the up and locked position april fo first officer rested his arm on the flapslat handle as he was operating the autopilot and the action moved the handle down extending the slats july fo pilot reported the flapslat handle moved and slats extended aircraft was in cruise flight at mach june fo the slats extended while the airplane was in cruise flight without movement of the flapslat handle confirmed slat cable rigging was out of tolerance the underlined sentences marder said are what mr barker omitted from the document he gave you after the first slats incident the faa issued an airworthiness directive to change cockpit controls the airlines had a year to comply some did it immediately others didnt as you can see the subsequent incidents all occurred in aircraft which had not yet made the change well not quite please let me finish in december of we discovered a second issue the cables running to the slats sometimes became slack maintenance crews werent catching the problem so we issued a second service bulletin and added a tension measurement device so ground crews could check more easily whether cable rigging was within spec that solved it by december everything was resolved clearly not mr marder malone said pointing to the list you have more incidents in and in only on foreign carriers marder said you see that notation do and fo that stands for domestic operator or foreign operator the domestic operators must make the changes called for in the faa airworthiness directives but foreign operators arent under faa jurisdiction and they dont always make the changes since all incidents have involved foreign carriers that hadnt made the retrofits malone scanned the list so you knowingly allow carriers to fly unsafe airplanes you just sit back and let it happen is that what youre telling me marder sucked in his breath casey thought he was going to blow but he didnt ms malone we build airplanes we dont operate them if air indonesia or pakistani air wont follow the airworthiness directives we cant force them to all right if all you do is build airplanes lets talk about how well you do that malone said looking at this list here you had how many design changes on the slats eight casey thought she doesnt understand shes not listening she doesnt get what shes being told no two retrofits marder said but there are eight incidents here youd agree to that yes marder said irritably but were not talking about incidents were talking about ads and there are only two ads he was getting angry his face flushed i see malone said so norton had two design problems on the slats for this aircraft there were two corrections two corrections of your original erroneous design malone said and thats just for slats we havent gotten to the flaps or the rudder or the fuel tanks and the rest of the airplane just in this one tiny system two corrections didnt you test this aircraft before you sold it to unsuspecting customers of course we tested it marder said through clenched teeth but you have to realize what i realize malone said is that people have died because of your design errors mr marder that plane is a deathtrap and you dont seem to care about that at all oh for christs fucking sake marder threw up his hands and jumped out of his seat he stomped around the room i cant fucking believe this it was almost too easy jennifer thought in fact it was too easy she was suspicious of marders histrionic outburst during the interview shed formed a different impression of this man he wasnt the assistant principal he was much smarter than that she realized it from watching his eyes most people made an involuntary eye movement when asked a question they looked up down or sideways but marders gaze was steady calm he was completely in control and she suspected he was in control now deliberately losing his temper why she didnt really care her goal from the beginning had been to blow these people out to make them worried enough to pass her on to the president jennifer wanted marty reardon to interview the president this was vital to her story it would undermine the segment if newsline made serious charges against the n and the company fielded a middlelevel flunky or a press nerd to respond but if she could get the president on camera her whole segment attained a new level of credibility she wanted the president things were going well marder said you explain it casey casey had been appalled by marders explosion marder was famously bad tempered but it was a major tactical error to blow up in front of a reporter and now still red faced and huffing behind his desk marder said you explain it casey she turned to face malone ms malone casey said i think everyone here is deeply committed to flight safety she hoped that would explain marders outburst were committed to product safety and the n has an excellent safety record and if something does go wrong with one of our planes something did go wrong malone said looking evenly at casey yes casey said and were investigating that incident now im on the team conducting that investigation and we are working around the clock to understand what happened you mean why the slats extended but you must know its happened so many times before casey said at this point listen marder said breaking in it wasnt the damn slats frederick barker is a hopeless alcoholic and a paid liar who works for a sleazebag lawyer no one in his right mind would listen to him casey bit her lip she couldnt contradict marder in front of the reporter but malone said if it wasnt the slats it wasnt the slats marder said firmly well issue a preliminary report in the next twentyfour hours that will conclusively demonstrate that casey thought what what was he saying there was no such thing as a preliminary report really malone said softly thats right marder said casey singletons the press liaison on the irt well be getting back to you ms malone malone seemed to realize that marder was terminating the interview she said but theres much more we need to go over mr marder there is also the miami rotor burst and union opposition to the china sale oh come on marder said given the seriousness of these charges she continued i think that you may want to consider our offer to give your president mr edgarton an opportunity to respond thats not going to happen marder said its for your own benefit malone said if we have to say that the president refused to talk to us that sounds look marder said lets cut the crap without transpacific you have no story and we are going to issue a preliminary report on transpacific tomorrow youll be informed when thats all we have for the moment ms malone thank you for coming by the interview was over norton administration pm i cant believe that woman marder said after malone had gone she isnt interested in the facts she isnt interested in the faa she isnt interested in how we build airplanes shes just doing a hatchet job is she working for airbus thats what i want to know john casey said about the preliminary finding forget it marder snapped ill deal with it you go back to work ill talk to the tenth floor get some input arrange a few things well talk later today but john casey said you told her it wasnt the slats its my problem marder said you go back to work when casey was gone marder called edgarton my flights in an hour edgarton said im going to hong kong to show my concern for the families of the deceased by personally visiting them talk to the carrier express my sympathies to the relatives good idea hal marder said where are we on this press thing well its as i suspected marder said newsline is putting together a story thats extremely critical of the n can you stop it absolutely no question marder said how edgarton said well issue a preliminary report that it wasnt slats our preliminary will say the accident was caused by a counterfeit cowl on the thrust reversers is there a bad cowl on the plane yes but it didnt cause the accident thats fine edgarton said a bad part is fine just so its not a norton problem right marder said and the girls going to say that yes marder said she better edgarton said because it can be tricky talking to these pricks reardon marder said its marty reardon whatever she knows what to say yes youve briefed her yes and ill go over it with her again later okay edgarton said i also want her to see that media training woman i dont know hal do you really think yes i do edgarton said cutting in and so do you singleton should be fully prepared for the interview okay marder said just remember edgarton said you fuck this up youre dead he hung up outside norton administration pm outside the administration building jennifer malone got into her car more distressed than she cared to admit she now felt it was unlikely the company would produce the president and she was worriedshe had the feelingthat they might make singleton their spokesperson that could alter the emotional tenor of the segment the audience wanted to see beefy arrogant captains of industry get their just deserts an intelligent earnest attractive woman wouldnt play nearly as well were they smart enough to know that and of course marty would attack her that wouldnt look so good either just imagining the two of them together gave jennifer the shivers singleton was bright with an appealing open quality martyd be attacking motherhood and apple pie and you couldnt hold marty back hed go for the throat but beyond that jennifer was starting to worry that the entire segment was weak barker had been so convincing when she interviewed him she had felt elated afterward but if these ads were for real then the company was on solid ground and she worried about barkers record if the faa had the goods on him then his credibility was shot theyd look foolish giving him airtime the reporter jack whatshisname was disappointing he didnt play well on camera and his material was thin because in the end nobody gave a damn about drugs on the factory floor every company in america had drug problems that wasnt news and it didnt prove the airplane was badwhich was what she needed she needed vivid persuasive visuals to demonstrate that airplane was a deathtrap she didnt have them so far all she had was the cnn tape which was old news and the miami rotor burst which was not very compelling visually smoke coming out from a wing big deal worst of all if the company really was going to issue a preliminary finding that contradicted barker her cell phone rang speak to me dick shenk said hi dick she said so where are we shenk said im looking at the board right now marty finishes with bill gates in two hours some part of her wanted to say forget it the storys flaky it isnt coming together i was dumb to think i could nail it in two days jennifer do i send him or not but she couldnt say no she couldnt admit she had been wrong hed kill her if she backed off the story now everything about the way she had made her proposal and the cool way she had walked out of his office forced her hand now there was only one possible answer yes dick i want him youll have the piece for saturday yes dick and its not a parts story no dick because i dont want sloppy seconds on minutes jennifer it better not be a parts story its not dick i dont hear confidence he said im confident dick im just tired okay marty leaves seattle at four hell be at the hotel about eight have the shoot schedule ready when he arrives and fax me a copy at home youve got him all tomorrow okay dick nail it babe he said and hung up she flipped the phone shut and sighed she turned on the ignition and put the car in reverse casey saw malone backing out of the parking lot she was driving a black lexus the same car jim drove malone didnt see her which was just as well casey had a lot on her mind she was still trying to figure out what marder was doing he had blown up at the reporter told her it wasnt a slats incident and told her there was going to be a preliminary finding from the irt how could he say that marder had bravado to spare but this time he was digging a hole she didnt understand how his behavior could do anything but damage the companyand himself and john marder she knew never damaged himself qa pm norma listened to casey for several minutes without interruption finally she said and whats your question i think marders going to make me the spokesman for the company par for the course norma said the big guys always run for cover edgarton will never do it and marder wont either youre the press liaison for the irt and youre a vicepresident of norton aircraft thats what it will say at the bottom of the screen casey was silent norma looked at her whats your question she said again marder told the reporter that tpa wasnt a slats problem she said and that we were going to have a preliminary report by tomorrow hrnmm its not true hmmm why is marder doing this casey said why did he set me up for this saving his skin norma said probably avoiding a problem he knows about and you dont what problem norma shook her head my guess is something about the plane marder was program manager on the n he knows more about that aircraft than any other person in the company there may be something he doesnt want to come out so he announces a phony finding thats my guess and im the one carrying the water looks like it norma said casey was silent what should i do figure it out norma said squinting through the smoke of her cigarette theres no time norma shrugged find out what happened to that flight because your tail is on the line honey thats how marders set it up walking down the hall she saw richman well hi later she said she went into her office and shut the door she picked up a photograph of her daughter and stared at it in the picture allison had just emerged from a neighbors swimming pool she stood with another girl her age both of them in swimming suits dripping water sleek young bodies smiling gaptoothed faces carefree and innocent casey pushed the picture aside turned to a large box on her desk opening it she removed a black portable cd player with a neoprene sling there were wires that ran to a strange pair of goggles they were oversize and looked like safety goggles except they didnt wrap around and there was a funny coating on the inside of the lenses sort of shimmery in the light this she knew was the maintenance headsup display a card from tom korman fell out of the box it said first test of vhud enjoy enjoy she pushed the goggles aside looked at the other papers on her desk the cvr transcript of cockpit communications had finally come in she also saw a copy of transpacific flightlines there was a postit on one page she flipped it open to the picture of john chang employee of the month the picture was not what she had imagined from the fax john chang was a very fit man in his forties his wife stood beside him heavier smiling and the children crouched at the parents feet were fully grown a girl in her late teens and a boy in his early twenties the son resembled his father except he was a little more contemporary he had extremely closely cropped hair a tiny gold stud in his ear she looked at the caption here he relaxes on the beach at lantan island with his wife soon and his children erica and tom in front of the family a blue towel was spread across the sand nearby a wicker picnic basket with bluechecked cloth peeking out the scene was mundane and uninteresting why would anyone fax this to her she looked at the date on the magazine january three months ago but someone had had a copy of that magazine and had faxed it to casey who an employee of the airline a passenger who and why what was it supposed to tell her as casey looked at the magazine picture she was reminded of the unresolved threads of the investigation there was a great deal of checking still to do and she might as well get started norma was right casey didnt know what marder was up to but maybe it didnt matter because her job was still the same as it had always been to find out what happened to flight she came out of the office wheres richman norma smiled i sent him over to media relations to see benson pick up some standard press packets in case we need them bensons got to be pissed off about this casey said uhhuh norma said might even give mr richman a hard time she smiled looked at her watch but id say youve got an hour or so to do what you want so get going nail pm so singleton ziegler said waving her to a seat after five minutes of pounding on the soundproof door she had been admitted to the audio lab i believe we found what you were looking for ziegler said on the monitor in front of her she saw a freezeframe of the smiling baby sitting on the mothers lap you wanted the period just prior to the incident ziegler said here were approximately eighteen seconds prior ill start with full audio and then cut in the filters ready yes she said ziegler ran the tape at high volume the babys slobbering was like a bubbling brook the hum inside the cabin was a constant roar taste good the mans voice said to the baby very loudly cutting in ziegler said highend bypass the sound got duller cabin ambient bypass the slobbering was suddenly loud against a silent background the cabin roar gone high deltav bypass the slobbering was diminished what she heard now were mostly background soundssilverware clinking fabric movement the man said isatakfastor youarah his voice cut in and out deltav bypass is no good for human speech ziegler said but you dont care right no casey said the man said notailingorewardessonis ightr when the man finished the screen became almost silent again just a few distant noises now ziegler said it starts a counter appeared on the screen the timer ran forward red numerals flickering fast counting tenths and hundredths of a second the wife jerked her head around whatwaat damn casey said she could hear it now a low rumble a definite shuddering bass sound its been thinned by the bypass ziegler said deep low rumble down in the two to five hertz range almost a vibration no question casey thought with the filters in place she could hear it it was there the mans voice broke in a booming laugh ake it easyem the baby giggled again a sharp earsplitting crackle the husband saidostomeoney the lowpitched rumbling ended stop casey said the red numerals froze the numbers were big on the screen nearly twelve seconds she thought and twelve seconds was the time it took for the slats to fully deploy the slats had deployed on flight by now the tape was showing the steep descent the baby sliding on the mothers lap the mother clutching it her panicked face the passengers anxious in the background with the filters in place all their shouts produced unusual clippedoff noise almost like static ziegler stopped the tape theres your data singleton unequivocal id say the slats deployed sure sounds like it its a fairly unique signature why the aircraft was in cruise flight why would they deploy was it uncommanded or had the pilot done it casey wished again for the flight data recorder all these questions could be answered in a few minutes if they just had the data from the fdr but it was going very slowly did you look at the rest of the tape well the next point of interest is the cockpit alarms ziegler said once the camera jams in the door i can listen to the audio and assemble a sequence of what the aircraft was telling the pilot but thatll take me another day stay with it she said i want everything you can give me then her beeper went off she pulled it off her belt looked at it jm admin asap btoya john marder wanted to see her in his office now norton administration pm john marder was in his calm moodthe dangerous one just a short interview he said ten fifteen minutes at most you wont have time to go into specifics but as the head of the irt youre in the perfect position to explain the companys commitment to safety how carefully we review accidents our commitment to product support then you can explain that our preliminary report shows the accident was caused by a counterfeit thruster cowl installed at a foreign repair station so it could not have been a slats event and blow barker out of the water blow newsline out of the water john she said i just came from audio theres no questionthe slats deployed well audios circumstantial at best marder said zieglers a nut we have to wait for the flight data recorder to know precisely what happened meanwhile the irt has made a preliminary finding which excludes slats as if hearing her own voice from a distance she said john im uncomfortable with this were talking about the future casey i understand but the china sale will save the company cash flow stretch development new aircraft bright future thats what were talking about here casey thousands of jobs i understand john but let me ask you something casey do you think theres anything wrong with the n absolutely not you think its a deathtrap no what about the company think its a good company of course he stared at her shaking his head finally he said theres someone i want you to talk to edward fuller was the head of norton legal he was a thin ungainly man of forty he sat uneasily in the chair in marders office edward marder said we have a problem newsline is going to run a story on the n this weekend on primetime television and it is going to be highly unfavorable how unfavorable theyre calling the n a deathtrap oh dear fuller said thats very unfortunate yes it is marder said i brought you in because i want to know what i can do about it do about it fuller said frowning yes marder said we feel newsline is being crudely sensationalistic we regard their story as uninformed and prejudicial to our product we believe they are deliberately and recklessly defaming us i see so marder said what can we do can we prevent them from running the story no can we get a court injunction barring them no thats prior restraint and from a publicity standpoint its ill advised you mean itd look bad an attempt to muzzle the press violate the first amendment that would suggest you have something to hide in other words marder said they can run the story and we are powerless to stop them yes okay but i think newslines information is inaccurate and biased can we demand they give equal time to our evidence no fuller said the fairness doctrine which included the equaltime provision was scrapped under reagan television news programs are under no obligation to present all sides of an issue so they can say anything they want no matter how unbalanced thats right that doesnt seem proper its the law fuller said with a shrug okay marder said now this program is going to air at a very sensitive moment for our company adverse publicity may very well cost us the china sale yes it might suppose we lost business as a result of their show if we can demonstrate that newsline presented an erroneous view and we told them it was erroneouscan we sue them for damages as a practical matter no we would probably have to show they proceeded with reckless disregard for the facts known to them historically that has been extremely difficult to prove so newsline is not liable for damages no they can say whatever they want and if they put us out of business its our tough luck thats correct is there any restraint at all on what they say well fuller shifted in the chair if they falsely portrayed the company they might be liable but in this instance we have a lawsuit brought by an attorney for a passenger on so newsline is able to say theyre just reporting the facts that an attorney has made the following accusations about us i understand marder said but a claim filed in a court has limited publicity newsline is going to present these crazy claims to forty million viewers and at the same time theyll automatically validate the claims simply by repeating them on television the damage to us comes from their exposure not from the original claims i take your point fuller said but the law doesnt see it that way newsline has the right to report a lawsuit newsline has no responsibility to independently assess the legal claims being made no matter how outrageous if the lawyer said for example that we employed child molesters newsline could still report that with no liability to themselves correct lets say we go to trial and win its clear that newsline presented an erroneous view of our product based on the attorneys allegations which have been thrown out of court is newsline obligated to retract the statements they made to forty million viewers no they have no such obligation why not newsline can decide whats newsworthy if they think the outcome of the trial is not newsworthy they dont have to report it its their call and meanwhile the company is bankrupt marder said thirty thousand employees lose their jobs houses health benefits and start new careers at burger king and another fifty thousand lose their jobs when our suppliers go belly up in georgia ohio texas and connecticut all those fine people whove devoted their lives working to design build and support the best airframe in the business get a firm handshake and a swift kick in the butt is that how it works fuller shrugged thats how the system works yes id say the system sucks the system is the system fuller said marder glanced at casey then turned back to fuller now ed he said this situation sounds very lopsided we make a superb product and all the objective measures of its performance demonstrate that its safe and reliable weve spent years developing and testing it weve got an irrefutable track record but youre saying a television crew can come in hang around a day or two and trash our product on national tv and when they do they have no responsibility for their acts and we have no way to recover damages fuller nodded pretty lopsided marder said fuller cleared his throat well it wasnt always that way but for the last thirty years since sullivan in the first amendment has been invoked in defamation cases now the press has a lot more breathing room including room for abuse marder said fuller shrugged press abuse is an old complaint he said just a few years after the first amendment was passed thomas jefferson complained about how inaccurate the press was how unfair but ed marder said were not talking about two hundred years ago and were not talking about a few nasty editorials in colonial newspapers were talking about a television show with compelling images that goes instantaneously to forty fifty million peoplea sizable percentage of the whole countryand murders our reputation murders it unjustifiably thats the situation were talking about here so marder said what do you advise us to do ed well fuller cleared his throat again i always advise my clients to tell the truth thats fine ed thats sound counsel but what do we dot it would be best he said if you were prepared to explain what occurred on flight it happened four days ago we dont have a finding yet fuller said it would be best if you did after fuller had left marder turned to casey he didnt say anything he just looked at her casey stood there for a moment she understood what marder and the lawyer were doing it had been a very effective performance but the lawyer was also right she thought it would be best if they could tell the truth and explain the flight as she listened to him she had begun to think that somehow she might find a way to tell the truthor enough of the truthto make this work there were enough loose ends enough uncertainties that she might pull them together to form a coherent story all right john she said ill do the interview excellent marder said smiling and rubbing his hands together i knew youd do the right thing casey newsline has scheduled a slot at four pm tomorrow meantime i want you to work briefly with a media consultant someone from outside the company john she said ill do it my way shes a very nice woman and im sorry casey said i dont have time she can help you casey give you a few pointers john she said i have work to do and she left the room digital data center pm she had not promised to say what marder wanted her to say she had only promised to do the interview she had less than twentyfour hours to make significant progress in the investigation she was not so foolish as to imagine she could determine what had happened in that time but she could find something to tell the reporter there were still many dangling leads the possible problem with the locking pin the possible problem with the proximity sensor the possible interview with the first officer in vancouver the videotape at video imaging the translation ellen fong was doing the fact that the slats had deployed but had been stowed immediately afterwardwhat exactly did that mean still so much to check i know you need the data rob wong said spinning in his chair i know believe me he was in the digital display room in front of the screens filled with data but what do you expect me to do rob casey said the slats deployed i have to know whyand what else happened on the flight i cant figure it out without the flight recorder data in that case wong said you better face the facts weve been recalibrating all the one hundred and twenty hours of data the first ninetyseven hours are okay the last twentythree hours are anomalous im only interested in the last three hours i understand wong said but to recalibrate those three hours we have to go back to where the bus blew and work forward we have to calibrate twentythree hours of data and its taking us about two minutes a frame to recalibrate she frowned what are you telling me but she was already calculating it in her head two minutes a frame means itll take us sixtyfive weeks thats more than a year working twentyfour hours a day real world itd take us three years to generate the data rob we need this now it just cant be done casey youre going to have to work this without the fdr im sorry casey thats the way it is she called accounting is ellen fong there she didnt come in today she said she was working at home do you have her number sure the woman said but she wont be there she had to go to a formal dinner some charity thing with her husband tell her i called casey said she called video imaging in glendale the company that was working on the videotape for her she asked for scott harmon scotts gone for the day hell be in at nine tomorrow morning she called steve nieto the fizer in vancouver and got his secretary steves not here she said he had to leave early but i know he wanted to talk to you he said he had bad news casey sighed that seemed to be the only kind of news she was getting can you reach him not until tomorrow tell him i called her cell phone rang jesus that benson is unpleasant richman said whats his problem i thought he was going to hit me where are your at the office want me to come to you no casey said its after six youre done for today but see you tomorrow bob she hung up on the way out of hangar she saw the electrical crews rigging tpa for the cet that night the entire aircraft had been raised ten feet into the air and now rested on heavy blue metal fixtures beneath each wing and fore and aft on the fuselage the crews had then slung black safety webbing beneath the underside of the aircraft some twenty feet above the ground all along the fuselage doors and accessory panels were open and electricians standing on the webbing were running cables from the junction boxes back to the main cet test console a sixfoot square box that was placed in the center of the floor to one side of the aircraft the cycle electrical test as it was known consisted of sending electrical impulses to all parts of the aircrafts electrical system in rapid succession every component was testedeverything from cabin lights to reading lights cockpit display panels engine ignition and landinggear wheels the full test cycle ran two hours it would be repeated a dozen times throughout the night as she passed the console she saw teddy rawley he gave her a wave but didnt approach her he was busy undoubtedly hed heard that flight test was scheduled three days from now and he would want to be sure the electrical test was performed correctly she waved to teddy but he had already turned away casey headed back to her office outside it was growing dark the sky a deep blue she walked back toward administration hearing the distant rush of takeoffs from burbank airport on the way she saw amos peters shuffling toward his car carrying a stack of papers under his arm he looked back and saw her hey casey hi amos he dropped his papers with a thud on the roof of his car bent to unlock the door i hear theyre putting the screws to you yeah she was not surprised he knew the whole plant probably knew by now it was one of the first things she had learned at norton everyone knew everything minutes after it happened you going to do the interview i said i would you going to say what they want you to say she shrugged dont get high and mighty he said these are television people theyre beneath pond scum on the evolutionary scale just lie hell with it well see he sighed youre old enough to know how it works he said you going home now not for a while i wouldnt be hanging around the plant at night casey why not people are upset amos said next few days itd be better to go home early you know what i mean ill bear it in mind do that casey i mean it he got in his car and drove off qa pm norma was gone the qa office was deserted the cleaning crews had already started in the back offices she heard a tinny portable radio playing run baby run casey went to the coffeemaker poured a cup of cold coffee and took it into her own office she flicked on the lights stared at the stack of papers waiting on her desk she sat down and tried not to be discouraged by the way things were going she had twenty hours until the interview and her leads were falling apart just lie hell with it she sighed maybe amos was right she stared at the papers pushing aside the picture of john chang and his smiling family she didnt know what to do except go through the papers and check she again came to the charts of the flight plan again they teased her she remembered she had had an idea just before marder called her the night before she had a feeling but what was it whatever it was it was gone now she set the flight plan aside including the general declaration outwardinward that had been filed with it which listed the crew john zhen chang captain m leu zan ping first officer m richard yong first officer m gerhard reimann first officer m thomas chang first officer m henri marchand engineer m robert sheng engineer m harriet chang flight attendant f linda ching flight attendant f nancy morley flight attendant f kay liang flight attendant f john white flight attendant m m v chang flight attendant f sha van hao flight attendant f y jiao flight attendant f harriet king flight attendant f b choi flight attendant f yee chang flight attendant f she paused sipped the cold coffee there was something odd about this list she thought but she couldnt put her finger on it she set the list aside next a transcript of communications from southern california air traffic approach control as usual it was printed without punctuation the transmission to intermixed with transmissions to several other aircraft uah three six five ground thirty five thousand usa on frequency again changed radios sorry about that atac one nine eight copy aal fuel remaining four two zero one atac copy that two five eight five no problem we have you now tpa this is transpacific five four five we have an emergency atac affirmative zero zero one atac go ahead five four five tpa request priority clearance for emergency landing in los angeles aal down to twenty nine thousand atac okay five four five understand you request priority clearance to land tpa affirmative atac say the nature of your emergency uah three two one ground thirty two thousand aalool holding two six nine tpa we have a passenger emergency we need ambulances on the ground i would say thirty or forty ambulances maybe more atac tpa five four five say again are you asking for forty ambulances uah turn one two four point niner tpa affirmative we encountered severe turbulence during flight we have injuries of passengers and flight crew atac copy one nine eight good day atac transpacific i copy your ground request for forty ambulances uah thank you casey puzzled over the exchanges because they suggested very erratic behavior by the pilot for example the transpacific incident had occurred shortly after five in the morning at that time the plane was still in radio contact with honolulu arinc with so many injuries the captain could have reported an emergency to honolulu but he hadnt done that why not instead the pilot continued to los angeles and he had waited until he was about to land before reporting an emergency why had he waited so long and why would he say the incident had been caused by turbulence he knew that wasnt true the captain had told the stewardess the slats deployed and she knew from zieglers audio that the slats had deployed so why hadnt the pilot announced it why lie to approach control everyone agreed john chang was a good pilot so what was the explanation for his behavior was he in shock even the best pilots sometimes behaved oddly in a crisis but there seemed to be a pattern herealmost a plan she looked ahead atac do you need medical personnel too what is the nature of the injuries you are bringing in tpa i am not sure atac can you give us an estimate tpa i am sorry no an estimate is not possible aalool two one two niner clear atac is anyone unconscious tpa no i do not think so but two are dead the captain seemed to report the fatalities as an afterthought what was really going on atac copy zero zero one atac tpa five four five what is the condition of your aircraft tpa we have damage to the passenger cabin minor damage only casey thought minor damage only that cabin had sustained millions of dollars of damage hadnt the captain gone back to look for himself did he not know the extent of the damage why would he say what he did atac what is the condition of the flight deck tpa flight deck is operational fdau is nominal atac copy that five four five what is the condition of your flight crew tpa captain and first officer in good condition at that moment one of the first officers had been covered in blood again did the pilot not know she glanced at the rest of the transcript then pushed it aside shed show it to felix tomorrow and get his opinion she went on looking through the structure reports the interior cabin reports the relevant pma records for the counterfeit slats locking pin and the counterfeit thruster cowl steadily patiently she worked on into the night it was after ten oclock when she again turned to the faults printout from flight she had been hoping she could skip this and use the flight recorder data instead but now there was nothing to do but slog through it yawning tired she stared at the columns of numbers on the first page as pwr test ail servo comp aoa inv cfds sens fail crz cmd mon inv el servo comp eprn tra fms speed inv press alt inv gs speed ang slat xsit to gs dev inv gnd spd inv tas inv tat inv aux aux aux aux coa as roxp rdr prox aoa bta fds rg fcmd mon she didnt want to do this she hadnt eaten dinner yet and she knew she should eat anyway the only questions she had about these fault listings were the aux readings she had asked ron and he had said the first was the auxiliary power unit the second and third were unused and the fourth aux coa was a customer installed line but there wasnt anything on those lines ron said because a zero reading was normal it was the default reading so she was really finished with this listing she was done casey stood up at her desk stretched looked at her watch it was tenfifteen shed better get some sleep she thought after all she was going to appear on television tomorrow she didnt want her mother to call afterward saying dear you looked so tired casey folded up the printout and put it away zero she thought was the perfect default value because that was what she was coming up with on this particular nights work a big zero nothing a big fat zero she said aloud means nothing on the line she didnt want to think what it meantthat time was running out that her plan to push the investigation had failed and that she was going to end up in front of a television camera tomorrow afternoon with the famous marty reardon asking her questions and she would have no good answers to give him except the answers that john marder wanted her to give just lie hell with it maybe that was how it was going to turn out you re old enough to know how it works casey turned out her desk light and started for the door she said good night to esther the cleaning woman and went out into the hallway she got into the elevator and pushed the button to go down to the ground floor the button lit up when she touched it glowing she yawned as the doors started to close she was really very tired it was silly to work this late shed make foolish mistakes overlook things she looked at the glowing button and then it hit her forget something esther said as casey came back into the office no casey said she rifled through the sheets on her desk fast searching tossing papers in all directions letting them flutter to the floor ron had said the default was zero and therefore when you got a zero you didnt know if the line was used or not but if there was a then that would mean she found the listing ran her finger down the columns of numbers aux aux aux aux coa there was a numeral aux coa had registered a fault on the second leg of the flight that meant the aux coa line was being used by the aircraft but what was it used for she sucked in her breath she hardly dared to hope ron said that aux coa was a line for customer optional additions the customer used it for addons like a qar the qar was the quick access recorder another flight data recorder installed to help the maintenance crews it recorded many of the same parameters as a regular dfdr if a qar was on this aircraft it could solve all her problems but ron insisted this plane didnt have a qar he said hed looked in the tail which was where it was usually installed on an n and it wasnt there had he ever looked anywhere else had he really searched the plane because casey knew an optional item like the qar was not subject to faa regulation it could be anyplace in the aircraft the operator wanted itin the aft accessory compartment or the cargo hold or the radio rack beneath the cockpit it could be just about anywhere had ron really looked she decided to check for herself she spent the next ten minutes thumbing through thick service repair manuals for the n without any success the manuals didnt mention the qar at all or at least she couldnt find any reference but the manuals she kept in her office were her personal copies casey wasnt directly involved in maintenance and she didnt have the latest versions most of the manuals dated back to her own arrival at the company they were five years old that was when she noticed the headsup display sitting on her desk wait a minute she thought she grabbed the goggles slipped them on she plugged them into the cd player she pressed the power switch nothing happened she fiddled with the equipment for a few moments until she realized there was no cdrom in the machine she looked in the cardboard box found a silver platter and slid it into the player she pressed the power button again the goggles glowed she was staring at a page from the first maintenance manual projected onto the inside of the goggles she wasnt quite sure how the system worked because the goggles were just an inch from her eyes but the projected page appeared to float in space two feet in front of her the page was almost transparent she could see right through it korman liked to say that virtual reality was virtually useless except for a few specialized applications one was maintenance busy people working in technical environments people who had their hands full or covered in grease didnt have the time or inclination to look through a thick manual if you were thirty feet up in the air trying to repair a jet engine you couldnt carry a stack of fivepound manuals around with you so virtual displays were perfect for those situations and korman had built one by pressing buttons on the cd player casey found that she could scroll through the manuals there was also a search function that flashed up a keyboard hanging in space she had to repeatedly press another button to move a pointer to the letter q then a then r it was clumsy but it worked after a moment of whirring a page hung in the air before her n quick access recorder qar recommended locations pressing more buttons she scrolled through a sequence of diagrams showing in detail all the places where the qar could be located on the n aircraft there were about thirty places in all casey clipped the player onto her belt and headed for the door airport marina pm marty reardon was still in seattle his interview with gates had run long and hed missed his plane now he was coming down in the morning jennifer had to revise the schedule it was going to be a difficult day she realized shed hoped to start at nine now she couldnt begin until ten at the earliest she sat in the hotel room with her laptop figuring it out transfer from lax barker at ofc king at airport faa at airport transfer to burbank rogers at burbank standup outside norton singleton at norton transfer to lax too tight no time for lunch for traffic delays for normal production screwups and tomorrow was friday marty would want to make the six oclock plane back to new york marty had a new girlfriend and he liked to spend the weekend with her marty would be very pissy if he missed the flight and he was definitely going to miss it the problem was that by the time marty finished with singleton in burbank it would be rush hour hed never make his plane he really should leave burbank by twothirty which meant pushing singleton up and holding off the lawyer she was afraid shed lose the faa guy if she changed him at the last minute but the lawyer would be flexible hed wait until midnight if they asked him to shed talked with the lawyer earlier king was a blowhard but he was plausible in short bites five ten seconds punchy worth doing transfer from lax barker at ofc faa at airport transfer to burbank rogers at burbank standup outside norton singleton at norton transfer to lax king at airport pad that would work in her mind she reviewed her pullouts if the faa guy was good jennifer hadnt met him yet just talked on the phone then marty might run over with him if it took too long to transfer to burbank shed blow off rogers who was weak anyway and go right to martys standup singleton would be fastjennifer wanted to keep marty moving there so he didnt attack the woman too much a tight schedule would help back to lax finish with king martyd leave at six and jennifer would have her tape shed go to an editing bay at the o and o cut the segment and uplink to new york that night shed call in and get dicks comments saturday morning revise it and uplink it again about noon that was plenty of time to make air she made a note to call norton in the morning and tell them she needed to move singleton up two hours finally she turned to the stack of faxed background documents norton had sent her office for deborahs research jennifer had never bothered to look at these and she wouldnt bother now except she had nothing better to do she thumbed through them quickly it was what she expected selfjustifying papers that said the n was safe that it had an excellent record flipping from page to page she suddenly stopped she stared theyve got to be kidding she said and she closed the file hangar pm at night the norton plant appeared deserted the parking lots nearly empty the perimeter buildings silent but it was brightly lit security kept floodlights on all night and there were video monitors mounted on the corners of all the buildings as she crossed from administration to hangar she heard her footsteps clicking on the asphalt the big doors to hangar were pulled down and locked she saw teddy rawley standing outside talking to one of the electrical team a wisp of cigarette smoke rose up toward the floodlights she went over to the side door hey babe teddy said still here huh yeah she said she started through the door the electrical guy said the buildings closed nobodys allowed in were doing the get now its okay she said im sorry you cant the guy said ron smith gave strict orders nobodys to go inside if you touch anything on the airplane ill be careful she said teddy looked at her walked over i know you will he said but youre going to need this he handed her a heavy flashlight three feet long its dark in there remember the electrical guy said and you cant turn the lights on we cant have change in the ambient flux i understand she said the test equipment was sensitive turning on the overhead fluorescents might change readings the electrician was still fretting maybe i better call ron and tell him youre going in call whoever you want casey said and dont touch the handrails because i wont she said for christs sake i know what im doing she went into the hangar teddy was right it was dark inside she felt rather than saw the large space around her she could barely discern the outlines of the plane looming above her all its doors and compartments were open cabling hanging down everywhere beneath the tail the test box sat in a pool of faint blue light the crt screen flickered as systems were activated in sequence she saw the cockpit lights go on then off then the forward cabin lights brightly lit thirty feet above her then darkness again a moment later the beacon lights on the wing tips and the tail came on sending hot white strobe flashes through the room then darkness again the front headlights suddenly glared brightly from the wing and the landing gear began to retract because the plane was mounted above the ground the landing gear was free to retract and extend it would happen a dozen times that night outside the hangar she heard the electrician still talking in a worried tone teddy laughed and the electrician said something else casey turned on her flashlight and moved forward the flashlight cast a powerful glow she twisted the rim spreading the beam wider now the landing gear was fully raised then the gear doors opened and the landing gear began to extend the big rubber wheels coming down flat then turning with a hydraulic whine a moment later the insignia light shone up at the rudder illuminating the tail then it went off again she headed for the aft accessory compartment in the tail she knew ron had said the qar wasnt there but she felt she had to check again she climbed the broad stairs rolled up to the back of the plane being careful not to touch the handrails electrical test cables were taped to the handrails she didnt want to disturb them or to cause field fluctuation from the presence of her hand the aft accessory compartment built into the upward slope of the tail was directly above her head the compartment doors were open she shone her light in the upper surface of the compartment was taken up by the underside of the apu the turbine generator that served as the auxiliary power unit a maze of semicircular pipes and white couplings wrapped around the main unit below was a cramped series of readout meters rack slots and black pcs boxes each with the milled vanes for heat transfer if there was a qar in here as well she might easily miss it the qars were only about eight inches square she paused to put on her goggles and turned on the cd player immediately a diagram of the aft accessory compartment hung in space before her eyes she could see through the diagram to the actual compartment behind the rectangular block marking the qar was outlined in red on the diagram in the actual compartment the space was taken up by an extra readout meter hydraulic pressure for a flight control system ron was right there was no qar here casey climbed back down the stairs to the floor and walked beneath the plane to the forward accessory compartment just behind the nose wheel it too was open standing on the ground she shone her flashlight up into the compartment and flicked to the correct manual page a new image hung in the air it snowed the qar located in the right anterior electrical rack next to the hydraulic activator buses it wasnt there the slot was empty the round connector plug exposed at the back the shiny metal contact points glinting it had to be somewhere inside the plane she headed off to the right where a rollup staircase led up thirty feet to the passenger door just behind the cockpit she heard her feet ring on the metal as she entered the aircraft it was dark she shone her flashlight aft the beam moving over the cabin the passenger cabin looked worse than before hi many places her beam caught the dull silver of the insulation pads the electrical crews had pulled the ulterior panels around the windows to get at junction boxes along the walls she noticed a lingering faint odor of vomit someone had tried to mask it with a sweet floral spray behind her the cockpit suddenly glowed the overhead map lights came on softly illuminating the two seats then the row of video display screens the twinkling lights of the overhead panels the fdau printer on the pedestal buzzed printing out a couple of test lines then was silent all the cockpit lights went out dark again cycling immediately the forward galley lights just ahead of her came on the illuminators for heating and microwaves flashed the overheat and timer warnings beeped then everything went off silence dark again casey was still standing just inside the door fiddling with the cd player at her waist when she thought she heard footsteps she paused listening it was difficult to tell as the electrical systems cycled through there was a continuous succession of soft buzzes and clicks from relays and solenoids in the avionics racks around her she listened hard yes she was sure of it now footsteps someone was walking slowly steadily through the hangar frightened she leaned out the door and called loudly teddy is that you she listened no more footsteps silence the clicking of the relays the hell with it she decided she was up here alone inside this tornup airplane and it was getting on her nerves she was tired she was imagining things she walked around the galley to the left side where the display showed an additional electrical storage panel down near the floor the panel cover had already been removed she looked at it through the transparent diagram this was mostly taken up with secondary avionics boxes and there was little room no qar she moved down the cabin to the midships bulkhead there was a small storage compartment here built into the bulkhead frame just below a slot for magazines it was a foolish place to install a qar she thought and she was not surprised when she didnt find one there either four down twentysix to go now she moved toward the tail to the aft interior storage compartment this was a more likely place a square service panel that was just to the left of the rear exit door on the side of the aircraft the panel didnt screw down it flipped up on a hinge which made it more accessible for crews in a hurry she came to the door which was open she felt a cool breeze darkness outside she couldnt see the ground forty feet below the panel was just to the left of the door and it was already open she looked seeing it through the diagram if the qar was there it would be in the lowerright corner next to the breaker switches for the cabin lights and the crew intercom it wasnt there the wing tip lights came on brilliant strobes flashing repeatedly they cast harsh shadows in the interior through the open door and the row of windows then off again clink she froze the sound had come from somewhere near the cockpit it was a metallic sound like a foot kicking a tool she listened again she heard a soft tread a creak someone was in the cabin she pulled the goggles off her head leaving them hanging around her neck silently she slid to her right crouching behind a row of seats at the rear of the plane she heard footsteps coming closer a complicated pattern of sound a murmur was there more than one she held her breath the cabin lights came on first in front then midships then aft but most of the ceiling lights were hanging so they cast odd shadows then went off again she gripped the flashlight the weight felt comforting in her hand she moved her head to the right so she could peer between the seats she heard the footsteps again but could see nothing then the landing lights came on and in their reflected glare a row of hot ovals appeared on the ceiling from the windows along both sides and a shadow blotting out the ovals one after another someone walking down the aisle not good she thought what could she do she had the flashlight in her hand but she had no illusions about her ability to defend herself she had her cell phone her beeper her she reached down and silently flicked the beeper off the man was close now she edged forward her neck aching and she saw him he was almost to the rear of the plane looking in every direction she could not see his face but in the reflected landing lights she could see his redchecked shirt the landing lights went out darkness in the cabin she held her breath she heard the faint thunk of a relay coming from somewhere in the forward compartment she knew it was electrical but apparently the man in the red shirt did not he grunted softly as if surprised and moved forward quickly she waited after a while she thought she heard the sound of footsteps on the metal stairs going down she wasnt sure but she thought so the airplane was silent around her cautiously she came out from behind the seat it was time to get out of here she thought she moved to the open door listening there was no question the footsteps walking away the sound diminishing the nose lights came on and she saw a long streak of shadow a man walking away a voice inside said get out of here but she felt the goggles around her neck and hesitated she ought to give the man plenty of time to leave the hangarshe didnt want to go down and find him on the floor so she decided to look in another compartment she pulled on the goggles pressed the button on the unit she saw the next page the next compartment was nearby located just outside the rear door where she was standing she leaned out the door and holding on with her right hand found she could easily look into the panel box the cover was already open there were three vertical rows of electrical buses which probably controlled the two rear doors they were overrides and at the bottom yes the quick access recorder it was green with a white stripe around the top stenciled lettering maint qar b maint a metal box about eight inches square with a plug facing outward casey reached in gripped the box and pulled gently with a metallic click it came free of the inner coupling and she had it in her hand all right she stepped back inside the doorway holding die box in both hands now she was so excited she was trembling this changed everything she was so excited she did not hear the rush of footsteps behind her until it was too late strong hands shoved against her she grunted and her hands slipped away and then her body fell through the door into space falling to the floor thirty feet below too soonmuch too soonshe felt a sharp pain on her cheekand then her body landed but something was wrong there were strange pressure points all over her body she was no longer falling but rising then falling again it was like a giant hammock the webbing shed hit the safety webbing she couldnt see it in the darkness but the black safety webbing was hung beneath the plane and she had fallen into it casey rolled over onto her back saw a silhouette at the door the figure turned and ran through the airplane she scrambled to her feet but it was difficult to balance the webbing was slowly undulating she moved forward toward the dull metal expanse of the wing she heard footsteps clattering on the metal stairs somewhere forward the man was coming she had to get out she had to get off the webbing before he caught her she moved closer to the wing and then she heard a cough it had come from the far edge of the wing somewhere off to her left someone else was here down on the floor waiting she paused feeling the gentle swaying of the webbing beneath her in a moment she knew more lights would come on then she could see where the man was suddenly the hot strobe lights above the tail flickered rapidly they were so bright they illuminated the entire hangar now she could see who had coughed it was richman he wore a dark blue windbreaker and dark slacks the lazy collegiate manner was gone richman stood near the wing tense alert he looked left and right carefully scanning the floor abruptly the strobe lights went out plunging the hangar into darkness casey moved forward hearing the webbing creak beneath her feet would richman hear could he figure out where she was she came to the wing stretching forward in darkness she grabbed it with her hand moved outward to the edge sooner or later she knew the webbing would end her foot struck a thick cord she bent down felt knots casey lay down on the webbing gripped the edge in both hands and rolled over the side falling for a moment she hung by one arm the webbing stretching downward she was surrounded by blackness she did not know how far it was to the floor six feet ten feet running footsteps she released the webbing and fell she hit the ground standing dropped to her knees sharp pain in her kneecap as she banged into concrete she heard richman cough again he was very close off to her left she got up and began to run toward the exit door the landing lights came on again harsh and strong in their glare she saw richman throw up his hands to cover his eyes she knew he would be blinded for a few seconds not long but perhaps enough where was the other man she ran she hit the wall of the hangar with a dull metallic thud someone behind her said hey she moved along the wall feeling for the door she heard running footsteps where where behind her running footsteps her hand touched wood vertical runners more wood then the metal bar the door latch she pushed cool air she was outside teddy turned hey babe he said smiling hows it going she fell to her knees gasping for breath teddy and the electrical guy came running over what is it whats the matter they were standing over her touching her solicitous she tried to catch her breath she managed to gasp call security what call security someones inside the electrical guy ran to the phone teddy stayed with her then she remembered the qar she had a moment of sudden panic where was it she stood oh no she said i dropped it dropped what babe that box she turned looking back at the hangar shed have to get them to go back inside to you mean the one in your hand teddy said she looked at her left hand the qar was there clutched so tightly her fingers were white glendale pm come on now teddy said arm around her walking her into the bedroom everythings fine babe teddy she said i dont know why well find out tomorrow he said soothingly but what was he doing tomorrow teddy said but what was he she couldnt finish her sentences she sat on the bed suddenly feeling her exhaustion overwhelmed by it ill stay on the couch he said i dont want you alone tonight he looked at her chucked her on the chin dont worry about a thing babe he reached over and took the qar out of her hand she released it unwillingly well just put this right here he said setting it on the bedside table he was talking to her as to a child teddy its important i know itll be there when you wake up okay okay call if you need anything he left closing the door she looked at the pillow she had to get out of her clothes to get ready for bed her face hurt she didnt know what had happened to it she needed to look at her face she picked up the qar and stuck it behind the pillow she stared at the pillow then lay down on it and closed her eyes just for a moment she thought friday glendale am something was wrong casey sat up quickly pain streaked through her body she gasped she felt a burning sensation in her face she touched her cheek and winced sunlight poured through her window onto the foot of the bed she looked down at twin arcs of grease on the bedspread she still had her shoes on she still had her clothes on she was lying on top of the bedspread fully dressed groaning she twisted her body swung her feet to the floor everything hurt she looked down at the bedside table the clock said sixthirty she reached behind the pillow brought out the green metal box with a white stripe the qar she smelled coffee the door opened and teddy came in in his boxer shorts bringing her a mug how bad is it everything hurts i figured he held the coffee out to her can you handle this she nodded took the mug gratefully her shoulders hurt as she lifted it to her lips the coffee was hot and strong face isnt too bad he said looking at her critically mostly on the side i guess thats where you hit the mesh she suddenly remembered the interview oh jesus she said she got off the bed groaning again three aspirins teddy said and a very hot bath i dont have time make time hot as you can stand she went into the bathroom and turned on the shower she looked in the mirror her face was streaked with grime there was a purple bruise that started by her ear and ran back behind her neck her hair would cover it she thought it wouldnt show she took another drink of coffee removed her clothes got into the shower she had bruises on her elbow on her hip on her knees she couldnt remember how she had gotten them the stinging hot spray felt good when she came out of the shower the telephone was ringing she pushed open the door dont answer that casey said are you sure theres no time she said not today she went into the bedroom to dress she had only ten hours until her interview with marty reardon between now and then she had only one thing she wanted to do clear up flight nortondos am rob wong placed the green box on the table attached a cable pressed a key on his console a small red light glowed on the qar box its got power wong said he sat back in his chair looked at casey you ready to try this im ready she said keep your fingers crossed wong said he pushed a single key on the keyboard the red light on the qar box began to flicker rapidly uneasily casey said is that its okay its downloading after a few seconds the red light glowed steadily again now what its done wong said lets see the data his screen began to show columns of numbers wong leaned forward looking closely uh looks pretty good casey this could be your lucky day he typed rapidly at the keyboard for several seconds then he sat back now we see how good it is on the monitor a wireframe aircraft appeared and rapidly filled in becoming solid threedimensional a skyblue background appeared a silver aircraft seen horizontally in profile the landing gear down wong punched keys moving the aircraft around so they saw it from the tail he added a green field running to the horizon and a gray runway the image was schematic but effective the airplane began to move going down the runway it changed attitude the nose raising up the landing gear folded into the wings you just took off wong said he was grinning the aircraft was still rising wong hit a key and a rectangle opened on the right side of the screen a series of numbers appeared changing quickly its not a dfdr but its good enough wong said all the major stuff is here altitude airspeed heading fuel deltas on control surfacesflaps slats ailerons elevators rudder everything you need and the datas stable casey the aircraft was still climbing wong hit a button and white clouds appeared the plane continued upward through the clouds i figure you dont want to real time this he said you know when the accident occurred yes she said it was about nineforty into the flight nineforty elapsed right coming up on the monitor the aircraft was level the rectangle of numbers on the right stable then a red light began to flash among the numbers whats that fault recording its uh slats disagree she looked at the aircraft on the screen nothing changed slats extending no wong said nothing its just a fault she watched a moment longer the aircraft was still level five seconds passed then the slats emerged from the leading edge slats extending wong said looking at the numbers and then slats fully extended casey said so there was a fault first and then the slats extended afterward right uncommanded extension no commanded now plane goes nose up and uhohexceeding buffet boundarynow heres the stall warning and on the screen the airplane nosed over into a steep dive the white clouds streaked past faster and faster alarms began to beep flashing on the screen whats that casey said the planes exceeding the gload envelope jeez look at him the airplane pulled out of the dive and began a steep climb hes going up at sixteen eighteen twentyone degrees wong said shaking his head twentyone degrees on commercial flights a standard rate of climb was three to five degrees ten degrees was steep used only in takeoffs at twentyone degrees passengers would feel as if the plane were going straight up more alarms exceedences wong said again in a flat voice hes stressing the hell out of the airframe its not built to take that you guys do a structure inspect as they watched the plane went into a dive again i cant believe this wong said the autopilots supposed to prevent that he was on manual even so these wild oscillations would kick in the autopilot wong pointed to the box of data to one side yeah there it is the autopilot tries to take over pilot keeps punching it back to manual thats crazy another climb another dive in all they watched aghast as the aircraft went through six cycles of dive and climb until suddenly abruptly it returned to stable flight what happened she said autopilot took over finally rob wong gave a long sigh well id say you know what happened to this airplane casey but im damned if i know why war room am a cleaning crew was at work in the war room the big windows overlooking the factory floor were being washed the chairs and the formica table wiped down in the far corner a woman was vacuuming the carpet doherty and ron smith were standing near the door looking at a printout whats going on she said no irt today doherty said marder canceled it casey said how come nobody told me that then she remembered shed turned her beeper off the night before she reached down turned it back on cet test last night was damn near perfect ron said just as we said all along thats an excellent airplane we only got two repeated faults we got a consistent fault on aux coa starting five cycles in around tenthirty i dont know why that happened he looked at her waiting he must have heard that she had been inside the hangar the night before at about that time but she wasnt going to explain it to him at least not right now she said and what about the proximity sensor that was the other fault smith said out of twentytwo cycles we ran during the night the wing proximity sensor faulted six times its definitely bad and if that proximity sensor faulted during flight youd get a slats disagree in the cockpit she turned to leave hey doherty said where are you going ive got to look at some video casey do you know what the hell is going on youll be the first to know she said and she walked away as swiftly as the investigation had stalled the day before she felt it coming together the qar had been the key at last she could reconstruct the sequence of events on right and with that the pieces of the puzzle were falling rapidly into place as she walked to her car she called norma on her cell phone norma i need a route schedule for transpacific got one right here norma said it came over with the faa packet what do you want to know flight schedule to honolulu ill check there was a pause they dont go into honolulu norma said they only go to never mind casey said thats all i need to know it was the answer she had expected listen norma said marder has called three times for you already he says youre not answering your pager tell him you cant reach me and richman has been trying to you cant reach me casey said she hung up and hurried to her car driving in the car she called ellen fong in accounting the secretary said ellen was working at home again today casey got the number and called ellen its casey singleton oh yes casey her voice was cool careful did you do the translation casey said yes flat no expression did you finish it yes i finished it can you fax it to me casey said there was a pause i dont think i should do that ellen said all right do you know why ellen fong asked i can guess i will bring it to your office ellen said two oclock fine casey said the pieces were coming together fast casey was now pretty sure she could explain what happened on flight she could almost lay out the entire chain of causal events with luck the tape at video imaging would give her final confirmation only one question remained what was she going to do about it sepulveda boulevard am fred barker was sweating the air conditioner was turned off in his office and now under marty reardons insistent questioning sweat trickled down his cheeks glistened in his beard dampened his shirt mr barker matty said leaning forward marty was fortyfive handsome in a thinlipped sharpeyed way he had the air of a reluctant prosecutor a seasoned man whod seen it all he spoke slowly often in short fragments with the appearance of reasonableness he was giving the witness every possible break and his favorite tone was that of disappointment dark eyebrows up how could this be marty said mr barker youve described problems with the norton n but the company says airworthiness directives were issued that fixed the problems are they right no under martys probing barker had dropped the full sentences he now said as little as possible the directives didnt work well we just had another incident didnt we involving slats norton told us it wasnt slats i think youll find it was so norton aircraft is lying theyre doing what they always do they come up with some complicated explanation that conceals the real problem some complicated explanation marty repeated but arent aircraft complicated not in this case this accident is the result of their failure to redress a longstanding design flaw youre confident of that yes how can you be so sure are you an engineer no you have an aerospace degree no what was your major in college that was a long time ago wasnt it music mr barker werent you a music major well yes but uh jennifer watched martys attack with mixed feelings it was always fun to see an interview squirm and the audience loved to watch pompous experts cut down to size but martys attack threatened to devastate her entire segment if marty i destroyed barkers credibility of course she thought she could work around him she didnt have to use him a bachelor of arts in music marty said in his reasonable tone mr barker do you think that qualifies you to judge aircraft not in itself but you have other degrees no do you have any scientific or engineering training at all barker tugged at his collar well i worked for the faa did the faa give you any scientific or engineering training did they teach you say fluid dynamics no aerodynamics well i have a lot of experience im sure but do you have formal training in aerodynamics calculus metallurgy structural analysis or any of the other subjects involved in making an airplane not formally no informally yes certainly a lifetime of experience good thats fine now i notice those books behind you and on your desk reardon leaned forward touched one of the books that lay open this one here its called advanced structural integrity methods for airframe durability and damage tolerance pretty dense you understand this book most of it yes for example reardon pointed to the open page turned it to read here on page it says leevers and radon introduced a biaxiality parameter b that relates the magnitude of the t stress as in equation you see that yes barker swallowed what is a biaxiality parameter uh well its rather difficult to explain briefly marty jumped who are leevers and radon theyre researchers in the field you know them not personally but youre familiar with their work ive heard their names do you know anything about them at all not personally no are they important researchers in the field ive said i dont know barker tugged at his collar again jennifer realized she had to put a stop to this marty was doing his attackdog routine snarling at the smell of fear jennifer couldnt use any of this stuff the significant fact was that barker had been on a crusade for years he had a track record he was committed to the fight in any case she already had his slats explanation from the day before and she had softball answers to the questions she had asked herself she tapped marty on the shoulder were running late she said marty responded instantly he was bored he jumped up im sorry mr barker we have to cut this short we appreciate your time youve been very helpful barker appeared to be in shock he mumbled something the makeup girl came up to him with wipes in her hand and said ill help you get the makeup off marty reardon turned to jennifer in a low voice he said what the fuck are you doing marty she said answering him in the same low tones the cnn tape is dynamite the storys dynamite the publics scared to get on airplanes were fleshing out the controversy performing a public service not with this clown youre not reardon said hes a litigators stooge all hes good for is an outofcourt settlement he doesnt know what the fuck hes talking about marty whether you like this guy or not the plane has a history of problems and the tape is fabulous yes and everybodys seen the tape reardon said but whats the story you better show me something jennifer i will marty you better left unstated was the rest of the sentence or im going to call dick shenk and pull the plug aviation highway am for a different look they shot the faa guy on the street with the airport as background the faa guy was skinny and wore glasses he blinked rapidly in the sun he looked weak and bland he was such a nonentity jennifer couldnt even remember his name she felt confident he wouldnt hold up well unfortunately he was devastating about barker the faa handles a great deal of sensitive information some is proprietary some is technical some is industry sensitive and some is company sensitive since the candor of all parties is critical to our function we have very strict rules about the dissemination of this information mr barker violated those rules he seemed to have a great desire to see himself on television and his name in the newspapers he says not true marty replied he says the faa wasnt doing its job and he had to speak out to attorneys marty said attorneys yes the faa guy said most of his leaks were to attorneys bringing cases against carriers he released confidential information to attorneys incomplete information about investigations in progress and thats illegal did you prosecute were not able to prosecute we dont have that authority but it was clear to us that he was being paid under the table by lawyers to give them information we turned his case over to the justice department which failed to pursue it we were pretty upset about it we thought he should go to jail and the attorneys with him why didnt that happen youd have to ask justice but the justice department is made up of attorneys and attorneys dont like to send other attorneys to jail sort of professional courtesy barker worked for attorneys and they got him off barker still works for attorneys everything he says is designed to support or incite a frivolous lawsuit he has no real interest in aviation safety if he did hed still be working for us trying to serve the public instead of trying to make a lot of money marty said as you know the faa is currently under fire jennifer thought shed better stop marty now there wasnt any point in continuing she already intended to drop most of this interview shed use just the early statement where the faa guy said barker wanted publicity that was the least damaging comment and it would constitute a balanced response in the segment because she needed barker marty im sorry we have to get across town marty nodded thanked the guy immediatelyanother indication he was boredsigned an autograph for the guys kid and climbed into the limo ahead of jennifer jesus marty said as the limo pulled away he waved goodbye to the faa guy through the window smiled to him then he flopped back in the seat i dont get it jennifer he said ominously correct me if im wrong but you dont have a story you got some bullshit allegations by lawyers and their paid stooges but youve got nothing of substance weve got a story she said youll see she tried to sound confident marty grunted unhappily the car pulled out and headed north to the valley toward norton aircraft video imaging systems am tapes coming up now harmon said he drummed his fingers on the console casey shifted her body in the chair feeling twinges of pain she still had several hours before the interview and she still couldnt decide how she would handle it the tape began to run harmon had tripled the frames the image moving in a jerky slow motion the change made the sequence appear even more horrifying she watched in silence as the bodies tumbled the camera spun and fell and finally came to rest at the cockpit door go back how far as slow as you can one frame at a time yes the images ran backward the gray carpet the blur as the camera jumped away from the door the glint of light off the open cockpit door the hot glare from the cockpit windows the shoulders of the two pilots on either side of the pedestal captain on the left first officer on the right the captain reaching toward the pedestal stop she stared at the frame the captain was reaching no hat the face of the first officer turned forward away from him the captain reaching his hand out casey rolled her chair toward the console and peered at the monitor then she stood moved very close to the screen seeing the scan lines there it is she thought in living color but what was she going to do about it nothing she realized there was nothing she could do she had the information now but she could not possibly release it and hold on to her job but she realized she was probably going to lose her job anyway marder and edgarton had set her up to do the press whether she lied as marder wanted her to do or whether she told the truth she was in trouble there was no way out the only possible solution that casey could see was not to do the interview but she had to do it she was caught in the middle okay she said sighing ive seen enough what do you want to do run another copy harmon pressed a button on the console he shifted in his chair looking uncomfortable ms singleton he said i feel i have to mention something the people who work here have seen this tape and frankly theyre pretty upset i can imagine casey said theyve all seen that guy on television the attorney who says youre covering up the real cause of the accident uhhuh and one person in particular a woman in reception dunks we should turn this tape over to the authorities or to the television stations i mean its like the rodney king thing were sitting on a bomb here peoples lives are at risk casey sighed she was not really surprised but it presented a new issue and she would have to deal with it has that already happened is that what youre telling me no harmon said not yet but people are concerned yes and what about you what do you think well to tell you the truth im bothered as well harmon said i mean you work for the company you have your loyalties i understand that but if there really is something wrong with this airplane and people died because of it caseys mind was working fast again thinking through the situation there was no way to know how many copies of the tape had already been made there was no way to contain or control events now and she was tired of the intriguewith the carrier with the engineers with the union with marder with richman all these conflicting agendas while she was caught in the middle trying to hold it together and now the damn tape company she said whats the name of the woman in reception christine barron does she know your company has signed a nondisclosure agreement with us yeah but i guess she thinks her conscience takes precedence i need to make a call casey said on a private line he took her to an office that wasnt being used she made two telephone calls when she came back she said to harmon the tape is norton property it is not to be released to anyone without our authorization and you have signed a nondisclosure agreement with us doesnt your conscience bother you harmon said no casey said it doesnt were investigating this and well get to the bottom of it all youre doing is talking about things you dont understand if you release this tape youll help a bottomfeeder lawyer sue us for damages you signed an nda with us you violate it and youre out of business keep it in mind she took her copy of the tape and walked out of the room norton qa am frustrated and angry casey stormed into her office at qa an elderly woman was waiting for her she introduced herself as martha gershon in media training in person she looked like a kindly grandmother gray hair tied up in a bun and a beige highnecked dress casey said im sorry im very busy i know marder asked you to see me but im afraid that oh i realize how busy you are martha gershon said her voice was calm reassuring you dont have time for me especially today and you dont really want to see me do you because you dont much care for john marder casey paused she looked again at this pleasant lady standing there in her office smiling you must feel youve been manipulated by mr marder i understand now that ive met him i must say i dont get a strong feeling of integrity from him do you no casey said and i dont think he likes women much gershon continued and i suspect hes arranged for you to speak to the television cameras in the hope that you would fail gosh id hate to see that happen casey stared at her please sit down she said thank you dear the woman sat on the couch her beige dress billowing around her she folded her hands neatly in her lap she remained utterly calm i wont take long she said but perhaps youd be more comfortable if you sat down too casey sat down theres just a few things id like to remind you of gershon said before your interview you know youll be speaking to martin reardon no i didnt yes she said which means youll be dealing with his distinctive interviewing style that will make it easier i hope youre right i am dear she said are you comfortable now i think so id like to see you sit back in your chair there you go sit back when you lean forward you appear too eager and your body gets tense sit back so you can take in what is said to you and be relaxed you might want to do that in the interview sit back i mean and be relaxed all right casey said sitting back relaxed now i think so casey said do you clasp your hands together like that on the desk usually id like to see what happens if you place your hands apart yes rest them on the desk just like youre doing if you close your hands it makes you tense its so much better when you just stay open good does that feel natural i guess so you must be under great strain now gershon said clucking sympathetically but ive known martin reardon since he was a young reporter cronkite disliked him thought martin was cocky and insubstantial i fear that assessment has proved accurate martin is all tricks and no substance hes not going to give you any trouble katharine not a woman of your intelligence youll have no trouble at all casey said youre making me feel wonderful im just telling you how it is gershon said lightly the most important thing to remember with reardon is that you know more than he does youve worked in this business for years reardon has literally just arrived he probably flew in this morning and he will fly out again tonight hes bright facile and a quick study but he does not have your depth of knowledge remember that you know more than he does okay casey said now because reardon has almost no information at his disposal his chief skill is manipulating the information you give him reardon has a reputation as a hatchet man but if you watch how he behaves hes actually a onetrick performer and this is his trick he gets you to agree with a series of statements so you are nodding yes yesand then he hits you with something out of left field reardons done that his whole life its amazing people havent caught on hell say youre a woman yes you live in california yes you have a good job yes you enjoy life yes so why did you steal the money and youve been nodding along and suddenly youre flustered youre offbalanceand hes got a reaction he can use remember all he wants is that onesentence reaction if he doesnt get it hell double back and ask the question another way he may return to a subject again and again if he keeps raising a particular topic youll know he hasnt gotten what he wants okay martin has another trick he will make a provocative statement and then pause waiting for you to fill the vacuum hell say casey you make airplanes so you must know the planes are unsafe and wait for you to answer but notice he hasnt actually asked a question casey nodded or he will repeat what you say in a tone of disbelief i understand casey said you understand gershon said surprised raising her eyebrows it was a pretty good imitation of reardon you see what i mean you will be goaded to defend yourself but you dont have to if martin doesnt ask a question you neednt say anything casey nodded not saying anything very good gershon smiled youll do just fine just remember to take all the time you want the interview is taped so theyll cut out any pauses if you dont understand a question ask him to clarify it martin is extremely good at asking vague questions that provoke specific answers remember he doesnt really know what hes talking about hes just here for the day i understand casey said now if youre comfortable looking at him do that if youre not you might choose a point somewhere near his head like the corner of a chair or a picture on the wall behind him and focus on that instead the camera wont be able to tell youre not really looking at him just do whatever you need to do to keep your concentration casey tried it looking just past gershons ear thats good gershon said youll do fine theres only one more thing i can tell you katherine you work in a complex business if you try to explain that complexity to martin youll be frustrated youll feel he isnt interested hell probably cut you off because he isnt interested a lot of people complain that television lacks focus but thats the nature of the medium televisions not about information at all information is active engaging television is passive information is disinterested objective television is emotional its entertainment whatever he says however he acts in truth martin has absolutely no interest in you or your company or your airplanes hes paid to exercise his one reliable talent provoking people getting them to make an emotional outburst to lose their temper to say something outrageous he doesnt really want to know about airplanes he wants a media moment if you understand that you can deal with him and she smiled her grandmotherly smile i know youll do just fine casey casey said will you be there at the interview oh no gershon said smiling martin and i have a long history we dont much care for each other on the rare occasions we find ourselves in the same location im afraid we tend to spit administration pm john marder was sitting at his desk arranging the documentspropsfor casey to use in her interview he wanted them complete and he wanted them in order first the parts record for the counterfeit thruster cowl on the numbertwo engine finding that part had been a stroke of luck kenny burne for all his bluster had done something right a thruster cowl was a bigbone part something everybody could relate to and it was definitely counterfeit pratt and whitney would scream when they saw it the famous eagle on their logo had been printed backward more important the presence of a counterfeit part could throw the entire story in that direction and it would take the heat off his private phone rang he picked it up marder he heard the hissing crackle of a satellite phone hal edgarton calling from the company jet on his way to hong kong edgarton said has it happened yet not yet hal another hour call me as soon as its over i will hal and it better be good news edgarton said and he hung up burbank pm jennifer was fretting she had had to leave marty alone for a while and it was never a good idea to leave marty alone during a shoot he was a restless highenergy guy and he needed constant attention someone had to hold his hand and fuss over him marty was like all the oncamera talent at newslinethey might once have been reporters but now they were actors and they had all the traits of actors selfcentered vain demanding they were a pain in the ass is what they were she also knew that marty for all his bitching about the norton story was at bottom just worried about appearances he knew the segment had been put together fast he knew it was down and dirty and he was afraid that when the segment was cut hed be fronting a lame story he was afraid his friends would make snide comments about the story over lunch at the four seasons he didnt care about journalistic responsibility he just cared about appearances and the proof jennifer knew was in her hands she had only been gone twenty minutes but as her town car rolled up to the location she saw marty pacing head down troubled and unhappy typical marty she got out of the car he came right over to her started to make his complaint started to say he thought they should bail on the segment call dick tell him it wasnt working she cut him off marty look at this she took the videotape she was carrying gave it to the cameraman and told him to play it back the cameraman popped it into the camera while she went over to the small playback monitor that sat on the grass what is it marty said standing over the monitor watch the tape began to play it started with a baby on the mothers lap googoo gaga baby sucking her toes marty looked at jennifer his dark eyebrows went up she said nothing the tape continued with the glare of the sun on the monitor it was hard to see in detail but it was clear enough bodies suddenly tumbling through the air marty sucked in his breath as he watched excited where did you get this disgruntled employee an employee of a video shop that does work for norton aircraft a solid citizen who thought it should be released she called me this is a norton tape they found it on the plane unbelievable marty said watching the tape unbelievable bodies tumbling the camera moving this is shocking isnt it fabulous the tape continued it was good it was all goodeven better than the cnn tape more kinetic more radical because the camera broke free and bounced around this tape conveyed a better sense of what must have happened on the flight who else has this marty said nobody but your disgruntled employee may no jennifer said i promised wed pay her legal bills as long as she didnt give it to anybody else shell sit tight so this is our exclusive right an actual tape from inside norton aircraft right then weve got a fabulous segment here marty said back from the dead jennifer thought as she watched marty go over to the fence and start to prepare for his standup the segment was saved she knew she could count on marty to cut the crap because of course this new tape added nothing to the information already in the can but marty was a pro he knew their segments lived and died on the visuals if the visuals worked nothing else mattered and this tape was a grabber so marty was cheerful now pacing back and forth glancing at norton aircraft through the fence the whole situation was perfect for marty a tape obtained from inside the company with all the innuendo of stonewall and coverup marty could milk that for all it was worth while the makeup girl retouched his neck marty said we should probably send that tape to dick so he can tease it done jennifer said pointing to one of the cars heading down the road dick would have it within an hour and he would cream when he saw it of course he would tease it hed use bits of it to promote saturdays show shocking new film of the norton disaster terrifying footage of death in the skies only on newsline saturday at ten theyd run that sucker every half hour until showtime by saturday night the whole country would be watching marty adlibbed his standup and he did it well now they were back in the car heading toward the norton gate they were even a few minutes ahead of schedule whos the company contact he said woman named singleton a woman dark eyebrows up again whats the deal shes a vicepresident late thirties and shes on the investigation team marty held out his hand give me the file and the notes he started to read through them in the car because you realize what we have to do now dont you jennifer the segments all moved around that tape runs maybe four fourthirty and you may show parts of it twicei would so you wont have much time for barker and the others its going to be the tape and the norton spokesman thats the core of the piece so there isnt any choice we have to nail this woman cold jennifer said nothing she waited while marty thumbed through the file wait just a minute here marty said he was staring at the file are you kidding me no jennifer said this is dynamite reardon said whered you get it norton sent it to me in a background package three days ago by accident bad accident marty said especially for ms singleton war room pm casey was crossing the plant heading over to iaa when her cell phone rang it was steve nieto the fixer in vancouver bad news nieto said i went to the hospital yesterday hes dead cerebral edema mike lee wasnt around so they asked me if i could identify the body and steve she said not on a cell phone send me a telex okay but dont send it here send it to ft in yuma really yes okay she hung up and entered hangar where the tape strips were laid out on the floor she wanted to talk to ringer about the pilots hat theyd found that hat was critical to the story as it was now becoming clear to casey she had a sudden thought and called norma listen i think i know where that fax came from about the inflight magazine does it matter yes call centinela hospital at the airport ask for a stewardess named kay liang and this is what i want you to ask her better write it down she spoke to norma for several minutes then hung up immediately her cell phone rang again casey singleton marder screamed where are you for chrissakes hangar four she said im trying to youre supposed to be here marder screamed for the interview the interviews four oclock they moved it up theyre here now now yes theyre all here the crew everybody theyre setting up theyre all waiting for you its now casey which was how she found herself in the war room sitting in a chair with a makeup woman daubing at her face the war room was full of people there were guys setting up big lights on stands and taping sheets of cardboard to the ceiling other men were taping microphones to the table and to the walls there were two camera crews setting up each with two camerasfour cameras in all pointing in opposite directions two chairs had been arranged at opposite sides of the table one for her one for the interviewer she thought it was inappropriate that they were taping in the war room she didnt know why marder had agreed to it she thought it was disrespectful that this room where they worked and argued and struggled to understand what happened to planes in flight had been turned into a prop for a television show and she didnt like it casey was offbalance everything was happening too fast the makeup woman kept asking her to keep her head still to close her eyes then open them eileen marders secretary came over and thrust a manila folder in her hands john wanted to make sure you had this she said casey tried to look at the folder please the makeup woman said i need you to look up for a minute just a minute then you can go jennifer malone the producer came over with a cheerful smile hows everything today ms singleton fine thanks casey said still looking up for makeup barbara malone said to the makeup woman make sure you get the uh and she waved her hand toward casey a vague gesture i will the makeup woman said get the what casey said a touchup the makeup woman said nothing malone said ill give you a minute to finish here and then marty should be in to meet you and well go over the general areas were covering before we start okay malone went away the makeup woman barbara continued to daub at caseys face im going to give you a little under the eyes she said so you dont look so tired ms singleton casey recognized the voice at once a voice shed heard for years the makeup woman jumped back and casey saw marty reardon standing in front of her reardon was in shirtsleeves and a tie he had kleenex around his collar he held out his hand marty reardon nice to meet you hi she said thanks for your help with this reardon said well try to make it as painless as possible okay you know of course were on tape reardon said so if you have a bobble or something dont worry well just cut it if at any time you want to restate an answer go ahead and do that you can say exactly what you want to say okay primarily well be talking about the transpacific flight but im going to have to touch on some other matters as well somewhere along the line ill ask about the china sale and therell probably be some questions about the union response if we have time but i dont really want to get into those other issues i want to stay with transpacific youre a member of the investigation team yes all right fine i have a tendency to jump around in my questions dont let that bother you were really here to understand the situation as best we can okay ill see you later then reardon said he smiled and turned away the makeup woman moved back in front of her again look up she said casey stared at the ceiling hes very nice the makeup woman said a sweet man underneath it all dotes on his children she heard malone call out how much more time guys someone said five minutes sound were ready just give us the bodies the makeup woman began to powder caseys neck casey winced feeling twinges of pain you know the woman said i have a number you can call for what its a very good organization very good people psychologists mostly and extremely discreet they can help you with what look left please he must have hit you pretty hard casey said i fell sure i understand ill leave my card in case you change your mind the makeup woman said using the powder puff hmm i better get some base on that to take the blue out she turned back to her box got a piece of sponge with makeup on it she began to daub it onto caseys neck i cant tell you how much i see in my line of work and the woman always denies it but domestic violence has to be stopped casey said i live alone i know i know the makeup woman said men count on your silence my own husband jeez he wouldnt go into counseling i finally left with the kids casey said you dont understand i understand that when this violence is going on you think theres nothing you can do thats part of the depression the hopelessness the makeup woman said but sooner or later we all face the truth malone came over did marty tell you were mostly doing the accident and hell probably start with that but he may mention the china sale and the unions just take your time and dont worry if he jumps around from one thing to another he does that look right the makeup woman said doing the other side of her neck casey turned to the right a man came over and said maam can i give you this and he thrust a plastic box into her hands with a dangling wire what is it casey said look right please the makeup woman said its the radio mike ill help you with it in a minute her cell phone rang in her purse on the floor beside her chair turn that off someone shouted casey reached for it flipped it open its mine oh sorry she brought the phone to her ear john marder said did you get the folder from eileen yes did you look at it not yet she said just lift your chin a little the makeup woman said on the telephone marder said the folder documents everything we talked about parts report on the reverser cowl everything its all there uhhuh okay just wanted to make sure youre all set im all set she said good were counting on you she clicked the phone off turning the power switch off chin up the makeup woman said thats a girl when makeup was finished casey stood and the woman brushed her shoulders with a little brush and put hair spray in her hair then she took casey into the bathroom and showed her how to thread the mike wire up under her blouse through her bra and clip it to her lapel the wire ran back down inside her skirt then back up to the radio box the woman hooked the box to the waistband of caseys skirt and turned the power on remember she said from now on youre live they can hear whatever you say okay casey said she adjusted her clothes she felt the box pinching at her waist the wire against the skin of her chest she felt cramped and uncomfortable the makeup woman led her back into the war room holding her by the elbow casey felt like a gladiator being taken into the arena inside the war room the lights were glaring the room was very hot she was led to her seat at the table told to watch she didnt trip over the camera cables and helped to sit down there were two cameras behind her there were two cameras facing her the cameraman behind her asked her to please move her chair an inch to the right she did a man came over and adjusted her microphone clip because he said there was clothing noise on the opposite side reardon was attaching his own microphone without assistance chatting with the cameraman then he slipped easily into his chair he looked relaxed and casual he faced her smiled at her nothing to worry about he said piece of cake malone said lets go guys theyre in the chairs its hot in here a camera ready b camera ready sound ready lets have the lights malone said casey had thought the lights were already on but suddenly new harsh lights blazed down at her from all directions she felt as if she were in the middle of a glaring furnace camera check malone said fine here were fine all right malone said roll tape the interview began war room pm marty reardon met her eyes smiled and gestured to the room so this is where it all happens casey nodded this is where the norton specialists meet to analyze aircraft accidents yes and youre part of that team yes youre vicepresident of quality assurance at norton aircraft yes been with the company five years yes they call this room the war room dont they some do yes why is that she paused she couldnt think of any way to describe the arguments in this room the flares of temper the outbursts that accompanied every attempt to clarify an aircraft incident without saying something he could take out of context she said its just a nickname the war room reardon said maps charts battle plans pressure tension under siege your company norton aircraft is under siege at the moment isnt it im not sure what youre referring to casey said reardons eyebrows went up the jaa europes joint aviation authority is refusing to certify one of your aircraft the n because they say its unsafe actually the planes already certified but and youre about to sell fifty ns to china but now the chinese too are said to be concerned about the safety of the plane she didnt get angry at the innuendo she focused on reardon the rest of the room seemed to fade away she said im not aware of any chinese concerns but you are aware reardon said of the reason behind these safety concerns earlier this week a very serious accident involving an n aircraft yes transpacific flight an accident in midair over the pacific ocean yes three people died and how many injured i believe fiftysix she said she knew it sounded awful no matter how she said it fiftysix injured reardon intoned broken necks broken limbs concussions brain damage two people paralyzed for life reardon trailed off looking at her he hadnt asked a question she said nothing she waited in the glaring heat of the lights how do you feel about that she said i think everyone at norton feels very great concern for air safety thats why we test our airframes to three times the design life very great concern do you think thats an adequate response casey hesitated what was he saying im sorry she said im afraid i dont follow doesnt the company have an obligation to build safe aircraft of course and we do not everyone agrees reardon said the jaa doesnt agree the chinese may not agree doesnt the company have an obligation to fix the design of an aircraft which it knows to be unsafe what do you mean what i mean reardon said is that what happened to flight has happened before many times before on other ns isnt that true no casey said no reardons eyebrows shot up no casey said firmly this was the moment she thought she was stepping off the cliff this is the first time yes well then reardon said perhaps you can explain this list he produced a sheet of paper held it up she knew from across the room what it was this is a list of slats episodes on the n going back to right after the plane was introduced eight episodes eight separate episodes transpacific is the ninth thats not accurate well tell me why casey went through as briefly as she could the way airworthiness directives worked she explained why they had been issued for the n how the problem had been solved except for foreign carriers that had failed to comply how there had not been a domestic incident since reardon listened with continuously raised eyebrows as if he had never heard such an outlandish thing before so let me see if i understand he said in your view the company has followed the rules by issuing these air directives which are supposed to fix the problem no casey said the company has fixed the problem has it were told slats deployment is the reason people died on flight thats incorrect she was now dancing on a tightrope working a fine and technical line and she knew it if he asked her did the slats deploy she would be in trouble she waited breathlessly for the next question reardon said the people who told us the slats deployed are wrong i dont know how theyd know casey said she decided to go farther yes theyre wrong fred barker former faa investigator is wrong yes the jaa is wrong well as you know the jaa is actually delaying certification over noise emissions and lets just stay with this for a moment reardon said she remembered what gershon had said hes not interested in information the jaa is wrong he said repeating the question this called for a complicated answer she thought how could she put it briefly theyre wrong to say the aircraft is unsafe so in your opinion reardon said there is absolutely no substance to these criticisms of the n thats correct it is an excellent aircraft a welldesigned aircraft yes a safe aircraft absolutely youd fly in it whenever possible your family your friends absolutely no hesitation whatsoever thats right so what was your reaction when you saw the tape on television from flight he ii get you saying yes then hit you from left field but casey was ready for it all of us here knew that it was a very tragic accident when i saw the tape i felt very sad for the people involved you felt sad yes didnt it shake your conviction about the aircraft make you question the n no why not because the n has a superb safety record one of the best in the industry one of the best in the industry reardon smirked yes mr reardon she said let me ask you last year fortythree thousand americans died in automobile accidents four thousand people drowned two thousand people choked to death on food do you know how many died in domestic commercial transports reardon paused he chuckled i must admit youve stumped the panel its a fair question mr reardon how many died in commercial aircraft last year reardon frowned ill say ill say a thousand fifty casey said fifty people died do you know how many died the year before that sixteen fewer than were killed on bicycles and how many of those died on the n reardon asked eyes narrowed trying to recover none casey said so your point is we have a nation in which fortythree thousand people die every year in cars and nobody worries about it at all they get into cars when theyre drunk when theyre tiredwithout a second thought but these same people are panicked at the thought of getting on an airplane and the reason casey saidis that television consistently exaggerates the real dangers involved that tape will make people afraid to fly and for no good reason you think the tape shouldnt have been shown i didnt say that but you said it will make people afraidfor no good reason correct is it your view tapes such as these should not be shown she thought where is he going why is he doing this i didnt say that im asking you now i said casey replied that those tapes create an inaccurate perception of the danger of air travel including the danger of the n ive already said i think the n is safe so you dont think such tapes should be shown to the public what the hell was he doing she still couldnt figure it out she didnt answer him she was thinking hard trying to see where he was going with this she had a sinking feeling she knew in your view ms singleton should such tapes be suppressed no casey said they should not be suppressed no has norton aircraft ever suppressed any tapes uhoh she thought she was trying to figure out how many people knew of the tape a lot she decided ellen fong ziegler the people at video imaging maybe a dozen people maybe more ms singleton reardon said are you personally aware of any other tape of this accident just lie amos had said yes she said i know of another tape and have you seen the tape i have reardon said its upsetting horrifying isnt it she thought they have it theyd gotten the tape she would have to proceed very carefully now its tragic casey said what happened on flight is a tragedy she felt tired her shoulders ached from tension ms singleton let me put it to you directly did norton aircraft suppress this tape noeyebrows up the look of surprise but you certainly didnt release it did you no why not that tape was found on the aircraft casey said and is being used in our ongoing investigation we didnt feel it appropriate to release it until our investigation is completed you werent covering up the wellknown defects of the n no not everyone agrees with you about that ms singleton because newsline obtained a copy of that tape from a consciencestricken norton employee who felt that the company was covering up who felt the tape should be made public casey held herself rigid she didnt move are you surprised reardon said his lips in a curl she didnt answer her mind was spinning she had to plan her next move reardon was smirking a patronizing smile enjoying the moment now have you yourself actually seen this tape mr reardon she asked the question in a tone that implied the tape didnt exist that reardon was making it all up oh yes reardon said solemnly i have seen the tape its difficult painful to watch it is a terrible damning record of what happened on that n aircraft youve seen it all the way through of course so have my associates in new york so it had already gone to new york she thought careful careful ms singleton was norton ever planning to release that taper its not ours to release wed return it to the owners after the investigation was completed it would be up to the owners to decide what to do with it after the investigation was completed reardon was shaking his head forgive me but for a company you say is committed to flight safety there seems to be a consistent pattern of coverups here coverups ms singleton if there was a problem with the airplanea serious problem an ongoing problem a problem the company knew aboutwould you tell us but there is no problem isnt there reardon was looking down now at the papers in front of him if the n is really as safe as you say ms singleton then how do you explain this and he handed her a sheet of paper she took it glanced at the paper jesus christ she said reardon had his media moment he had gotten her unguarded offbalance reaction she knew it would look bad she knew there was no way for her to recover from it no matter what she said from this point on but she was focused on the paper in front of her stunned to see it now it was a xerox of the cover sheet of a report done three years ago norton aircraft internal review action committee executive summary and following was a list of the names of the committee members beginning with her name since she had chaired the committee casey knew that there was nothing improper about the study nothing improper in its findings but everything about it even the nameunstable flight characteristics appeared damning it was going to be very difficult for her to explain hes not interested in information and this was an internal company report she thought it should never have been released it was three years oldnot that many people would even remember it existed how had reardon gotten it she glanced at the top of the page saw a fax number and the name of the sending station norton qa it had come from her own office how who had done it richman she thought grimly richman had placed this report in the packet of press material on her desk the material casey had told norma to fax to newsline how had richman known about it marder marder knew all about the study marder had been program manager on the n hed ordered it and now marder had arranged for the study to be released while she was on television because ms singleton reardon said she looked up back into the lights yes do you recognize this report yes i do she said is that your own name at the bottom yes reardon handed her three other sheets the rest of the executive summary in fact you were the chairman of a secret committee inside norton that investigated flight instabilities of the n isnt that right how was she going to do this she thought hes not interested in information it wasnt a secret she said its the kind of study we frequently conduct on operational aspects of our aircraft once theyre in service by your own admission its a study of flight instabilities look she said this study is a good thing a good thing eyebrows up astonished yes she said after the first slats incident four years ago there was a question about whether the aircraft had unstable handling characteristics in certain configurations we didnt avoid that question we didnt ignore it we addressed it headonby forming a committee to test the aircraft in various conditions and see if it were true and we concluded let me read reardon said from your own report the aircraft relies upon computers for basic stabilization yes she said all modern aircraft use the aircraft has demonstrated marked sensitivity to manual handling during attitude change casey was looking at the pages now following his quotes yes but if youll read the rest of the sentence you will reardon cut in pilots have reported the aircraft cannot be controlled but youre taking all this out of context am i eyebrows up these are all statements from your report a secret norton report i thought you said you wanted to hear what i had to say she was starting to get angry she knew it showed and didnt care reardon leaned back in his chair spread his hands the picture of reason by all means ms singleton then let me explain this study was carried out to determine whether the n had a stability problem we concluded it did not and so you say i thought i was going to be allowed to explain of course then let me put your quotes in context casey said the report says the n relies on computers all modem aircraft rely on computers for stabilization in flight the reason is not because they cant be flown by pilots they can theres no problem with that but the carriers now want extremely fuelefficient aircraft maximum fuel efficiency comes from minimal drag as the aircraft flies through the air reardon was waving his hand a dismissing gesture im sorry but all this is beside to minimize drag casey continued the aircraft has to hold a very precise altitude or position in the air the most efficient position is slightly nose up the computers hold the aircraft in this position during ordinary flight none of this is unusual not unusual flight instabilities reardon said he was always shifting the subject never letting her catch up im coming to that were eager to hear open sarcasm she struggled to control her temper however bad things were now it would be worse if she lost her temper you read a sentence before she said let me finish it the aircraft has demonstrated marked sensitivity to manual handling during attitude change but this sensitivity is entirely within designparameters and presents no difficulty to properly certified pilots thats the rest of the sentence but youve admitted there is sensitive handling isnt that just another word for instability no she said sensitive does not mean unstable the plane cant be controlled reardon said shaking his head it can you did a study because you were worried we did a study because its our job to make sure the aircraft is safe she said and we are sure it is safe a secret study it wasnt secret never distributed never shown to the public it was an internal report she said you have nothing to hide no she said then why havent you told us the truth about transpacific flight the truth were told your accident team already has a preliminary finding on the probable cause is that not true were close she said close ms singleton do you have a finding or not casey stared at reardon the question hung in the air im very sorry the cameraman said behind her but we have to reload camera reloading reloading reardon looked as if he had been slapped but almost immediately he recovered to be continued he said smiling at casey he was relaxed he knew he had beaten her he got up from his chair turned his back to her the big lights clicked off the room seemed suddenly almost dark somebody turned the airconditioning back on casey got up too she pulled the radio mike off her waist the makeup woman came running over to her holding out a powder puff casey held up her hand in a minute she said with the lights off she saw richman heading for the door casey hurried after him bldg pm she caught him in the hallway grabbed him by the arm spun him around you son of a bitch hey richman said take it easy he smiled nodded past her shoulder looking back she saw the soundman and one of the cameramen coming out into the hallway furious casey pushed richman backward shoving him through the door to the womens room richman started to laugh jeez casey i didnt know you cared then they were in the bathroom she pushed him back against the row of sinks you little bastard she hissed i dont know what the hell you think youre doing but you released that report and im going to youre going to do nothing richman said his voice suddenly cold he threw her hands off him you still dont get it do you its over casey you just blew the china sale youre finished she stared at him not understanding he was strong confidenta different person edgartons finished the china sales finished and youre finished he smiled just the way john said it would happen marder she thought marder was behind it if the china sale goes marder will go too edgarton will see to that richman was shaking his head pityingly no he wont edgartons sitting on his ass in hong kong hell never know what hit him by noon sunday marderll be the new president of norton aircraft itll take him ten minutes with the board because weve made a much bigger deal with korea a hundred and ten aircraft firm and an option on thirtyfive more sixteen billion dollars the board will be thrilled korea casey said she was trying to put it together because it was a huge order the biggest in the history of the company but why would because he gave them the wing richman said and in return theyre more than happy to buy a hundred and ten aircraft they dont care about sensationalistic american press they know the planes safe hes giving them the wing sure its a killer deal yeah casey said it kills the company global economy richman said get with the program but youre gutting the company she said sixteen billion dollars richman said the minute thats announced norton stockll go through the roof everybody gets well everybody but the people in the company she thought this is a done deal richman said all we needed was somebody to publicly trash the n and you just did that for us casey sighed her shoulders dropped looking past richman she saw herself in the mirror makeup was pancaked around her neck and now it was cracking her eyes were dark she looked haggard exhausted defeated so i suggest richman said that you ask me very politely what you should do next because your only choice now is to follow orders do as youre told be a good girl and maybe john will give you severance say three months otherwise youre out on your fucking ass he leaned close to her do you understand what im saying yes casey said im waiting ask politely in her exhaustion her mind raced examining the options trying to see a way out but she could see no way out newsline would run the story marders plan would succeed she was defeated she had been defeated from the very beginning defeated from the first day richman had shown up im still waiting richman said she looked at his smooth face smelled his cologne the little bastard was enjoying this and in a moment of fury of deep outrage she suddenly saw another possibility from the beginning she had tried so hard to do the right thing to solve the problem of she had been honest she had been straight and it had just gotten her into trouble or had it you have to face facts here richman said its over theres nothing you can do she pushed away from the sink watch me she said and she walked out of the room war room pm casey slipped into her seat the soundman came over and clipped the radio pack to the waist of her dress say a few words for me will you please just for level testing testing im getting tired she said thats fine thank you she saw richman slip into the room and stand with his back to the far wall he had a faint smile on his face he didnt look worried he was confident there was nothing she could do marder had made a huge deal he was shipping the wing he was gutting the company and hed used casey to do it reardon dropped into his seat opposite her shrugged his shoulders adjusted his tie he smiled at her how you holding up im okay hot in here isnt it he said he glanced at his watch were almost finished malone came over and whispered in reardons ear the whispering continued for some time reardon said really and his eyebrows went up then he nodded several times finally he said got it he began to shuffle his papers going through the folder in front of him malone said guys we ready a camera ready b camera ready sound ready roll tape she said this is it casey thought she took a deep breath looked expectantly at reardon reardon smiled at her youre an executive at norton aircraft yes been here five years yes youre a trusted highly placed executive she nodded if he only knew now there is an incident flight involving an aircraft you say is perfectly safe correct yet three people died and more than fifty were injured yes the footage which weve all seen is horrifying your incident review team has been working around the clock and now we hear you have a finding yes she said you know what happened on that flight careful she had to do this very very carefully because the truth was she didnt know she just had a very strong suspicion they still had to put the sequence together to verify that things had happened in a certain order the chain of causation they didnt know for sure we are close to a finding casey said needless to say were eager to hear we will announce it tomorrow casey said behind the lights she saw richmans startled reaction he hadnt been expecting that the little bastard was trying to see where she was going let him try across the table from her reardon turned aside and malone whispered in his ear reardon nodded turned back to casey ms singleton if you know now why wait because this was a serious accident as you yourself saidtheres already been a great deal of unwarranted speculation from many sources norton aircraft feels it is important to act responsibly before we say anything publicly we have to confirm our findings at flight test using the same aircraft that was involved in the accident when will you flight test tomorrow morning ah reardon sighed regretfully but thats too late for our broadcast you understand that youre denying your company the opportunity to respond to these serious charges casey had her answer ready weve scheduled the flight test for five am she said well hold a press conference immediately afterwardtomorrow at noon noon reardon said his expression was bland but she knew he was working it out noon in la was pm in new york plenty of time to make the evening news in both new york and los angeles nortons preliminary finding would be widely reported on both local and network news and newsline which aired at pm saturday night would be outofdate depending on what emerged from the press conference the newsline segment edited the night before would be ancient history it might even be embarrassing reardon sighed on the other hand he said we want to be fair to you naturally casey said norton administration pm i dont know richman said i think she may be planning something shes pretty smart john not smart enough marder said fuck her marder said to richman it doesnt make any difference what she does now but if shes scheduling a flight test who cares marder said and i think shes going to let the news crews film it so what flight test will only make the story worse she has no idea what caused the accident and she has no idea what will happen if she takes that transpacific plane up they probably cant reproduce the event and there may be problems nobody knows about like what that aircraft went through very severe gforce loads marder said it may have undetected structural damage anything can happen when they take that plane up marder made a dismissive wave this changes nothing newsline airs from ten to eleven saturday night early saturday evening ill notify the board that some bad publicity is coming our way and we have to schedule an emergency meeting sunday morning hal cant get back from hong kong in time and his friends on the board will drop him when they hear about a sixteenbilliondollar deal theyve all got stock they know what the announcement will do to their shares im the next president of this company and nobody can do a thing to stop it not hal edgarton and certainly not casey singleton war room pm the cameras were packed up the white foam sheets removed from the ceiling the microphones unclipped the electrical boxes and camera cases removed but the negotiations dragged on ed fuller the lanky head of legal was there so was teddy rawley the pilot and two engineers who worked on ft to answer technical questions that arose for newsline malone now did all of the talking reardon paced in the background occasionally stopping to whisper in her ear his commanding presence seemed to have vanished with the bright lights he now appeared tired fretful and impatient malone began by saying that since newsline was doing an entire segment on the norton n it was in the interest of the company to allow newsline to film the flight test casey said that presented no problem flight tests were documented with dozens of video cameras mounted both inside and outside the plane the newsline people could watch the entire test on monitors on the ground they could have the film afterward for their broadcast no malone said that wouldnt be sufficient newslines crews had to actually be on the plane casey said mat was impossible that no airframe manufacturer had ever allowed an outside crew on a flight test she was she said already making a concession to let them see the video on the ground not good enough malone said ed fuller broke in to explain it was a question of liability norton simply couldnt allow uninsured nonemployees on the test you realize of course there is inherent danger in flight test its simply inescapable malone said that newsline would accept any risk and sign waivers of liability ed fuller said he would have to draw up the waivers but that newslines lawyers would have to approve them and there wasnt time for that malone said she could get approval from newslines lawyers in an hour any time of the day or night fuller shifted ground he said if norton was going to let newsline see the flight test he wanted to be sure that the results of that test were accurately reported he said he wanted to approve the edited film malone said that journalistic ethics forbade that and in any case there wasnt time if the flight test ended around noon she would have to cut film in the truck and transmit it to new york at once fuller said the problem for the company remained he wanted the flight test portrayed accurately they went back and forth finally malone said she would include thirty seconds of unedited comment on the outcome of the flight by a norton spokesperson this would be taken from the press conference fuller demanded a minute they compromised on forty seconds we have another problem fuller said if we let you film the flight test we dont want you to use the tape you obtained today showing the actual incident no way malone said the tape was going to be aired you characterized the tape as having been obtained from a norton employee fuller said thats incorrect we want the provenance accurately stated well we certainly got it from someone who works for norton no fuller said you didnt its one of your subcontractors no its not i can provide you with the irs definition of a subcontractor if you like this is a fine point we have already obtained a sworn statement from the receptionist christine barron she is not an employee of norton aircraft she is not in fact an employee of video imaging she is a temp from an agency whats the point here we want you to state the facts accurately that you obtained the tape from sources outside the company malone shrugged as i said this is a fine point then whats the problem malone thought for a minute okay she said fuller slid a piece of paper across the table this brief document conveys that understanding sign it malone looked at reardon reardon shrugged malone signed it i dont understand what all the fuss is about she started to push it back to fuller and paused two crews on the aircraft during the flight test is that our agreement no fuller said that was never the agreement your crews will watch the test on the ground that wont work for us casey said that the newsline crews could come to the test area they could film the preparations the takeoff and landing but they couldnt actually come on the plane during the flight sorry malone said teddy rawley cleared his throat i dont think you understand the situation ms malone he said you cant be walking around filming inside the airplane during a flight test everybody on board has to be strapped in in a fourpoint harness you cant even get up to pee and you cant have lights or batteries because they generate magnetic fields that might disrupt our readings we dont need lights she said we can shoot available light you dont understand rawley said it can get pretty hairy up there thats why we have to be mere malone said ed fuller cleared his throat let me be entirely clear ms malone he said under no circumstances is this company going to allow your film crew on board that aircraft it is absolutely out of the question malones face was rigid set maam rawley said youve got to realize theres a reason we test over the desert over large uninhabited spaces you mean it might crash i mean we dont know what might happen trust me on this you want to be on the ground malone shook her head no we must have our crews on board maam theres going to be big gforces casey said therell be thirty cameras all over the plane theyll cover every possible anglecockpit wings passenger cabin everywhere youre getting exclusive use of the film no one will know your cameras arent getting the footage malone glowered but casey knew that she had made the point the woman only cared about the visuals i want to place the cameras she said uhuh rawley said i have to be able to say our cameras are on board malone said i have to be able to say that in the end casey hammered out a compromise newsline would be allowed to position two lockeddown cameras anywhere in the plane to cover the test flight they would take the feed directly from these cameras in addition they would be allowed to use footage from other cameras mounted in the interior finally newsline would be allowed to shoot a standup with reardon outside building where the assembly line was located norton would provide transportation for the newsline crews to the arizona test facility later in the day would put them up in a local motel would transport them to the test facility in the morning and back to la in the afternoon malone pushed the paper back to fuller deal she said reardon was looking fretfully at his watch as he left with malone to shoot the standup casey was alone with rawley and fuller in the war room fuller sighed i hope weve made the right decision he turned to casey i did what you asked when you called me earlier from the video company yes ed she said you were perfect but i saw the tape he said its dreadful im afraid that whatever the flight test shows that tape will be the only thing anybody remembers casey said if anybody ever sees that tape my concern fuller said is that newsline will run that tape no matter what i think they wont casey said not when we get through with them fuller sighed i hope youre right high stakes yes she said high stakes teddy said you better tell them to bring warm clothing you too babe and another thing i watched that woman she thinks shes going to get on the plane tomorrow yeah probably and you too right teddy said maybe casey said you better think about this real good teddy said because you saw the qar video casey that airplane exceeded its design gloads by a hundred and sixty percent that guy subjected the airframe to forces it was never built to withstand and tomorrow im going to go up and do it again she shrugged doherty checked the fuse she said theyve xrayed and yeah he checked teddy said but not thoroughly ordinarily wed go over that fuselage for a month before we put it back in active service wed xray every join on the plane that hasnt been done what are you saying im saying teddy said that when i put that aircraft through those same gforce loads theres a chance that the airframe will fail you trying to scare me casey said no im just telling you this is serious casey real world it could happen outside bldg pm no aircraft company in history reardon said has ever permitted a television crew on a flight test but so important is this test to the future of norton aircraft so confident are they of the outcome that they have agreed to allow our crews to film so today for the first time we will be seeing footage of the actual plane involved in flight the controversial norton n aircraft critics say its a deathtrap the company says its safe the flight test will prove whos right reardon paused done jennifer said you need something for the cut yeah where do they do the test anyway yuma okay reardon said standing in afternoon sun before building he looked down at his feet and said in a low confidential voice we are here at the norton test facility in yuma arizona its five oclock in the morning and the norton team is making final preparations to take flight into the air he looked up what times dawn damned if i know jennifer said cover it all right reardon said he looked down at his feet again and intoned in the early predawn tension mounts in the predawn darkness tension mounts as dawn breaks tension mounts that should do it jennifer said how do you want to handle the wrap he said youve got to cover it both ways marty i mean do we win or what cover it both ways to be sure reardon looked down at his feet again as the aircraft lands the team is jubilant happy faces all around the flight is successful norton has made its point at least for now he took a breath as the aircraft lands the team is muted norton is devastated the deadly controversy over the n continues to rage he looked up enough she said you better give me an oncamera about the controversy continues to rage we can close with that good idea marty always thought it was a good idea for him to appear on camera he stood erect set his jaw and faced the camera here in this building where the n is built no behind me is the building where no hold on he shook his head faced the camera again and yet the bitter controversy over the n will not die here in this building where the aircraft is made workers are confident that it is a safe reliable aircraft but critics of the n remain unconvinced will there be another harvest of death in the skies only time will tell this is martin reardon for newsline burbank california he blinked too corny too much on the money great marty he was already unclipping his mike removing the radio pack from his belt he pecked jennifer on the cheek im out of here he said and sprinted to the waiting car jennifer turned to her crew pack up guys she said were going to arizona saturday norton test facility yuma arizona am a thin streak of red was starting to appear behind the flat range of the gila mountains to the east the sky overhead was deep indigo a few stars still visible the air was very cold casey could see her breath she zipped up her windbreaker and stamped her feet trying to stay warm on the runway lights shone up at the transpacific widebody as the ft team finished installing the video cameras there were men on the wings around the engines by the landing gear the newsline crew was already out filming the preparations malone stood alongside casey watching them jesus its cold she said casey went into the right test station a low spanishstyle bungalow beside the tower inside the room was filled with monitors each displaying the feed from a single camera most of the cameras were focused on specific partsshe found the camera on the right locking pinand so the room had a technical industrial feeling it was not very exciting this isnt what i expected malone said casey pointed around the room theres the cockpit high mount down cockpit facing back at the pilot you see rawley there in the chair the interior cabin looking aft interior cabin looking forward looking out on right wing the left wing those are your main interiors and well also have the chase plane chase plane an f fighter follows the widebody all through the flight so well have those cameras too malone frowned i dont know she said in a disappointed voice i thought it would be more you know glitzy were still on the ground malone was frowning unhappy these angles on the cabin she said who will be in there during the flight nobody you mean the seats will be empty right its a test flight that isnt going to look very good malone said but thats how it is on a test flight casey said this is how its done but it doesnt look good malone said this isnt compelling there should be people in the seats at least in some of them cant we put some people on board cant i go on board casey shook her head its a dangerous flight she said the airframe was badly stressed by the accident we dont know what will happen malone snorted oh come on there arent any lawyers here how about it casey just looked at her she was a foolish kid who knew nothing about the world who was just interested in a look who lived for appearances who skimmed over surfaces she knew she should refuse instead she heard herself say you wont like it youre telling me its not safe im telling you that you wont like it im going on malone said she looked at casey her expression an open challenge so how about you in her mind casey could hear marty reardons voice as he said despite her repeated insistence that the n was safe nortons own spokesperson casey singleton refused to board the plane for the flight test she said that the reason she wouldnt fly on it was what casey didnt have an answer at least not an answer that would work for television not an answer that would play and suddenly the days of strain the effort to try and solve the incident the effort to contrive an appearance for television the effort to make sure she didnt say a single sentence that could be taken out of context the distortion of everything in her life for this unwarranted intrusion of television made her furious she knew exactly what was coming malone had seen the videos but she didnt understand they were real okay casey said lets go they went out to the plane aboard tpa am jennifer shivered it was cold inside the airplane and under fluorescent lights the rows of empty seats the long aisles made it seem even colder she was faintly shocked when she recognized in places the damage that she had seen on the videotape this was where it happened she thought this was the plane there were still bloody footprints on the ceiling broken luggage bins dented fiberglass panels and a lingering odor even worse in some places the plastic panels had been pulled off around the windows so that she could see the naked silver padding the bundles of wires it was suddenly all too clear that she was in a big metal machine she wondered if she had made a mistake but by then singleton was gesturing for her to take a seat right in the front of the center cabin facing a lockeddown video camera jennifer sat beside singleton and waited as one of the norton technicians a man in coveralls tightened the shoulder harness around her body it was one of those harnesses like the stewardesses wore on regular flights two green canvas straps came over each shoulder meeting at the waist then there was another wide canvas strap that went across her thighs heavy metal buckles clamped it all in place it looked serious the man in coveralls pulled the straps tight grunting jeez jennifer said does it have to be that tight maam you need it as tight as you can stand it the man said if you can breathe its too loose can you feel the way it is now yes she said thats how you want it when you put it back on now heres your release here he showed her pull that now why do i need to know case of emergency pull it please she pulled the release the straps sprang away from her body the pressure released and just do it up again yourself if you dont mind jennifer put the contraption back together just as he had done it before it wasnt difficult these people made such a fuss about nothing now tighten it please maam she pulled the straps tighter if i need it tighter ill tighten it later maam he said by the time you realize you need it tighter itll be too late do it now please alongside her singleton was calmly putting the harness on cinching it down brutally the straps dug into singletons thighs pulled hard on her shoulders singleton sighed sat back i believe you ladies are prepared the man said you have a pleasant flight he turned and went out the door the pilot that rawley character came back from the cockpit shaking his head ladies he said i urge you not to do this he was looking mostly at singleton he almost seemed to be angry at her singleton said fly the plane teddy thats your best offer best and final he disappeared the intercom clicked prepare to close please the doors were closed clicked shut thunk thank the air was still cold jennifer shivered in her harness she looked over her shoulder at the rows of empty seats then she looked at singleton singleton stared straight ahead jennifer heard the whine of the jet engines as they started up a low moan at first then rising in pitch the intercom clicked she heard the pilot say tower this is norton zero one request clearance for ft station check click roger zero one taxi across runway two left contact point six click roger tower the plane began to move rolling forward out the windows she saw the sky was lightening after a few moments the plane stopped again what are they doing jennifer asked weighing it singleton answered they weigh before and after to guarantee weve simulated flying conditions on some kind of scale built into the concrete click teddy need uh about two feet more on nose click hangon the whine of the engines increased jennifer felt the plane inch forward slowly then it stopped again click thank you got it youre at fiftyseven two seven gw and co is thirtytwo percent mac right where you want to be click bye guys click tower zero one request clearance for takeoff click cleared runway three contact ground point six three when off the runway click roger then the plane began to roll forward the engines increasing from a whine to a full deep roar the sound building until it sounded louder to jennifer than any engines she had beard before she felt the thump of me wheels going over the cracks in the runway and then suddenly they had lifted off the plane going up the sky blue out the windows airborne click ohkay ladies we are going to proceed to flight level three seven zero thats thirtyseven thousand feet and we are going to circle there between yuma station and carstairs nevada for the duration of this excursion everybody comfy if you look to your left you will see our chase plane coming alongside jennifer looked out and saw a silver jet fighter glinting in the morning light it was very close to their aircraft close enough to see the pilot wave then suddenly it slid backward click uh you probably wont see much more of him hell be staying high and behind us out of our wake the safest place to be right now we are coming up on twelve thousand feet you may want to swallow ms malone were not creeping up like the airlines jennifer swallowed heard her ears pop loudly she said why are we going up so fast he wants to get to altitude quickly to cold soak the plane cold soak at thirtyseven thousand feet the air temperature is minus fifty degrees the airplane is warmer than that right now and different parts will cool off at different rates but eventually on a long flightsuch as a long pacific crossingall the parts of the plane will reach that temperature one of the questions for the irt is whether the cable rigging behaves differently at cold temperature cold soaking means putting the plane up at altitude long enough to cool it down then we begin the test how long are we talking jennifer said standard cold soak is two hours we have to sit here for two hours singleton looked at her you wanted to come you mean we spend two hours doing nothing click oh well try to amuse you ms malone the pilot said were now at twentytwo thousand feet and climbing itll be another few minutes to cruise altitude we are at two eightyseven kias and we will stabilize at three forty kias which is point eight mach eighty percent of the speed of sound thats the usual cruise speed for commercial aircraft everybody comfy jennifer said can you hear us i can hear you and see you and if you look to your right you can see me a monitor in the cabin in front of them came on jennifer saw the pilots shoulder his head the controls arrayed in front of him bright light out the window now they were high enough that full sunlight streamed in through the windows but the ulterior of the plane was still cold because she was sitting in the center of the cabin jennifer could not see the ground out the windows she looked at singleton singleton smiled click ah okay we are now at flight level three seven zero doppler clear no turbulence a beautiful day in the neighborhood would you ladies please unbuckle your harnesses and come to the cockpit what jennifer thought but singleton was already taking hers off standing up in the cabin i thought we couldnt walk around its okay right now singleton said jennifer climbed out of her harness and walked with singleton up through first class to the cockpit she felt the faint vibration of the airplane beneath her feet but it was quite stable the door to the cockpit was open she saw rawley in there with a second man he didnt introduce and a third who was working with some instrumentation jennifer stood with singleton just outside the cockpit looking in now ms malone rawley said you interviewed mr barker didnt you yes what did he say was the cause of the accident he said the slats deployed uhhuh okay please watch carefully this is the flaps slats handle here we are at cruise speed cruise altitude i am now going to deploy the slats he reached his hand forward to the thing between the seats wait a minute let me get strapped in youre perfectly safe ms malone i want to sit down at least then sit down jennifer started back then realized that singleton was remaining standing by the cockpit door staring at her feeling foolish jennifer went back and stood by singleton deploying slats now rawley pushed the lever down she heard a faint rumble that lasted a few seconds nothing else the nose tilted steadied slats are extended rawley pointed to the instrument panel you see the speed you see the altitude and you see that indicator that says slats we have just duplicated the exact conditions that mr barker insists caused the death of three people on this very same aircraft and as you see nothing happened the attitude is rock solid want to try again yes she said she didnt know what else to say okay slats retracting this time maybe youd like to do it yourself ms malone or maybe youd like to walk over and look at the wings see what actually happens when the slats extend its kind of neat rawley pressed a button ah norton station this is zero one can i have a monitor check he listened a moment okay fine ms malone move a little forward so your friends can see you on that camera up there he pointed up to the ceiling of the cockpit give em a wave jennifer waved feeling foolish ms malone how many more times would you like us to extend and retract the slats to satisfy your cameras well i dont know she was feeling more foolish by the minute the flight test was starting to seem like a trap the footage would make barker look like a fool it would make the whole segment look ridiculous it would make we can do this all day if you like rawley was saying thats the point no problem deploying the slats at cruise speed on the n plane can handle it fine try it once more she said tightly thats the handle there just flip that little metal cover up and pull it down about an inch she knew what he was doing putting her in the shot i think youd better do it yes maam whatever you say rawley pulled the lever down the rumbling occurred again the nose went up slightly exactly as before now rawley said weve got the chase plane getting views for you showing the slats extending so youll have exterior angles showing all the action okay slats retracting she watched impatiently well she said if the slats didnt cause this accident what did singleton spoke for the first time how long has it been now teddy weve been up twentythree minutes is that long enough maybe could happen any minute now what could happen jennifer said the first part of the sequence singleton said that caused the accident the first part of the sequence yes singleton said nearly all aircraft accidents are the result of a sequence of events we call it a cascade its never one thing theres a chain of events one after another on this aircraft we believe the initiating event was an erroneous fault reading caused by a bad part with a sense of dread jennifer said a bad part she was immediately recutting the tape in her mind getting around this awkward point singleton had said it was the initiating event that didnt have to be emphasized especially if it was just a link in the chain of events the next link in the chain was equally importantprobably more important after all what had happened on was terrifying and spectacular it involved the whole airplane and it was surely unreasonable to blame it on a bad part you said there was a chain of events thats right singleton said several events in a sequence that we believe led to the final outcome jennifer felt her shoulders drop they waited nothing happened five minutes went by jennifer was cold she kept glancing at her watch what exactly are we waiting for patience singleton said then there was an electronic ping and she saw amber words flash on the instrument panel it said slats disagree there it is rawley said there what is an indication that the fdau believes the slats are not where theyre supposed to be as you see the slats lever is up so the slats should be stowed and we know they are but the airplane is picking up a reading that they are not stowed in this case we know the warning is coming from a bad proximity sensor in the right wing the proximity sensor should read the presence of the retracted slat but this sensors been damaged and when the sensor gets cold it behaves erratically tells the pilot the slats are extended when theyre not jennifer was shaking her head proximity sensor im not following you what does this have to do with flight singleton said the cockpit on got a warning that something was wrong with the slats warnings like that happen fairly frequently the pilot doesnt know whether something is really wrong or whether the sensor is just acting up so the pilot tries to clear the warning he runs out the slats and retracts them so the pilot on deployed the slats to clear the warning yes but deploying the slats didnt cause the accident no we ve just demonstrated that what did rawley said ladies if you will please take your seats we will now attempt to reproduce the event aboard tpa am in the center passenger cabin casey pulled the harness straps over her shoulders and cinched them tight she looked over at malone who was sweating her face pale tighter casey said i already did casey reached over grabbed her waist strap and pulled as hard as she could malone grunted hey for christs i dont much like you casey said but i dont want your little ass getting hurt on my watch malone wiped her forehead with the back of her hand although the cabin was cold sweat was running down her face casey took out a white paper bag and shoved it under malones thigh and i dont want you throwing up on me she said do you think well need that i guarantee it casey said malones eyes were flicking back and forth listen she said maybe we should call this off change the channel listen malone said maybe i was wrong about what we shouldnt have come on the plane we should have just watched too late now casey said she knew she was being tough with malone because she was frightened herself she didnt think teddy was right about the airframe cracking she didnt think he was foolish enough to go up in a plane that hadnt been thoroughly checked he had hung around every minute of the tests during the structural work the cet because he knew in a few days he was going to have to fly it teddy wasnt stupid but he was a test pilot she thought and all test pilots were crazy click all right ladies we are initiating the sequence everybody strapped in tight yes casey said malone said nothing her mouth was moving but she wasnt saying anything click ah chase alpha this is zero one initiating pitch oscillations now click roger zero one we have you initiate on your mark click norton ground this is zero one monitor check click check confirm one to thirty click here we go fellas mark casey watched on the side monitor which snowed teddy in the cockpit his movements were calm assured his voice relaxed click ladies i have received my slats disagree warning and i am now extending the slats to clear the warning slats are now extended i am out of the autopilot now nose is up speed decreases and i now have a stall casey heard the harsh electronic alarm sounding again and again then the audio warning the recorded voice flat and insistent stall stall stall click i am bringing the nose down to avoid the stall condition the plane nosed over and began to dive it was as if they were going straight down outside the scream of the engines became a shriek caseys body was pressing hard against the harness straps sitting beside her jennifer malone began to scream her mouth open a single unvarying scream that merged with the scream of the engines casey felt dizzy she tried to count how long it was lasting five six seven eight seconds how long had the initial descent been bit by bit the plane began to level to come out of the dive the scream of die engines faded changed to a lower register casey felt her body grow heavy then heavier still then amazingly heavy her cheeks sagging her arms pressed down to the armrests the gforces they were at more than two gs casey now weighed two hundred and fifty pounds she sank lower in the seat pressed down by a giant hand beside her jennifer had stopped screaming and now was making a continuous low groan the sensation of weight decreased as the plane started to climb again at first the climb was reasonable then uncomfortablethen it seemed to be straight up the engines were screaming jennifer was screaming casey tried to count the seconds but couldnt she didnt have the energy to focus and suddenly she felt the pit of her stomach begin to rise followed by nausea and she saw the monitor lift off the floor for a moment held in place by the straps they were weightless at the peak of the climb jennifer threw her hand over her mouth then the plane was going over and down again click second pitch oscillation another steep dive jennifer took her hand away from her mouth and screamed much louder man before casey tried to hold on to the armrests tried to occupy her mind she had forgotten to count she had forgotten to the weight again sinking pressing deep into the chair casey couldnt move she couldnt turn her head then they were climbing again steeper than before the shriek of the engines loud in her ears and she felt jennifer reach for her jennifer grabbing her arm casey turned to look at her and jennifer pale and wildeyed was shouting stop it stop it stop it the plane was coming to the top of the rise her stomach lifting a sickening sensation jennifers stricken look hand clapped to her mouth vomit spurting through her fingers the plane going over another dive click releasing the luggage bins give you a sense of how it was along both aisles the luggage bins above the seats sprang open and twofoot white blocks spilled out they were harmless neoprene foam but they bounced around the cabin like a dense blizzard casey felt them strike her face the back of her head jennifer was retching again trying to pull the bag from under her leg the blocks tumbled forward moving down the cabin toward the cockpit they obscured their view on all sides until one by one they began to fall to the floor roll over and remain mere the whine of the engines changed the sinking drag of added weight the plane was going up again the pilot in the f chase plane watched as the big norton widebody streaked upward through the clouds climbing at twentyone degrees teddy he said over the radio what the hell are you doing just reproducing whats on the flight recorder christ the pilot said the huge passenger jet roared upward breaking through cloud cover at thirtyone thousand feet going up another thousand feet before losing speed approaching stall then nosing over again jennifer vomited explosively into the bag it spilled out over her hands dribbled onto her lap she turned to casey her face green weak contorted stop it please the plane had started to nose over again going down casey looked at her dont you want to reproduce the full event for your cameras great visuals two more cycles to go the plane was diving steeply now still looking at jennifer casey said teddy teddy take your hands off the controls jennifers eyes widened horrified click roger taking my hands off now immediately the plane leveled out smoothly gently the scream of the engines abated to a constant steady roar the foam blocks fell to the carpet tumbled once and did not move level flight sunlight streamed through the windows jennifer wiped vomit from her lips with the back of her hand she stared around the cabin in a daze what what happened the pilot took his hands off the stick jennifer shook her head not understanding her eyes were glazed in a weak voice she said he took his hands off casey nodded thats right well then the autopilot is flying the plane malone collapsed back in her seat put her head back closed her eyes i dont understand she said to end the incident on right all the pilot had to do was take his hands off the column if he had taken his hands away it would have ended immediately jennifer sighed then why didnt he casey didnt answer her she turned to the monitor teddy she said lets go back yuma test station am back on the ground casey went through the main room of the flight test station and into the pilots room it was an old woodpaneled lounge for test pilots from the days when norton still made military aircraft a lumpy green couch faded gray from sunlight a couple of metal flight chairs pulled up to a scratched formica table the only new object in the room was a small television with a builtin tape deck it stood beside a battered coke machine with a taped card that said out of order in the window a grinding air conditioner it was already blazing hot on the airfield and the room was uncomfortably warm casey looked through the window at the newsline crew walking around flight filming it as it sat on the runway the aircraft gleamed in the bright desert sun the crew seemed lost not certain what to do they aimed their cameras as if composing a shot then lowered them again immediately they seemed to be waiting casey opened the manila folder she had brought with her and looked through the sheets of paper inside the color xeroxes she asked norma to make had turned out rather well and the telexes were satisfactory everything was in order she went to the television which she had ordered brought out here she pushed a tape into the deck and waited waited for malone casey was tired then she remembered the scope she rolled up her sleeve and pulled off the four circular bandages arranged in a row on the skin of her arm scopolamine patches for motion sickness that was why she had not vomited on the plane she had known what she was in for malone had not casey had no sympathy for her she just wanted to be finished this would be the last step this would end it the only person at norton who really knew what she was doing was fuller fuller had understood immediately when casey had called him from video imaging fuller recognized the implications of releasing the tape to newsline he saw what it would do to them how they might be boxed in flight test had done that she waited for malone five minutes later jennifer malone came in slamming the door behind her she was wearing a pair of flight test coveralls her face was washed her hair pulled back and she was very angry i dont know what you think you proved up there she said you had your fun taped the show scared the shit out of me i hope you enjoyed it because it isnt going to change a fucking thing in our story barker is right your plane has slats problems just like he says the only thing hes missing is that the problem occurs when the autopilots off thats all your little exercise demonstrated today but our story isnt changed your planes a deathtrap and by the time we air our story you wont be able to sell one of those planes on mars were going to bury your shitty little airplane and were going to bury you casey did not speak she thought shes young young and stupid the harshness of her own judgment surprised her perhaps shed learned something from the tough older men at the plant men who knew about power as opposed to posturing and strutting she let malone rant awhile longer and then she said actually youre not going to do any of that you fucking watch me the only thing you can do is report what actually happened on flight you may not want to do that you wait malone said hissing you fucking wait its a fucking deathtrap casey sighed sit down ill be goddamned if i will did you ever wonder casey said how a secretary at a video house in glendale knew you were doing a story on norton had your cell phone number and knew to call you malone was silent did you ever wonder casey said how nortons attorney could have found out so quickly you had the tape and then have gotten a sworn statement from the receptionist that shed given it to you malone was silent ed fuller walked in the door of video imaging just a few minutes after you walked out ms malone he was worried about running into you malone frowned what is this did you ever wonder casey said why ed fuller was so insistent you sign a document saying you didnt obtain the tape from a norton employee its obvious the tapes damaging he doesnt want the company to be blamed blamed by whom by i dont know the public you better sit down casey said she opened the file slowly malone sat she frowned wait a minute malone said youre saying that secretary didnt call me about the tape casey looked at her then who called malone said casey said nothing it was you casey nodded you wanted me to have that tape yes why casey smiled she handed malone the first sheet of paper this is a parts inspection record stamped off by a pmi at the faa yesterday for the number two inboard slats proximity sensor on flight the part is noted to be cracked and defective the crack is old im not doing a parts story malone said no casey said youre not because what flight test showed you today is that any competent pilot could have handled the slats warning initiated by the bad part all the pilot had to do is leave the plane in autopilot but on flight he didnt malone said we already checked that the captain of was an outstanding pilot thats right casey said she passed her the next piece of paper this is the crew manifest submitted to the faa with the flight plan on the date of departure of flight john zhen chang captain m leu zan ping first officer m richard yong first officer m gerhard reimann first officer m thomas chang first officer m henri marchand engineer m robert sheng engineer m malone glanced at it pushed it aside and this is the crew manifest we got from transpacific the day after the incident john zhen chang captain leu zan ping first officer richard yong first officer gerhard reimann first officer henri marchand engineer thomas chang engineer robert sheng engineer malone scanned it shrugged its the same no its not in one thomas chang is listed as a first officer in the second list he appears as an engineer malone said a clerical error casey shook her head no she passed another sheet this is a page from the transpacific inflight magazine showing captain john chang and his family it was sent to us by a transpacific flight attendant who wanted us to know the real story you will notice his children are erica and thomas chang thomas chang is the pilots son he was among the flight crew of flight malone frowned the changs are a family of pilots thomas chang is a pilot qualified on several commuter aircraft he is not type certified to fly the n i dont believe this malone said at the time of the incident casey continued the captain john chang had left the cockpit and walked to the back of the plane for coffee he was aft when the accident occurred and severely injured he underwent brain surgery in vancouver two days ago the hospital thought it was the first officer but his identity has now been confirmed as john zhen chang malone was shaking her head casey handed her a memo from s nieto fsr vanc to c singleton yuma test fac highly confidential authorities now confirm the postmortem identification of injured crew member in vancouver hospital as john zhen chang the captain of transpacific flight chang wasnt in the cockpit casey said he was in the back of the plane his hat was found mere so someone else was in the captains chair when the incident occurred casey turned on the television started the tape these are the concluding moments of the videotape which you obtained from the receptionist you see the camera falling toward the front of the plane and twisting to eventually lodge in the cockpit door but before it does here she froze the frame you can see the flight deck i cant see much malone said theyre both looking away you can see that the pilot has extremely short hair casey said look at the picture thomas chang has closecropped hair malone was shaking her head strongly now i just dont believe this that visual is not good enough you have a threequarter profile it doesnt identify it doesnt say anything thomas chang has a small stud in his ear you can see it in this magazine photo and on the video you can see the same stud catch the light right there malone was silent casey pushed another piece of paper across to her this is a translation of the chinese voice communications in the cockpit as recorded on the tape you have a great deal of it is unintelligible because of the cockpit alarms but the relevant passage is marked for you alm stall stall stall fo what unintelligible you cptn am unintelligible correct the alm stall stall stall fo torn release die unintelligible cptn what do unintelligible it fo tommy unintelligible when unintelligible must unintelligible the casey took the paper back thats not for you to keep or refer to publicly but it corroborates the videotape in your possession malone said in a stunned voice he let his kid fly the plane yes casey said john chang permitted a pilot who was not type certified to fly the n as a result fiftysix people were injured and four people diedincluding john chang himself we believe that the aircraft was on autopilot and chang left his son momentarily in charge of the flight that was when the disagree warning occurred and the son extended the slats to clear it but the son panicked overcorrected and porpoised eventually we believe thomas chang was knocked unconscious by the severe movements of the airplane and the autopilot took over malone said on a commercial flight some guy lets his fucking kid fly the plane yes casey said thats the story yes casey said and you have the tape in your possession that proves it therefore you are aware of the facts mr reardon stated on camera that both he and his colleagues in new york have watched the tape in its entirety so you have seen this shot of the cockpit i have now informed you what that shot represents we have provided you with corroborating evidencenot all the evidence theres more we have also demonstrated in flight test that there is nothing wrong with the aircraft itself not everyone agrees she began this is no longer a matter of opinion ms malone it is a matter of fact you are undeniably in possession of the facts if newsline does not report these facts which you are now aware of and if it makes any suggestion whatsoever that there is anything wrong with the n aircraft based on this incident we will sue you for reckless disregard and malicious intent ed fuller is very conservative but he thinks we will certainly win because you acquired the tape that proves our case now would you like mr fuller to call mr shenk and explain the situation or would you prefer to do it yourself malone said nothing ms malone wheres a phone she said theres one in the corner malone got up and walked over to the phone casey headed for the door jesus christ malone said shaking her head the guy lets his kid fly a plane full of people i mean how can that happen casey shrugged he loves his son we believe hes allowed him to fly on other occasions but theres a reason why commercial pilots are required to train extensively on specific equipment to be type certified he didnt know what he was doing and he got caught casey closed the door and thought and so did you yuma am jesus fucking christ dick shenk said i got a hole in the show the size of afghanistan and youre telling me youve got a bad parts story featuring yellow peril pilots is that what youre telling me jennifer because im not going to run with that ill get murdered im not going to be the pat buchanan of the airwaves fuck that
