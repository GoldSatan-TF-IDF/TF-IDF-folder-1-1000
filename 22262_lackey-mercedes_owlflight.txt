mercedes r lackey and larry dixon darians taleowl one the air was warm the summer day flawless and darian firkin was stalling trying to delay the inevitable and he knew it he had hopes that if he just lingered enough on this task of wood gathering his master might forget about him or something more urgent than the next lesson might come up before wizard justyn got himself organized it was worth a try anyway since the very last thing darian wanted on this fine sunny day was to be cooped up in that musty old cottage it was worth any amount of physical work to be saved from that fate he took a deep breath of the balmy air laden with the scent of curing hay damp earth and growing things and added another cut quarterlog to his burden of three the bark and rough wood catching on his shirt and leaving bits of dirt and moss smeared on the sleeve would four be enough to qualify as a load probably he headed for the cottage justyns cottage decayed on the edge of the village on the side farthest from the bridge and the road closest to the forest the village itself was a tight little square of cottages with three finer houses all arranged in neat rows around the village square the fields farmed by the inhabitants of errolds grove stretched out on either side along the riverbank but on the back side there was nothing but a single field of corn and a small meadow where goats and sheep were kept in the winter behind all of that was the forest if he paused for a moment and listened it wasnt at all difficult to hear the voice of the woods from where darian stood all the little rustling and murmurings the birdsong and animal calls sometimes that was a torment on days when justyn set him some fool task that kept him pent in the cottage from dawn to dusk he put down his burden on the pile at the side of the dilapidated cottage and returned for more he carefully selected three small pieces of chopped wood from the large communal pile the woodpile lay at the back of the righthand side of the village of errolds grove he tucked them under his arm and carried them toward the rickholder at the side of wizard justyns tiny cottage every day that it was possible the village woodcutter went out with a team of oxen to find and bring back deadfall from the pelagiris forest he never went far but then he never had to the trees in the pelagiris were enormous with trunks so big that six men could stretch their arms around one and not have their fingers touch and one fallen tree would supply enough wood for the whole village for a month every time there was a storm at least one tree or several huge branches would come crashing down the woodcutter did nothing at all but cut wood no farmwork no herding the villagers supplied him in turn with anything he needed and since he had no wife nor apprentice the women took it in turn to cook for him clean his little hut and sew wash and mend his clothing the woodcutter was not a bright man nor one given at all to much thought so he found the arrangement entirely to his satisfaction and since the villagers never went into the forest anymore if they didnt have to it was entirely to theirs as well darian wished they had apprenticed him to the woodcutter instead of the wizard but he hadnt had any say in the matter after all as an orphan who had been left to the village to care for he should be grateful that they gave him any sort of care at all at least that was what they all told him loudly and often the cottage was hardly longer than the woodrick built strongly at one time of weathered gray river rock with a thatched roof of broomstraw in which birds twittered all spring and summer long that twittering was the first thing darian heard every morning when he woke up it was an adequate enough little cottage by the standards of the village but it seemed badly cramped to darian and always smelled slightly musty with an undertone of bitter herbs and dust no one ever cleaned it but darian so perhaps that was the reason for the aroma he didnt really despise the place since after all it was shelter but it didnt really feel like the home the other villagers and his master tried to convince him it was when he reached the cottage and the upright supports that would hold exactly one measured rick of wood between them he set each piece down on the halfrick already piled there with exacting care distributing them with all the concentration of a fine lady making a flower arrangement only when they were balanced precisely to his liking did he return for another three logs he listened carefully for any sound of life inside the cottage for after justyn had told him to replenish their fuel darian had left his master muttering over a book and darian had hopes that justyn might get so involved that he wouldnt notice that darian was taking a very long time to fetch wood from a few yards away there was no sound from inside the cottage and darian ambled off slowly making as little noise as possible until he was out of easy hearing distance the village was fairly quiet at this time of day with most people working in the fields only a few crafters had work to keep them in their workshops at this time of year most of the things that people needed they had to make for themselves these days or hope that someone else in the village had the skills they lacked leather and fur were available in abundance but the tanner worked hides mostly in the fall and there was no official cobbler since old man makus died the blacksmith did all metal work needed and with fortyodd families to provide for he generally had enough work to keep him busy all of the time the miller was also the baker keeping flour and bread under the same roof so to speak he baked almost all of the bread and occasional sweets for the village so that only one person would have to fire up and tend an oven women would often put together a stewpot or a meat pie or set of pasties for the evening dinner and take it to him to put just inside the oven in the morning then they could go out to work the fields and fetch the cooked meal back when the family returned for dinner the womenfolk of errolds grove did their own spinning weaving and sewing mostly during the long dark hours of winter which was when the men made crude shoes and boots mended or made new harnesses and belts and carved wooden implements once every three or four months everyone would take a day off work to make pots plates storage jars and cups of clay from the banks of the londell river and in a few days when those articles were dry the baker and the woodcutter would fire them all at once those went into a common store from which folk could draw whatever they needed until it was time to replenish the crockery again the only things that had to be brought in from outside were objects of metal that required more skill than the blacksmith had such as needles and pins and barstock for the smith virtually everything else could be and was made by the people living here the village was mostly selfsufficient which was a source of bitter pride for no one wanted to come here anymore errolds grove could have dropped off the face of the world and no one would miss it i certainly wouldnt darian thought with bitterness of his own he had to pass through one of the busier corners of the village to reach the woodpile going around both the smithy and the baker the savory scent of bread coming from the door of the bakery told the boy that leander was removing loaves from the big brick oven that took up all of the back half of his shop as for the smith he was obviously hard at work as the smithy rang with the blows of hammer on anvil there was a scent of hot metal and steam on the breeze and smoke coming from the smokehole in the roof leander wouldnt pay any attention to darian as he passed but there was a chance that the smith might the smithy was a threesided shed the forge in the middle the anvil toward the front there was a fat old gray plowhorse waiting patiently for his feet to be attended to tied to the post outside the smithy and its owner a man called backet watched as the smith hammered out a new shoe for it blacksmith jakem a huge balding man with an incongruous paunch beneath his leather apron paused in his work to watch darian pass by his eyes narrowed darian ignored him as he usually ignored the adults of the village when he thought he could get away with it jakem didnt think much of darian but that was hardly out of the ordinary darian didnt think much of jakem either as he made the return trip with his three small logs the smith hawked and spat into the fire aint nobody works as hard as a lazy un he said loudly to the farmer sitting on a stump beside the forge thats the plain truth old man backet agreed taking off his hat to scratch his head lazy un will work twices hard as anybody else tryin to avoid working at all he cast a sly look at darian as he replied to see if his words had struck a nerve darian continued to ignore them so long as the adults didnt address him directly there was a certain amount of immunity that being only thirteen gave him hed learned some time ago that a retort would only earn him trouble with his master not that wizard justyn had ever laid a hand on him but the reproachful lectures on how much he owed the villagers of errolds grove and how little he repaid their care were worse than a beating nobody ever asked me what i wanted not once nobody gave me a choice if id had a choice i wouldnt be here now and no one would have had to think about taking care of me id have offered to work just enough to get a tent and some supplies and id have been off to try on my own now im stuck here enduring useless blathering from a senile master and carrying firewood like a dog in harness he made three more such trips ignoring the adults at the forge each time although it certainly it did not escape his notice that the force and frequency of the smiths blows increased each time he passed if jakem wanted to wear out his arm trying to impress upon darian what socalled industrious labor looked and sounded like it wasnt going to bother darian any besides if he told the smith why he was making such a production out of the simple task of fetching wood hed only get another tonguelashing and maybe a cuff on the side of the head into the bargain the smith had a notoriously heavy hand with his own offspring and if provoked he might well use it on darian as darian put his scant armload of wood down at the end of the third trip the voice of doom emerged from the interior of the cottage darian leave that for now and get in here its time for your lesson it was actually a fairly pleasant masculine voice a bit tiredsounding and querulous but not too irritated or scolding nevertheless if darian had been a dog he would have dropped his head and ears and tucked his tail down but the firewood he protested knowing that the protest would do him no good but making it anyway the wood can wait i cant come in now darian darian drew his brows together in a sullen scowl but obeyed the summons leaving the sunshine and the fresh air for the closedin gloom of the cottage he tried to leave the door open to admit a little breeze but justyn frowned and motioned to him to shut it behind him he waited with resignation for his eyes to adjust to the dimness the only light in the cottage came from a trio of very small windows in three of the four walls even though the shutters stood wide open they still didnt admit much light wizard justyn waited for him at one end of the scarred and battered table taking up most of the right side of the room which served as kitchen dining room workroom and study all in one at the rear of the room was a set of rungs hammered into the stone of the wall that served as a ladder to the loft where darian and his master slept most of the rest of the wallspace was taken up with shelves badlymade bookcases that leaned perilously toward each other like drunks propping one another up and several appalling pictures of famous mages darians father whod dabbled in painting had once said that a good engraving or print was worth twenty bad paintings and darian could certainly see why they made his eyes hurt just to look at them but unfortunately there was no way that he could avoid looking at them most prominent was the best of the lot a heroic portrait of a person not even a terrible painter could ruin entirely his noble features and intelligent eyes made up to a small extent for the stiff daubs of his costume shown seated at a table from about the waist up the great wizard kyllian a fireflower mage looked every inch the powerful sorcerer right down to his familiar a sleek and smuglooking striped creature at his elbow that might have been a cat or might not have been it was difficult to tell if grimkin was something other than an ordinary feline or if the painter had taken the same liberties with cat anatomy that he had with human arranged on either side of this portrait were the pictures of heraldmage elspeth darkwind hawkbrother quenten of white winds and the powerful adept firesong all of whom wizard justyn had allegedly seen and spoken with before he arrived here to serve errolds grove darian was more than a little dubious about that claim for one thing how could a brokendown fake like old justyn have ever gotten near enough to the legendary elspeth and darkwind to have seen them at close range much less spoken to them and if he had how could he ever have thought that the horrible daubs on his wall in any way resembled them they hardly even resembled portraits of human beings the picture of elspeth showed her atop her companion in an unreasonably heroic pose both hands upraised with what were supposed to be bolts of lightning coming from her hands but the lightning bolts looked more like sickly palegreen snakes the companion looked like a lumpy cow the face of the heraldmage like a blob of dough with two currants stuck in for eyes and a slash of orange carrot for a mouth she apparently had twisted legs no neck and enormous pillowlike breasts the heralds uniform and her companion werent even white they were a disgusting muddyyellow sort of color as if the painter hadnt been able to afford a pure white pigment or maybe hed used a cheap varnish that had yellowed as it aged darkwind at least looked human but the bird on his shoulder had more in common with a fat chicken ready for the pot than any hawk that darian had ever seen the rest of the portraits were pretty much on the same level of skill or lack of it the firebird posing with the adept was so ineptly done that most of the villagers thought it was supposed to represent a goose and had wondered aloud out of justyns hearing why a mage would have such a silly familiar as for firesongs mask the adept was never seen without one it looked like a childs drawing of a sunflower and if everyone didnt already know that it was a mask a reasonable person could have thought the painting was of some fabulous monster it was painfully obvious that no woman had ever touched this cottage since the day justyn moved in darian had gotten used to it over the last six months but there was no doubt that it was a worsethantypical aged bachelors study littering the leaning and badlymade bookcases were an assortment of cheap and flashy magical implements a few tattered old books a lot of unrecognizable but definitely dead animals which were allegedly preserved in some way several spider webs a couple of cracked mugs the upper half of the skull of some largish animal an apple core and a great deal of dust darian had tried to clean the place up when hed first been sent here out of pure selfinterest but being told sharply to leave things alone on numerous occasions hed lost interest in cleaning up anything but his own little corner around his pallet in the loft sitting right in front of wizard kyllians portrait on the top of a tipsylooking bookcase was a beatup and scruffy old black tomcat currently engaged in cleaning his hind leg which stuck stiffly straight up into the air as the cats tongue rasped at the thin fur this was justyns familiar or so he claimed it certainly matched its master for a lessgraceful cat darian had never seen it seemed to share the villagers contempt for its master and his apprentice ignoring both of them with a disdain more in keeping with the pampered pet of a princess than of a patchyfurred mongrel of indeterminate age with a broken tail and chewedup ears carefully placed in a rack on the wall was a rather plain looking partially split walking stick with a bit of crystal embedded in the top which justyn said was his wizards staff that along with four chairs none matching and the thick warped oak table with a book under one leg keeping it straight comprised all of the furnishings of the room the table was covered with jars and bottles the remains of last nights dinner in stackedup plates that had been shoved out of the way bits of scribbledon paper burnedout ends of candles and one empty wine bottle darian glanced with guilt at the stack of dirty dishes he was supposed to have cleaned them up this morning but he had been in such a hurry to get up and out before justyn thought of giving him a lesson that he had neglected that duty entirely now hed have to scrub them with sand to get all the driedon gravy off them and hed have to do so before they could eat or they wouldnt have anything to eat tonights dinner on at least hed remembered to take the turnip pasties over to the baker in time for them to go into the oven it wouldnt have been the first time hed forgotten and theyd had to make do with bread raw turnips onions and sometimes a little cheese but the mess evidently didnt bother justyn at all when darian had first been apprenticed to him the place had looked much the same the day hed moved his things in darian had been strictly forbidden to touch anything on any of the bookshelves without specific permission which frankly led darian to believe that old justyn wasnt certain what was on those shelves himself it had occurred to him that justyn was afraid that if darian cleaned and organized things the boy would ruin the wizards best excuse for not getting magics done immediately when people asked him for them hunting for this or that ingredient or piece of apparatus was a good excuse for stalling and as darian knew from his own experience if you stalled long enough people sometimes forgot their requests sit justyn ordered darian slumped into a seat across from justyn taking the chair that wobbled the least there was a plate with an apple on it right in front of his chair and sitting where he could watch both the apple and darian was justyn with a resigned sigh darian stared at the apple while justyn stared just as intently at darian he looks like a real ragbag today darian thought critically looking down at the wrinkled winterstored apple he looks as if birds were nesting in his beard is this pan of his act or is he getting even more senile justyn was about the most illkempt male in the village his only wealth that of his untidy beard he had three or four shabby and patched robes all pretty much alike with badlymade lopsided esoteric symbols sewn on them by justyn himself if you looked closely you could see little rusty spots where justyn had stabbed his thumb with the needle and bled on bis work he kept them clean darian had to give the old man that much credit although he was always spilling things on them that made stains that never would come out rendering the garments into a mosaic of blotches of various faint colors it was difficult to tell how old the mage was his hair and beard were gray rather than white with a few streaks of darker color in them and his brownish eyes very sad and tired were sunken so deeply beneath his shaggy eyebrows that it was difficult to see the wrinkles at the corners he could have been any age from forty to ninety and since no one in the village knew anything of his history before he came to errolds grove in the company of a herald on circuit his true age was anyones guess well justyn said showing a bit of impatience are you going to just sit there wasting time or are you going to actually do something with another reluctant sigh darian stopped merely staring at the apple and began concentrating he narrowed his focus until the apple filled his vision and his mind simultaneously relaxing and tensing he concentrated on the apple being above the plate as if an invisible hand held it there as he concentrated the apple began to wobble a little the movement was so slight that it could have been caused by someone bumping the table itself except that neither he nor justyn had moved after a long moment of tension he felt something inside himself relax slowly agonizingly the apple rose still wobbling but now doing so in midair it hovered about the width of his finger above the plate surface sweat broke out all over his forehead in beads and he felt the pinch of a headache starting just between his eyes and behind the concentration he seethed with annoyance and impatience this was a stupid waste of time he knew it and justyn knew it but justyn was never going to admit it because that would be admitting that he had been wrong about darian and justyn would die before he admitted that what on earth good would floating an apple about do would it bring in more crops chase away sickness bring prosperity back to the village the answer clearly was no to all three questions behind justyn the cat finished his grooming and began coughing making gagging and strangling sounds darian struggled to maintain his concentration but the wretched creatures noise was more than he could ignore the apple wobbled and dipped as darians control over it began to unravel the cat hacked again more violently than before until darian was certain it was going to cough up a lung this time and not just another wad of hair it was too much distraction and he lost the spell completely the cat spit up a massive moist hairball with a sound that made darians stomach turn just as the apple thumped down on the plate darian swore furiously under his breath at the cat the apple and a fate that conspired to make a mess even of things he despised the cat sniffed coughed once more jumped down and limped over to the fireplace where it curled up on the ashstrewn hearth darian gave the cat a look that should have set its fur on fire if there had been any justice in the universe and glowered at the apple if hed had half the power justyn swore he had the apple should have exploded from the strength of that glare the fact that it didnt only proved to him that his master was a fraud and was trying to make him into another fraud what is the use of this he asked himself angrily whats the point if a stupid cat can break a spell how is anyone supposed to get anything done by magic its stupid thats all it is its just as pointless as everything else in this village try again justyn ordered him with a kind of weary disgust that angered darian even further what right did that old fake have to be disgusted with him it wasnt his fault that he had no magic and as far as that was concerned justyn had no room to find fault with darian on that score how long has it been since he did anything with real magic i bet he couldnt have kept that apple in the air any longer than i did anger and frustration rose to the boiling point and instead of doing as he was told he swept his arm across the table in front of him knocking apple plate and anything else in the path of that angry sweep off the table and onto the floor with a crash the plate didnt shatter since it was made of pewter but it made a lot of noise and acquired yet another dent as justyn opened his mouth to scold darian shoved his chair away from the table sitting there with his arms folded over his chest glowering silently daring justyn to do his worst justyn visibly pushed down his own temper darian i want you to try again the wizard repeated with mounting impatience and since you wont do it properly you can pick that apple up off the floor and put it back on the table with your mind yes and the plate as well a bit more hard work will teach you to control your temper a mage cant ever lose his temper or why darian snarled defiantly interrupting the lecture on selfcontrol that he had heard a hundred times already why should i use my mind to float fruit around theres no reason to its faster and easier to grab it like any normal person would and just to prove his point he bent down and seized apple and plate and banged both down on the wooden tabletop there now thats what a person with plain common sense does you dont have to muck around with these stupid tricks to get things done now of course was the moment when justyn would launch into a lecture on how in magic one must practice on small things before one could expect to succeed in the larger how he was being immature and childish and how very ungrateful he was next would follow how it was criminal that he refused to obey that he had such a wonderful gift and was apprenticed to a wizard who would teach him skills and didnt appreciate his easy circumstances when instead he could have been bound out to a farmer or the blacksmith darian knew it all by heart and could have recited it in his sleep and it wouldnt make any difference if he protested that he didnt want to be a wizard that he hadnt asked for this socalled wonderful gift and that he didnt see what was so wonderful about it justyn would ignore his protests just as everyone else had and did and always would for some reason that he did not fathom every other person in the village was astonished that he didnt appreciate being farmed out to the old fake but just at that point there were sounds of thumping and a grunt of pain outside harris and vere neshem a pair of the local farmers staggered in through the door with kyle osterham the woodcutter supported between them his leg wrapped in rags stained with fresh red blood darian jumped immediately out of his chair and moved aside for them shoving the chair in their direction he was chopping up a stump and his footing slipped vere said as they lowered kyle down into the seat darian had just vacated bit of a mess good thing we were close by since justyn served errolds grove in the capacity of a healer far more often than that of a wizard darian had seen men who were worse wounded stagger in through the door but kyles leg was a bit of a mess surface cut he noted critically ax blade probably hit the shin bone and skinned along the top of it thatd peel back a lot of skin but itll heal quickly as soon as its stitched and it wont leave much of a scar lucky if he didnt break the shin though it would bleed a lot and hurt a great deal but it was hardly lifethreatening he edged out of the way a little more and got nearer the door justyn rummaged through the shelves behind him grabbing rags herbs a needle and fine silk thread a mortar and pestle darian boil some water he ordered his back to the room as he hunted for something he needed but now darian was in no mood to comply this little incident only confirmed what he had been thinking the people of errolds grove didnt need some fool who could suspend apples in the air they needed a healer sometimes a finder sometimes a weatherwatcher but not a wizard and they never had needed a wizard in all the time darian had been here most especially they didnt need him it would make more sense for one of the girls to learn everything justyn could teach about herbs and simples distilling and potions setting bones and stitching skin so darian just stood there ignoring justyns order radiating rebellion and waiting for their reaction one of the farmers glanced at him with censure written clearly on his face justyn he said in an overly loud voice is there any help you need justyn who had been muttering to himself as he mixed herbs in the mortar got flustered and distracted at the interruption he had to dump the lot of what he was grinding out into the tiny fire and start again the fire flared up with a roar and a shower of multicolored sparks and both farmers exclaimed in startled surprise taking everyones attention off darian that was all he needed for once darian was not going to stand around and wait for people to give him stupid orders taking advantage of the distraction the boy edged around behind vere and made good his escape sliding quickly out of the door before anyone noticed he was gone thatll show him thatll show all of them that im not going to be treated like i have no mind of my own im not a slave and i never agreed to any of the things theyve done to me they dont give me the regard theyd give a rooster why should i stay and be insulted and made to do things i hate he didnt want to be caught though so he moved around to the back of the cottage plastering himself against the wall and ducking under the windows until he reached the side that faced the forest he was just underneath the open window when he heard justyn say in an exasperated tone of voice from which all patience had vanished will you please boil that water darian now not two weeks from now but darian was out of reach of further orders and as he paused to listen to find out if either of the farmers was inclined to volunteer to go look for him evidently justyn looked around and saw that for himself for there was a muffled curse useless brat the first farmer muttered we should have prenticed him as a woodcutter to you kyle vere gave a snort hed be just as useless there lazy is what he is you oughta beat him now and again justyn youre too soft on him them parents of his spoiled him and you aint helping by bein soft on him there was a clatter of metal as someone put the kettle on the hook over the fire veres brother seconded that opinion them two was useless to us and dangerous justyn its in his blood an you oughta beat it out of him else hell bring somethin out of the woods that none of usll like darian lurking right beneath the window heard every word too clearly to mistake any of it and his stomach seized up inside of him as both fists clenched in an unconscious echo of the knots in his gut they were at it again in front of him or behind his back they never let up not for a minute he felt his anger boiling up again felt his face getting hot and his eyes starting to burn with the misery of loss he had vowed never ever to show he wanted to storm right back inside and confront both of those miserable old beasts but what good would it possibly do theyd only say to his face what theyd just said to justyn with a strangled sob he wrenched himself around and ran off not into the village but into the woods beyond where the villagers were too cowardly unlike his mum and dad to go his feet knew the path so he didnt need to be able to see to find his way to one of his many hiding places that was just as well since unshed tears of anger and grief kept him from seeing very clearly darian wasnt old enough to remember a time when things had been other than hard here at errolds grove but until last year he had been happy enough he hadnt spent much time in the village itself and although he hadnt had any playmates he hadnt felt the need of them solitary by nature he enjoyed the mostlysilent companionship of his parents errolds grove lay on the very far western edge of valdemar nominally it was part of valdemar but the people here seldom saw a herald more than once a year and of late it had been longer than that between visits not that a herald would do darian any good but the heralds absence made the villagers feel neglected and forgotten and that made them even harder on anyone who didnt conform and darian would never conform he hated the village he hated the people who saw no farther than the edges of their fields and wanted nothing more he wanted more he was stifling for want of freedom and felt as if he were starving on a diet of confinement and mediocrity hed been out there where these villagers feared and he remembered it far more vividly than anything that had happened to him in this dull little huddle of huts once hed traveled the deep forest he was never the same again and he didnt want to be part of this insular flock of humanity he ran like a hare through the field of corn behind the cottage bare callused feet making little noise on the soft cultivated earth nobody stopped him the tall green corn hid him from view and if they heard his running feet they probably thought it was one of their own children coming back from an errand a moment later darian burst into the shadows of the forest at the edge of the fields and slowed once he was in the shelter of the undergrowth he took a moment to orient himself then twisted his way through the brush and sought refuge in his favorite tree one of the enormous forest giants that ringed the village and kept it in shade for most of the day he climbed as swiftly as a squirrel or a treehare and as surely even blinded by tears he had no trouble finding his hiding place where the great trunk split in two forming a cup that a boy could easily curl up in and still have room for a few possessions beneath him lay the village a cluster of about fifty buildings on the forested side of a bridged ford on the river londell right on the edge of the pelagiris forest it went on forever in three directions climbing hills plunging into valleys and crowning the huge bluff that rose above the river downstream of the village with only the londell halting its march toward the heart of valdemar the hardwon fields carved out of the forest were tended and fertilized with the greatest and tenderest of care for it took terrible effort to gain a foot of clear ground from the trees and there was always the chance so it was said that the forest would decide to take revenge for trees that were cut down rather than falling down naturally the forest had always been a fairly uncanny place according to the old granthers and grammers of the village but since the start of the magestorms it had gotten very much stranger and far more dangerous a herald had come the first he had seen three months after his unwanted apprenticeship to justyn had been decided for him the herald had been lightskinned with a long blond braid of hair and looked all the paler because of the white outfit and matching riding coat with him of course had been his companion a white horse that was more than a horse it was more like a dreamers ideal of everything a horse could be with lambent blue eyes a long mane and hide that stayed impossibly clean and silvery hooves the herald had explained that the strange things that were happening were called magestorms and they were caused by the magic of the world being disturbed a very long time ago they had been told that the greatest mages of the world had united under valdemaran leadership and were working to prevent any major catastrophes the herald had answered the few questions posed by the villagers looking to the white horse and then back darian had wondered at the time if he was the only one of the group justyn included who felt like the white horse and the herald were communicating with each other through thenlooks and subtle gestures the herald would have gone on but several of the older folk of the village hauled him away to explain more out of darians earshot since that took justyn away as well he was perfectly happy with that and went off then to spend time alone in this very place of refuge by the time hed emerged the herald and his companion had gone and there hadnt been one through here since according to justyn the fact that errolds grove was relatively near lake evendim meant that they got the worst of the magestorms huge circles of land and the creatures in them either changed completely or warped and twisted out of all recognition monsters appeared things worse than the worst nightmare or legend and unfortunately there were no friendly hawkbrothers nearby to chase away or kill them not that the people of errolds grove particularly trusted the hawkbrothers at one time these people had made a good living out of going into the pelagiris forest and collecting some of the strange plants and fungi that grew there for use as dyestuffs and that business had occasionally brought them into conflict with the hawkbrothers traders had come far out of their way for those dyes and that had encouraged some people to go in deeper in search of any other things that traders might find valuable of course the deeper in they went and the more they looked for ancient treasures instead of mosses and fungi the more likely it was that they would wander into hawkbrother lands and be warned off often at the point of a drawn weapon once or twice outsiders had come hunting treasure as well and their bound bodies would later be found neatly arranged on the forest edge without a single copper piece or trinket missing awaiting discovery and burial each such discovery would discourage deeper incursions for a few months but there were always greedy outsiders ready to dare the hawkbrothers for the sake of treasures and their fates were a warning to the dyetraders to stick to their business and leave whatever treasure was out there alone nevertheless there was enough and more than enough of legitimate quarry to tempt the people of errolds grove out into the pelagiris until things started getting out of hand the village had been quite prosperous with visits from heralds twice and three times a year a fine wooden bridge over the londell built by the order of the crown and even a pair of valdemaran guards stationed to watch the bridge and keep the peace on the road there were still two sturdily built guardposts here one on either side of the bridge to prove that errolds grove had once been considered an important border town but war had come war with hardorn and the guards had been taken away to serve elsewhere never to return now the only way that the people of errolds grove could keep the road open was to run their own volunteer patrols over it then things had somehow gotten mixed up with magic as well and so far as the people of errolds grove were concerned order and their old way of life had all but disappeared first had come the physical storms worse than anyone had ever seen before that washed out the road in places flooded the village twice and buried it in yards of snow for most of the last several winters then had come the magestorms to batter them all along with the physical storms and all anyone from valdemar could do after the heralds initial warning was to send a messenger with a map that showed what places were going to change and when that was no great help when all the places were out in the wild forest and no one could get out there to chase large animals away from the danger zone so the animals became monsters or maybe the monsters were brought in by the magic no one was really certain the only thing that everyone in errolds grove could agree on was that now it was far too dangerous to leave the village and its fields you never knew if or when you might disturb something that was canny enough to follow you back home people stopped going into the forest and the dyetraders stopped coming since there was no longer anything here to trade for or even worth the peril to investigate cowards darian thought angrily scrubbing the tears from his eyes with his knuckles other people kept going in other people weren t so scared of their shadows that they gave up people like his parents for instance darians parents had been trappers as had many generations of his ancestors on either side but when it became too dangerous to actually live in the forest they had made errolds grove the base of their operation carefully working a territory with cautious respect for the hawkbrothers claims and the new strangeness that the magestorms brought with them some of the creatures that arrived on the wings of the magestorms had handsome pelts of unusual colors and traders would pay a lot for them other changes had occurred in the normal species of the pelagiris that had made improvements in color or texture of the furs of animals native to the forest and for these too traders would come then although they were not as expert as the villagers had been they would look for the dyefungi when time permitted thus bringing back a bit of the prosperity that had left on the stormwinds they were careful darian silently told the village they knew how to be careful they would never ever have let anything follow them here no matter what you think they always made certain to use traps that any truly intelligent species would spot just to keep their consciences clean but even with that caution they had brought in some incredible prizes darian had often gone with them for during the winter they would both be out together for weeks at a time he loved the forest and even at its most dangerous he had never been as terrified of it as the villagers were now it was right to be cautious around the forest but it was stupid to be afraid of it after all it wasnt the forest that was so dangerous it was the things living in it and as long as you were careful there was nothing to worry about any fool could see that and how could anyone let fear blind him to so much of wonder and beauty dari listen his mother would whisper and he would cock his head to listen for the new sound that had caught her attention perhaps the liquid trill of a new bird or was it a tervardi or the belllike tone of a hammerjay whatever it was once he caught it he would look to her and see the pleasure shining in her eyes as she listened too then she would tell him what it was they had just heard and spin him tales of the little lives of the creatures of the forest tales far more wonderful than anything in those dusty books the villagers thought so important dari look his father would say pointing to something wonderful a soaring hawk the sunset light glowing red and orange on a towering cloud a doe with a fawn only minutes old and then his father would show him how to follow the hawk and watch it stooping to a kill what the fiery sunset portended in the way of weather and how to find the fawn when she hid in the grasses to doze while her mother went off to drink or graze he would stand an excited witness to the hawks victory sit in quiet contentment until the last red rays of the sunset faded into blue dusk or creep up to whisper to the fearless fawn being careful not to touch it lest its mother scent him and reject it even though his hands itched to stroke its soft pelt he still loved the forest loved the green silences the huge trees the sounds of it he couldnt get anyone else in the village to see what drew him there when he tried they looked at him with suspicion and even a little fear just as they had looked at his parents but he could have borne even that if he still had them dad mum why didnt you come back why did you leave me alone why did you let the forest take you away from me the pain returned greater for having been bottled away beneath his anger and rebellion his eyes flooded with tears his throat knotted and he pounded his hand against the bark of the tree until his knuckles were raw and scraped loneliness filled him until there was no room for anything else except for anger at the insular villagers who hadnt even bothered to mount a search party when his parents didnt return it didnt matter to these fools that the exotic furs his mum and dad brought back had been the only thing that kept traders coming to the village oh no because they went out into the forest everyone was just certain that something would follow them back into the village something too big and monstrous to get rid of there hadnt been a particle of evidence that something like that had any chance of happening but it didnt matter his mum and dad had been watched like criminals every time they came back from a trapping run and theyd felt it how could they not have so they would go back out more and more often spending less and less time in the village and maybe that was taking on too much risk in the middle of the magestorms maybe that was why after an agony of waiting he knew that they wouldnt come home this time theyd left him behind because there was going to be another magestorm coming and justyn and some of the others had persuaded them not to risk his safety along with their own hed protested but theyd slipped off during the night leaving him with the innkeeper as they usually did by the time he woke up the next morning they were gone and the wind and snow had obliterated their trail hed tried to follow but had been forced to turn back he waited and waited going out every day to watch for them sure each dawn that he would see them coming in laden with their prizes but this time he had watched in vain for they didnt return darian was left to the village to care for and it hadnt taken them long to figure out how to dispose of him within a day or two of being certain that darians parents were never returning the village elders had quickly apprenticed him to justyn justyn had long been after his parents to bind darian over to him as an apprentice justyn had told them that he had the magegift and that it had to be trained or it would be dangerous mum and dad only laughed at him and told him he was a silly old fool if he thought a boy could be dangerous to anything or anybody but the villagers had been only too ready to believe in the danger and only too happy to get him disposed of and more than once thered been intimations that disposed of is exactly what hed be if they detected any connection between him and these weird times they told him then and they continued to tell him frequently that he should be grateful to them for seeing to his care and for persuading his parents to leave him behind on that last trapping run they never stopped telling him how grateful he should be in fact there was even a hint behind it all that it was a good thing that his parents had been lost because now he darian would no longer find his own life at risk in the forest the tears welled up again needless to say he wasnt grateful i helped them they said i did when they set the traps i was the one up in a tree watching and listening for danger when they needed an extra set of hands i was right there and when they were tired i was the one who was still fresh enough to tend to dinner or build the fire up maybe that hadnt been true back when he was just a little boy but it had been the past couple of years and there was no denying it theyd been able to concentrate on the work at hand instead of having to keep one eye on the work and one watching for peril or approaching weather and maybe that was why they hadnt come back that was the stuff his nightmares had been made of for the last year he kept thinking of times when hed been there when theyd needed him when they needed a third set of hands on the rope in a blizzard when hed spotted large carnivores stalking the camp even when hed been up a tree and had seen the signs of a bad storm coming up without warning had a pack of some magictwisted horrors ambushed them attacking them until finally their defenses were all gone had a terrible storm overwhelmed them had it been simply accident the falling branch the hidden crevice the slip in the dark that left one or both of them crippled and helpless was that why they didnt return because theyd counted on his eyes and ears to warn them his extra hands on a knife or a bow to help fight off danger and he hadnt been there hed never been bad with a knife and he was even good with a short bow could it have made the crucial difference or was it something else had they been caught by bandits eager to steal their precious furs had there been an avalanche or had one or both of them fallen through the ice while crossing a river horror of horrors had they been caught in a changecircle and changed themselves were they out there even now rooted to the spot as halfhuman trees or wandering in some shape not even he would recognize he couldnt shake the conviction that if he had been along they would have all come back to the village as usual somehow some way his mere presence would have made the difference he knew better than to try and tell this to anyone in the village hed tried once to tell justyn and the old wizard had told him that he was overreacting that whatever had happened to his parents had nothing to do with him after that he had kept his guilt and fears to himself but he couldnt help but think that if he had been along his parents would have had that extra set of hands and eyes that would have kept them safe and brought them through whatever it was that took them away and that was what made it all the more horrible here in this refuge away from the fools who didnt understand he could let his real feelings out why he cried in silent anguish face turned up to the canopy of leaves both fists grinding against the back of the tree why did you leave me why didnt you take me with you why did you leave me all alone his body shook with silent sobs and tears coursed down his cheeks soaking his patched and muchmended shirt it was too small in the arms for him by far but he wouldnt let anyone take it from him nor would he give up the leather vest that went with it she had made him the shirt and he had cut and stitched the vest and those two articles of clothing were all he had left of them why he asked them again and again until there was nothing left in the world but sorrow and guilt why did you leave me alone finally his body trembling in every fiber he collapsed in on himself curled into a ball and sobbed muffling the sound of his weeping in his arms and the bark of the tree he wept himself dry and exhausted until there was no more strength left even for a single tear before justyn was satisfied that kyles injury was no longer lifethreatening and was as clean as one herbalist could make it there was a great deal of blood spilled on the stone floor of his cottage it wasnt the worst wound hed ever tended but it was definitely one of the messiest justyn had finally stopped the bleeding with a compression bandage and after liberally dosing the woodcutter with brandy and poppypowder began stitching the wound closed with a curved needle and fine silk thread kyle was a stolid enough fellow and in a way it was a blessing for both of them that he was so very insensitive and one might as well say it stupid for he didnt seem to mind the ugly wound and the stitching half so much as the two farmers whod brought him in vere and harris grimaced every time justyn put a stitch in and harris who had no livestock at all but a few chickens relying on the loan of his brothers oxen to plow his own land was looking a bit green about the face kyle had just sat quietly as if he were a good plowhorse waiting for a new shoe to be fitted the brandy and poppy concoction made the muscles of his face go slack and relaxed and he leaned back in his chair propped up by harris and vere blinking sleepily whenever the needle went in i could be generous justyn thought i could suppose that hes in shock by now except that he hasnt any of the symptoms of being in shock such stolidity in the face of serious injury had been the hallmark of some of the mercenary soldiers justyn had tended in the past the long gone past so removed from what he was now that it might be the past of another person altogether there were just some men who never felt much of anything either physical or emotional in general they got along well with their fellows and they made good enough soldiers for although they never displayed the least bit of incentive they always obeyed orders without question and if a woman didnt mind being the one to make all the decisions they made perfectly amiable husbands and fathers certainly their phlegmatic temperament never led to beatings or other abuse there had been times when he envied them that easy acceptance virtually everyone in the village was cast from the same mold and it wasnt at all difficult to tell that vere and harris were kyles cousins all three of them were husky lighthaired and browneyed but harris and vere were darker than kyle and kyle had features that were much more square justyn sometimes wondered if the reason he and darian had never quite been accepted by the villagers was a simple matter of appearance both he and darian were thin and dark in stark contrast to everyone else here or at least he amended mentally i was dark until my hair started going gray hes gonna be laid up a couple of days vere said with irritation his thick brows furrowing in a decided frown that means well have to spare someone from field work to keep an eye on him so he doesnt get into trouble all juiced up with that poppy like he is cant you magic him stead of sewing him up like usual ive told you before justyn said patiently manipulating the needle through a particularly tough patch of skin im not a healer im an herbalist a surgeon and a bonesetter i would have to use a complicated magic spell to do what you suggest whatever it was that the heralds did to end the magestorms fractured all the magic and left it scattered around like a broken mirror it takes a long time to gather up enough shards of power to work any spells its very tiring it exhausts all the magic thats nearby and then if you really needed some magic to be done in the case of an emergency i wouldnt be able to do it what if something bad came out of the pelagiris and i couldnt protect the village you wouldnt want that now would you the farmers both shook their square shaggy heads but they also looked skeptical and cynical and justyn could hardly blame them after all no one in errolds grove had ever seen him work anything involving powerful magic and they had no reason to think he could do anything much and they have every reason to doubt me he admitted to himself taking another careful tiny stitch and tying it off besides he added as an afterthought you can get widow clay to watch him she cant work in the fields with that bad leg but she can still weave baskets or knit and sew while she keeps an eye on him and who knows she might decide that hes better than no husband at all and then your wives wont have to cook and clean for him anymore justyn felt a bit badly that he was talking about kyle as if the woodcutter wasnt there but in a sense he wasnt hed had enough poppy and brandy that he wouldnt recall a thing that had been said once the drugs wore off and even if he did justyn rather doubted that hed take offense at any of it since worse things had been said in his presence that he never took offense to he felt no guilt whatsoever about setting up widow clay however the good widow had been setting her cap at him of late and that was something he wanted to put an end to by whatever means it took the last thing he needed was some meddling woman coming in here and setting his life to rights both the farmers brightened at that idea and they didnt say anything more about magic instead they exchanged the kind of cryptic sentences that almost amount to a code among close kin and justyn gathered that their conversation had something to do with a plan to persuade the widow clay that her best interests lay in dragging kyle over the broom justyn rather doubted that kyle would mind if she did hed probably accept being married with the good natured calm with which he accepted having his leg stitched up as for the widowwell shed have nothing to complain about in kyle justyn continued to sew the two sticky flaps of skin together with tiny delicate stitches a woman would have envied but the meticulous work was not engrossing enough to keep his mind off the past the irony was at one time he would have been able to mend a minor wound like this with magic using magic to bind the layers of skin and muscle together leaving the leg as sound as it had been before the injury granted his grasp of power had been minor compared to the great mages like kyllian and quenten but at least it had worked reliably and what was more it probably would be working better after the end of the storms than the magics of those who were his superiors in power he had never used leyline magic much less nodemagic and the loss of the leylines would have made little difference to him he had been a hedgewizard one of those who practiced earthmagics with a little touch of mindmagic thrown in for good measure and he had served in the ranks of wolfstones pack a mercenary company recruited by heraldcaptain kerowyn to aid valdemar and rethwellan in the war against hardorn his had been a minor role in that company using the earthmagics to tell him where the enemy was and how many his numbers were helping patch up the wounded helping conceal their own men from the enemy and his mages kerowyns skybolts had worked with the pack in the past and they were one of the few mercenary companies she felt sure enough of to trust in the treacherous times when ancar still ruled hardorn all that had been explained very carefully to the members of the pack as had the risks and possible rewards and the company had voted unanimously to take the contract after all it was captain kero they were talking about no one who took the same side as she did ever found himself working for people he would really rather have lost down a mine shaft and usually no one found himself facing a situation where foreign commanders were spending mere lives like base coin that they couldnt get rid of fast enough justyn had only just hired on with the pack and hed been eager to see some real fighting to get right into the thick of things but he had quickly discovered that the place of a junior mage a mere hedgewizard was going to be back with the supporttroops and foolish me that wasnt enough excitement for me he tried to volunteer every time they called for able bodies but wisely the commanders kept passing him right over until they came to the desperate running battles with ancars troops that decimated their own ranks and left the commanders little choice but to put a weapon into the hands of anyone they could spare and hope for the best justyn had been a good enough archer but his mindmagic had given him an edge as long as he got his arrow going in the right direction he could think it into a target with a bow in his hands he impressed even the archerysergeant and so they kept him with the archers and he got more than his share of excitement until his first battle hed thought that actually killing someone might be a very difficult thing for he would be thinking his arrow into the body of a man not a straw target but then when he saw what he faced there was actually a grim and melancholy sort of pleasure in it hellpuppets were what the other fighters called ancars linetroopers conscripted and controlled entirely by bloodmagic ancar had depleted the countryside for fighters and had raised the power for the spells that controlled them by killing their families in cold blood when justyn killed one of the troopers it was actually a longedfor release for the poor clod spellbound and spellridden for most of them that arrow came as a blessing taking them out of ancars hands and on to a place where their loved ones were probably already waiting ancar had not used his people well to say the least and justyn found himself sending prayers along with each arrow and as for the officers and mages commanding ancars troops there was great pleasure in ridding the world of creatures so depraved and sadistic and perhaps it was wrong for him to feel pleasure in killing even something as vile as ancars toadies but he couldnt find it in his heart to regret taking even one of them out of the world and fighting was a great deal more exciting than grinding herbs lighting campfires and sealing wounds when the archerysergeant had halfheartedly given him the option to go back with his old group hed declined and to be honest i felt more like a man i was actually doing something and other men other fighters praised me for it how could i go back to work among the cooks and the muledrivers it wasnt only the members of the pack who praised him either hed met several of the valdemarans in the form of some of the guard when theyd picked up a stray squad or two along the way the sadlydepleted remnants of a valdemaran company that had been holding the line before the pack came to reinforce them they thought he was a fine soldier and said as much as they all shared exhaustion and the rare hot meal between engagements heady stuff for a young fool i suppose wonder where the boy went harris said idly interrupting justyns thoughts justyn had the needle clamped between his teeth and couldnt answer but the question was rhetorical for the man answered it himself probably ran off into the woods my boys seen him running off there before im telling you justyn theres bad blood there and youd better do something about it before he gets more than himself into trouble justyn really wasnt paying much attention lost in his own thoughts as he was and the halfconscious grunt he made in reply seemed to satisfy the man at the moment he really didnt want to think about young darian though he was getting an increasing number of complaints from the villagers that he wasnt keeping the boy under firm enough discipline no his thoughts were in the past at the moment drawn there by the task of stitching up something that could have been a wound made on purpose rather than accidentally if i hadnt been so young i would have realized from the state of the valdemaran guard and the fact that my own commanders were willing to risk a mage in the front lines that something was very very wrong what had gone wrong was that they were all trapped on the wrong side of the enemy lines and only the fact that they had good commanders had gotten them as far as they had gone he had learned later that the guard and pack captains had agreed on a lastditch dash for the border at a weak spot in the enemy lines hoping for a combination of surprise and overconfidence to bring them all through and the ploy worked except that for it to work someone had to hold the rearguard and the most logical group was the mixed archery squad guarded by a handful of swordsmen they fought their way back toward valdemar step by step until the only barrier between them and safety was a river with a single wooden bridge one man with a bow could hold the enemy off long enough for everyone else to get across and by that time he was considered the best shot in the group so of course like a young hero who hasnt quite grasped his own mortality i volunteered that was when he learned the great and vital truth about being a bowman when you run out of arrows you can do virtually nothing against a man with an ax he had fended off attacks for a few moments with his bow and knife getting some painful wounds in the process and the last thing that he remembered was watching the flat of the ax blade descending in strangelyslowed time toward his head he had awakened in the infirmary tent after his heroic efforts there hadnt been a man in the decimated ranks willing to allow him to go down without trying to rescue him but his skull had been cracked like a boiled egg and it had only been good fortune and the fact that wizard kyllian was present at that very site that had kept him alive to thank his rescuers kyllian himself was too old by then to take part in any battlemagics he had confined himself to instructing the new heraldmages and to helping the healers when their own ranks grew too thin for fireflower was a school that produced mages who were equally versed in healing and magecraft reputed to be a great friend of quenten the head of the white winds school at bolthaven justyn really didnt know why hed chosen to come north when the valdemarans sent out a call for mages through quenten perhaps it was some need of his own that drew him there or some urge to leave the sheltered confines of the fireflower retreat he didnt confide his reasons to justyn who was just one among many of the patients that he pulled back from the soontobedead and into the land of the living it was obvious almost at once that justyn was not going to be any good for fighting anymore the blow to his head addled his vision enough that he would never be able to accurately sight an arrow again and he simply had never had the strength of body to be a swordsman nor did he ride well enough for the cavalry but there was still magic the magic hed despised that suddenly seemed desirable again but like a lover scorned his magic had left him as well much of what he had learned the blow to his head had driven from his memory he had trouble seeing mageenergies with any reliability and the mindmagic he had was so seriously weakened he could no longer lift anything larger than a needle for more than a few moments he had gone in a single instant from hero to a discard and what would he do with himself outside of the mercenary companies he had no skills no abilities outside of those of the magic that was now mostly gone from him when he was able to get out of bed and care for himself the healers turned him loose to complete his recovery on his own and the pack gave him his musteringout pay and their good wishes the captain expressed his regret but pointed out that the pack couldnt afford anyone who couldnt pull his own weight and suggested that he might find employment somewhere as a server in an inn or the like a server in an inn was that what he had come to all at once he couldnt bear the idea that he must give up all of his oncepromising future to become a menial a drudge another cipher with no future and no prospects that was when he had approached the great wizard hat in hand like a beggar and asked for advice he must have fairly radiated despair for kyllian had sent away the people he was talking with and took him into his own tent sitting him down and presenting him with a cup of very strong brandy i suppose you think that your life is over the great wizard had said wearily but kindly and from your perspective thats an appropriate response i understand you put on a fairly brave show out there he had flushed brave but stupid i suppose depends on who you would ask your fellow mages now they would say it was stupid im sure risking your gifts as well as your life in physical combat but the fellows you shot covering fire for would have a different opinion he had been rather surprised that kyllian remembered the details of how he had been injured but there were more surprises in store for him so youre brave enough to die kyllian had continued watching him closely but are you brave enough to live are you brave enough to learn skills that will get you little gratitude brave enough to practice them among people who will probably despise you and certainly wont believe your tales of battle heroics but who nevertheless will need what you can do what could he answer except to nod mutely having no notion of what that nod was going to get him into it wasnt magic that saved you boy the old man had told him bluntly it was simpler stuff than even you are used to practicing bonesetting and fleshstitching herbs and bodyknowledge patience and persistence and your own damned refusal to be a proper hero and die gloriously do you know whats happened out there in the hinterlands of valdemar he had shaken his head obviously how could he have known he wasnt a native of the place well i do because the healers come and wail on my shoulder about it at least three times a day there are no healers out there now theyve all been pulled east to take care of this mess even the old wisewomen the herbalists and the beasthealers have turned up here anyone that could travel has come here where the need is greatest that leaves vast stretches of territory without anyone that a sick or injured farmer can turn to not an earthwitch not a hedgewizard not even a horseleech no one and people are going to die of stupid things like coughs and festered wounds unless people like you take the time to acquire a few more skills and go out there to help them kyllian had eyed justyn shrewdly and i can virtually guarantee it will be a thankless proposition but youll be doing a world of good even if no one is willing to acknowledge it why do you care what happens to the people of valdemar hed asked with equal bluntness and why should i the old wizard had smiled an unexpectedly sweet smile that charmed justyn in spite of himself i care because i dont care what land people own allegiance to so long as they are good people and i suppose i care because of the philosophies that made me choose the school i chose ask any healer of whatever nation how he feels about healing a man from another land even one that is his enemy and he will look at you as if you were demented for even asking such a foolish question healers dont see nations boy they see need and they act on that need that is why i care and why should i justyn had repeated why did you volunteer to hold the bridge was all kyllian asked and although justyn had not quite understood the question then discovering the answer had formed a large part of his life from then on but at the time given his utter lack of anything else he thought he could do and the fact that the great wizard kyllian certainly seemed to want him to volunteer that was what he had done first though he needed to begin a new course of learning he had apprenticed himself to the leeches and herbalists and wisewomen on the battlefield absorbing their knowledge of matters other than the injuries of combat when they werent all up to their elbows in blood and body parts he acquired herbals and other books brought what was left of his magic up as far as he could and when heraldmage elspeth and hawkbrother darkwind and adept firesong did whatever it was they did to end the war with hardorn he was there for the celebration of victory then volunteered his services to both the healers and the heralds after all he was at least a little bit of a mage as well as a certified bonesetter and herbhealer and selenay of valdemar had decreed that valdemar still needed mages kyllian had been right and he was assured that valdemar could use anyone with either of those skills and desperately ancars mages hadnt confined their attentions to killing valdemaran fighters theyd made a point of going after the tents of the healers and other noncombatants contrary to every accepted convention of war far too many of the healers and leeches who had volunteered were not going back to their homes again those services that he offered were gratefully accepted and the healers sent him off so far into the west that he wasnt certain he was still on a map of valdemar a whole string of folk went most with about as much magical power as he had and some with less a healer and a herald went with them and found them towns and villages who wanted and would support folk like himself the last village on the list was errolds grove and it was here that he found that kyllian had been only too right people had already died needlessly of stupid things a compound fracture gone septic a winter epidemic of fever an infected foot the people here needed him and wanted him and the healer and herald went back to haven to look for more volunteers to fill all those empty places where healers had once been at first things hadnt been as bad for the village and the villagers as they were now traders still came for the dyestuffs and there was both ready money and the goods coming in from outside to spend it on the villagers had seemed impressed by the little magics he could still do such as finding lost objects and predicting the weather he had been given a house and was promised that like the woodcutter all his needs would be taken care of a strange and scruffy black cat had simply appeared one day a cat that seemed unnaturally intelligent and he took it as a good omen that he had gotten himself a proper familiar that his magic might once again amount to more than the wherewithal for a few parlor games he set about looking for an apprentice to teach and saw the light of magery dancing in the eyes of a young child the son of a pair of fur trappers he had every confidence that he would one day be able to persuade them that their boy should have a chance at a better life than they held and get young darian for his apprentice it seemed as if the gods were finally smiling on him again and he rechanneled his ambitions into another path if he could not become a great mage he could train one it didnt take having the talent and the gift to be able to train the person who did he transmuted his dream into the dream of being the mentor to a powerful magician and thought that he would be content but then the magestorms began and his fortune dropped along with that of his village when one or two monstrous creatures invaded the village no one wanted to go out into the pelagiris forest and encounter more and since the dye fungus wouldnt grow outside of the forest that pretty much put an end to the dyetrade with no money and no traders coming in the villagers were forced to become selfsufficient but selfsufficiency had its cost in time and hard physical labor the narrower the lives of his villagers became the less they in their turn were willing to forgive the demands on him became greater and he was less able to meet them and when darian was orphaned and was bound over to him by the villagers the boy reacted in exactly the opposite way he would have expected not with gratitude but with rebellion that perhaps was the worst blow of all the boy had seemed so tractable with his parents so bright and so eager to learn and with bis parents gone and no relatives to teach him a trade or care for him he should have been relieved and grateful to get so gentle a master as justyn who never beat him never starved him into submission never really scolded him justyn was nearly finished with kyles wound but the problem presented to him in the shape of young darian was nowhere near as easy to deal with was it only that the villagers were right that the boy had bad blood in him just how bad was the bad blood if there was such a thing was it insurmountable should he give up and see the boy bound over to the smith perhaps certainly the smith would not tolerate the kind of behavior darian exhibited now but how could that be fair to the boy was it only that he was strongwilled and stubborn unwilling to turn bis hand to another path when the one he had been on was closed to him it would have been natural enough for him to plan to follow in his fathers footsteps and certainly there was every indication that he knew quite a bit about the business of trapping and preparing furs if it was only that could his stubborn nature be overcome surely justyn could make him see reason the forest was too dangerous to go out in now and the deaths of his parents should prove that to him if only he could be made to acknowledge the fact if two people with all the experience and caution they displayed could not survive there darian had no chance of prospering and surely justyn could make him understand that was it that he wanted everything to come to him easily as magic came to those in childrens tales was he too lazy to work if that was the case justyn wasnt sure how to remedy it but that didnt seem right either the boy wasnt actually lazy but look at what hed said this afternoon that he didnt see any reason to expend a great deal of effort to do something much more easily accomplished with normal means and perhaps it was only that justyn hadnt been able to persuade him that those little exercises were the only way of building his ability and control to handle anything bigger or was there something else going on something that justyn didnt understand justyn could see some things for himself the boy didnt like being made to feel that he was somehow different from the other children in the village perhaps part of his rebellion stemmed from the fact that his talent for magecraft was bound to set him farther apart from the others given the contempt with which the villagers regarded justyn he had no reason to assume that they would give him any more respect if and when he became a mage and he certainly reacted badly whenever his parents were mentioned but his parents too had been different very much so the entire village had regarded them with suspicion and displeasure anticipating that they would only bring more trouble than they were worth with them eventually some of the villagers had not been entirely certain that dalians parents were human the argument was that no human would ever choose to go out into the pelagiris when there were safer ways of making a livelihood a fallacious argument to be sure but the folk of errolds grove seemed to have a grasp on logic that was tenuous at best but was it that darian wished his parents had been the same as everyone else and he was angry that they had been different and had made him different by default or was there some other thought going through his mind bad blood and reckless thats whats in that boy he heard with half an ear and it occurred to him at that moment that every time anyone in the village so much as mentioned darians parents and lineage it was with scorn and derision and the certainty that no good would ever come of those folks why no wonder the boy reacted poorly every time the boy heard himself talked about it was with the almost gleeful certainty that he would come to a bad end or be nothing but trouble as reluctant to show any sort of feeling as he was still for darian those words must seem like a blow to the face or more to the point to the heart still one would think that the boy would feel a little proper gratitude justyn certainly treated him well he was hardly overworked he had plenty of free time to himself enough to eat proper clothing to wear and a comfortable place to sleep there was no telling if hed had all those things with his parents but one would think he would be happy enough to have them now wait think a moment it is one thing to feel gratitude it is another to be told over and over again just how grateful you should be if only you werent too much of a little beast to be appreciative hes only a child he cant understand how much of a burden one extra mouth to feed is for the people here folks with children would have to work that much harder to feed and clothe him folks whose children are grown expect to be taken care of in their old age not become caregivers all over again he hadnt any skills that were useful to the folk here when he was left in their hands so he wouldnt contribute anything toward his own keep for months or even years but how is a child supposed to understand that and as a child his parents were naturally everything to him the center of his young life and being told they were idiots and deserved to get swallowed up by the forest must surely make his blood boil he must feel impelled to defend them and yet since he was a mere child he would be considered impudent and disrespectful if he did another thing that justyn had noticed about him was that he had a great deal of difficulty in remaining still and concentrating perhaps that was characteristic of all young boys but most were apprenticed to learn skills that involved physical work not mental work the boy had a restless heart and the truth of it was that he was not wellsuited to insular village life he spent most of his free time not with the three or four boys near his own age but out in the forbidden forest whether he was just wandering or exploring with a purpose justyn didnt know but he certainly seemed to prefer the company of trees and birds to that of his own kind and there are certainly times when i dont blame him for that justyn tied off the last of the stitches and clipped all the threads as short as possible so that they wouldnt catch on something now he said to all three of them although he wasnt at all sanguine about kyle understanding anything he said i know youve heard this before but it bears repeating you all three know what happens when a wound goes septic kyle please realize that if you let this wound sour at best you would be very very sick and i would have to open up the wound drain it and cut or burn out part of the infected tissue it would hurt a very great deal both while i was doing it and afterward youd have much worse than a scar then and it would take much longer to heal you would probably end up with a limp or even lame if the infection grew bad enough kyle grunted and nodded his agreement his brown hair flopping into his vacant brown eyes he brushed it away and although the motion was slow his hand was steady arguing for a certain level of sobriety now pay attention to what i have to tell you he insisted you may have heard this before when someone else was hurt but chances are you dont remember it as well as you think you do harris vere i am counting on you to remind kyle of all of this all right vere agreed looking as if he felt put upon harris just grunted clearly bored with the entire procedure knowing the two as he did justyn figured that vere would try to remember to tell kyle everything and harris would do so only if he happened to think about it justyn sighed and hoped they wouldnt forget what he was about to tell them at least kyles constitution was so robust that he could take a little neglect once a day the wound is to be washed in wine just as i did before i closed it and allowed to dry in the air right kyle said vaguely wash and airdry dont bandage it wet after it is dry then put the salve i have given you on it and put a dressing made of fresh clean cloth over it dont put bear fat or goose grease or tallow or riverweed or anything else your granny used to use for wounds on it do you understand that forget your grannys and your mothers famous remedies and stick with mine trust me on this and remember that the heralds sent me here for just this reason ive seen and treated more wounds like this than there are people in the village just the salve you give him vere sighed as kyle nodded so earnestly that justyn had some hope that the man might actually remember what hed been told at night before you sleep i want you to change the dressing again with fresh clean cloth i want you to have all the rags you use for dressings washed thoroughly in boiling water and hung to dry in the sun sometimes he wondered if theyd pay more attention to the things he told them to do if he gave them some kind of nonsense to say over each task as a kind of charm against sickness but no he was afraid that if he did that they would trust in the charm and forget cleanliness how could he get them to believe that there were invisible animals living in filth that made wounds fester if he couldnt get them to believe in him thank the gods they at least knew the signs of infection and gangrene examine the wound carefully each time you change the dressing and if you see anything wrong come to me at once remember youre watching for infection and that can include swelling red streaks coming up or down your leg from the wound skin thats hot to touch and more sore than it should be understand come to you at once kyle repeated nodding vigorously all right justyn said and sagged back in his chair he waved a hand at them you can all go now harris and vere each took one of kyles arms and heaved him up out of his chair justyn didnt offer him any more of the precious poppypowder he didnt have much and he had to save it there was no telling when the next trader would come with the powder hed ordered almost a year ago rather surprisingly kyle made it erect without too much in the way of a wobble and he didnt lean on the two farmers nearly as much as justyn thought he would the benefits of an iron constitution and a head like a granite boulder i suppose he thought dispassionately hed probably have healed up all right without me which is likely what vere and harris will be telling each other he leaned back in his chair and massaged the bridge of his nose between his thumb and forefinger kyllian had been right this was a place where he and a successor were desperately needed and it was a place where they would get little thanks and no credit for what they did people honored the spectacular not the everyday raise a dead man and bring him back to life and they would hold you in awe keep him from dying in the first place with a little simple hygiene and they ignored you what was he to do he had known what he was up against when he arrived here and what was he going to do about a successor if he couldnt somehow bring the boy around he would have to find someone willing to do the hard work without any magic at all women tendedto be more community minded than men and in this village at least they were used to taking on the more objectionable of community tasks perhaps he ought to check among the girls and see if any of them were willing to learn all he could teach them about bonesetting and herbs and the like it wouldnt hurt darian to see that he had a rival for justyns tutelage that might get him interested again when nothing else seemed to the only problem with that idea was that it would be hard for a young girl to get a mature man to listen and obey her when it came to following instructions that had been the idea behind sending a man here in the first place if only i could regain my magic if i could impress the people here that might bring darian around if he just thought that he had a chance of being seen with respect as long as he learned what i have to teach that might change his attitude he turned his attention to the apple sitting on the plate on the end of the table where harris had put it he narrowed his focus and concentrated on the fruit as he had so often and so easily feeling a nowfamiliar headache arc across his head just behind his right eyebrow he didnt remember the blow that had felled him but he fancied that it had felt a lot like that stabbing pain he willed the apple to rise this time surely this time it wobbled a bit on the plate but did not move still he continued to concentrate on it and it rocked faster and faster but still refused to rise until the pain behind his right eye was enough to blind him with a sigh he dropped the apple with his mind and it stopped moving im an old fraud he said out loud im a failure and an old fraud my apprentice hates me and hates magic and you he looked at his cat which was licking itself again probably arent even a familiar and even if you are youre a failure too if a whirlwind came out of the sky and swallowed us all up no one would ever notice thats how unimportant we are what do you think of that the cat went on cleaning itself sticking a scraggly fleagnawed leg straight up in the air arse toward justyn he chuckled bitterly for the cats silence seemed the only fitting comment two even grief as profound as darians could not be sustained for too long and after lying exhausted in his hiding place for a time other feelings began to penetrate his sorrow all of them maddeningly persistent and utterly ordinary it was irritating which in itself was irritating to have stupid things like a nose that was sore and stuffed up from crying and an ant crawling up his leg inside his breeches intrude on something as profound as his grief but that didnt stop them from intruding his arms and legs felt cramped his hands stung where hed pounded them against the bark and scraped them and one hip hurt jammed as it was against the hard bark of the tree finally he decided it was time to leave he sat up his eyes sore and dry and peered down through the branches to see if there was anyone about to catch him when he climbed down there was no one working in the field below and from the fact that the long shadows of the trees had crept over the village hed been up here a while he guessed that the women who usually worked in the bean field had probably left their work to go prepare dinner for the men and children the wind was in the wrong direction for him to catch aromas coming from the village but it was a good bet that if he could smell anything it would be the mingled aromas of stews soups pies and pasties same as always i wonder why they bother making individual dinners surely it would make more sense just to make one big pot of stew for the whole village he thought with a touch of contempt after all everyone in the village uses the same halfdozen recipes i dont think anyone has ever tried to make anything new since ive been here perhaps it was that as difficult as things were there were still some who were more prosperous than the rest who could afford a little more meat and spices in their food and who made sure to enjoy that distinction from everyone else whenever the opportunity presented itself as if by sharing a bit of spice with everyone else theyd lose the chance to lord it over their neighbors he thought sourly the halfdozen welltodo families were the ones who seemed to go out of their way to complain about his behavior as if they didnt already have the best houses in town and can even pay somebody else to cook and clean for them still if it was mealtime hed probably better be getting back to justyn there were still dishes to scrub and the pasties to fetch from the baker or the old wretch would probably forget to eat and then darian would get the blame if justyn got sick sometimes he wondered how justyn had gotten along before he came but then he realized that the women had taken care of him the same way they cared for kyle so the villagers had gotten something out of apprenticing him to justyn theyd been able to stop cleaning up after and cooking for the wizard no wonder theyd been in such a hurry to get him bound over ill have to clean up after kyle too if i dont want to have to eat dinner in a room that looks like someone had butchered a pig there justyn is such a slob how can he be so concerned with keeping wounds clean and live the way he does wrinkling his lip a little with disgust he stretched his arms and legs until the cramps went away then climbed slowly down the side of the tree opposite the village he didnt want anyone to catch sight of him if he could help it hed already lost a couple of hiding places by being careless here on the edge of the fields where there was more sunlight growth of bushes and vines was especially heavy giving him cover that allowed him to get into the field without being seen already the air was hot and drowsy with midday heat and hidden insects buzzed and droned on all sides of him the ground here smelled damp someone must have opened up the irrigation pipe for this field he pushed through the dense underbrush until he came to a field of pole beans and made his way through the rows of tall tentlike arrangements of poles covered with climbing bean vines they made a jagged hedge that was difficult to see through and extended well over the top of his head eventually the field ended and he reached the outskirts of the village on the northern side he reentered errolds grove near the firing pit for pottery and the storage shed where the finished pieces were kept he didnt see anyone although the sounds of dinner being served and eaten were coming from every open window it must be later than i thought he still didnt feel much like hurrying though his bout of grief had pretty much killed his appetite and with a bit of pique he decided that justyn could wait if his master was hungry his master could go fetch his own dinner from the baker and clean a plate or two himself for a change he made his way slowly along the paths between the houses kicking a round rock through the dust nursing his grievances the ordinary sounds of people who liked each other eating together only made him feel more abused and put upon because he knew what those people must be thinking and saying about him vere and harris had certainly recounted the tale of his defection to their families by now and their wives had probably shared the story with others as they brought water from the well or went to fetch dinner from the baker so now everyone knew that darian had shown his true face again and they would be feeling very smug indeed by suppertime tonight hed be the main topic of evening lectures to the family theyll be looking at their children and telling each other thank the gods he isnt like darian or my boy would never act like darian huh as if they really had any idea half of what their precious children get into when they arent watching and the very next person he encountered would probably stop him in order to remind him of how ungrateful and unnatural he was every time he got into trouble and trouble seemed to have a wide definition for these people people would go out of their way to give him their own version of the lecture hed already heard a thousand times or more the sermon on how kind justyn was for taking him in and apprenticing him without an apprenticing fee or any kind of familial relationship again and again at least justyn himself usually left that part out perhaps because he remembered only too well how he had pestered darians parents every time they came into errolds grove darian could recall at least a dozen times that justyn had come to his mum and dad separately or together to urge on them a plan of apprenticing him into justyns service there had been a great deal of fuss made about how dangerous it was for someone with darians potential to remain untrained in his magic darian remembered his dad once telling his mum that justyn was trying to frighten them into giving darian over to him and that she shouldnt let the old man alarm her if darian could not get away from whoever had decided to deliver the usual lecture the haranguer would then go through the litany of darians many character flaws and deficiencies and the only variation was in how much emphasis an individual placed on a particular flaw this part was actually useful darian had noticed over the course of several of these lectures that people tended to stress the flaw that they were most prone to themselves for instance the rudest man in the village old man gulian tended to harp on how rude darian was and erna dele who never spoke or showed a thank you for any favor and always expected more than she got would go on at great length on how he didnt appreciate what he was given he learned a lot by listening to what people thought they saw as deficiencies in him regardless of who was giving the lecture it always ended with a homily on gratitude obedience and humility that is how he should daily demonstrate how grateful he was to everyone in errolds grove by thanking all and sundry on every occasion for their generosity toward him how he should show that gratitude by instant obedience to anything anyone wanted of him and how he should be properly humble and prove that he knew his place in the scheme of things by groveling before everyone he came across how i should be so happy to have been permitted to become a boundover slave that i should demonstrate that gratitude with humble servitude to anyone over the age of fifteen it takes a village to raise a child was the old proverb often quoted to justyn when someone came to complain about darian and it certainly seemed as if everyone in the village had his or her own ideas of the proper way for darian to behave each time he heard the lecture he was sorely tempted to kick the orator in the shins he never did though because there was always that doubt that they might all be right and that he was in the wrong after all everyone here seemed to be in agreement on his behavior and worth except he himself and after all he was only a boy what if he was entirely in the wrong what if he was a bad person what if he did deserve to be punished what if justyn was too tolerant of his behavior and he really deserved to be disciplined what if the reason his parents got swallowed up by the forest was because he was a bad person and this was how the gods had chosen to punish them for how he turned out that was the possibility that gave him a cold lump in the bottom of his stomach and made him squirm with distress whenever he thought of it and that of course just made him want to be loud and wild and try some of the magics that justyn talked about just to show them all that he was not to be trodden underfoot like a weed and he was not going to take all their lectures and disapproval lying down which of course always got him into more trouble in fact it seemed as if ever since hed arrived in this place he was in trouble to one degree or another or thought to be in trouble and it wasnt fair the other boys pulled as many pranks as he did or more they were just slier about it and they didnt get caught because no one was trying to catch them the way everyone seemed to be trying to catch him hellfires he thought rebelliously when everyones watching you all the time to catch you doing something wrong theyre going to get you no matter how hard youre trying to do right and meanwhile just because everyone in the whole town expected darian to be the one who made trouble that meant they werent going to catch their own boys at it and darian would get the blame for things they did it happened all the time and even when he could prove he hadnt had anything to do with the mischief no one ever apologized to him or made things up to him they just said that he deserved to get into trouble for all the things he did that he hadnt gotten caught at now there was a prime bit of logic and just suppose the beans got pecked a bit by birds or a deer wandered in and ate some of the young corn things that he couldnt possibly have any control over why that was all the fault of his dad and mum it was the pelagirisbeasts come to take revenge on the village for the terrible trappers who had invaded the forest even the most normal of beast depredations was always blamed on some monster from the pelagiris that had followed dalians parents back to errolds grove though what selfrespecting monster would pull up carrots and eat them or trample down a hill of beans or pick at ripe strawberries well that was beyond him must have been a monster with a singularly vegetarian appetite funny how they all forget those coats and rugs and bedcoverings they all have that dad and mum traded for food and supplies he thought sourly looking up from his rock and noting one of those bedcoverings hanging out on a line to air a soft shade of subtle cream it was too with markings and mottlings of a darker shade of pale brown quite a handsome fur thick and warm and probably a fine thing to have on the bed in the dead of winter darian even remembered what the beast had looked like when theyd caught it a terribly dangerous beast it was completely unable to defend itself much less attack anyone it had looked like a huge hassock with four tiny little legs and a head the size of an apple all stuck on a body easily the size of a fat cow and certainly much wider if anything had been born to become a tanned hide that thing surely had been it was a wonder it had survived long enough to be trapped in the first place poor justyn hadnt even gotten the benefit of having furs traded to him in return for taking darian as an apprentice he didnt get anything at all not even other peoples castoffs and he was the one who probably deserved some kind of repayment the most widow clay of the bad leg that kept her from hard physical labor had been appointed to make him bedcoverings which she knitted from odds and ends of yarn that she unraveled from wornout sweaters or scrounged from leftovers or other projects she also made quilts of scraps that no one else wanted because they were stained or faded and threadbare or too drab to be desirable even as a patch for a quilt poor justyn he always got the tagends of everything he was the last person in the village to get a share of meat of clothing of anything whoevers turn it was to supply him always gave him what they didnt want take now for instance there was an abundance of turnips beans and peas so their meals featured either turnips beans or peas depending on how the donor herself felt about those vegetables mostly they got turnips and he was not looking forward to the time when the squash ripened now his mood turned to guilt as it always did at this point for the worst part of it was that in his heart he knew he was being treated fairly wellhoused and wellfed and justyn though shorttempered and appallingly sloppy was fundamentally kind he kicked his stone back and forth from his left foot to his right making slow progress in the direction of justyns cottage he kept his eyes down on the path and his stone for it was just possible that if any adult saw him doing this they would think it was some ridiculous exercise that justyn had set him as it certainly would look too tedious to be a game justyn had set him tasks that looked sillier in the past and the one thing they all had in common was that they were tedious its not so bad with justyn and i wouldnt mind so much if i was learning something useful its just that he keeps insisting that this magic stuff is good for something ive heard the stories and ive seen the bad art on his walls hes talked about great mages and even one or two hawkbrothers and told me about their great spells and weaings but so far i havent seen him do anything that couldnt be done easier by plain old ordinary hands for that matter a lot of what justyn did was accomplished by mundane means and old justyn sure didnt get a lot of respect wealth or even appreciation so why would anyone want to be a wizard in the first place whats the point of being a wizard if you get taken for granted and paid only in what no one else wants if i was learning something like being a fighter a warrior something that was useful and got respect well things would be different the old man was good at small spells and minor healings simple magics that made life better and safer for the villagers but nobody really seemed to notice just how much he did for them they acted as if he was supposed to be at their beck and call for the most minor of trivialities and on the whole they treated him very little better than lilly the barmaid at the inn justyn just accepted that treatment as if it was what he expected and deserved that isnt doing either of us any good if it comes right down to it he doesnt get respect so i never will either but he also doesnt ever do anything to make people think he was important and any old wisewoman knows almost as much as he does about healing and medicines everything justyn did or wanted him to do seemed to involve a great deal of stupid plodding repetitive work so what good was magic when all it did was make for more hard tedious work he knew why the villagers didnt respect justyns magic wasnt magic supposed to be spectacular instantaneous and take ones breath away wasnt that the way magic happened in the tales when the village was buried in snow shouldnt justyn have been able to clear the snow away from the paths and the doors with a snap of his fingers shouldnt he be able to hold back floodwaters with his will or make a well by wishing it there shouldnt he have been able to keep people safe when they went into the forest to make a living after all that was how the people of errolds grove were supposed to make a living shouldnt a proper wizard be able to make sure they could still do it no matter what those magestorms brought that may have been what earned their scorn when the monsters came justyn wasnt able to do things that let the village prosper despite their presence if theyd thought that he was going to be able to get rid of any monsters that came in from the forest people wouldnt have been half as hard on dad and mum in fact they might have helped them out a bit that last winter when running the traplines was so hard and if people had been pleasant to him and his parents if theyd been able to prosper on their own maybe his dad and mum wouldnt have felt as if they had to go out into the forest as often or for as long they might still have been here if they hadnt felt so unwelcome in errolds grove he shook his head angrily to keep from crying all over again he had to think hard to be able to get a breath he felt as if he were in a constriction trap and the trap kept getting smaller every day i dont think i can bear too much more of this he thought but this time the thought had more of a feeling of desperation behind it ive got to get away ive got to figure out how i can take care of myself and get away from here this place these people theyre trying to make me just like them and i dont want to be like them wanting everything just alike is whats killing them all they just dont realize it there had to be more to life than the kind of life the villagers were living a dull pedestrian daytoday existence when he wasnt being badgered he was being bored to death every day is exactly like every other day only the weather and the seasons change and even they dont make that much difference unless theres something like a flood or a blizzard or a monster or something they think is a monster or maybe a herald comes along once a year at most its always the same food the same gossip the same things going wrong or right nobody ever does anything just for the sake of doing it and nobody ever dares try anything new there were times when he thought that even the appearance of a monster from the pelagiris forest would be preferable to the dayin dayout sameness it might wake up some of these people show them that there were more important things than complaining about one small boy no one ever makes songs or tales about people plowing their bean fields whats the point of living on the edge of a perilous and magical place like the forest if you dont go looking for adventure in it or if not adventure why not just life people used to go looking for adventure or for mosses and other dyestuffs anyway but now they would rather hide in the village and pretend the forest wasnt just beyond their carefully cultivated fields theyd rather do without prosperity than take a chance against danger and darian could not understand that my folks went out looking for adventure maybe there is something in my blood only it isnt bad blood its just i dont know i just know if i dont do something different soon im going to burst i dont know how these folks stand living like this maybe they dont burst because theyre hollow he looked back over his shoulder at the forest with longing he always felt more contented when he was in there and the temptation to keep going to keep on looking to see what was beyond the next stand of trees behind the next patch of undergrowth was often overwhelming it always felt as if there was something exciting out there waiting for him if he just went far enough in and maybe dad and mum are still alive in there somewhere his belly wrenched he was thinking that again as he had for ages and he still could not let that hope go until someone found proof otherwise he would always be certain that they werent dead that they were trapped or imprisoned somewhere waiting for someone to find them as long as he could believe that he couldnt give up and he had something to hold onto in the middle of the night when he woke up and found himself beneath a thick thatched roof instead of the open sky or tent canvas or forest canopy that hope faded a little more with each passing day though it got harder to believe they were still alive somewhere when there was never any trace either of what became of them or of a force or person that could have imprisoned them maybe when a trader comes i can get him to take me with him i could work for him until we get somewhere where there are more people then i could join the guard i bet id be a great fighter in fact i bet id be one of the best fighters there ever was he was easily one of the best bowmen in the village more than half the time hed been apprenticed it was his skill that put meat in justyns stew and not the gratitude of the villagers then again all the wars were supposed to be over now and maybe they wouldnt need fighters well that was all right i could remind people about the furs and the dyes that used to come from here i could get them to put together an expedition to explore the forest thats what i could do i know all dads trapping trails i could be famous for opening up the forest or maybe he could just work for the trader until he had enough put by to buy his own supplies and traps he could go out into the forest himself and become as good a trapper as his dad was he remembered his dad saying more than once that he was doing the villagers a favor by trading those furs for kind instead of cash and that the traders never gave but a fraction of the worth of the fur if i took my furs to a big city myself i could get a lot of money for them i could get rich and id probably be famous too as for the people of errolds grove well when they saw how he was prospering maybe they would stop cowering in their houses like rabbits in a burrow and dare the forest themselves again i havent seen that many monsters and most of them werent dangerous if you kept your wits about you ive never seen any forest spirits or vapor demons or anything you could even mistake for something like that hellfires i havent even seen hawkbrothers and i know theyre supposed to be out there somewhere so how dangerous could it be now that the magestorms are over really ive probably spent as much time in the forest as anyone here and i just dont think that hiding in your house and pretending that the forest isnt there is going to do anyone any good he looked up slyly for a moment and realized that he had managed to kick his stone up to the back of the inn or what served as an inn here in the village it really wasnt much more than another cottage with two rooms one large room full of benches and tables one a kitchen and a loft above the kitchen where the owner slept it was owned by hanbil brason who brewed the beer and dispensed it to the men who gathered here of an evening and in earlier years besides selling beer and food he at times had sold floor space at night to passing traders nowadays when there wasnt much in the way of coined money in the village hanbil sold his brew by tally you brought in a bushel of barley a bunch of hops a dozen eggs some pork or chicken and he would reckon up how much in real money that represented and put it on a tallystick for you then you drank and ate until you used up the tally hanbil was the only man with whose tallies no one argued because he was the only source of beer and his was the only place in the village where men could gather to complain about their wives in relative peace he was aided in his endeavors by lilly who served beer and meat pasties cleaned and washed up and dispensed some other unspecified services that caused the good wives of errolds grove to frown and pronounce her no better than she should be whatever that meant it might have had something to do with the fact that she wore skirts kilted up above her knee extremely tight bodices and blouses that continually fell off one shoulder showing a great deal more of her than the wives liked lilly was no girl she was older than some of those wives and really no prettier the women had no cause to feel any jealousy about her looks but they did and they took some pleasure in snubbing her at every opportunity however like poor old kyle folks said she was not especially bright so she didnt seem to take any notice of being slighted or if she noticed she didnt care maybe having the approval of the husbands was worth the snubs of the wives darian had some doubts about that he didnt think it was that lilly was stupid at all he thought it was probably more the case that she was so resigned to her lot and position that she just didnt think about it anymore the boys said she was also not quite bright enough to count past ten anything more than ten was simply a lot and as every child in the village knew if there were more than ten pasties or fruit pockets cooling on the windowsill lilly would never notice one missing once again darian had doubts for hed seen her taking in the plates of cooled baking with a slight smile when one or more was missing he had the feeling that she knew very well that the baked goods were gone and that she rather enjoyed the fact that bold children were snitching hanbils goods and since hanbil was notoriously parsimonious when it came to his share of the support for justyn darian always considered it his duty to filch something to eat from the inn when he got the chance this was his day of golden opportunity lilly must have been out berrying on the old road this morning for there was a line of fine goldenbrown berrypockets cooling in pans on the windowsill and just beneath it sitting on upturned buckets so she could reach them from the window juice oozed from them enticingly and there were at least two dozen of them darian sidled up to the window and took a quick glance around to see if anyone was watching but the area was deserted and he could hear lilly talking to hanbil up in the loft he snatched and ran juggling the pocket from hand to hand to keep from getting burned while his mouth watered with anticipation a moment later he was safe in a spot he often used for strictly temporary hiding the hollow behind some juniper bushes under the window of what passed for a shop in errolds grove nandy lutter and her husband used to buy their goods from traders but with fewer and fewer coming through they had to go fetch their own goods they were the only people in the village who ever went up the road to the outside world once every three months derrel lutter would hitch up his horse to his wagon and drive off across the bridge with a wagon full of whatever he and nandy had traded for over the previous three months when he came back he would have the things that the village could not make for itself and he and nandy would set them up in the shop and make trades over the next few months they brought in things like needles and pins ribbons and colored thread sugarloaves spices and salt they were two of the errolds grove elite and as a result nandy had gone to the effort of planting things around their house that were pretty but impractical as a means of displaying their wealth she had beds of spring bulbs flowering trees that had no real fruit rose vines and evergreenholly and juniper the latter were planted against the side of the house and the hollows against the wall where the branches had died back for lack of sunlight made a good hiding place that was where darian went when hed filched a pie better to get under cover eat it quickly and dispose of the evidence at once they couldnt accuse you for having a blue tongue you could claim youd been berrying yourself he wriggled into place just below a window and proceeded to nibble delicately at his treat so as not to waste a single crumb for such a poorly regarded woman lilly was a remarkably good baker and her efforts certainly surpassed anything darian could produce the pastry was flaky and light perfectly browned and crunchy the filling sweet and juicy without being too runny he took a great deal of satisfaction not only in the fact that hed cheated hanbil out of something but out of the fact that taking it by sleightofhand had been a great deal more efficient than trying to get it by levitation or some other daft method justyn might have suggested i dont need his stupid magic to get what i need i can do anything i have to do with my two hands and my wits the more he thought about it the more discontented he became this was no life for anyone with any courage or ideas this was no place for anyone who wanted something besides a place to sleep and steady meals and predictability errolds grove was dying or dead and no one had noticed it but him and he had to escape before he died too nandy and another woman were talking inside but he didnt pay any heed to them until the tagend of a sentence caught his attention that old fraud who calls himself a wizard i dont know why we give over anything to support him the other woman replied querulously its not as if he was like kyle and useful ive said as much to my husband nandy replied with an air of triumph ive said to him that theres nothing that man could do that one of the girls couldnt learn take idas saffy she chuckled cruelly and the gods know there isnt a boy in errolds grove who would nandy her visitor exclaimed in mock shock now how could you say a thing like that twenty years old and not married a face like a horse and a body like a washboard its only plain speaking nandy retorted with obvious pleasure now look my man could take her up when he next goes off to the city and leave her at the healer there hell train her for nothing weve already asked in a year she comes back and we can send that goodfornothing fraud off to swindle some other village saffy could go back to living with her parents just like before but then shed go from being a burden to a blessing the rest of us could pay for her services as we need them not before and there wont be that drain on everyone which is purely cruel and now theres two to feed him and that useless feckless bit of bad blood that he calls an apprentice well it isnt fair the other agreed if youre never sick it doesnt seem fair to have to keep giving over food and clothing and all of course he does do finding and weatherwatching and a careful person dont need a finder and as for weatherwatching we got along well enough without it before nandy pronounced that as the end of the argument as for the boy well i dont doubt that if he doesnt manage to bring the forest down on us all as his rootless parents tried to do he certainly wont amount to anything he hasnt the intelligence of kyle and hes as shiftless as lilly and the sooner were rid of both of them the better off this village will be nandy and her customer moved away from the window at that point and darian couldnt hear anything but the murmur of voices he sat where he was not out of shock but suddenly struck by a sense of hopelessness so deep he couldnt have moved if his life had depended on it now they grudged even the scant food they provided him they were going to turn him out to fend for himself as soon as they could get away with it and they were going to do the same to justyn too but of course justyn would have a year or so to try to find a new place to go because they couldnt do without him until saffy was trained it sounded as if supposing nandy had her way they were going to just throw darian out as soon as nandy could get enough people to agree with her and justyn at least had some skills he could barter for a new place somewhere darian had nothing except the clothing hed brought with him the ability to shoot a bow and whatever he could convince folks he could do so what am i supposed to do go live off the forest with no supplies and no weapons but my bow and few arrows it was one thing to plan to become a great hunter and trapper when he was older and had built up all the things he needed to properly live in the wilds it was quite another to know that he was going to be cast out to make shift for himself with nothing whatsoever to help him no point in asking justyn for help either the old wizard would have a hard enough time finding a new place for himself maybe i should just run away now and get it over with if i go now maybe i could steal enough to keep me alive until i get to the next town thats kelmskeep i think isnt it assuming he could find the next town hed never been there and he didnt know how far it was or if he could get there afoot people said it was downriver but how far was it could he get there on his own and if he could would anyone want him when he got there assuming he didnt run into something else first like maybe hawkbrothers it used to be that you wouldnt run into them unless you trespassed in their territory but that wasnt the case anymore or so their yearly herald had said now they could be anywhere in the forest according to the herald they were supposed to be much better at doing the new kinds of magic than anyone else was and the herald had been rather vague about just what these bands of roaming hawkbrothers were supposed to be doing nor had he been able to tell the villagers how the hawkbrothers would react to any strangers they met in the forest of course as long as he stayed on the road he would probably be all right but what if he couldnt hed have to eat and drink and that would mean going into the forest to hunt for food and water well he had warning now if a trader came by before nandy got enough people together to agree to throw him out maybe he could get the man to take him along or maybe the herald would come soon and he could beg help there and hopefully the herald wouldnt decide that the best help would be to persuade the villagers to give darian one more chance that chance would last only as long as it took for them to get rid of justyn and then hed be out on his ear too now so thoroughly depressed that the filched sweet lay like a leaden lump in his stomach seeing no future now but a choice between uncertainty and endless drudgery darian crawled out of his hiding place and slunk like a beaten dog back to the dubious protection of his master the short distance to the other end of the village seemed shorter than usual and justyn was waiting for him outside the cottage when he came into view of the building darian knew by the set of justyns chin and the look in his eye that it would do him no good to tell his master what he had overheard at best justyn would dismiss it all as idle gossip betray his hiding place to nandy and hand him over to her for punishment at worst justyn would assume he was making it all up in an effort to avoid punishment in either case nothing would happen until it was too late for darian justyn had evidently pondered darians punishment for some time and had come up with something both appropriate and suitably quelling its about time you decided to show yourself he said his face set in a fearsome scowl i used the last of my mycofoetida oh kyle as you would know if you had been here as you ought to have been i had to clean up his mess and then clean up the dishes from last night that you were supposed to have attended to darian just hung his head and looked at his feet saying nothing there was nothing much he could say after all justyn was right he should have been there if he had been there nandy would have less ammunition to use against him there was little doubt that he had caused all of his misfortunes all by himself so since you happen to like roaming around in the forest so much you can just go out there and collect enough mycofoetida to fill this basket justyn dropped the basket contemptuously at his feet without waiting for him to reach for it darian winced and picked the basket up without a word mycofoetida was a fungus a particularly noxious shelffungus with a perfectly nauseating aroma when freshpicked the aroma faded to nothing within a few candlemarks of being gathered and when dried and packed in a wound it was a powerful preventive against infection but for those few hours it was best that both fungi and picker stayed away from anyone else it grew best on live tree trunks where there was a fair amount of indirect light which meant that you didnt have to go far into the forest to find it only justyn knew how to dry it prepare it and use it properly so only justyn ever went after it it was not a choice task to say the least justyn knew how to gather it without losing the contents of his stomach but darian didnt and he doubted that justyn was going to impart that information in his current mood he was right justyn also dropped his bow and quiver of arrows at his feet since youre going to be out there for some time the wizard continued you might as well hunt bring back something for our dinner tomorrow if i have to look at another turnip i may start breaking plates darian stooped again gathered up the bow and arrows and turned still without saying anything as he slouched away he thought he heard justyn mutter under his breath and it would serve you right if the hawkbrothers got you that last almost made darian break into hysterical laughter it was so incongruous after the things hed just overheard for it was a threat that was always being given to naughty children youd better be good or the hawkbrothers will get you even darians mum had said it playfully now and again when hed been into harmless mischief of all the things to tell him now as he trudged openly between the rows of corn heading for the forest he sighed and slung his quiver over his shoulder people always talked about hawkbrothers as if they were all male and no one had ever said anything about seeing a woman of fheir kind was that why mothers said that hawkbrothers would get a naughty child were there no women and did they kidnap children to replace their numbers no that didnt make any sense they were supposed to be allies of valdemar and your allies didnt go about snatching toddlers maybe they might ask the heralds for orphans to adopt that would be perfectly all right since the hawkbrothers were certainly capable of protecting children and caring for them but it wouldnt make sense for them to outandout kidnap little ones not that you could convince anyone here of that after all the hawkbrothers were foreign and as everyone here knew you couldnt trust foreigners still given how no one here wanted him maybe it wouldnt be so bad if the hawkbrothers did carry him off at least it would be an adventure maybe they would know something about what had happened to his mum and dad or they would be willing to help him try and find out after all they were supposed to know everything there was to know about the pelagiris and they actually lived in and off of the forest itself never needing any kind of supplies or help from outside not even his mum and dad had been able to do that maybe his best bet would be to try and find hawkbrothers instead of trying to avoid them but given the way my luck has been running if i run away and try to find them there wont be any of them for leagues around he thought dispiritedly while he shuffled toward a copse of trees everything i touch falls apart even justyn would have been better off if hed never seen me hellfires i bet he really doesnt want me around anymore hed probably be grateful if i just disappeared he hunted for the fungus in a rather halfhearted fashion as he tried to formulate plans that didnt fall apart the moment he considered what opposition to them he might encounter one thing he knew even if nobody in the village wanted him around the moment he tried to run off theyd go after him it wasnt logical but it was the way they did things it didnt matter if the outcome was what they wanted whatever happened had to be accomplished under their control take the case of anandas rooster for instance ananda pellard had an old rooster that was the most evilminded aggressive bird darian had ever seen she couldnt catch it to trim off its spurs and it would attack anything even grown people inflicting some painful punctures on children ananda always said that she ought to put it down but it was obvious she was afraid to try and catch it to kill it one night something plucked it out of the tree it roosted in ananda said she heard it squawk and in the morning there was only a pile of loose feathers with blood on them probably it had been an owl and you would have thought that everyone would be glad that the nasty old bird had been taken care of but no nothing would do but that the men sat up for the next several nights to try and kill whatever had come in to get the rooster darian wouldnt have been surprised if it had only been ananda who was upset after all it was her bird and even a tough old rooster made perfectly good soup but it seemed as if half the village was annoyed and all because what had happened hadnt been under their control so if he ran away even though none of them wanted him there anymore they would be angry and upset and sure to send someone after him to catch him and bring him back so whatever course he took he had to be somehow certain of being able to elude pursuit none of this made any sense of course but nothing was making any sense anymore he honestly truly tried to keep from going too far away but he couldnt find any of the shelffungus growing near at hand and he really hadnt expected to the last time hed hunted for the stuff hed had to climb so far up tree trunks that justyn had been alarmed and he knew that it wouldnt grow farther up than hed gone since there was too much light so since it needed a great deal of indirect light and that meant the edge of the forest he finally decided to work his way along the riverbank it was a slow process he hunted tree by tree looking for fungus at ground level then peering up along the trunk to see if there was any higher growth then finally climbing to see if what he had spotted was the kind of fungus he wanted or something else and that was probably exactly as justyn had planned too for justyn knew more about where things grew on the edge of the forest than darian did he must have climbed twenty trees before he found a single growth by that time at least he had worked out something to try to keep the fetidsmelling juice off his hands when he broke the piece off he wrapped several layers of leaves over the place where he held the fungus to break it off and immediately discarded them once the fungus was safely in the basket although it still smelled terrible he managed not to get any of the smell on himself he was up a third tree when he gradually became aware of a great deal of noise and shouting from the direction of the village he craned his head as far as he could around the tree trunk and nearly fell off the limb he was sitting on there was smoke rising from the village and from the road beyond it he saw people made small by the distance trying frantically to catch loose horses or heading toward the river with bundles on their backs and children stumbling along behind moving as quickly as they could a moment more and he saw the red of flame flickering on the other side of the river light glancing off something very bright and metallic and the shouts turned to screams a single thought formed through the shock something was happening the village of errolds grove somehow for some reason was under attack what am i going to do with this boy justyn thought as he watched darian slouch his way through the corn heading to the edge of the woods the boy vanished from sight within moments and he wasnt trying to hide this time no wonder he could evade virtually any watcher why he didnt even make the stalks move as he passed through them if you didnt know he was in the field youd think it was empty justyn sighed heavily went back into the cottage shut the door firmly behind him to discourage visitors and sank into his chair he didnt want to see anyone else today unless it was a tearing emergency all morning he had been receiving visitors eager to give him their own idea of what he should do about darians latest infraction and some of the speakers had voiced something stronger than mere opinion it was clear that if he couldnt get darian turned around there were those who would take care of the situation for him most of them wanted him to dismiss the boy and didnt really care what happened to him after he was dismissed he wouldnt be allowed to stay here that was certain the villagers didnt like the way their children were reacting to his presence or more specifically his actions hes a disruptive influence was how derrel lutter the shopkeeper put it he doesnt fit an evejy part of a village has to fit widow clay had dropped by on the pretext of having her bad knee looked at and had been more to the point the other children think hes some kind of hero or at least they think hes somebody to look up to if hes allowed to sass his elders and get away with it every youngun in errolds grove is gonna start doin the same shed pointed out so unless you want to be the reason for a lot of spanked bottoms and soapy mouths youd better get that boy to act like something other than a savage folks have given him a certain amount of room on account of losing his parents and all but theyre out of patience and the woman was perfectly right although he held himself aloof from the other children in the village darian was a profound influence on them and even justyn had noticed it they envied his freedom freedom to run off and do what he wanted and freedom to speak his mind even to an adult they all wished that their parents had been as adventurous as his and when he was willing to talk about it which was not often they hung on every word of his stories about living in the forest any one of them would happily have traded places with him even though life with justyn was hardly one of exalted status and when they could get away with it they flatout imitated him the most coveted item among the village children at the moment was a tooled leather vest like darian wore that was what virtually all of them of both sexes had requested as birthingday presents justyn had actually considered that attitude a healthy one and he had secretly hoped some of it might rub off on the parents it had been something of a half daydream of his if their elders got some spine back and decided to stop fearing the forest and go back out to do what had brought prosperity to the village in the first place then the place would stop stagnating it might even prosper again and they would discover that there was nothing so terrible in the pelagiris after all they would stop denigrating darians parents and might even stoop to consulting him about the forest which would raise both his status and justyns in the eyes of the village even if darians influence had only been on the children they looked likely to go out and do what their parents feared to errolds grove would prosper again perhaps not this year or the next but in the future that was the good influence in the meantime the children were as prone to imitate darians sins as his virtues so darian was likely to cause another uproar when word of this day leaked out to the children without a doubt there would be a brief plague of children sneaking out on their appointed tasks to play truant and defying their parents when taken to task that had not been in any of justyns halfformed plans he sighed then rested his aching head on his hand it seemed that nothing he had thought of for darian was working out in the way he had hoped perhaps if i proved to him what his behavior is doing in setting an example and a bad one among the other children hes not an unreasonable child and he wouldn t want to get the others in trouble that might do the trick perhaps justyn had been going about this all wrong darian had been treated as a sort of miniature adult by his parents hed had a great deal of independence with them he was used to relative freedom and the responsibility of deciding what he was to do for himself but justyn had been treating him as a directionless child justyn tapped a little marching rhythm on the arm of his chair with his free hand and frowned as he thought i should sit down with him i think instead of lecturing him or going on about how much he owes us i should point out to him no thats wrong that would be treating him as a child again and although what he is doing is childish i am no longer certain his motives are entirely those of a child instead of telling him anything perhaps i should begin by listening to him if i can get him to tell me what has been going through his mind these many months perhaps we can work out the best way to proceed together and perhaps i should tell him my own story and let him see why i am teaching him the way i am that might be the way to get through to him lost in these thoughts and unexpectedly wearied from the stress of dealing with all those unhappy visitors justyn closed his eyes just for a moment just to ease them one moment turned to two and two to many and without intending to permit himself the luxury he dozed off dreaming of a repentant apprentice now willing to be taught and to take on the responsibilities of a proper student then he reached the point in sleep where his dreams themselves faded away justyn was so deep in slumber that it took several moments for the sound of the alarm bell in the village square to penetrate his consciousness when it did sift through it brought him awake with a start it took another few moments for him to collect his thoughts and realize what it was that had awakened him it had been so long since that particular bell had been rung the last time had been due to a flood but what could possibly be amiss this time a quick glance out the window showed that there was no sign of a storm and the village had been so quiet that dalians peccadillo was the worst thing to disturb the dull routine of the day what had happened to change that his heart pounded uncomfortably at the sudden awakening he struggled up out of his chair every joint protesting violently at such sudden movement and got his walking stick down off the wall he opened his door on pandemonium outside beyond the nearest houses in the village square there was a babble of voices the noise of many people running to and fro he heard many people shouting and there was panic in their tones he hobbled out his door to see folk streaming toward the center of town from the fields he joined them alarm giving him more energy than hed had for many a day by the time he reached the square most of them had beaten him there some had already heard the news which must be terrible indeed to judge from the way they were pelting back to their houses faces pale and eyes gone panicky and full of fear others had already been to their houses and were returning with hunting bows boarspears and rusty old antique weapons in their hands a monster bandits surely not war who would we be fighting the hawkbrothers no thats not possible surely there is some other explanation derrel lutter stood beside nandy who was still ringing the bell with wideeyed determination her hair had come undone and flew in wild tendrils all about her face beside derrel was a stranger holding the reins of a tired horse whose clothing showed the effects of a hard ride and whose face was pinched with terror he was trying not to let loose dont try to fight you fools the man shouted over the bell and the shouting his voice cracking with strain run i tell you run i tried to tell you before and you didnt believe me this isnt some band of brigands this is an army and you havent a chance against it bewildered justyn looked around and saw vere coming back to the square with a determined scowl on his face and a boarspear in his hands and seized his arm what in the name of heaven is going on he shouted vere thrust his chin at the stranger that theres a feller from riverford farm big estate upwater where derrel does some trading he shouted back derrel vouches for him came riding in bout middinner says a gang of men and monsters came storming in and massacred everybody in sight says he was out with the herds and managed to get away on his horse and make a run for it he wasnt too clear on what hed seen not then anyway so we figured it was bandits and tom kalley rounded up the militia the man paused when he saw the look of noncomprehension on justyns face he mounted up and led em out just like always wasnt nothing to frighten the women about he thought so nobody told em except for the ones whose men hadda go mend just go out turn em away from the village and send a messenger over to lord breon you know we aint never had no trouble before we figgered riverford just been caught out thats all too bad for them but we were ready see justyn shook his head not yet understanding the cause for such a high level of panic the errolds grove militia never had experienced any trouble discouraging bandits from coming after the town it didnt make any sense vere wasnt through yet one of them just one came back a short bit ago his horse was foundering and it dropped and died right after he tumbled off the rest theyre gone justyn gaped at him the militia twenty men in all were well armed and quite adequately trained and their ability to fight on horseback had given them a considerable edge over bandits who were generally afoot and even when horsed did not know how to fight as a group when the guard had been forced to leave to go to the front the queen had no intention of leaving them defenseless she had sent spare horses and arms and someone to train volunteers from the village in fighting their herald had supervised the training and had seen to it that the trainer left instructions on drilling and practices which the militia undertook with religious regularity one of the duties of their herald was to make sure that they stayed in training and the occasional bandits only gave them incentive to continue that way justyn had watched them and they werent bad and the level of their expertise was obvious in the fact that they had handled every bandit group that they had come up against how could they have been wiped out so easily the stranger grabbed nandy and took the bellrope out of her hands by force so that the clangor finally stopped listen to me listen to me he shouted and the cries and screams stopped as abruptly as the cessation of the bell peals his words fell into the sudden silence like cold round stones into a pool you heard the boy your men are dead he said forcefully and a womans hysterical sob pierced the quiet only to be muffled by her neighbor pulling her head into the shelter of her shoulder the stranger ignored her you cant do anything for them you can only save yourselves and theres not much time to do that send someone downriver to kelmskeep and lord breon someone on a fast horse or in a swift boat and do it now the rest of you grab what you can and run as fast and as far as you can this is no bandit horde im telling you i know because i saw them this is an army its men and monsters and it looks like a demon is leading them they killed everyone at riverford that resisted and theyll do the same here now justyn saw that young ado larsh barely seventeen and the youngest member of the militia was sitting on the platform beside the stranger there was a bloody rag acting as a bandage around his head and one eye and another binding his arm he looked white in deep shock but nodded in confirmation of everything the man said what about those who didnt resist widow clay called out sharply what happened to them someone else growled and a few of her neighbors cast her angry looks but she gave them back look for look there are some of us she pointed out who cant run myself and kyle for two what happened to those who didnt resist the stranger shook his head i dont know i didnt wait around to see but i can tell you that from the smoke that rose up behind me it looked to me like they put every building on the estate to the torch and i can only hope there wasnt anyone in those buildings when they went up thththeyre mmmoving fffast ado stammered cccant bbe ffar bbbehind there was silence then nothing but silence clearly no one knew what to do next and if no one took charge in a moment there would be nothing but blind panic people would be caught between trying to hide and trying to escape torn between saving possessions and getting away quickly and managing only to confuse matters further if someone didnt tell them what to do nothing would be done at all and they would all die stupidly and uselessly right ill take over from here justyn heard himself say into the deathly hush people turned to see who had spoken as if they didnt recognize his voice maybe they didnt this was the first time he had spoken with real authority in years he pulled himself up as tall as he could and pushed through the crowd with the aid of his staff until he got himself up on the platform their faces turned up to meet his all of them white and shocked all of them looking for an answer from anyone even him well as it happened he had one for them a bit of murmuring started and he quelled it with three sharp raps of the end of his staff on the boards beneath his feet this is war and war is what i came out of he looked around to see if there was any disagreement some of you may not have believed my war tales as you called them but they were as true as the fact that ive seen how armies operate i know whats coming and i know what im talking about the stranger is right you arent fighters anyone who had any real training here is dead you have no experience of anything but dealing with a few bandits and i tell you now there is no way you can defend yourselves let alone the village against an army of trained and organized fighters he had their full attention now and since the majority of those below him were women and children not men there were fewer who were disposed to argue with that assessment which is just as well since its an honest one your best bet is to try to escape or try to hide anyone who wants to take a chance on staying id suggest you go to the riverbank as far from the village as you can and stay together he said briskly dont take anything of value with you armies like this are paid in loot and if you stand between them and their loot theyll kill you if you have valuables with you theyll kill you to get at them let them have what they want if you all survive this you can petition the crown for relief and get it if you go hide yourselves beside the river have nothing they want and look as harmless as possible once theyre done working out their battlelust in looting theyll get around to finding you and they probably wont kill you probably thats all i can promise you out of my military experience they might just want loot and theyll leave you completely alone never looking for you or they might decide to make slaves or something out of you if you have young children take toys and sweets to keep them quiet when the enemy soldiers find you grovel beg bow your heads to the ground and plead with them and dont stand up until they tell you to with luck they wont find you at all with a little less theyll let you go and with a bit less than that youll end up serving them he didnt say what else might happen this was not the time to turn the women hysterical if they hadnt already thought of it themselves there was no point in bringing the subject up but at least well be alive widow clay declared and began to hobble determinedly toward the river justyn gave her credit for good sense she didnt even look back at her cottage much less go back to try and save anything she simply set her sights on the river and in putting as much distance between herself and the approaching trouble as possible the rest of you do as you were told take boats or horses if you have them go afoot if you dont and run now dont stop to take anything with you every moment you waste packing valuables is a moment when you could be putting as much distance between you and here as possible dont let your jewelry cost you your life go to kelmskeep its fortified and should be able to hold off a siege a few moved to follow the widow and before anyone else could start he rapped his staff on the platform again as for me he trumpeted in a pretty fair imitation of his old sergeants paradeground voice ill hold the bridge against them ive held bridges before and this one only needs one warrior or wizard to hold it long enough for a considerable delay the rest of you take the time i buy for you and run for kelmskeep or put some furlongs between you and here lord breon has a real garrison of veteran fighters and he also has ways of getting word out in a few hours to the guard he can protect those of you who reach him long enough for the guard and the heralds to get here relieve a siege and drive the enemy out of errolds grove if you can spare a moment set fire to your hay and your outbuildings as you run the smoke will help hide you and might alert others out there that theres trouble the fire will confuse the enemy and keep them occupied a little longer they might stop long enough to try and put it out or they might run into burning buildings thinking theres loot and get themselves crisped whatever you do if you get caught dont fight back fall to the ground and beg for mercy theyre trained youre not and there will be many of them for every one of you now move he finished in a bellow that startled them all out of their poses of shock you havent much time save your lives now as he had expected they were all so happy that there was someone who could take charge of the situation and tell them clearly what to do that no one argued with him they simply scattered some to follow widow clay some to their boats or for their horses some headed straight for the woods on foot perhaps planning to take cover there and follow the river road to lord breons estate he walked slowly and calmly toward the bridge and as he passed the inn he saw with a mingled sense of admiration and irony that lilly had her own strategy for surviving she had loaded a wheelbarrow with a small keg that could only be brandywine some mugs and a mattress and she was headed obliquely toward the river on the upstream side of the village it was fairly obvious to justyn that in this situation at least lilly was not as stupid as everyone had thought she was she had a fair idea what an invading army would do with a woman and she was going to see that the ones who found her had a reason to protect her and keep her out of the hands of their fellows ablebodied and used to hard work she would probably go far enough away from the others that when soldiers found her there would only be a few of them and someone who acted like a cooperative wouldbe camp follower had good odds of surviving this encounter she might even find one man strong enough to hold off the others and willing to act as her protector which was the best any woman could hope for in a case like this one he wished her good luck silently as if she had somehow heard his wish she turned and looked back at him he couldnt hear her completely over the noise of the fleeing villagers but he read the words on her lips i know what you mean to do gods bless and keep you wizard justyn she turned away but before her face was completely averted he saw tears starting up in her eyes tears for me with astonishment he felt a kind of weight lift away from his shoulders and a new strength and dignity enter him he drew himself up and continued his stately progress to the bridge no one else paid him any attention but no one else even thought to question his plan to recall that only a few hours before he had been the unregarded scorned old fool who couldnt even manage to discipline a young boy that was just as well because he did have a plan and he knew it would work he might not have much magic left but he had enough for one last trick and it would delay pursuit long enough long enough long enough for dorian to get deep into the forest thanks to the gods that i sent him off candlemarks ago hell see the commotion and hell run like a sensible lad theres nothing holding him here after all and i suspect that hes been tempted to run away more than once this will just give him the excuse he needs he has his bow he knows the woods its summer and he has enough control of magic that his power can help him a little he knows where kelmskeep is if not how to get there i think hell be all right he went to the middle of the bridge if the people behind him knew it a good magic place suspended among three of the four elements air water and the earth that the wood of the bridge had grown out of and was rooted in he grounded his staff on the wood of the bridge and began drawing power out of the world around himself it was a slow process but he had time and besides all that he gathered was only intended to add to the power within himself normally he would not be able to tap into much of that well this situation is not exactly normal as he began the old black tomcat ambled up and sat down neatly at his feet just as calmly as if he were sitting down at the hearth waiting for dinner justyn looked down at the cat bemusedly i wish i knew what you really were he told the cat i wish i knew if you were just an opportunist or a real pelagir familiar it might not make much of a difference to this situation but well it would to me halfheartedly he tried to shoo the cat away but it refused to leave his side and he gave up small aged animals fared poorly in situations like this one it would be better off with him the cat looked up at him with one eye truly a jaundiced look if there ever was one yawned hugely and turned his attention toward the road justyn took his cue from the cat and saw a plume of dust rising above the treetops the enemy was coming whoever the enemy was and as had been warned it was coming swiftly justyn took a deep breath and closed his eyes for a moment reaching inside himself for calm and certainty when he opened them again a heartbeat later he was ready this will be a very short confrontation darian was out of breath by the time he reached the village justyn wasnt in the cottage the flames he had seen were from haystacks and sheds and when he saw vere throw a flaming brand into the thatch of his own cottage he realized that the villagers themselves had set their property aflame everywhere people were fleeing as if for their lives in the confusion it seemed as if there were hundreds more folk than actually lived in the village and he wondered if they had all gone suddenly mad he coughed in the acrid smoke and stood poised in the midst of the chaos searching for someone to tell him what was going on someone seized his arm he automatically started to wrench away when as he turned he saw it was kyle the woodcutter you gotta run and hide in the woods boy the man shouted over the noise of fire and fleeing people shaking his arm for emphasis theres trouble on the way big trouble fighters an army moren we can handle he dropped darians arm and hobbled off toward the river using a stick as a crutch leaving the boy staring after him blankly trouble more than they can handle what was that supposed to mean as kyle had held him the last of the villagers had left the confines of the town nothing impeded him but the refuse of what theyd left behind in their wake and the fires and smoke pigs goats chickens geese and even cattle milled in the street evidently turned loose by their owners he ran up the path toward the bridge jumping over dropped bundles and dodging the confused and panicky livestock and fowl certain only that whatever was coming it would be coming from that direction since it was away from that direction that everyone was running it never occurred to him that justyn might not have run away with the rest of them until he got around a house and could see the bridge and justyn was standing straight as a post in the middle of it the old cat sat calmly at his side and justyn had grounded his wizards staff on the wood of the bridge for all the world as if it was a real magical staff and not just a glorified walking stick his back was to the village all his attention was on the road on the other side of the bridge something was making a very large dust cloud on the road a dust cloud that approached the river and it was coming on uncomfortably fast darian stood stock still and stared he felt like a fly in amber feet frozen where he had stopped able to observe but unable to move or speak the dust cloud neared approached the bridge now he saw what made it people people carrying weapons and things also with glittering weapons in their hands a great many of both they were arrayed in evenly spaced ranks armed and armored identically and heavily or at least more heavily than anyone in the village militia or the guard that darian had ever seen had been the sun reflected brightly off shiny pikeheads and helms off shields and axes all very strong and newlooking they were led by something much larger than kyle and quite clearly not human who was sitting on an animal that was clearly not a horse the differences between the humans and the things werent subtle if someone had taken a bear and given it the tusks of a boar that was what the humansized things looked like they didnt wear much in the way of a helm but it didnt look as if they really needed a helm which was frightening in and of itself they had small red eyes hairy muzzles and low brows underneath their helmets the humans looked like humans only mean and cold as if they didnt much care about anything the large thing was something of a different order altogether where skin showed under armor it was a sort of flat dead greenish color like mud with riveralgae mixed in its face was flat with a wide nose that had slits instead of nostrils its mouth was another slit lipless and when it opened its mouth darian saw that all of its teeth were pointed its eyes were a flat dull gray with tiny pinprick pupils as if it preferred darkness to light the creature it rode resembled nothing so much as a huge lizard with fat kneeless legs and a long fat tail the mount didnt need armor it hadvgrown its own the leading thing halted and the entire army behind it came to a dead stop as it held up its hand it looked at justyn at the cat and back to justyn darian expected it to laugh at the temerity of one silly old man trying to stop them all from coming across that bridge but it didnt laugh instead it narrowed its eyes and glared at justyn without saying a word justyn simply stood there calmly as if he saw such things every day as if keeping them from crossing the bridge was no great matter darians heart raced there was a roaring in his ears and he had broken into a cold sweat his stomach was doing flips his throat was knotted and he shivered like an aspen leaf he wanted to run to help justyn to drag him away to shout at least but he couldnt do anything nothing in his body would answer to his will he could only stand and watch numb with fear justyn seemed to grow taller for a moment and his ragged robes gathered around him of themselves like a royal garment he looked at that moment just like a real wizard the kind they made songs about and painted portraits of he looked like wizard kyllian like a hero the thing lifted the reins of its mount and the lizard put one ponderous foot after the other onto the bridge its head swinging from side to side with each pace and the first lot of bearthings followed until it and the entire first rank of creatures was crowded sixdeep behind it on the bridge justyn simply stood there unmoving until the muzzle of the lizard was barely the length of his staff away from his face justyn bowed his head in a momentary nod then with no warning the entire bridge and everything on it vanished into a sheet of flame darian screamed but his cry of horror and dismay was lost in the sound of the explosion the concussion of the blast knocked darian off his feet and stunned him for a moment when he scrambled back up there was no sign of justyn or even of the bridge just a roaring torrent of fire stretching over the river that reached from one bank to the other darian didnt think couldnt think but his body wanted to live and knew that the only way to make sure that he lived was to run so it did and it carried darian along with it even though his heart cried to join justyn in the flames he jumped a hedgerow and before hed hit the ground the hedge disintegrated and blew past him in pieces he tumbled onto his left side and cried out but he couldnt hear himself darians vision narrowed to what was before him losing his peripheral awareness his mind obsessed only with being on his feet again and running for all he could gain he ran as he had never run before hardly conscious of anything but picking the path in front of him bits of flaming debris from the bridge flew through the air and landed in his path in the thatch of intact cottages setting them afire he scattered a flock of chickens before him as tongues of flame licked at him and smoke blew into his eyes confusing him and making it hard to see as he choked and coughed he didnt rightly seem to be in control of his body at all he was carried along a stunned passenger in a vehicle that had its own ideas about what it was going to do it wasnt as easy running through the village as it usually was there were fires everywhere now and debris and more of the things that the villagers had dropped as they escaped littering the usually orderly pathways he had to double back and circle around obstacles so that his path through the village to the safety of the forest took on the twisted quality of a nightmare there was a lot of noise behind him shouting and splashing and as soon as he broke free of the houses he turned for an instant and discovered that the enemy had found the ford that the bridge had replaced they had come up along either side of the burning bridge flanking the village and were already running up the riverbank cutting him off from the woods but there werent many of them yet they were all human and they were spaced quite far apart he was most of the way across a field of waisthigh wheat when the first one spotted him and shouted the shout acted as an added incentive not that he had needed one but somehow he managed to put on another burst of speed and shot past the two men nearest him bursting through the underbrush and into the woods here he was at an advantage for he knew the paths and they did not it wasnt possible to shoot at anything moving as fast as he was for the paths twisted and turned with foliage making it difficult to get off a clear shot he heard men floundering through the undergrowth for a while but after a bit they gave up their pursuit of him he continued to run through the thick green forest pelting headlong down the path his feet thudding in the dirt by now his initial burst of energy had worn off his lungs and legs burned and he had no choice but to slow his mindless dash once he lost his momentum he woke out of his trance strength just ran out of him he had to slow and then finally to stop he bent over double in the middle of the path hands braced on both his knees to keep them from collapsing panting and sobbing at one and the same time he wanted to scream to weep and never stop to run until he came to the edge of the world to run back to the village and fling himself against the entire army he hadnt the strength to do anything but take huge gasping breaths that burned his lungs and brought a stitch to his side he could not believe what he had just seen and yet the scene was etched into his memory as indelibly as if the fires justyn had called up had scorched the image there he still couldnt think clearly conflicting emotions warred in his mind for the upper hand rage grappled with heartshattering grief and kept him from breaking into helpless tears fears warred with confusion and kept him from going on despair battled with determination and urged him to crawl into the nearest hole to hide where was he to go what was he to do how was he to get away from these madmen for madmen they must be why would anyone in his right mind want to attack an impoverished dying backwater like errolds grove a place where so few people had even a single copper coin to their names that most of the village transactions were run on barter and tallysticks a single small sane voice spoke up amidst the confused babble of thoughts in his head get off the path stupid if theyre still following you thats how theyll come he straightened up with difficulty trotted a few stiff paces farther along the wall of underbrush and wriggled through a set of vines whose springy tendrils would snap back behind him rather than breaking leaving no trace of his passage unless of course they have some sort of tracking beast the voice reminded him this is no place to hide collect your thoughts and think of something better he wriggled underneath some bushes and huddled there breathing hard each breath stabbing the bottom of his lungs like a redhot poker and listening there was plenty of noise behind him but nothing immediately around him where did i get into the woods through the wheatfield that was on the back side of the village next to the corn and away from the bluff so i wont be striking the river if i keep on this way but i also wont have to climb will these people have a trackingbeast do armies have such things with them he hadnt seen any dogs but that didnt meant they werent there he tried to remember what if anything justyn had said about the armies he had been with but he couldnt recollect enough now he regretted not listening to the old mans stories theyd seemed so irrelevant at the time but now now i only hope i have more time to regret not listening to him his next thought was to climb a tree but he dismissed it immediately as a bad idea if the enemy had a tracker hed be trapped no he had to get as far away from the village as possible and then what one thing at a time get away first worry about what comes next after youve gotten away he stayed where he was until his sides and legs didnt hurt as much listening cautiously for sounds that meant pursuit that didnt just mean the sounds of someone coming down the path behind him it meant the lack of normal sounds from the small birds and animals nearby and the warning calls of birds that had been disturbed by intruders cries that would come from higher up in the trees there was nothing immediately around him but silence broken only by a few faint rustles and mutters and he decided with some reluctance that he ought to go back to the path it was true that anyone hunting him would have to use it but it was equally true that he would make much better time if he didnt have to fight his way through the undergrowth his passage would be quieter too i can wait until im deeper into the forest before i get off the path a bit farther on the undergrowth thins and i can move through the trees a great deal easier that would make for another danger though thinner undergrowth would mean a better chance of being spotted if the enemy had also gone off the path just because he knew the forest it didnt follow that the enemy was ignorant of it nevertheless sitting here only made being caught more likely he shook off his doubts wriggled out of his cover as branches and twigs caught at his hair and clothing and found his way back to the path he had abandoned trying to make a minimum of disturbance to the underbrush his tough bare feet made no more sound on the path than the falling of a leaf and he trotted along with an arrow nocked to his bow all senses alert for what seemed like an eternity his nerves strained to the breaking point so much that he shivered like a nervous hare and started each time a birdcall broke the silence every deeper shadow seemed to hide an enemy and every cracking twig might be the sound of a heavy foot whats ahead of me in this direction he thought about the path for a while and decided that one of his stormshelters was a pile of rock slabs in the middle of a rockstrewn clearing with enough room under three of them piled together for him to squeeze himself and a small fire beneath according to the villagers at some point farther than any of them had ever cared to go and farther than he had been able to penetrate it became hawkbrother territory well werent they supposed to be valdemars allies shouldnt they do something about these invaders if he could get away maybe he ought to try to find them if he could get away from the invaders in the first place a posthumous revenge was not going to be very satisfactory from his point of view the undergrowth thinned as he knew from past explorations that it would and he put his arrow back in the quiver fastened the cover over it and unstrung his bow slinging it over his shoulder now that he could see for some distance he knew that he no longer had much of an advantage with his bow if he saw an enemy now it would not be a case of surprise at short range and the enemies were armored he might be the best shot in the village but a smallgame bow had no chance against armor his only chance of felling one of these men would lie in a lucky shot through the helmslit and today did not seem a good day to trust his luck he picked up his pace into the lope his father had taught him for covering the greatest amount of ground with the least effort now it was possible to see for some distance under the trees what growth there was here was composed of thin delicate bushes with slender leaves a few sparselyleaved vines with stems as thick as his leg and some palegreen weeds liberally festooned with prickles there wasnt a great deal of cover and it was the huge tree trunks themselves that blocked vision he got off the path and under the trees hoping that he would be able to see trouble before it saw him a few furlongs farther on he ran into the enemys second line he literally ran into it a patrol of three mounted men he rounded a huge tree trunk and suddenly there they were their horses shying away from the unexpected intruder that was all that allowed him to escape them as they fought their startled horses he dodged between two of them and ran darting in and around the trees feeling the place between his shoulder blades crawl as he expected an arrow to hit there at any moment after the initial surprise they seemed to treat his appearance as something of a joke he couldnt understand their language but their laughter was plain enough cruel though it sounded evidently they thought that hunting him was going to be an entertaining way to pass the time as he ran and dodged hoping to get to his rockpile and hide they pursued him without putting their horses into a lather and before too many moments had passed it was obvious to him that they were making a game out of herding him before them he glanced back once or twice and saw that theyd taken off their helms and gorgets and both were dangling from the pommels of their saddles by the straps that only allowed him to see their faces more clearly and what he saw in those brief glances chilled him these were cold and hardened men who were getting a great deal of cruel amusement from playing with him as a cat plays with a terrified mouse they clearly thought he was as soft as one of the villagers and wouldnt last long before tiring and they had every reason to believe that he was skinny and looked younger than he was and they were on horseback if they could get him running in a straight line they could easily tire him out and run him down so he wouldnt run in a straight line and he would try to get to his rock pile where horses couldnt go without breaking an ankle once he got wedged into his hole he could draw his knife and keep them at bay and then what well maybe theyd get tired of trying to pry him out at the moment this was his only hope faint though it was he dodged around a tree waited until they thundered past him with his back pressed against the bark and then made a dash for another temporary obstacle in the form of a patch of vines he dove into those rolled beneath them and came out the other side while they were still hacking their way through the stems with their swords now he saw the sign that he was nearer his goal than hed thought a tall standing stone shaped like a finger pointing straight upward he dashed for that ducked around it dove and scrambled beneath a bush as one of the men charged him with an incomprehensible shout he made it through to the other side of the bush and scrabbled to his feet again to make the last dash for the rock pile the men bellowed laughter as they chased him he threw himself flat as they charged down at him then picked himself up and made a scramble over the last couple of furlongs they overshot him and had to pull their horses around in a wide circle to avoid riding them into the treacherous footing of the rocks his heart was pounding so hard it rivaled the sound of the horses hooves and all he could think about was that narrow triangle of dark that meant his hiding place if he could get in there hed be hard to get out he scuttled over the rocks the stones shifting under his feet and making him slip and fall bruising palms and knees the crevice was close almost within reach a shadow fell over him as his hand actually touched the first of the great stone slabs that formed his shelter he flinched away tried to throw himself to the side but it was too late his heart literally stopped and a dark film passed over his vision a hand seized the collar of his shirt and hauled him upright dangling him in the air in front of the crudest face he had ever seen in his life the mans greasy hair was braided back in a tail and bound around the forehead with a dirty red scarf he had cold flat brown eyes like dead pebbles his right eyebrow was split by a scar that continued on down his cheek his teeth were broken and discolored his beard untrimmed and full of tiny bits of straw he held darian up and shook him roaring laughter darian stopped breathing he was the biggest man darian had ever seen bigger than kyle and every muscle of his arms and legs under the sweatdamp dirty skin was rock hard and a great deal of those arms and legs showed beneath the metal corselet and thigh guards the armor was very nearly too small to protect him adequately he said something to his two companions and chortled shaking darian again he smelled too bad breath and rank sweat and rancid grease all combined to make him stink like a sick and unclean animal darians mind went blank he hung limply in the mans grasp waiting for whatever the men was going to do to him whatever it was it would probably be very bad the other two remained on the horses at the edge of the rockfield shouting encouragement to their fellow whatever he planned to do they obviously approved of darian wondered if it would hurt for very long please he pleaded silently hoping some god would listen let it be over quickly at that instant the shaft of a whitefeathered arrow appeared in the mans throat as if conjured up by his prayer the mans eyes bulged blood sputtered from his lips and his hand came up to claw at the arrow that darian hadnt even heard pass over his own shoulder three snowfire kvala a hawkbrother of the kvala clan had only twice or three times before this mission ever been inside the border of the land called valdemar he considered himself only passably and imperfectly acquainted with the customs of these valdemarans he thought of himself as a good scout an excellent hunter and an indifferent mage of no better than master level but not any kind of an expert on their affable foreign allies but he did know this much lawabiding mounted valdemaran fighters of whatever ilk did not chase young boys afoot without a very good reason they certainly did not chase such boys in the manner of a cruel game taking pleasure from the childs obvious fear nor would they do so with clear intent to harm him therefore when hweel his bondbird came flying silently out of the treetops projecting urgent images of just that into his mind snowfire did not need to ponder diplomatic contingencies to make a decision hweel made one of his rare calls warning him that he was coming down the birds call was a long profound bass note like a thunderous breath deeper by far than that of a more common hoot of an owl of normal size and breeding snowfire held up his arm with the heavy wristtoshoulder leather gauntlet on it and prepared for hweels landing as hweel dropped out of the canopy with his wings spread wide to slow his glide snowfire braced himself he had to hweel was easily three or four times the size and mass of most bondbirds and twice the size and mass of a normal eagleowl even with no intent to harm simply landing came as something of a shock to the one hweel was landing on feet the size of snowfires hand closed relatively gently on his arm upon impact and through a triplethickness of leather he still felt their potentiallylethal strength snowfire endured the buffeting of hweels wings for a moment as the bird steadied himself then hweel folded his massive pinions and settled on snowfires arm snowfire stared into the round golden eyes and opened his mind fully to his bondbird hweel showed him images from above of course but every detail was unnervingly sharp there were three wellarmed but illkempt fighters on horseback apparently patrolling through the tall trees through hweels memory snowfire saw a thin boy with a bow and not much else suddenly blunder in among them the boy ran the fighters followed making a game of letting him stay just far enough in front to make him think he might escape taking pleasure in herding him guide me he told his bird and with an effort that drove a short grunt from him he cast hweel up into the air the bird spread his wings and with powerful downstrokes drove himself upward what passes his mount asked tossing his long curved horns and tilting his head so that the intelligent eyes faced snowfire nothing good snowfire replied dismounting he told the dyheli stag who was his partner to go back to the others with a message that he had been detained and why then got his bow and quiver down from the roll tied to the dyhelis creamcolored saddle pad that nearly matched the stags creamy coat are you certain you wish to do this afoot the stag asked flicking his ears with aloof interest no point in making it obvious that im not of kvaldemar he replied stringing his bow with a little effort besides if these ruffians see you theyii probably shoot you for meat the stag snorted with affront and disgust barbarians then and ignorant the stag replied i will tell the others and with that the stag leaped easily and gracefully away heading unerringly for the encampment he made scarcely a sound as he ran the dyheli were masters of their environment the deep forest snowfire followed hweel nocking an arrow to his bow making even less sound than the stag like the dyheli the tayledras were masters of the forest the others were expecting him to return to their base camp with game soon dealing with this situation would probably not take long to resolve but having sent the dyheli sifyra back with word of what he was doing if he did not return within a reasonable time some of the others would come after him and sifyra could lead them to the right place half of being clever is making certain you are not being stupid that was a shinain proverb and one of his favorites he might not be one for swift thinking but he seldom put a foot wrong perhaps nightwind his lady love preferred most battle plans do not survive the initial encounter with the enemy but she had associated with the gryphons for too long for some of their cavalier and devilmaycare attitude not to have rubbed off snowfire kept every sense alert now that he was afoot and alone on the ground he noted every deeper shadow beneath the canopy of the enormous trees here notedathe tenor of birdsong up in the canopy itself drank in the scents of forest litter searching for the aroma of newlybruised greenery hweel did not see everything it was perfectly possible that there was an ambush waiting here somewhere hweel flew silently up through the lower branches of the canopy hweel could fly silently because he unlike every other bondbird in the yedorkandan kshulah was a shorteared eagleowl owls flew with no betraying sound at all unless very close thanks to their softedged feathers and unlike most owls the eagleowls were equally adept at day or night flying making them ideal bondbirds for a scout or hunter who might find himself moving by day or night yet there were few of them among the tayledras of kvala for there were only four breeding pairs in the entire vale at the moment snowfire considered himself incredibly fortunate that hweel had chosen him as his bondmate in such a circumstance as this he felt even greater gratitude no one would see hweel unless hweel chose it to be so and that would be a bad thing for the one making the sighting as it would probably be the last thing he saw the talons of a tayledrasbred eagleowl could pierce the skull of a goat so great was the pressure behind them and what they could do to a goat could easily be done to a man unlike his lesser kindred hweel was intelligent enough to pick distinct targets for his talons such as vulnerable eye sockets although snowfire had not yet needed to put such killing power to the test against a man hweel had already proven himself valiant and valuable against the changebeasts loosed by the magestorms hurry hweel sent urgently and filled snowfires mind with the image of a brute of a man pursuing the boy across a pile of rocks laughing the man was afoot now having left his horse at the edge of the rockfield snowfire broke into a swift but cautious run he did not want to betray his presence by either noise or movement so he dashed from the cover of one giant tree trunk to the next keeping himself well out of sight he reached the edge of the clearing just in time to see the man in question catch the boy and haul him up by the collar howling with laughter he held the boy limply from his hand he was big enough that the boys feet dangled some distance off the ground the boy was as pale as ice clearly terrorstricken there were two other men very nearby mounted on horses also laughing even from here snowfire caught an unpleasant scent of rancid grease and stale sweat snowfire eased into the cover of a brushcovered boulder held in place by the massive roots of a nearby tree between the mottled shadows at the edge of the clearing and the camouflaging effect of his scout gear that was quite enough cover to keep him invisible one of the mounted men called to the one with the boy they did not speak valdemaran but one of the mountain dialects of the north you caught your rabbit cor now what are you going to do with him called the first one snowfire held down his anger the boy wasnt hurt yet although he clearly expected something terrible to happen to him a mountain barbarian doesnt normally kill an unarmed captive they do take slaves though hes too small for a workslave but hes pretty enough said the other mounted man you gonna keep him for a bodyslave a bodyslave do they mean what i think they mean maybe if there aint enough women to go around the one holding the boy called back laughing even harder that was all he ever said again filled with fury at his words snowfire acted on impulse as he rarely did rose out of the shadow of the trunk he hid behind and fired the arrow fletched with owl feathers flew as silently as hweel and as surely burying itself in the soft tissue of the mans throat even as it was still in the air snowfire had pulled a second arrow from the quiver at his belt and was sighting it the man made a gurgling sound and reached frantically up pawing at his throat with his free hand as the second arrow sped to join the first a second arrow appeared beside the first one and the enemy fighter lost all interest in darian letting him go to claw at his throat with both hands fortunately when his captor dropped darian and began staggering back a little making hideous noises darian was still limp the boy made a soft fall on the hard slabs of rock and somehow his body acted for him again and he quickly rolled out of the way of the toppling soldier get up he screamed at himself get up and run while you have the chance as darian scrambled to his feet scraping himself on the rough surface of the rocks he instinctively turned to look in the direction from which the arrows had come for just an instant and no longer he saw a strangelooking man in the shadows of the forest on the other side of the rock pile he was dressed in mottled greenandbrown clothing and although he didnt look old and certainly didnt act old his long oddlycut hair that was braided in a few places and dyed had stark silverwhite roots he had an arrow nocked at full draw on his bow and he loosed it just as darian heard something whistle past his ear from somewhere behind him he ducked to the side instinctively one of his tormentors had returned an attack to the bowman from the woods the stranger uttered a brief exclamation as a fighting knife buried itself to the hilt in his arm he dropped out of sight vanishing so far as darian saw and behind him darian heard a harsh cry a startled snort and the sound of something heavy falling he turned again to see that the second enemy fighter who had still been mounted had fallen off his horse an arrow through one eye the soldier lay on the ground twitching his hands his head jerked once as he died then the body was still the horse shied but moved only far enough to join the other dead fighters horse both of them paused a moment then started cropping the thin grass as if there was nothing whatsoever the matter what are you doing standing in the open hide stupid hide darian scuttled into hiding behind a boulder in shock at the sudden reversal of his fortunes where had this strange man come from who was he and why was he helping him this was all happening much too fast never mind that scolded that sensible voice in the back of his head there were three theres still at least one alive where there were three of those brutes there are probably more do something prodded into action darian picked up his dropped bow by some miracle it hadnt been broken in all of the tumbling and rolling and quickly strung it opening his quiver and getting an arrow of his own nocked he peered cautiously around the boulder from where he was he could see two more of the enemy coming cautiously on foot along the side of the rockpile where had the second one come from he took a quick glance around the other side of his boulder toward the last place where he had seen the stranger and making a quick estimate figured that his rescuer could not see these two new foes from where he was now injured as he was he might not be able to defend himself so i guess its up to me suddenly he felt strangely calm his stomach stopped flipping about his hands stopped trembling and everything took on a crystalline clarity around him the colors deep the edges sharp and defined taking a deep breath he stepped around the side of the boulder and pulled his arrow back as far as he could sighting carefully on the head of the man in the lead snowfire cursed aloud with sudden pain as a flat knife thrown by one of the two still mounted buried itself in his biceps he dropped glad he had already loosed the arrow the blade had penetrated deep but by luck had gone in more or less with the grain of the muscle as he pulled the knife from his arm and discarded it he was rewarded by the sound of the mans body hitting the ground so much for being able to pull my bow for a while id better get the boy and myself out of here before it comes to handtohand my climbing stick is still with sifyra and a match between a war ax or sword and a hunting knife is usually a short one he pulled a pressure bandage from the emergency pouch at his belt and wrapped it tightly around his arm temporarily sealing the injury a brief caress of power melded the end of the bandage into the wrap the large magics were difficult these days but the very smallest still worked reliably making him often glad that he was of no higher power than a master he had always depended on the use of small magics not large and the loss of the leylines and the nodes was of no great import to him but he didnt have much time there was at least one fighter still alert and active out there perhaps more and he himself was now wounded and not capable of drawing a bow without breaking the wound open and making it more serious than it already was and also to the point he had just dispatched two of the enemy with arrows that shouted tayledras as clear to read as if he had branded the corpses with the sigil of kvala so he had three things to do now rescue the boy take care of the betraying arrows and get both himself and the boy out of there before any more enemies appeared two come hweel said showing him where and how fast they were moving both had abandoned their horses and were creeping toward him afoot and separated two more but from farther they heard the pursuit of the boy maybe they do not hurry but will come soon can you protect me while i move toward the boy snowfire asked in return the reply was not so much in words as in feelings a sense of contempt that he had asked so simple a thing content in knowing that hweel would stoop on anyone who got within striking distance of his bondmate while he in turn worked his way toward the boy snowfire began easing his way to the other side of the rockpile his wounded arm kept sending lances of fire up his shoulder but he had hunted and fought with worse and since it wasnt bleeding badly now he knew he could afford to ignore it until he was in a safer position he kept himself as much under cover as he could but through hweels eyes he saw that the boy had gotten himself under the concealment of a boulder and was in the process of stringing and readying his own bow good he thought with some satisfaction so hes not helpless and hes no coward and he can think and plan for himself he isnt counting on me to come to his rescue beyond what ive already done nevertheless he couldnt be allowed to take a shot at the moment he was being ignored as insignificant while the fighters concentrated on snowfire as the real enemy that puny little smallgame bow didnt have enough power behind it to do much damage unless the boy got a lucky eye shot all that would happen was that the two fighters still within striking distance would stop ignoring him and count him as an enemy and there was no doubt that they would not hesitate for a moment to kill him while he was unarmed and only trying to flee their customs counted him a noncombatant the moment he raised an arm against them he was a fighter since their own boys entered a warriorsociety when no older than this boy snowfire got to the boy just as he stepped out of cover and prepared to fire he reached out and grabbed the boy by the collar with his good hand and yanked him down into cover again poor lad he must feel like a kitten being mauled by now quick as a thought before the boy could cry out he muffled the boys mouth with his other hand for a moment and put his finger to his lips miming a message of silence the way valdemarans did the boys eyes were as wide and round as a pair of fat plums and for a moment as blank as mirrors with the shock of so rude an introduction but he recovered quickly obviously guessed at what snowfire wanted and nodded vigorously satisfied snowfire let him go and he quickly got his feet and hands beneath him and backed into hiding beside the tayledras hweel where are they he silently asked his bird the owl showed him the two nearest enemy were crouched under cover of a bush at nearly the opposite side of this rocky clearing the other two had left their horses which pleased snowfire and were making their way on their bellies to join the first two none of them had bows which pleased snowfire even more they must be planning to jump on me all at once he decided the only problem for them is im not where they think i am he thought for a moment measured distances in his mind and formulated a plan when we run spook the farther horses he told the owl and motioned to the boy to stay where he was he took three arrows from the boys quiver and wriggled his way to the first body where he replaced the two tayledras arrows with the boys then he worked backward to the second body and did the same with the last arrow it was a good thing that hed picked barbless gamearrows when he blindly drew in the heat of the moment they had broad heads but tapered back to the shaft and were in fact meant to be easy to draw out barbed mankilling arrows on the other hand were meant to be difficult to remove from a wound his hunting arrows came out with very little trouble and he inserted the boys arrows with no problem with such optimal targets someone with his level of skill would have been just as lethal with the light valdemaran arrows as his own the fact that the boys bow wasnt heavy enough to have given the arrows the power to penetrate as far as they did was of no significance for the enemy had seen him and knew that he had made the shots not the boy he only wanted them to think that he was valdemaran not tayledras the closer view confirmed his guess that these were northern barbarians wearing beartokens and surely smelling much worse than even the filthiest of animals you would think that they would emulate the cleanliness of their totems but no satisfied now that he had removed all the traces of tayledras activity that a likelyuneducated soldier would recognize he carefully worked his way to within sprinting distance of the horses belonging to the two men hed killed and took a deep breath this would be their only chance of getting out of there without having to get into handtohand combat with at least one of the enemy he would have one opportunity for surprise so his plan had better work right the first time he made another survey of the area through hweels eyes waited for his moment and sprang darian had been so taken by surprise by the strangers appearance that for a moment he had just stared blankly at his rescuer while the man held one hand firmly over his mouth the man held a finger against his own lips while staring penetratingly into darians eyes darian had never seen eyes quite so intensely blue before meeting their gaze was like falling into an icy pool and it took his breath away just as surely after a moment darian realized that he was miming for darian to be quiet he nodded vigorously after all the last thing he wanted was to draw attention to both of them satisfied the man released him and darian got his arms and legs underneath him and scuttled his way back into deeper cover with the stranger between him and the enemy the stranger had already bandaged his knife wound which astonished darian but after a moment it was obvious why he had done so he hadnt wanted to leave a bloodtrail and the binding would make his arm at least partially usable for a while now what he wondered as the stranger mimed for him to stay where he was and keep very still he nodded again to show that he understood and to his continued surprise the stranger took three of his arrows out of darians quiver and began working his way very flat to the ground and snakelike through the rocks he kept going until he came to the body of the man whod first grabbed darian darian couldnt see what he did there but a few moments later he came back into view and slithered his way to the body of the man whod thrown the knife at him now darian had the advantage of elevation for the rocks where he was hiding were a bit taller than the forest verge where the man had fallen from his horse and he was able to see what the stranger did fortunately those same rocks blocked the view of the enemy across the clearing to his puzzlement darian saw him carefully work his own arrow out of the wound that had killed the enemy and insert darians arrow in its place now why is he doing that he didnt have long to puzzle over the question for as soon as the stranger had finished his odd task he tucked his own bloodied arrows sideways into his belt gathered himself and leaped like some great cat for the reins of the nearest horse the second horse shied and bolted pounding off into the forest but the stranger had the first one caught by the reins the horse reared and danced but the stranger held him firmly and as soon as the beast had all four hooves on the ground he swung himself up into the saddle before darian could blink without thinking darian stood up as the stranger wheeled the horse around on its hindquarters and dug his heels into its sides it surged forward toward darian and the stranger leaned over its neck stretching a hand out for him darian instinctively reached toward the stranger who grabbed his arm hand firmly around darians elbow as they plunged past with a grunt and a gasp of pain the man pulled darian over the front of his saddle and sent the horse racing off into the deeper forest this was by far the least comfortable way to ride that ever existed the saddlebow drove into his stomach pounding breath out of him in grunting gasps and darian could not see much but he glimpsed enough between bruisirigs to know that he was heading deeper into the pelagiris than he had ever dared go alone the boy had good instincts he could not have reacted better if snowfire had outlined the plan in advance for him he stood up automatically when snowfire leaped for the horse snowfire managed to get the reins in his good hand not his bad one so when the horse reared and tried to bolt like its mate he was able to hold onto it the moment the horse had all four hooves back down on the ground snowfire flung himself into the saddle since the boy was perfectly positioned for a pickup even to the point of having one arm extended snowfire dug his heels into the horses side and urged it into a leaping run the boy was close enough that the horse had not gotten any kind of speed up before it reached the lad snowfire leaned down from the saddle seized the extended arm caught the boys arm at the elbow ignoring the pain from his wounded arm and hauled him up over the front of the saddle like a sack of meal it was a good thing that the boy was so small and thin or snowfire wouldnt have been able to manage the feat as it was he felt his wound break open under the bandage and tear and a surge of warm wetness saturated the bandage just after the searing of renewed pain two more strides and the horse was in full gallop meanwhile the pounding of hooves told snowfire that hweel had managed to spook the other two horses into panicked flight hopefully without being seen by the distracted soldiers that should delay pursuit nicely good by the time those brutes manage to catch their mounts weii be long gone and the other horses will be too lathered to follow at any kind of pace nevertheless snowfire was not about to slacken his pace especially not here where the ground cover was so thin and sparse that the horse could gallop safely through it snowfire guided the running horse in among the trees allowing it to set its own speed at the moment it was so spooked by his appearance and his cavalier handling that it just wanted to run and he was disposed to let it he simply used reins and weight to control where it was going weaving his way in and out among the massive columnar trunks his main effort bent toward herding it in the direction of the stream he and sifyra had passed on his way here as soon as he thought they were well out of reach he planned to slow the beast and take it into the streambed to break their trail gradually at about the moment when he was ready to slacken their pace and he was quite certain the boy was long past ready the horse slowed of its own will hweel had been trailing behind them keeping watch on their backtrail and had reported no followers now he sent the owl back to see if the barbarians had managed to organize themselves he hoped not he hoped theyd cut their losses and report to whoever was in charge of them that a huge force of valdemaran warriors had used a child to lure them into an ambush he rather doubted that theyd tell the truth not with two dead and thenhorses run to exhaustion and nothing to show for their efforts by the time they reached the stream the energy and excitement that had sustained him had worn off and his wound was bleeding freely it had soaked right through the bandage and was going to make a right mess of his tunic if he didnt do something about it soon hweel reported no pursuit at all the horses were evidently not at all fond of their masters and were nicely evading capture the men didnt have anything with them to tempt the horses into allowing them near enough to grab the reins either which was certainly a mistake on their part that argued further for their being barbarians out of the northern mountains they werent used to horses or riding up there and wouldnt have figured out that if your horse didnt like you he wasnt disposed to coming back to you once hed gotten rid of you and if that happened your only chance of catching him was to have something the horse wanted on your person the horse he was on didnt much want to wade into the slippery streambed but snowfire used a little mindtouch to persuade it muttering to it absently reminding it with images and feelings how good the cool water would feel on its hot legs finally it stepped gingerly down into the water and snowfire allowed it to pick its way carefully among the rocks interestingly the boy hadnt so much as uttered a sound in all that time and he didnt squirm or show any sign of discomfort though he had to have been beaten raw by now snowfire hoped that his valdemaran was equal to dealing with the child he had picked it up mindtomind from one of the guards at the nexttolast site his group had worked but until he tried to talk to the boy he wouldnt know if it was equal to communicating with a possibly terrified child of course if the boy allowed he could rectify that quickly enough with another mindmagic session that was how he knew some of the dialects of the northern barbarians hed picked them up from a bold fellow who actually went up there to trade for furs snowfire had gotten a great deal of information from that hardy soul hed learned for one thing that once the barbarians accepted a person as a bona fide trader he had nearimmunity among them its an extension of their traditional immunity granted to talespinners and historysingers shan had told him and laughed but i suspect that it stems more from their greed for pretty baubles and fine fabrics than it does from any real interest in news of the outside world at least theyre bright enough to know that if they kill the trader who brought the goods there wont be any more to follow him the question in snowfires mind was what brought northern barbarians down into valdemar he hoped that there were only a few of them and not an army there had been trouble on the northern borders before and that was when they knew that it was guarded by the forest of sorrows if they had learned that sorrows was no longer tenanted well he would concentrate for now on the immediate problem what to do with the boy stopping his bleeding and getting back safely to his base camp snowfire pulled the horse to a halt after they had ridden for several furlongs through the streambed itself by now the horse was cool enough that he could allow it to drink and he really needed to rebandage that wound before the blood loss became a serious impediment to his performance he got them all over to the stream bank coaxed the horse up onto solid ground let the boy get off then dropped off the horses back himself what he really wanted to do was to lie down but he wouldnt be able to do that for a while his arm hurt like fury and besides needing to get the bleeding stopped he wanted to get some cool water on it to ease some of the pain there was only so much paindampening he could do after all on limited endurance tayledras scouts were durable but he had just been through a fight and the aftermath of a fight could leave anyone feeling as if theyd run the length of the pelagirs he looped the horses reins around a branch with his good hand and tied them off giving the beast just enough slack that it could get a drink and snatch at a few bites of grass poor thing it looked at him with astonishment perhaps because hed given it that freedom or perhaps only because he hadnt beaten it yet and then buried its nose deep in the cool water then he knelt beside the streambed and carefully unwrapped the bandage from around his upper arm he let the wound bleed a little more while he put one end of the bandage under a rock in the sparkling clear stream letting the swiftlyflowing chill water wash it out for him then he splashed water on the wound giving it a little rudimentary cleaning and made certain that it wasnt any more serious than he had thought it wasnt it was just a very simple penetration wound and not a nastylooking one as deep wounds go there didnt seem to be anything left in it no signs of poisons visible and as he had recalled the knife had not seemed dirty or rusty he reached into the water for the bandage to redo the job onehanded it never even occurred to him to ask the boy to help before he could do anything else the boy was already at his elbow and had taken the bandage out of his hands in a moment he had wrung it as dry as possible and seized his arm please to hold still good sir the boy said carefully forming the valdemaran words as he looked directly into snowfires eyes as if he thought he could give the sense of what he said if he simply spoke slowly and clearly and locked gazes with his rescuer then again if he had a touch of mindmagic that might work snowfire had not lowered his own shields so he couldnt have told whether the boy possessed such a thing yes surely snowfire said too much taken aback to argue was the boy in training to be a healer it certainly seemed as if he might be but if that were the case why was he not in the pale green of a healerstudent using some clean dry moss picked from a rock beside the stream as a pad the boy rewrapped the bandage with the deft hands of an expert putting exactly the right kind of pressure at the proper angles on the wound to hold it closed again when he came to the end of the bandage and looked at it for a moment in puzzlement snowfire took over and sealed the end of the bandage down again with magic and to his surprise he felt the boy following what he had done with his own mind oh the lad said sounding surprised the next words were blurted as if he spoke before he thought so magic is good for something then he clapped his hand over his mouth his face a comic mask of dismay the littlest magics are usually the most practical snowfire said mildly in accented valdemaran he cleared his throat carefully i am snowfire kvala scout of the tayledras or as you say hawkbrothers i return now to my own people in a place we have made for ourselves the boy ducked his head awkwardly but his eyes were alive with mingled curiosity and apprehension my name is darian he said simply darian firkin and ah thank you i thought they were going to kill me i do not think that what they had in mind for you would have been pleasant snowfire said carefully unsure of how much or little to tell the lad he might well be much older than he looked he had very old eyes for such a young face and the face itself was a mask of politeness behind which something else was hidden have you any place you need to go or a place of safety that i may take you to or would you care to come with me to a safe haven the boy held his breath and slowly the polite mask shattered and fell he crumpled sobbing apparently completely overcome by sudden overwhelming grief snowfire did not need to be an empath to read that there was something dreadfully wrong something triggered by mention of safety or a safe place to go he decided on his own that the best place for both of them was back with his little band whatever had gone wrong had evidently been horrible terrifying it likely had a great deal to do with those barbarians and was probably something that he and his people urgently needed to know about but there was a more immediate need to soothe the child enough so that he could ride without falling apart the sooner he got back to camp the better snowfire had never had a little brother but he had played the role of confidante and helper a time or two in the past to warriors mages and younger scouts hush now he soothed putting his good though leather layered arm about the boys shoulder close enough to give emotional support not so close as to be intrusive he knew before the boy did by the imperceptible tensing of the lads muscles when he was coming too close and backed off a bit here you may come with me and we will go to my people i promise you will be quite safe enough with us eh then when you are rested you will talk to us tell us what happened perhaps we can help even if we cannot we will see to it that you are safe warm and safe and wellfed the boy only nodded and snowfire mounted lending the boy a hand so that he could swing up to sit behind the saddle instead of being carried like so much baggage the boy must have ridden this way before he put his foot carefully on top of snowfires trusted his weight to snowfires arm and got himself up behind the tayledras with a minimum of awkwardness and there he sat his arms around snowfires waist to hold him in place his sobs had ended but as he held tightly to snowfires waist the tayledras felt him shivering and not with cold but with suppressed emotion and shock he was very near a breaking point and snowfire wanted him to be safely in the hands of someone who could deal with his trauma before he came to that breaking point nightwind was an empath as well as a trondiirn and she would be the best person for the child at this moment snowfire clucked to the horse which lengthened its stride readily into a slow canter evidently it already preferred snowfire over its previous masters it seemed as if this was something more serious than a single boy and a few sadistic barbarians perhaps this situation was more than his little group could deal with after all they already had quite a bit on their plate after the danger from the magestorms had ended magic had been shattered like a broken crystal the matrixed pattern of leylines and nodes was gone as if it had never been and the energies that had once flowed in them were spread evenly across the face of the land this had left the more powerful mages at something of a loss but the tayledras already had a plan in place to deal with such a contingency they were a longsighted and patient people when it came to making and fulfilling plans they would move with urgency when speed was called for or could wait for generations to lay something in place magic flowed like water and like water it would not remain spread out over the land for long if left to itself it would form its own rivers and pools or leylines and nodes or it could be guided into paths that could be carved for it the sooner those paths were established the sooner it could be persuaded to follow those paths and would flow as it had before and the less likely it would be that stagnant pools would form warping creatures and plants as had happened before in the pelagirs after the mage wars were ended there were many more tayledras now than there had been then with a great deal more experience and now that there was no geas laid upon them by the stareyed to cleanse the land they were free to go out into it and rectify the situation before it became necessary to do those cleansings more to the point since no creature ever acts against its own best interest even though they may act in enlightened selfinterest if it was the tayledras mages who reestablished the leylines and nodes in a matrix they would be able to arrange and key them so that it did themselves and their allies the most good but conversely if they left an area unmanaged it would be altogether likely for other mages to come in and arrange things to their liking this was the reason for the groups of tayledras traveling about now dealing with changebeasts working to link the local magics up with the greater systems already established the crown of valdemar had not only given its blessing to the massive venture but had funded their needs and ordered support to be given by guard herald and citizen with free passage papers and more that the nowlegendary tayledras adept darkwind had the ear of the queen in the matter had not hurt a bit altruistically the hawkbrothers and their chosen allies were able to rid the land of some very unpleasant creatures realistically they were creating a matrix that better supported their own heartstones than even the original had in the future it would assure them of more than adequate power for virtually anything they wished to do could it be that some other rival mages had decided on the same plan of course it could he told himself in this case it wouldnt take an adept to see what the advantage in it would be it would only take a perceptive master in fact or someone very educated in the nature of types of magical energy and its tendencies to plan out a local scale version of gahhh snowfire you need help your mind is wandering deal with the situation in the here and now and discuss the implications of your speculations over a good meal by the fire later on well the best thing he could do now would be to get the boy to a place where he could feel safe perhaps after some food and calming this young darian could bring himself to reveal what had happened surely in nightwinds hands that would not be long in coming whatever it was snowfire was certain there was going to be a great deal more to it than appeared on the surface snowfire was so deep in his own thoughts that it startled him when the boy spoke who are you what are you doing here came the muffled voice from behind his back he considered the language carefully before he replied he did not want to answer the wrong question and give the boy the impression that he was being uncooperative myself specifically he asked or my people there are more of us here not far from here as i told you your people darian answered and snowfire felt him take one hand off of snowfires waist he sniffed and snowfire fished in a pouch at his belt to give the lad a bit of unused bandage to wipe his nose with ththank you the boy said carefully interesting that his own thoughts had just been on that very subject of why the tayledras were here we are a very special group of tayledras your people call us hawkbrothers usually and we are here for a number of reasons which all mesh together what know you of the magestorms he asked i ask this because it is relevant to why we are here he felt the boy shrug not much darian admitted they upset the weather a bunch made things bad around here turned monsters loose i guess they made it hard for mages to work snowfire thought for a moment and decided that the most complete if abbreviated explanation would certainly not be amiss and would fill up the time until the moment they arrived at the camp and besides it might help keep his mind off how his arm hurt i will go back to the very beginning then to the cause of it all once so many hundreds of years ago that most of that time is lost even as a legend there were many of what we know as the great mages these were adepts so powerful that they had the ability to actually create new creatures that had never existed before to change the weather or to make the rocks run like water was that where the monsters came from darian asked as snowfire paused some of them created creatures that you would take to be monsters i am sure snowfire told him craning his head around to smile at the boy with encouragement but i think that the monsters you speak of were all created later and i am coming to that one of these great mages was very evil and he made war on the rest in the end there was only one left to oppose him that one invented a kind of weapon that was so terrible that he swore he would only use it if he himself were dying he made two of these and when the time came that he was indeed dying killed by a slow poison delivered by an assassin loyal to the evil mage he sent one into the hands of the evil mage himself and triggered the other in his own place why darian asked snowfire suppressed a smile at that oldest of childrens questions because he said patiently the way that this weapon worked was to release all of the magic contained within every object within a certain area it released all of the magic in the good mages tower at the same time as the other released all of the magic in the evil mages stronghold now think for a moment about how powerful these two men were and think how much magic must have been released why in the case of the good mage his very tower had been built with and relied upon thousands of magic devices then think what must have been contained in that tower and around it the boy pondered that for a moment then shuddered convulsively that must have been big and awful he said in a subdued voice worse than a forest fire much worse snowfire assured him where the good mage once lived is now the dhorisha plains where the evil one lived is now lake evendim since both those places were strongholds among hills that should give you an idea how dreadful it was i assure you nothing that was caught inside where the bounds of the plains and the lake are now survived that cataclysm completely reshaped the world it was so powerful and the effects of two of the weapons being triggered simultaneously were worse and more complicated than the good mage had ever dreamed possible having two of them go off created theirs magestorms and those in their turn created the pelagir hills and the pelagiris forest huh the boy digested that i thought they just were i thought the forest had always been like that they were created by the cataclysm and the magestorms that followed snowfire replied and it was longer ago than i think you would dream possible and the pelagirs extended far out beyond what is now valdemar now the tayledras were given a duty and that was to set things to rights in the pelagirs and in return were given the secrets of how to control and confine very powerful magic and the odd thing is that we were very nearly done with that task when the magestorms returned and they returned because not only did they reshape the world they made an echo of themselves back across time exactly like the waves of a stone tossed into a quiet pool will reach the shore and reflect back again he paused do you see what i am saying thousands of years of history compressed into a few sentences but if he is really interested there are plenty who will teach him the tale in its fullest not really altogether darian admitted honestly but enough so i think im following the story right so the magestorms we had were the echoes of the ancient ones that would be why they made monsters like the first ones did exactly snowfire said with encouragement in his voice thinking as he did so that this was a good thing to be talking of for it gave the boy something to engross his mind snowfire had a growing suspicion that the barbarians had attacked his home and that he was the only one to escape if not indeed the only one to survive he would figure that out as soon as he had time to think about the attack at all and he would need to grieve eventually but it would be better if he did so in a safe place for now i will keep his mind on the strange hawkbrother so that he does not think too much about what has happened to him i cannot afford to cope with a hysterical child right now the new storms were bad in effect but worse in potential he continued and they were building up to a second cataclysm because they were a reflection of the originals which was why they grew stronger instead of weaker we are not precisely certain what that new cataclysm would have done but several folk determined to prevent it and succeeded that would be heraldmage elspeth adept darkwind and adept firesong right the boy asked as if he had suddenly made a connection for himself yes yes and some others as well not all of them human or even by common standards alive he thought with a little amusement but he can learn that for himself later no point in piling strangeness upon strangeness i am impressed that he would know those names i must continue to shorten the story a great deal more but if you wish to know all of it you have only to ask i will say only now that they did prevent it they did stop the storms and have made it so that they will not reecho at some later time and that the result of this was to change all the magic as we knew it they broke it didnt they the boy responded surprising him they broke magic like breaking a plate so it shattered into pieces in a sense he tried to think of another water analogy if you could imagine magic as all the streams and rivers and lakes in the world and suddenly all the water has been sucked out of them and has rained down evenly everywhere you could walk on what used to be the bottom of a lake that would have drowned you just after it happens or you can divert the rainwater to a new place you want filled but the rain continues to fall that is what has happened and that is one of the two things that brings us here at this time we are cutting new rivers if you will and making new lakes and we are once again putting things to rights getting rid of the changebeasts that the storms created and when youre done magic will be where you want it to be and work the way you want it to wont it the boy asked shrewdly thats what you get out of it your special magic will work again such an unexpectedly clever observation startled a laugh out of snowfire i must admit he replied with reluctant admiration you are quite correct not that this is a secret you understand and not that this means that no other mages will be able to use their powers things will simply work the way that everyone was used to them working and everyone who has the ability will be able to use them as of old except some people theorize more efficiently the horse had slowed to a brisk walk but snowfire could tell that it was tired and its pace was quick enough to suit him he let it set its own speed without correcting it poor thing it was probably used to being ridden to within a breath of foundering and a little decent treatment would work wonders with it so why are you doing this the hawkbrothers i mean darian asked couldnt anybody do this like the heraldmages or the fireflower mages or something they could snowfire admitted and in some places they probably are we are doing it here because we know how because there are very few heraldmages and even fewer who are at all powerful enough to do these things and because there are also changebeasts and other changes in these same areas that need attending to so we are paid by you our allies of valdemar to do work that we are used to doing and we are serving our own purposes at the same time we in our turn are getting muchneeded goods and foodstuffs for our people for our payment so we are well content no point in explaining too much more that there were still vales was something of a miracle and was due entirely to the superhuman efforts of tayledras mages to shield their heartstones during those final storms but without the leylines to feed the heartstones there was much less power coming in than going out and the tayledras back in the vales were having to be very conservative even frugal about what they did and did not do with the power contained in the stones that was the main reason why these parties had been sent out to make certain that as many of the old leylines as possible were reestablished and to see to it that an adequate amount of power was sent back to the stones that was the request of the first council of elders that it be adequate just what adequate meant was being left up to the discretion of the adepts leading each team it means dont be selfish i suppose and if there really arent that many mages in the area who would need nodeenergy then whats the point of allowing it to pool in nodes for adepts who dont exist i suppose a bad mage could divert a lot of that power away for himself right now couldnt he the boy asked aloud like a selfish farmer damming a stream so that only he can use the water for his crops i must say darian i am impressed you are very perceptive yes thats another reason why we are here snowfire conceded if we establish the leylines the rivers we can make sure that it will be available to anyone who needs to use it but if a selfish or bad mage got to a place first he could lock all that power away for all time so we arent just working for our own sake he chuckled gently after all eventually there will be mages in valdemar who will need to use that power and they would be rightfully annoyed if we had arranged things so that they could not get at it i spose they would the boy acknowledged would things have gone back to the way they had been if you left them alone that we dont know snowfire admitted but they went that way the first time so why wouldnt they go back darian persisted i mean its really hard to change the course of a river i heard of people who tried and each time it went right back the way it had been in its old bed so wouldnt things be the same if you left them alone even if they would there are still the changebeasts that need dealing with snowfire reminded him and the one thing that still could happen if we dont interfere is that a bad mage could lock the power away from everyone else we cant leave that to chance i spose not darian sighed and didnt ask any more questions snowfire made a note to tell adept starfall what the boy had said about it being difficult to change the natural course of a river and how that might apply to the leylines it was something he doubted that the adept had wanted to consider deeply and it could spell trouble at some point in the future any problems he asked hweel who was still wafting along in their wake branch to branch every thirty or so horselengths keeping a wary eye on things behind them all quiet the bird replied hungry he considered how far they were from the clearing how many times he had undertaken to break the trail and how long it might take the barbarians to catch their horses he concluded it was safe enough for hweel to take the time to go catch something hunt he suggested to the bondbird who needed no second invitation hweel had heard the call of a covey of quail some little distance back and was eager to see what he could do about helping to control the population owls often seemed more purposeful about their hunting than hawks or more especially the falcons it was no great amount of time later that snowfire sensed the burst of visceral bloodlust that meant hweel had gone in for a kill followed swiftly by triumph and accomplishment a little longer and hweel was back in the air and catching up now with a full stomach radiating satisfaction for a bird hweels size a single quail was a reasonable meal but not a full days ration the owl would probably go out again at night to hunt if snowfire didnt provide him with something the horse was not nearly as swift as a dyheli especially not with a double burden and the light coming through the trees had taken on a distinctly red hue when snowfire reached the outskirts of the encampment he whistled the recognition call for the outermost sentry and a moment later spotted the flash of a suntail hawkeagles creamy breast in the branches above him three of the scouts were bonded to suntails so it could have been any one of the three who were standing watch but he thought it was eere skyshadows secondyear bird go in ahead he told hweel wearily glad that it was a suntail and not one of the forestgyres who were fond of teasing the big owl not that they would ever harm hweel nor would hweel ever retaliate with anything more than an irritated beak snap but hweel was a ponderously serious bird in many ways and being teased put him in a bad mood just at the moment having his bondbird grumbling and hunched in a tree was a situation snowfire didnt want to be forced to endure on top of his other pains his arm hurt more and more as they rode and given a choice he wanted most to see nightwind and have it tended to then drink his weight in painkilling tea and sleep for about a day the last of his energy ran out shortly before they reached camp fortunately the boy had been cooperative and quiet during most of that time and his questions and conversation had been polite and subdued the rest of the time perhaps he had sensed that snowfire was not feeling up to conversation the horse took them through some truly spectacular territory and he wished vaguely that he was feeling good enough to appreciate it ancient trees with trunks the size of entire houses stretched toward the sky their roots firmly embedded in the sides of steep boulderstrewn hills rocks thrust themselves out of the soil in fantastic and baroque formations tiny threadlike streams sparkled and danced over rocks in the valleys or threw themselves headlong down the rocky cliffs and hillsides in exuberant waterfalls that were more spray than stream anywhere that the dense foliage overhead allowed a ray of sunlight to penetrate to the ground other plants flourished a patch of luxuriant grass studded with flowers a gnarled bush with glossy leaves or a graceful young scion of one of the giants that loomed overhead this was the season of birdsong and their calls fluted through the shadows from every direction a fresh warm breeze carried the faint scent of forest flowers and evergreen on its wings the only problem so far as snowfire was concerned was that his throbbing arm got in the way of being able to enjoy his surroundings at the moment they were something to be endured rather than enjoyed until landmarks would tell him that he was nearing the camp finally with grateful relief he saw just the landmarks he was looking for and soon he was riding down a long rift that would open up into the valley that his group had turned into as near a vale as was possible for so temporary an encampment nature had provided a fine little valley with tiny springs trickling out of the hillside at the back which the current dwellers had diverted into a series of three pools what nature had not provided the tayledras had fashioned constructing temporary groundbuilt ekeles with stone spools of cord windfallen tree trunks carefully tended vines and the canvas of their tents as roofs when adept starfall found this place to be nearly ideal for his purposes a bit of extra work made the camp into a place of more comfort and more security than mere tents would have permitted it made more sense that way with strong secure walls about them and a few creature comforts they all rested better had more privacy and felt healthier and happier for both which allowed them to do their work without missing the comforts of the vale too much the springfed pools gave them one for drinking water one for washing and one that could be heated with dozens of firewarmed stones or for those with the gift with magic for soaking weary bodies they would be here for as long as it took starfall to impose his will on the newly forming magicmatrices and for as long as it took to find and deal with any changebeasts that were still in the area probably into fall snowfire was very glad for those creature comforts waiting for him especially the hot pool he certainly felt that he had earned them a fellow called sunleaf who was bonded to a forestgyre had an interesting sort of magic with plants that allowed him to bend them to his purposes and accelerate their growth in a way that was quite remarkable outside the encampment he had coaxed bushes and vines into a thickness and luxuriance that hid the camp from sight and within it he had made vines grow in screens that divided the area up and gave a remarkable amount of privacy and got vines to grow over each ekele shrouding them in cool green that hid the structures beneath an avalanche of leaves it looked in fact as if they had moved into a place that had been abandoned to the forest for decades instead of one that they had just built snowfire sensed the boys interest as they rode into the valley and toward the little welcoming party of three that awaited them it was a small welcoming party and snowfire blessed the adepts good sense as it was composed of only tayledras who would not alarm the boy the adept himself the gentle trondiim nightwind and the youngest of the scouts wintersky who was something of a protege of snowfires and shared his ekele of course wintersky mostly had the ekele to himself since snowfire spent a great deal of time with nightwind none of the three could possibly frighten the boy whod had enough fright for one day though starfall looked very imposing and probably more like the boy had imagined a tayledras to look than snowfire did wintersky wore the same scoutinggarb that snowfire did but nightwind and starfall showed the other faces of tayledras life in their dress starfall wore the trailing robes jewelry and embroideries of someone who does not expect to be covering a great deal of territory in wild forest and nightwind the comfortable colorful loose garments of someone who does expect to be doing a great deal of physical and practical labor but who does not have to worry about fading into the landscape starfalls waistlength hair hung loose with a minimum of ornaments braided into it winterskys hair was dyed in leaf patterns and confined in a single tail and nightwinds was still dark for she practiced little magic and had never lived in a vale with a heartstone to bleach her hair she was in fact not kvala at all but kleshya the lost clan of the ancient days come up out of the farthest west but at the moment all snowfire could think of was how glad he was to see them all he slid down off the horse and found his legs unexpectedly wobbly he managed to save himself from embarrassment by holding for a moment to the pommel of the saddle and offered the boy his good hand as an aid to get down darian smiled at him wanly you dont look so good he said with that blunt frankness of a child who hasnt yet figured out that one doesnt always have to voice what one observes i can manage to get down myself and he did but his legs were just as wobbly as snowfires when he slid off the horses ramp and landed on the ground though in his case it was probably from a mixture of fatigue and unaccustomed riding than from pain this is darian kvaldemar snowfire told the others in valdemaran hes never seen tayledras before and he knows nothing of us darian this is adept starfall who is our elder and the leader of this group this is trondiim nightwind who is going to patch up the tears in your hide as she does for the rest of us who have the misfortune to ran through brambles darian rubbed some of his scratches with a bit of selfconscious embarrassment even though some of them were deep and he had many braises as well and this is wintersky he looked askance at the younger man who grinned at darian and finished the sentence wintersky who will share his quarters with you and snowfire unless you prefer to camp alone in a tent or have us make some other arrangements the young man winked i pledge you i do not snore my valdemaran is the best of all of us save the mighty hunter snowfire so i thought id volunteer our ekele its always better to have people about who know your tongue fairly well snowfire does snore though darian was clearly getting overwhelmed his eyes looked a trifle glazed his face was pale and his expression bewildered i dont mind i mean that would be good whatever you like whatever it is that i like is that you are to come and be tended and be eating and drinking and be then sleeping nightwind said firmly taking the boy in charge with maternal authority the boy yielded to her with relief and gratitude and she ushered him off ill report in brief and then i need to be tended eating drinking and then sleeping after youve gotten the full report snowfire told the adept as wintersky took the horse and led it away to be watched by the dyheli herd hweel saw the boy being chased by northern barbarians bearclan would be my guess but they were all wearing identical armor and i dont much care for what that implies neither do i starfall said his brows furrowing their tattoos would have told me more but things were rather impolite at the time and i didnt stay around to request a viewing from those remaining snowfire noted starfalls lips twitch as he tried not to smile at the understated and offhand manner snowfire was taking with the tale how impolite starfall asked only two casualties not even a minor quarrel by bearclan standards hardly more than an ordinary drunken brawlthough i did make sure to substitute the boys arrows for mine i didnt want to alert them to our presence still one of them had caught the boy by the time i got there and he and his colleagues were exchanging pleasantries that implied they had been improving some valdemaran settlements he dropped his tone of levity i think that the boy belonged to the latest one though i have not yet questioned him at all i wished an empath to be present when i did starfall lost all trace of humor at that so you have barbarians in identical armor what amounts to something more serious than a little banditry and all this a good bit farther south than we should expect to see mountain tribes i shall check my maps but starfall shook his head i do not like this snowfire neither do i since the barbarians dont move in groups larger than a dozen without having a shamanmage along with them snowfire had been letting what he knew about the northern tribes dig itself out of his memories during the last part of the journey he was better at recollection when he allowed the memories to surface on their own and they dont use horses as a rule yet all of the barbarians i saw were mounted this isnt sounding very promising starfall bit his lip for a moment well the best thing that i can do is to move the progress i was making on ahead it wont take more than a day or so and ill have the matrices set up and completely in my control id like to see the mage that can get it out of my hands then i wouldnt snowfire replied but if there was someone able to do that hed have challenged you already so the worst well have to deal with is someone your equal i think we can do that and i think youd better have someone look at that arm while you get some hot food inside you starfall pointed out your stoicism is respected but not required go you can make a more detailed report after youve rested and gotten properly patched up and by then the boy will be rested too and we can find out why barbarians on horses were chasing him now that his initial report had been made he had the relief of the discharge of duty and a great weariness descended on him he decided that the best place for him was in his shared ekele fortunately it was one of the nearer structures he rounded two vine screens and there it was looking like nothing so much as a leafy hummock he parted the vines with his good hand and found that nightwind had already preceded him there he had taken weatherfelled limbs and constructed a fine log home octagonal in shape with a roof of sod held up by logs and willow withes woven into fine mats the snug dwelling would probably serve as well in winter as in summer except that he would have to fill in the bottom rank with sod he had left off the bottom rank of logs on four of the eight sides so as to allow the movement of air through the place a cool breeze came in at the level of the floor and went out at the smoke hole in the middle it had been a great deal of extra work to make this ekele but he reckoned it had been worth the work a lantern with a magelight in it hung from one of the ceiling logs his sleeping place and hweels perch were on the far right as one came in the door and winterskys sleeping pad and tiecs perch were on the left that left a cooking place in the middle and any gear they shared near the door now there was a third sleeping place at the rear with the boy sitting sleepily on it and nightwind beside him snowfire saw at once that someone had left a young rabbit on hweels perch which meant hweel would not have to hunt tonight pleased by the courtesy he slipped back out before nightwind noticed he was there and called hweel to the fist the owl dropped down on his arm with customary aplomb and ducked his head as snowfire brought him in this time the boy who did not seem to be noticing much reacted very strongly and positively to hweel his mouth formed a silent oh and his eyes went round but there was no sign of fear in him nightwind noticed the lads reaction and smiled over her shoulder at snowfire snowfire took that as an invitation to come closer darian stared at the huge owl with intense interest is that your bird he whispered as if he was afraid that he might startle the owl i heard hawkbrothers had birds but i didnt know they were that big hes hes amazing snowfire flushed a little with pleasure he was not proud of much but he did take a certain pleasure in having so magnificent a partner as hweel yes he is isnt he he agreed his name is hweel and he was watching out for us flying behind us in the trees all the way back would you like to touch him can i he wont mind darian looked quite as if snowfire had given him permission to shake the queen of valdemars hand hweel is excessively vain and extremely fond of scratches and if you are going to offer him plenty of admiration and caressing he will be your friend for life nightwind said with mock severity hweel clacked his beak at her then softened the rebuke with the soft huuur an adult would give a nestling go ahead snowfire urged darian reached hesitantly to touch hweels breastfeathers but the owl had other ideas quick as thought he leaned down and butted his head against the outstretched hand and before he knew it darian was scratching the top of the owls round denselyfeathered head hes so soft the boy exclaimed with delight dont be afraid to give him a good scratching snowfire told him as hweel stepped down off the gauntlet to the floor and made his odd little sideways sidle up to the boy youll have to work to get through all the feathers on his head the owl closed his huge eyes in bliss as darian scratched with more vigor and shoved his head practically into darians chest snowfire was delighted both with the boys reaction and with hweels and for the first time he entertained the thought that if the boy had nowhere else to go he might wish to join kvala well it is enough for now that he is not terrified of the bondbirds and that the bondbirds take to him either would be amazing enough but having both is wonderful we can worry abolit what is to become of him when we have a better idea of what he has involved us in nightwind allowed the boy some time to caress hweel and before either of them tired of the sport she mindspoke to the bird enough he will still be here in the morning and so will you right now he needs to sleep as hweel heaved a great sigh of regret she said virtually the same thing to the boy sleep it is time for you and hweel will be here both when sun rises reluctantly the owl raised his head and the boy took his hand away but before he could take it entirely out of range the owl reached out with his powerful beak and gently nibbled darians fingertips that is a high compliment snowfire told him as the boy glanced at the tayledras for an explanation he doesnt offer that particular sort of thank you to just anyone darian looked dazzled and as hweel waddled toward his perch with an owls awkward and ungainly ground gait snowfire got one of the larger bodyfeathers about the size of the boys hand from a little basket he had woven of pine needles and tacked to the logs on his side to hold molted feathers he lifted hweel up to the perch given the owls huge wingspan he preferred that hweel not use his wings inside the ekele then gave the feather to darian the boy took it with shy thanks and occupied himself with stroking and examining it that was neatly done nightwind complimented him i was having trouble getting him to relax enough for the drug i gave him in his tea to work i want him to be drowsy when you and starfall question him thank hweel for cooperating so nicely snowfire replied as she pushed him over to his own sleeping pad and began unwrapping the bandage on his arm i already have came the calm reply and then snowfire endured a few bad moments as she examined the wound and gave it a thorough cleansing once it was clean however she was quick to put a numbing salve on it so that when she stitched it up for him he scarcely felt the prick of the needle the boy watched them intently but with a detachment that snowfire thought was probably thanks to the drug i am very concerned by the little i have sensed from this boy nightwind told him he is quite traumatized and on the whole i am concerned about what will happen to him when he allows himself to feel the emotions he is holding inside i got the impression that he doesnt show half of what he is feeling snowfire confirmed as starfall tapped the doorframe lightly then entered he keeps things to himself i think she told snowfire his griefs are many and not all concerned with whatever led him to us once he allows one to be free the others may come flying out that will be good for him but it will be a hard time as well she looked troubled i cannot tell you if your questions will trigger this release they may or they may not whether they do or not we need to know why snowfire found him in the predicament that he was in starfall pointed out and the sooner we know the better darian now that you have eaten and rested we would like you to tell us what happened to you snowfire said in his best valdemaran the boy nodded he looked awake but not entirely alert those men that were chasing me there were fighters like them that attacked errolds grove he said plaintively i guess the militia went to stop them but they probably didnt have a chance how many men starfall asked quickly what were they like it wasnt just men it was some kind of monster too and i didnt actually count how many there were but they were in ranks of five and i saw ten times five ranks and i know i didnt see all of them darian said growing agitated as nightwind put a steadying hand on his arm there were just a lot an awful lot i was out in the woods getting some treefungus that juh that we needed and i saw smoke and fire and came running back when i got there everybody was running away and this whole army was on the road to the bridge they had lots of armor and all kinds of pikes and swords and things and not all of them were men they were kind of half bear and half man and there was another thing a monster or a demon or something that wasnt anything like a man at all and it was leading them it was riding on this big lizard j a spasm of pain swept over the boys face and snowfire made a mental note to find out who or what began with j that the boy avoided talking about so carefully that might be the key to releasing some of that pentup grief the bridge got destroyed set afire to keep them off but they came across the river anyway thats when i ran and i got away from the first lot but those others were deeper in the forest and came after me when they saw me starfall and snowfire exchanged looks this did not sound very good did the others of your village get away from this army snowfire asked did they have somewhere to go for help the boy frowned for a moment then shrugged i didnt see anybody get caught he said finally and i guess they must have run to kelmskeep lord breon has got a whole garrison of his own and kelmskeeps fortified they say he has messengers and things he could send for the guard so thats probably where everybody went now what about the men who chased you snowfire asked how did that happen the boy winced with chagrin i ran into them he admitted i didnt think there was any way they could have got ahead of me and i ran into them cause i wasnt looking for anyone they came after me and i headed for that clearing cause theres places in there i couldve hid and they couldnt have brought their horses over those loose rocks but one of them caught me and thats where you showed up and thats all that will do ill have the others gather and we can discuss this when you are ready starfall said as he got to his feet and headed for the door of the ekele ill be there as soon as the boy is asleep snowfire promised and turned his attention back to darian hweel wont have to hunt for himself tonight so even though wintersky and i will be gone for a little hweel will be with you snowfire told him then asked the one question that was still puzzling him darian did you really intend to go after those two barbarians with your rabbitbow i had to darian replied sleepily i knew you were hurt and i didnt think youd seen them i knew i couldnt do much unless i got a lucky shot but maybe id distract them and for sure theyd make a noise so you would know that they were there well that was good planning snowfire told him and was rewarded with a sleepy smile that faded into drugged slumber he waited until he was certain that darians sleep was too deep to be easily broken then got up to go outside leaving hweel to keep a vigilant eye on the boy watch and guard he told the bondbird keeping things simple people had been known to have odd reactions to drugs and children in particular were prone to sleepwalking after a severe trauma snowfire was not in the least deceived by the boys apparent calm nightwind said that there was great emotion ready to burst out at any moment and he believed her find me if something happens hweel roused his feathers and huured his agreement now that he was full of rabbit he was quite content to stay in one place with a foot tucked up beneath his breastfeathers snowfire joined the rest of the group around the small fire that nightwind kept feeding with herbs to keep the insects away he accepted a mug of cool water from the spring from wintersky with a nod of thanks and took his place in the council session that had formed ive told the others what the boy told us starfall explained as firelight flickered and cast odd shadows on his face and the very first question i can think of is whether we should involve ourselves at all i dont think we can to tell you the truth replied wintersky regretfully i mean this sounds like an army and we have how many not quite twenty humans twice that in the dyheli herd a couple of hertasi and a gryphon we arent exactly equipped to be fighting battles either the fire popped and hissed blending with the sound of movement of something large like the sussuration of canvas across canvas i would sssay that one grrryphon isss worrrth an arrrmy but i rrreluctantly concurrr a deep voice rumbled from the shadows behind nightwind it only takesss a sssingle arrrow it isnt just an army of men but of changechildren as well and that means a mage is deep in it somewhere starfall put in unless what the boy saw were just costumes or disguises and i cant imagine why barbarians would bother wearing disguises it sounds to me as if someone managed to reconcile a great many bearclan septs snowfire mused maybe well this is a wild surmise but from what i know about the northern tribes they attach heavy religious and emotional significance to their totems and a lot of emphasis is put on taking on the attributes of those totems now what would happen if a mage came along perhaps in the guise of a shaman who could give them physical attributes of their totems hed own the clan to the point of being able to reconcile all the feuds between the septs starfall said flatly and there was someone who managed that once yesssss the shadow behind nightwind rose and loomed up over her head yessss therrre wassss and we all know hisss currrsssed name the shadow resolved itself into a shape and the shape into a creature a creature with the mantling wings and head of a raptor but a raptor of enormous size and with four limbs instead of two he wasss called maarrrrr i dont think were in any danger of seeing another maar kelvren nightwind soothed its all right but starfall frowned perhaps and perhaps not i cant help but think that this is a rather nasty coincidence these barbarians presumably led or backed by a mage suddenly moving into territory where no one has yet established a matrix for magic the difference between a maar and a petty tyrant is largely a matter of power all the more reason for you to form and hold the matrix snowfire replied firmly that will have to be our first priority it seems to me if the boy is correct most if not all of his people escaped surely one will reach lord breon and he can take care of the military problem from there that would be best starfall replied but with a little reluctance we are hardly the group best suited to taking on an army but think of what it would have meant if sssomeone had ssstopped maarrr when he wasss gatherrring the trrribesss kelvren urged his eyes glinting in the firelight would it not have been worrrth everrry sssacrrrificssse to do sssso we can stop any mage just as easily by holding the magic energy of this area away from him snowfire replied i think we should concentrate on getting that done first by then we should know if the valdemarans have taken care of the military situation themselves and if they have not kelvren persisted well deal with that when we come to it starfall said firmly ending the debate the gryphon folded his wings feathers making a clothoncloth sound as they slid across each other intq precise order verrry well i will be rrready and if they do rrrememberrr maarrr and hisss waysss kelvren reached for a log of firewood and purposefully splintered it into several pieces merely by squeezing it then i will ensurrre that they rrrememberrr grrryphonsss asss well four darian woke in the morning feeling as if his head werent working quite right it was difficult to put his thoughts together he seemed to be taking a very long time to get even a single thought to form he stared for a long time at the wall that was a hands breadth or two past his nose and wondered why the rough texture didnt look the way it should why did each roughsawn plank look rounded and why wasnt the wall itself slanting toward him as it formed the peak of the roof his mind moved slowly and his thoughts felt fuzzy around the edges and what was wrong with the light it was greenish and it was much darker in the loft than it should have been it couldnt be just turning dawn because he never woke up that early maybe its going to rain justyn hadnt foreseen any rains though and that was one thing that he could do right his weatherwatching was always accurate hed had the strangest dream too that the village had been attacked by a whole army there was fire a lot of fire in the dream the whole town had been on fire it had been more of a nightmare darian shivered and tried to remember more there was a lot of him running and monsters chasing him then more running through the forest then horrible men on horseback chasing him getting rescued by a hawkbrother and an owl a huge owl a pretty strange dream too when would i ever see a hawkbrother never in a thousand years and who would ever bother to attack errolds grove with an army what could they possibly want beans and turnips or maybe chickens he had to shake his head at the way he was trying to make sense of a dream anything can happen in a dream of course one of widow clays chickens must have started laying silver eggs with golden yolks or maybe justyn s spells finally worked and everyone was suddenly rich and that was why an army came then he rolled over and saw that he wasnt in the loft but in a strange octagonal hut made of rough logs windowless and with vines over the door there was a huge owl the same one he thought hed only dreamed about blinking sleepily on a perch to one side at that moment he realized with a plummeting heart that it hadnt been a dream at all it had all been real horribly real errolds grove was gone or if not gone it was in the hands of an army of violent strangers and everyone he knew had fled in fear of losing their lives in one moment he went from sleepy and laughing at himself to despair his insides became cold a lump rose in his throat that was half grief and half fear and his thoughts spun dizzily with nowhere to go he still couldnt quite remember all that had happened and the way his thoughts kept spinning didnt help there was something about justyn and his mind shied away from the thought as if he didnt want to remember as if remembering would be the most horrible thing that had happened to him the village had been taken but why what could anyone possibly want with a little town that was on the verge of drying up and blowing away if there were a single gold coin in the place he would be surprised a few of the women had jewelry silver and silvergilt but he was sure there was not enough in the whole village to fill a hat the women depended on their needlework to brighten their apparel most ornaments were made of carved and painted wood plaited straw beads and beadwork copper and bronze and not a single precious stone in the lot just turquoise agate and colored quartz there simply was nothing worth looting and even if you cleaned out every bit of beer and liquor in the place by the time you parceled it out among all the soldiers there wouldnt even be enough to get them mildly intoxicated this is insane nothing is making any sense i should be home i should be in the loft not here wherever here is but if he wasnt in the loft in justyns house where was he im with the hawkbrothers he remembered this house belonged to them what were they going to do with him now he remembered with a dreamlike vagueness that they had asked him questions about what had happened but they hadnt given him any idea what they planned to do where was he going to go if they didnt want him to stay could he get them to take him to kelmskeep but then what would he do thoughts of kelmskeep led him back to the village kelmskeep must have been where all the villagers were trying to escape to and that was why they were running without trying to take anything they could make lord breons lands in a few days or a week or so it would be a hardship but this was summer and no one would die of exposure or thirst but what had actually happened to the rest of the villagers how wellplanned had that attack been had those horrible fighters caught anyone else how could they not have if there had been four men on horseback ranging out that far from the village to catch those who tried to escape mightnt there be more no matter what the town did to me they never hurt me on purpose they just wanted me to be like them they never did anything to anybody they dont deserve to have those awful men get hold of them what would happen to them the man who caught him hadnt killed him right off but what would he have done when he learned that darian didnt have any money and didnt know where any was darian had only vague notions of what enemy soldiers wanted based on what bandits wanted if you didnt have money for them what would soldiers do how could you satisfy them if you didnt have what they had come for now darians vivid imagination portrayed all manner of terrible things that could have befallen the folk of errolds grove and he grew more and more agitated as he thought about their possible fates the owl turned his head then as if it sensed something was wrong it opened a pair of enormous eyes completely and fastened its gaze on him he found himself locking eyes with it it clearly was not afraid of him and strangely enough he was not afraid of it although it was easily large enough to hurt him quite seriously if not kill him if it took the notion to attack him in fact the more he looked into its huge golden eyes the calmer and quieter he felt it was so strange and warmfeeling and it made every thought seem to slow down it was almost as if the owl was putting its wing over him and sheltering him and telling him that everything would be all right then the owl blinked and the spell was broken the bird yawned hugely snapping his beak shut with a loud click darian yawned along with the owl then watched as the bird shook its tufted head so fast it blurred and felt as if he had to laugh a little at the sight the curtain of vines over the door to the hut parted and a shadow blocked out the light for a moment by the long braided hair and the odd clothing the newcomer had to be a hawkbrother as the hawkbrother came into the light he saw that it was the one who had rescued him yesterday he was very tall with long hair that had white roots and was dyed all over in patterns of pale and dark brown golden brown and barkgray his square chiseled face was very friendly with many smilecreases at the corners of his mouth his blue eyes contrasted oddly with his weathered golden skin he wore clothing in many shades of brown leather and closelywoven fabric and his left arm and shoulder were completely encased in a sleeve of padded leather snowfire his name is snowfire and his owl is hweel that was when darian remembered a calm and friendly voice telling him that this hut was snowfires and someone elses too and as he took another quick glance around he saw two sleeping pads like the one he was still on and a scattering of other belongings there was a second perch on the other side of the room across from hweels although no one had actually said anything about a second bird but there wasnt a bird on it from the size of the perch the bird must be half the size of hweel and he wondered what kind it was well and good said the hawkbrother standing just inside the door and looking at him in the friendliest possible fashion it seems that you are awake at last though i am certain you needed to sleep it is difficult to tell what time it is in this ekele i know you have slept entirely through breakfast and it is now time for lunch would you care to eat anything the hawkbrother had a very odd accent and his phrasing was a little strange but darian had no trouble understanding him i thought they had their own language didnt justyn tell me that somehow snowfire must have learned valdemaran from someone but darian thought he remembered him talking with a woman in some other tongue thank you im not sure if im hungry he replied vaguely knowing he should say something in reply but unable to come up with anything appropriate what did you say to someone whod saved your life how many times were you supposed to thank them for it did the hawkbrothers have some special significance attached to saving someones life it wasnt the sort of thing covered in the booke of manners that widow clay insisted he read for that matter the booke of manners seemed to give the impression that everyone in the world was valdemaran the hawkbrother snowfire yes that was right he was sure now came up and sat down beside him on a foldedup blanket snowfires arm was bandaged and obviously stiff and sore from the way he held it and darian felt very guilty all at once after all if he hadnt gotten into trouble snowfire wouldnt have gotten hurt rescuing him im sorry about your arm he said awkwardly blushing should he beg snowfires forgiveness for getting him into difficulties my arm snowfire looked surprised then shrugged as if it meant nothing to him i wouldnt worry about it if i were you its hardly a serious injury it doesnt look good he persisted i mean it must hurt an awful lot and you wont be able to use a bow until it heals up some oh i have had worse insect bites snowfire said nonchalantly truly it is nothing for you to concern yourself about it does give me an excuse to laze about the camp while others go out and do my hunting for me its just if i hadnt been there you wouldnt have gotten hurt rescuing me he began but i was so scared i couldnt think and after justyn and then as if those words had been a trigger he suddenly remembered everything that had happened yesterday the fight with justyn running off returning and being sent out as punishment coming back in time to see justyn see justyn on the bridge see justyn sacrifice himself one moment standing there facing down that thing the next moment seeing nothing of the bridge except a sheet of flame some barrier he had not even been aware of let go at that moment and there was nothing he could do to stop what happened next darian felt all the blood draining from his face leaving him cold and empty he trembled then simply fell apart a thousand unformed regrets triggered the avalanche and they tumbled together with selfrecrimination simple grief guilt and mourning they held him so paralyzed that he could not even move he could only shake and stare at snowfire with a sea of unbearable sorrow flooding him and choking his throat snowfire somehow saw it or part of it for he murmured ah poor fledgling let it go let it out and put his arm around darians shoulders in a gesture completely natural and fraternal and that was enough just enough to release the flood entirely he flung himself into snowfires shoulder and howled and snowfire held him firmly and comfortingly and let him cry himself out there was nothing awkward and selfconscious about it the hawkbrother just let him cry until he had no more tears left as if he let total strangers cry on his shoulder all the time for the first time since his parents disappeared darian had someone to cry with someone to share his grief with it helped it was amazing how much it helped finally after what seemed like days the torrent of tears turned to a stream the stream to a trickle and the tears at last stopped altogether it left him with an ache still in his heart a burden of guilt pressing down his soul and a void of loss he could never have expressed in words but he was too tired for the moment to continue his mourning so who was justyn snowfire asked with careful gentleness besides the one who held the bridge so your people could escape justyn was was the wizard darian managed as snowfire let him sit up and handed him a real handkerchief i was he was my master and he was teaching me or he was supposed to be he flushed a painful crimson even to the tip of his ears which burned as if he had gotten frostbite i wasnt a good apprentice he admitted with profound shame and grief i kept running off and i didnt want to practice the way he wanted me to but there was a tinge of resentment too and he couldnt help voicing it in his own defense but snowfire no one ever asked me if i wanted to be a wizard they just said i had the gift so i had to be one i wanted to be a hunter and a trapper like like my parents he would have said more but his throat closed again snowfire was silent for a moment i do not know you well darian he said after a moment but i think that you must have had a reason for running off and not practicing those magics darian shook his head still flushing and took refuge in one of the phrases the adults of errolds grove had always seemed to hate i dunno he mumbled every time he said that the adult he was talking to always replied with what do you mean you dont know how can you not know why youve done something you did it didnt you then why did you do it the reply of i dunno always seemed to trigger an angry interrogation which only got angrier as he retreated farther into himself snowfire however did not challenge that phrase perhaps someday you will know how to say what you felt what your reasons were he murmured encouragingly i would like to know when you can tell me it is just hard to say with words sometimes one can feel a reason without being able to say what the reason is we all feel that he sighed so wizard justyn is the one who blocked the bridge against the army then he set the bridge afire and perished in the flame i think darian began then stared at snowfire with his mouth dropping open i didnt say anything how did you know what happened to justyn for a moment wild tales of how hawkbrothers could read ones thoughts swept through his mind i am a mage too snowfire reminded him if i had been in his place and brave enough and desperate enough it is something that i would have done it is something that all those who have that gift know that they may someday need to do if the situation is hopeless and the need great enough and those who have given of themselves in that way are much honored for their bravery and nobility of spirit darian swallowed and took a deep breath while snowfire nodded to reinforce his words someone as strong and exotic as a hawkbrother honoring justyn if only justyn could have heard it when he was alive he was trying to keep those fighters back darian said grief clenching his stomach as he once again found himself holding back tears justyn this hawkbrother was saying that justyn had been brave and noble i think he mustve told everybody to run while he held them back i think thats why noone was fighting i think he told them not to fight because he knew they couldnt fight an army and he was buying time for them to get away he probably was and that was the wisest course for everyone snowfire put a finger under darians chin and lifted it so that darian was looking straight into his eyes i want you to listen to me and believe me darian what you described to us last night was definitely a very large and organized group and perhaps as you thought an entire army of welltrained fighters if justyn determined that the best course was for people to run he was right there is absolutely nothing your people could have done against them except be killed that is the way armies are it is what they do it is why they are armies they are made so that all that can stand against them is another army running was not only the best option for your people it was the only option for them they were not being cowardly they were accepting the gift that justyn offered to them and i will tell you something else i think that if they had known in advance that the gift included his life they would not have accepted it and they would have insisted that he escape with them but im supposed to be a mage i should have been there helping him darian was overwhelmed with shame and guilt so much so that he was not certain he had spoken aloud until snowfire shook his head darian you will not come into the full potential of your ability for at least another two perhaps three years the hawkbrother replied maybe more and even then you could not use that potential without several years of training study and practice even if you had begun training seriously three years ago you would not have been ready to help justyn now you would have been of no more use to him than than if you were going to be a fighter and he was an older warrior your strength as a mage is something that you must grow into as you would grow into your strength as a fighter there is a perfectly good reason why armies do not field ranks full of younglings your age and it is the same reason why you would have been of little help to justyn even if you had been training to your utmost yes but darian began then stopped unable to articulate why he was so certain that if he had been there helping justyn the old wizard would still be alive only sure that it was so you feel differently and i cannot convince you otherwise snowfire shrugged a little there is no arguing with a feeling i wish that there was but darian you cannot take on guilt for every bad thing that has happened put the guilt where it rightly belongs at least for if someone had not decided that it is easier to steal from innocents instead of earning their desires that army would not have appeared on the road to errolds grove in the first place if there is blame to be placed then place it squarely on the back of the aggressor who is leading these fighters whoever he is it is he who deserves to be punished not your people and not you darian was struck by the good common sense of that and felt a little of the burden he was carrying inside ease i i guess youre right i know i am snowfire said firmly and i know that you are feeling very strange and worn but now i have something difficult that i must ask of you adept starfall and i asked questions of you last night when you were very tired but we need to ask more of you now that you are well awake and thinking and the sooner we can ask you these things the fresher they will be in your mind do you think that you can manage such a thing for us when you are clean and fed darians heart sank he really did not want to go over all of yesterdays horrible events but he knew that he really needed to say yes i yes he replied in a small voice good and you are being quite brave to face what you will have to remember snowfire told him so earnestly that he did not doubt that snowfire actually meant the words and wondered at snowfire calling him brave now i will explain to you why we are going to need to know very many tiny details my people are allies of your people and we have taken on certain responsibilities we are all of us mages some with less power than you have at this moment and some like starfall with a very very great deal more but all of us are mages that makes my people very different and it makes us very desirable to other mages snowfire bit his lip as he looked down at darian for a moment as if he were debating something and then his expression settled as if he had decided to let darian hear more confidences there are ways that a mage can use another mage even if that other is an unwilling prisoner that is why we must be careful that we do not fall into the hands of mages who are working evil darian shivered all over was that why that huge fighter whod caught him hadnt killed him vague and illdefined pictures flitted through his mind all of them ugly we are only a very small party of tayledras snowfire continued we must know as much about this enemy as possible we need to know if we can and should attack him ourselves if we should merely interfere with him but let your valdemaran fighters deal with him or if we should actually hide from him do you see why we must do that perhaps one of the other boys from errolds grove would not have but darian did he nodded i can see it wouldnt make any difference if you waited so long as everybody got away he replied i mean whats the point of risking yourself for a bunch of old houses right it isnt as if the people couldnt rebuild or even move he bit his lip maybe now theyll be willing to settle somewhere else they surely werent prospering there that is correct snowfire said looking relieved your queen once said something both wise and profound when she ordered the evacuation of the eastern border that it was not the land that was valdemar it was the people it is not the houses that were your village it was your people if the people have survived then the village has regardless of whether or not the houses are still there darian nodded solemnly they could even still call themselves errolds grove if they wanted to he toyed with a bit of fringe on the blanket that had covered him last night i would understand if you decided not to fight them right away i mean as long as everybody got away all right and if theres a mage with these fighters you probably shouldnt let him know that there are more mages here there is certainly a mage behind them somewhere snowfire interrupted perhaps more than one those bearmen you saw could not have been made that way without a mage and darian quite frankly if there are no people who are in need of rescue the very best thing that we can do is to stay away from those fighters why darian asked a little surprised at his vehemence do you recall what i told you about what the tayledras are doing in your land how we are making the channels for magic to flow in snowfire waited expectantly his head tilted a little to one side darian closed his eyes for a moment then nodded as memoryfog cleared and you said that you were doing that so that a bad mage couldnt get the magic locked away from everybody else and he suddenly felt a number of things fall into place in his mind oh since theres a mage there he might try and lock the magic away i am almost positive that is exactly why he is here snowfire said grimly i frankly cannot imagine why the enemy would attack your little village except for that purpose if a special place for gathering magic is nearby he would have a readybuilt headquarters from which to work and a food supply already gathered and that is why it is our first and best duty to prevent him from accomplishing that task darian sighed he could certainly see snowfires point and as long as everyone was safe what would the hawkbrothers accomplish by fighting hadnt he just been thinking that there wasnt anything worth bothering about in errolds grove hadnt he just told snowfire that it might even be better if the people went somewhere better to resettle still the idea of a bunch of furcovered bullies just coming in and taking everything and not being made to pay for it made him angry and after what justyn did no justyn couldnt have thought he was saving the village just the people he must have known that there wasnt a chance of saving anything else so i shouldnt get all worked up over them taking the village darian are you ready to help us snowfire asked interrupting him midway through his attempt to sort out his feelings i guess so he began vaguely and before he could have second thoughts snowfire had gotten him out of the hut through a little maze of vinecovered barriers and he was suddenly confronting not one or two but ten or twelve of the hawkbrothers each of them with his or her own bird perched on a shoulder or arm they sat together in a sunny circular clearing with a tiny stream running along one side theyd taken their seats either on the ground or on natural objects such as boulders or pieces of log all of them were clearly waiting for him and as snowfire sat him down in the middle of this halfcircle of people and stood discreetly aside darian felt himself to be the uncomfortable focus of their interest although all of the people here had the same sort of greenandbrown clothing that snowfire wore no two costumes were alike and although many had heavy leather gloves on one or both hands none of them wore the same shouldertowrist gauntlet that he did all of the birds were enormous and of the breeds that darian recognized these individuals were twice and three times bigger than the ones darian knew there were three people with large hawks with vivid rustyorange and goldenyellow tails two with thin and nervous hawks with yelloworange eyes and pale almost pinkish breasts three with falcons that looked just like forestgyres two with ones that looked like peregrines one with a slategray bird with aggressive reddish eyes that must have been a goshawk of some sort and one with a huge cleverlooking crow no one else had an owl of any kind the birds all watched darian with interest and intelligence and darian had the peculiar feeling that they heard and understood every word that was being said another person came around a screen of vines a most impressive and exoticallydressed man with waistlength white hair who had a white falcon with pale brown markings perched on a pad on his shoulder this persons robes were so elaborately cut and layered that it was obvious he could never have gone scouting about through the forest as the others did so this must be the adept that snowfire had been talking about something about him seemed very familiar and as the adept spoke quietly with snowfire and one or two of the others darian finally remembered why hed met this man last night and the man had questioned him with snowfires assistance because his valdemaran hadnt been anywhere near as good as snowfires this was starfall who must be a very powerful mage indeed if the deference the other hawkbrothers showed him was any indication as darian found himself to be the focus of all those eyes avian as well as human he began to recall how often he managed to get himself into trouble and that was with people he knew how could he hope to do anything other than get himself into worse trouble with these folk and what must they think of him for running away the way he had surely they must think he was a dreadful coward at best and at worst at worst they must think he was good for nothing except to get them into more trouble his heart sank and he began to feel utterly worthless what good was he what good had he ever been surely these people could only wish him gone out of their lives he began to be a little bit afraid of them too oh snowfire seemed approachable and normal enough but the rest of these folk well they were the mysterious and dangerous guardians of the forest who knew what strange customs they had what if they decided to make him disappear after all if he disappeared there would be less trouble all the way around snowfire and the adept finished their conversation and came over to darian and took seats beside him with him placed between the two of them that took him aback hed expected to be sitting alone surrounded by strangers all of them interrogating him but it seemed as if starfall and snowfire had made themselves his advocates of a sort wed like to begin now if you are ready snowfire said phrasing the words as a question i guess i am darian replied a bit shaken some of our scouts do not know your tongue at all and most do not know it as well as i do snowfire told him by way of explanation so they will ask the question and i will act as translator or i will clarify what they are asking i would like you to think back to just before you saw the signs of the attack had you seen or heard anything in the past few weeks to make you think that there might be such an attack darian shook his head no he said truthfully then added but the people dont go out of the village much and especially not into the forest so they might not see anything justyn his voice quavered justyn wasnt much good at foresight he could see the weather all right but never anything on the ground that was how we got caught by a flood last fall the rain that caused it was way up north he didnt foresee it and of course he didnt foresee the way it would make the river rise he shook his head everybody was so afraid of the forest that they wouldnt stir past the fields if they could help it and nobody was due to go over to one of the other towns for trading for a while snowfire translated and some of the scouts discussed what he had said among themselves are towns there to your north called out one darian had to think hard about that one justyn had been making him memorize maps but he had a poor head for it he had much better luck in remembering things by means of landmarks than by arbitrary marks on a piece of paper i dont think so he said trying to be honest that is i think that the ones north of us are all a lot farther east as well i think he closed his eyes and tried to visualize the map hed been studying i think that the border here kind of sticks out in a bump pointing west and were at the tip of the bump there was more discussion and some sketching in the sand let us go forward then to the time of the attack starfall said carefully when did you first know that there was something wrong i was up in a tree looking for mycofoetida fungus he replied i was pretty high because wed kind of harvested everything that was near the ground and near the town so the first thing i saw was that there were big fires in town one of the hawkbrothers with a forestgyre said something to snowfire who relayed the question so the attack had already begun darian shook his head no no not yet i didnt know what was happening but i knew something had to be wrong so i left the basket and ran back to town and what was burning mostly was haystacks and sheds and just a few of them and i saw vere that was one of the farmers setting a fire himself i guess they were burning things to keep the bad people from getting them now discussion among the scouts lasted for some time before another called out a question that snowfire translated what did the army look like exactly can you remember any numbers he shuddered at that one but he had expected that it would be coming and he closed his eyes and tried to picture the scene at the bridge there was justyn on the bridge he said slowly then there was the big monster with the little monster riding on it then there were some of the bearmen they were five across the road and i think four lines of five then behind them was a bunch of human people with tall spears he tried so hard to visualize the scene that he began to get a headache i couldnt see behind them very far but there were a lot of them they were lined up on the road five across and i remember so many spears sticking up in the air that it looked like a burned forest was on the road for as far back as i could see he opened his eyes at the murmur of surprise but now attention was completely off him for the moment as the hawkbrothers discussed possible numbers represented by what he remembered from their worried faces he gathered that the implications werent good were all the bearmen on the bridge starfall asked him quietly i think so he said just as quietly but i dont know for sure because i ran some of them might have jumped into the river and some of them might have gotten out of the way and some might have been farther back in the ranks snowfire pointed out starfall sighed and nodded agreement did you see anyone that he groped for words for a moment then said something incomprehensible to snowfire did you see anyone who looked like a mage snowfire asked then raised one eyebrow as if aware of the uselessness of such a question i didnt see anyone wearing fancy robes or who looked like he was doing any magic darian replied trying to be as exact as possible the thing on the lizard acted more like like somebody who was in charge of things but not really in charge of everything if you get my meaning he acted like somebody who had to answer to somebody else and when he got caught in the fire the rest of em acted like it was no great thing that he wasnt there like maybe they were getting orders from somebody behind them darian was doing his best to answer the questions to the fullest but the more he had to think about justyn to see the scene in his mind the worse he felt he was doing his best to hold back tears but it wasnt easy and it didnt get any easier where were the rest of your people at the time the bridge was destroyed starfall asked gone darian told him glumly they were all running away from the village when i was running toward it and you turned to run when the bridge was destroyed that was one of the scouts a very young man whose face darian remembered from last night he hung his head not liking to think what they must believe of him for running yes he admitted flushing hotly from the top of his head on down and where were the enemy then the young man persisted still on the other side of the river darian looked up surprised to see that there was no open scorn in their faces no he told them no some of them were on the other side when i got out to the fields i guess they must have forded the river or something but they were working their way through the fields i guess to keep people from escaping and you eluded them came the question well he admitted there werent many of them and i ran away admitting that to all of those people was one of the most difficult things hed ever had to do and he felt tension build up suddenly inside him i had to he cried out the words forced out by the tension i had to i couldnt help justyn i didnt know what else to do and then unexpectedly he lost control of himself and burst into tears again and felt another overwhelming wave of shame for losing control of himself which ironically only made him cry harder starfall patted his shoulder sympathetically but evidently was not prepared to leave him alone i am sorry that we must ask these questions darian but we need the answers now do you remember how many men you saw on your side of the river and if they were entirely human an accurate number the questioning went on despite his distress becoming more and more detailed several times he lost control again and began to cry each time the hawkbrothers waited politely for him to regain control of himself then continued from where they had left off finally though they had exhausted everything he could tell them about the enemy army for such they were all agreed it was the questioning turned to another subject one even more trying for him to face because the subject was himself some of the scouts had gone off leaving only starfall snowfire wintersky and two others but the five of them were inexorable in their questions if all the villagers were afraid to go into the forest why was he out there why was he not afraid of the forest what had happened to his parents why had he been signed over to justyns care by the rest of the villagers why did the villagers have any say in what was to happen to darian why didnt darian want to be a mage did he think there was something wrong with being a mage did he often run off what did justyn do when he disobeyed was he thinking of running away at the time of the attack how did he feel about what justyn did on the bridge it was the last question that undid him it was bad enough having to admit how often he had gotten into trouble and worse admitting that the reason hed been sent out of the village was as a punishment for running away from a duty but to be asked how he felt about seeing justyn sacrifice himself again he started to cry but this time he couldnt get control of himself once he started snowfire even tried to soothe him saying that he wasnt at fault but he knew that he was and he was certain that in some strange way he should have been able to do something but all he had done was to run away like the coward he was you werent there you dont know you didnt see what i did he wailed his voice breaking with hysteria you dont understand im a coward im a rotten lying coward and its all my fault and with that he ran stumbling and half blinded with tears out of the clearing in the direction hed been led from he couldnt think of what to do but when he found himself back in front of snowfires hut the darkness inside seemed a good place to hide himself in and he blundered in the owl was gone it was very quiet and he crumpled into a miserable heap on the sleeping pallet crying so hard that he thought he would never be able to stop now i feel guilty starfall murmured to snowfire as the child stumbled out of the gathering space choking on his sobs snowfire sighed nightwind had warned him last night that scenes like this would occur and probably several times nightwind thinks there are emotional hurts that he has not dealt with except by avoiding them he told the adept she said last night that he was suffering from other troubles things that perhaps occurred some time ago she was quite sure he would not even mention them unless he was prodded into it well it seems that one of those hurts was the loss of his parents starfall said and ran his hand through his silver hair poor child i would feel terrible if something happened to mine he must feel dreadful it seems obvious to me that he has not been allowed to properly mourn for them snowfire pointed out these people who took him in seemed to want to make him ashamed of them children may be resilient but but not that resilient starfall interrupted his mouth set grimly and although these valdemarans may have meant well it is said by our cousins that the road to disaster is ordered by the righteous planned by the wellmeaning and paved with their good intentions i think that although darian has many faults as do most younglings they were viewed in an exaggerated manner on the whole they were in a fair way to ruining a fundamentally good child snowfire could only nod for he was in perfect agreement how can good people manage to so mishandle a boy he wondered was it only that they refused to see he did not fit in their constrained lives or were they only trying to be cruel to be kind never realizing they were only being cruel and their kindness missed the mark altogether i will see if nightwind thinks she should come help with this latest outbreak he sighed i hate to press the boy but even if we are going to do nothing more than avoid any contact with these barbarians we still need his knowledge of the area and we need to know everything he has seen starfall frowned at that snowfire reflected that in many ways he was made of sterner stuff than the adept well starfall might be the heart of the expedition but snowfire was its hands and it was his job to keep the heart safe finally starfall could contain himself no more i dont want to destroy the child just to extract information starfall protested then colored he i apologize i know you would never countenance any such thing it is just that i am not used to having children flee my presence in tears snowfire smiled wanly darians fragility has an unnerving effect on all of us and that effect is redoubled by the burden of what he has told us two days ago we were engaged in simple duty something routine not unmixed with pleasure i think and a duty we were completely prepared to handle now suddenly we have a mysterious enemy of unknown ability appearing to threaten us without prior warning of any sort it is quite enough to make anyone feel tempted to indulge in a fit of strong hysterics i know i am tempted starfall stood up shook out his robes and tossed back his hair i hope you will not think badly of me if i leave the boy in the hands of you and nightwind he ventured i feel as if i am playing the coward myself by doing so but but you have other things to do that involve the welfare of more than one boy snowfire reminded him and you may think me ruthless in some ways but if it meant preventing the rise of another maar or even another falconsbane i would not hesitate to sacrifice myself the boy and anyone else i could get to volunteer i think you would have a surprising number of volunteers starfall replied and you are right i do have a task to complete that cannot wait regardless of my personal feelings i am going to leave things in your hands as usual now more than ever i need to get those matrices established you might consider locking the power to yourself snowfire suggested and as starfall looked surprised even shocked he added there are no other alliance mages living here to require access to it you can key the rest of us into it if you really think it is necessary this may prevent trouble what can be locked securely can always be unlocked but it cannot be stolen that is one way to make sure this new mage cannot get at it and one way to make sure that if worst comes to worst he must keep you alive that would give time for help to come should disaster befall and you come into captivity you have a point starfall acknowledged looking troubled and just a little queasy starfall had never had to face a situation like this before and snowfire felt very sorry for him for all that tayledras were sturdy folk not all had grown up prepared to face an enemy in lifeordeath struggle and adepts especially tended to stay toward the power management side of magic ill consider it i would not have thought it possible for a mage to work changes on humans under our current conditions if he can do that he may be able to do other unpleasant and unexpected things that being so he may be able to bypass anything but a true personal lock as starfall walked off in the direction of his workplace snowfire was left to contemplate the smaller problem of darian hes going to have to cry himself out again and he hasnt yet gotten to the point where hes going to consider my failure to appear at his side as an act of desertion in fact he may just be grateful to be left alone better to consult with nightwind first and possibly with kelvren the gryphon had managed to get himself wrought up to a high pitch of excitement at the notion that he might be the one to confront a second maar as unlikely as that was and it might do kel some good to have something else to think about something like one small boy parentless and friendless with an apparent affinity for winged things so the next obvious place to go was the rock at the rear of the valley where the gryphon liked to sun himself between scouting forays and since hed already been out once this morning making certain that the barbarians had not gotten too close to the tayledras perimeter he would definitely be there the spring that watered this valley had been made to serve many creative purposes its water had been divided into several channels that gave everyone access to a thread of stream at the very least tayledras liked the sound of running or falling water and preferred to live in the midst of it lacking the lovely secluded spaces of a vale everyone in the team had made up for or hertasi had made up for that lack by creating a scrap of water garden for him or herself some had constructed tiny pools with a single water lily or a stand of reeds and a tiny singingfrog some preferred miniature waterfalls and gurgling brooks filled with stones and nightwind had made a clever little aqueduct and water wheel that powered an everchanging series of frivolous and colorful whirligigs but the greater part of the water could be diverted to fill two pools one to be used only for washing the other for swimming the former was emptied when the water was dirty into a sandfilter so that the water that sank into the earth was cleansed since there was no natural hot spring here the tayledras were making do with a steambath kelvren being a fastidious gryphon made use of the swimming or washing pool on a daily basis but could not be persuaded into the steamhut kelvrens daily bath was an occasion of much splashing and generally emptied the pool when every feather on his body was soaked he would shake himself out thus ensuring that anyone and anything near by that was not already drenched would receive a fair share of the spray then he would flap laboriously to a smooth rock high above the pool one of the few places in the valley that received sun for most of the day there he would sit and preen until he considered every feather to be perfectly groomed at least in a serviceable manner after that his trondlirn could do decorative and restorative tendings in the evening by checking the angle of the sun snowfire reckoned that kelvren would be about halfway through the grooming process and damp but not wet gryphons being more complicated and imperfect creatures than the bondbirds occasionally suffered some deficiencies and one of the more common was a tail gland that produced an insufficient quantity of oil to keep the feathers healthy and weatherproof that was kelvrens problem and it was one of nightwinds duties as his trondlirn to make up for that lack so she would be with him adding touches of very light fragrant oil to the shafts of his larger feathers with a small artists paintbrush after that it was his job to preen it into the barbs an odd task but then caring for gryphons evidently involved a great many odd tasks snowfire walked down the winding paths that threaded the encampment with a lengthened stride that allowed him to move quickly without appearing to hurry he soon reached the end of the valley and as he came around the last vine curtain and out into the full sunlight beyond the trees he saw nightwind sitting beside kelvren on the gryphons favored perch she was the only person in the entire group who had the same ravenwingblack hair as their shinain cousins along with the golden complexion and intense blue eyes she was not tall but she held herself so well that she gave the impression of being taller than she was her finelysculptured face reminded him a little of a vixen she did indeed have a tiny paintbrush in one hand and a pot in the other all her attention concentrated on the primaries and secondaries of the wings he had stretched out over her lap like a great feathered blanket it looked for all the world as if she were gilding or painting the great bird in fact she could have been painting him for special occasions besides wearing body and legjewelry the gryphons often had their feathers bleached then dyed or painted and sometimes strings of beads or bells were attached to the base of the tailcovert feathers or along the shafts of the crestfeathers or primaries she had told snowfire that this too was one of her skills an uncommon one among trondlirn kelvren was excessively proud of the fact that his attendant was so skillful a featherpainter snowfire himself had never seen a gryphon so decorated and frankly could not imagine it the whole idea seemed very bizarre to him as if hweel should suddenly express a desire to be transformed with colors like a firebird or a scarlet jay but gryphons being highly intelligent had an appreciation for artistry and a particular eye for ornament since they were in a very real sense living sculptures by a longlost master artist urtho they felt rightly that they were canvasses for beauty to be worked upon snowfire wondered wryly if urtho had bred them for vanity or if this trait had been an accidental feature of these created creatures he hailed them both nightwind responded with a wave of her brush and kel with fanning the opposite wing from the one being tended to he rounded the pool as he had expected kel had pretty much emptied it and it was now refilling from the spring and climbed up the path to their rock i take it from your expression that the situation is not exactly a good one nightwind asked as he sat down beside her with his back to the sun in a word correct he said as kel cocked an eartuft at him he quickly summed up the most salient points of the questioning and kel snapped his beak and flattened his headfeathers not good the gryphon surmised it appearrsss that this trrruly isss an arrrmy and not jussst a childsss exagerrration an arrrmy of rrreasssonable quality asss well well arrnned well trrrained and there is a high probability of a mage among them or leading them he reminded the gryphon my guess would be that he is leading them and to be honest we dont have the strength to risk a direct or even indirect confrontation kelvren growled but nodded reluctantly i do not like it but you arrre unforrrtunately corrrect but i sssshould like to venturrre a sorrrtie orrr two ssstrrrictly ssspy misssssionsss at night perrrrhapsss with hweel to guide i am a good nightflyerrr snowfire gazed at the gryphon with surprise and admiration now that is one of the better ideas i have heard today he replied very pleased with the idea hweel needs a certain amount of mental guidance and you should have a backup so that could be my role i think i could manage that without needing to use a weapon thats good because until that wound is healed you wont be doing anything like shooting a bow nightwind said rather pointedly i think snowfire replied with a bit of impatience that i am perfectly capable of figuring that out for myself and what about the time you went climbing right after a concussion last year she asked he ignored her which appeared to cause her a great deal of amusement hweel and i could go in together as far as that clearing where i rescued the boy he said to kelvren then you and hweel could go on alone we can get some idea from the boy how near the trees grow to the village but my impression was that you could easily use them as cover quite close in kel nodded clearly satisfied by having something constructive to do now that you mention the boy nightwind put in how badly did he take to being questioned snowfire winced well he left the meeting in tears if that tells you anything no more than i expected she replied with a shrug did he happen to let anything out that would give you a hint to those other emotional burdens hes carrying some of his background his parents were trappers and apparently disappeared a year or so ago the people of his village were afraid of the forest and have been since the magestorms brewed up some nasty creatures out there evidently the encounters they had with the monsters gave them some severe shocks so the villagers disapproved of anyone who would go into the forest on a regular basis claiming that the stormchanged monsters would track such people back to the village to attack them so what happened when the parents didnt come back nightwind asked what made the villagers take him in guilt maybe snowfire hazarded he was apprenticed to the village mage who evidently was not very good and didnt get much respect darian did not really want to be a mage himself and the villagers did their best to persuade him that his parents brought their fate on themselves he assumed that nightwind could make her own assessment from those rather bald facts probably much more accurately than he could oh no she said looking at him with all traces of amusement gone no wonder hes a tangle of unhappiness inside i hardly dare think of what he must be going through i do need your insight he reminded her you are the only empath among us you know im not trained in sorting out human emotions she protested then made a face i know im making excuses emotions are emotions but among my peoplesss ourrr emotional sssolutionsss arrre much morrre dirrrect kel pointed out with a chuckle and your emotions were modeled on your makers which were quite human point taken now let me think a moment she pressed her fingers to her temples im going to assume that he had a strong and positive bond with his parents so we have the obvious trauma of losing them and the notsoobvious trauma of not knowing what really happened to them he could even be coping with the loss by inventing reasons why they might still be alive which is only delaying the mourning period that sounds reasonable he agreed the people of his village strongly disapproved of his parents themselves as well as their profession i dont imagine too many days went by without darian hearing how reckless and dangerous his parents were which made it imperative to him to defend them except that defending them would be disrespectful of the adults in the village who would in turn punish him in some way never thinking that this was telling him that he either had to disassociate himself from his patents not likely hrrrr kel rumbled or take on the same disapproval it also told him that it was inappropriate to mourn them since presumably he was now in the care of much worthier people she shook her head fretfully i wish people would think before they do things like this to children all right so before he has lived a single day with these people he has been given the message that they disapprove of him it is wrong to care deeply about the parents he loved because they didnt deserve it and he is to be grateful to people whose ways are utterly at odds with his thats a fine way to begin a new life isnt it snowfire coughed and scratched his head there isnt a great deal i can add to that statement he said awkwardly nightwind pardon me for saying this but you seem very direct for an empath the kvala empath was more how should i put this diplomatic the kvala empath is one of your elders she chuckled besides you arent the one whose emotional turmoil is under discussion i might be more diplomatic with you get back to the sssubject kel grumbled orrr the two of you will begin courrrting behaviorrr again and i will have to sssprrread thisss oil myssself while you ante posssturrring oh excuse me she mocked him dabbing a bit of oil on the tip of his beak in a lightningquick stroke of her brush since you insist now you say he has magegift and was apprenticed to a rather ineffective village mage but did not actually want to be a mage at his nod she pursed her lips again i am going to assume that he liked his master so his master is of low status and meager ability he has been bound to this man regardless of his own preferences and he has no doubt been told how grateful he should be for having been so bound so the message he has been given is that he is so worthless he is now forcibly associated with a lowstatus individual because they believe he obviously is incapable of making a logical decision his own preferences are of no bearing on the situation because they tell him he is too ignorant to make his own choices his future has been determined for him whether or not he likes it and because he cannot understand why he should be pleased and gratified with the situation he is obviously morally and mentally deficient starfall quoted the shinain about the road to disaster he observed she massaged her temples with her fingers looking pained i know that one you know it is a very good thing that there are none of them available for me to strangle for i would be very tempted to do so i am also very tempted to suggest that what happened to that village seems very like a proper retribution for what they loaded upon this poor child but of course that would be making a moral judgment based on limited information about another culture and that would be wrrrrong kel said with an ironic tilt to his head ssso of courrrsse you could not possssibly do that unlesss it werrre sufficiently enterrrtaining the gryphon halfrumbled halfburbled a laugh and received a poke in the side in return well now i have some clearer idea of what i will probably be walking into when i go root him out of my ekele snowfire sighed mind you i have no doubt that the boy is as full of mischief as a gryphlet is quite convinced that he knows better than any adult born and is stubborn willful and rebellious just exactly as any other boy his age would be nevertheless it seems to me that if these folk intended to create a situation designed to bring out the worst in him they could not have been more effective that would be my conclusion snowfire nightwind agreed and dropped a thistledownsoft kiss on his forehead now go and see what you can do to turn the child around you have a knack for that which astonishes me for someone who claims to have no ability as an empath you certainly handle young creatures well lets hope it is a knack and not just a streak of good luck he replied and stood up and as for you old bird he continued looking to the gryphon i should think a distraction would do him some good and you are the most distracting creature i can think of would you care to help me out with him why not the gryphon agreed genially but not immediately i think he isss likely to indulge in morrre weeping and i have only now gotten my featherrrsss drry vain bird snowfire told him with mock severity and took himself back down the path to his ekele leaving nightwind and kel together on the sunning rock he had no doubt that kel was waiting to get nightwinds advice about how the gryphon should handle the boy and not for any specious reason about drying feathers that was fine they should ideally have different approaches after all they couldnt both play elder brother let me see starfall obviously is better suited to the role of respected elder and when darian sees that a mage is the highest statused person in our group that might make him change his mind about magic nightwind may be waiting to see if he accepts her as mother surrogate it would be better if he made that choice i think he is a little too clever to accept her if she puts herself forward in that role and i know she knows it could be trouble if she tried to force it on him the gryphon being the gryphon he will no doubt take the role of mysterious wonder or entrancing enigma and play his appearance for all he can to work in advice we could not give as he continued to plan out several possible approaches to take he reached the door of his hut and carefully parted the curtain of vines the boy was huddled up on his pallet with his face to the wall and somewhat to snowfires surprise the owl who was normally rather aloof had come down off his perch and was on the ground beside the boy with one wing stretched over him as if hweel were sheltering a nestling the owl turned his head and fastened his great golden eyes on snowfire as the tayledras entered instead of words hweel sent emotion a complicated flavor of distress and protectiveness boy hurts inside loss shelter lost caring lost pain but no blood hweel finally articulated i know snowfire replied simply ill do the best i can for him hweel relaxed immediately as if certain now that snowfire understood and had promised to help that snowfire could solve all of the boys complicated problems sometimes hweels absolute trust in his bondmates ability to solve any problem was as irritating as it was touching but snowfire took great care never to convey that irritation hweel relinquished his place on the boys pallet waddling over to be lifted up to his perch and once the owl was back where he belonged snowfire took up the place hweel had vacated he touched darians shoulder carefully darian he said quite calmly i came to see if you were feeling any better his immediate answer was a sniff but darian at least sat up nno the boy replied his voice hoarse snowfire suppressed a chuckle which would have been taken amiss at least the lad is honest im sorry to hear that no one wanted to upset you least of all starfall he is quite personally distressed that you were made so unhappy by our questions his last words to me were that he is not accustomed to having children run from him in tears darian rubbed his reddened eyes and sniffed again but looked up at snowfire with mingled surprise and disbelief why should he care it doesnt matter how i feel but it does snowfire interrupted it matters a great deal adept starfall is a great favorite among the children of our vale he is accustomed to being liked for his kindness as well as respected for his wisdom and it makes him feel badly if someone is hurt by his actions or words im not worth worrying about darian mumbled looking down at the ground theres no reason why he should think about me theres no reason why any of you should think about me youre all important people youre all these amazing warriors and mages you can do things that nobody back in errolds grove would believe and im im just the worthless troublemaker nobody else wants snowfire nodded to himself mentally as the boys words echoed what nightwind had already surmised im sorry to hear you say that since i dont in the least agree with you i truly hate to spoil a friendship by beginning it with a quarrel he replied lightly and was rewarded once again with darians glance of dumbfounded astonishment how can you say that the boy asked incredulously there isnt anybody in errolds grove whod believe their ears if they heard you say that why what would they say snowfire asked ingenuously that that im ungrateful disrespectful and i dont know my place darian said in what was very nearly a growl turning his gaze away from snowfires face and back down to the ground snowfire made a noncommittal sound and why would they say that youre ungrateful because after all the effort theyve gone to in order to make sure i had someone to take care of me and have food and shelter and the trouble theyve gone to in order to see that i was going to learn a useful trade im not grateful and i dont know my place darian muttered his voice full of resentment snowfire shifted his weight and took a more comfortable pose giving himself time to think out his answer it seems to me he said carefully that you already had the grounding in a very good trade that being the one that your parents followed it seems to me that provided you liked that trade of course you could with a little effort have found someone else in that trade to take you as halftrained apprentice and thus you would have supplied your own food shelter and master so i fail to see why they should think you should consider yourself beholden to them for what they did after all the choice of caretaker lodging and trade was theirs not yours and you had never asked them to undertake it on your behalf if someone cooks food i do not care for and offers it to me when they know i am not hungry should i be grateful to them some people would think so darian replied but his spirits seemed a little higher he shrugged then some people are foolish and that is their problem not mine nor should it be yours however there is this to consider would any of their children at your age have been able to do as you would have done had they waited to let you try no he admitted theyd have been pretty helpless theyd have had to get a relative to take care of em and sort things out for them then wouldnt it be reasonable to say that they were taking care of things for you as their own children would have needed care snowfire waited for darian to make the next leap of logic i guess so darian didnt say anything else but snowfire could tell he was thinking about something i hope its that he can see why they would expect him to be grateful even though he wasnt obliged to feel gratitude poor lad he was a tervardi being brought up by hertasi who didnt understand why he wanted to live at the tops of trees instead of a nice safe burrow deep in the ground and he didnt understand why he should be grateful that they kept giving him the room farthest from the exit well snowfire said at last why would they say you were disrespectful because i pretty much told them what you just did darian said with some wonderment so surprised to hear his own thoughts echoing from snowfires mouth that he was hard put to keep his eyes down on the ground well if you told them in approximately the same words that i used i can understand being called disrespectful snowfire chuckled you might consider cultivating a more diplomatic approach to avoid conflict in the future but what is this about knowing your place darian looked up at him from beneath a pair of fiercely knitted eyebrows i guess i wasnt humble enough he replied old justyn he just let everybody treat him like the whole villages servant and i guess i was supposed to act the same really snowfire did not let his expression of friendly interest slip perhaps though it wasnt that they treated justyn as if he were a servant but as if they had become so accustomed to his services that they took him for granted maybe darians fierce expression eased a little i suppose that was it i guess when you do things for people and they get used to you being there its natural to kind of get taken for granted exactly true snowfire nodded calmly that is why from time to time our vale healer goes out into the deep forest to meditate and refresh his spirit when we have to do without him for a while we notice again how much he does of course if any of us were to have a genuine emergency he would return but that rarely happens when he comes back he is invigorated by his rest and we are properly appreciative of all he does now that your master did not do this is as much his own fault as the villagers our shinain cousins have a saying to treat a person like a carpet it is necessary that one do the walking and one allow himself to be walked on darian actually smiled a little and rubbed his reddened nose with the back of his hand thats a funny saying but i guess i see the point it seems to me snowfire continued with perfect calm that the people of your village could have used a deal more exposure to the wider world and were stubborn and loud in their refusal to change their ways now darian laughed out loud thats a funny thing for a hawkbrother to say he replied hellfires you people never even came out of the forest till just a little bit ago most people thought you had feathers instead of hair that would be the tervardi not the tayledras snowfire chuckled and again the cousins say it takes a mule to repeat a mules bray which is to say the one most likely to recognize a fault is the one who suffers from the same fault hmm i guess so darian grew quiet and thoughtful and snowfire wondered if he had caught the second lesson that a great deal of the trouble between himself and his guardians lay in the fact that neither of them cared to compromise the vision they had for darians future a clue that he just might have came a moment later when he asked plaintively do i have to be a mage that is a good question darian well you have the gift and it seems reasonable to train it so that it is at least under your control snowfire replied judiciously having a gift is a bit like having a very large and active dog think about the large dogs you have been around in your life from pups to adults if you do not train a dog to obey you what happens he jumps all over people steals what he wants maybe bites someone darian nodded as if the analogy made sense to him but if he is trained even if you do not go to the extent of training him for say pulling a cart or searching for lost children he will stay out of trouble that is why you should at least train your gift otherwise like the dog it is likely to break loose and do something unanticipated usually at a bad moment darian sighed and propped his chin on his hand its just that before you did that stuff with the bandage i couldnt see much you could do with magic that you couldnt do with a pair of hands snowfire stretched and thought quickly he needed to find something that would convince darian to undertake real training which would mean a great deal of hard work well in the long run you are correct if i wish to know something happening at a distance i could work the magic to find it out or i could go there and find it out for myself if i needed to hide myself i could work the magic to do so or i could wear the correct clothing and learn to move without making a sound now i could not call lightning by myself for instance but the artificers of valdemar have a powder that will certainly leave a large hole and make one think that lightning was called so you are in the right of it but the black powder does not work in the rain sometimes the right clothing still would not conceal a watcher and it is not always convenient to go off on a journey to learn what is going on somewhere he spread his hands wide you see it is good to know how to do things without magic but it is good to know how to do them with magic as well it gives you more options than just one or the other justyn couldnt do much darian said meditatively magic i mean something was wrong with his head he said and he couldnt do magic like he used to i dont know that may have been as much the result of the magestorms as anything else snowfire replied with the way that magic was scattered he may not have had the power to do the things he used to and that may be why he lost some of the respect that he had in the past and also we do not know why but a small number of mages were affected by the storms some lost ability some gained it he may have been one of those who lost it and that is hardly his fault do you fault a man for no longer chopping wood when he has lost a hand but he figured out ways of doing things that needed getting done without magic darian protested and that is certainly to his vast credit i have no argument with you it is too bad that your villagers were so certain that something done by magical means is intrinsically more valuable than something done any other way that they forgot that the value lies in the accomplishment not how it was done snowfire decided enough had been said on that issue well that after all is how it is said that carnival sharpsters manage to separate the gullible from their earnings by accomplishing the ordinary with so much flash and tinsel that their victims forget that they are seeing nothing but a gaudy illusion overlaid on the absolutely commonplace darian looked so puzzled by that last remark that snowfire reminded himself sharply that he was only dealing with a young lad no matter how clever the boy sounded i dont know what that means the boy admitted honestly impressing the hawkbrother even more it matters not darian we can talk about it another time we have time to be friends but for now he led darian gently and by careful questions to talk about his parents he discovered that nightwind had been correct about darians close and affectionate relationship with his parents he also learned that as she had surmised he still held to the hope that they were still alive somewhere he saw no reason to disabuse the boy of that hope certainly his guardians had made that attempt and failed and after all what harm did it do him that hope had probably sustained him rather than harming him in any way and had helped him to keep his spirit intact that was hardly a bad thing finally he persuaded darian to come out of the ekele get something to eat and continue answering questions you will feel better with a meal inside you snowfire assured him as he led darian to the central cooking area i know that i always do i would also like you to meet the rest of us one at a time rather than facing all of us in a group that cannot have been comfortable darian averted his eyes for a moment it felt like like i was in trouble again and you you people are pretty scary he murmured uncomfortably snowfire mentally berated himself for not seeing that beforehand i apologize darian but that is how we always conduct our informationmeetings when people must know some crucial intelligence we all come together to hear it and ask questions then folk go off to think about the situation then return some time later to discuss possible strategies you were not in trouble but you were the focus and the most important part of the meeting darian flushed and snowfire decided that the subject had better be changed never mind he said lets get food by that time they had reached the cook shelter which had clay ovens constructed on the spot for baking open fires with tripods for pots and spits for roasting small beasts and birds whole and grills over coals for fish snowfire spotted the hertasi ayshen taking fresh hot bread from one of the ovens and headed straight in that direction for there was nothing he loved so much as hot bread it was only when he noticed that darian was no longer beside him that he turned to see the boy staring at the little hertasi with an expression of horrified surprise darian he asked puzzled is something wrong darians face was as pale as a cloud what is that he whispered as if he was afraid to make a sound lest the hertasi suddenly leap at him and rend him with claw and fang that is ayshen a good friend of mine and a wonderful baker snowfire said deciding that the best approach would be to be completely matteroffact about the hertasi did the valdemarans have no hertasi in their land evidently not judging by darians pinched expression his mate drusi makes a better stew but no one can rival his bread and his meat pies are worth suffering any hardship to earn come ill introduce you darian could hardly hang back after that and he trailed along after snowfire with wide eyes and a set look of determination on his face ayshen snowfire hailed i am about to perish of famine and our young friend darian kvaldemar has not even had breakfast surely you can take pity on us and feed us darian obviously understood none of this probably not even his name given that snowfire had given it the tayledras pronunciation but he could not misunderstand the tone of friendtofriend that snowfire used nor could he misunderstand the similar tone with which ayshen replied to this sally shame on you snowfire i thought the hatchling was in your charge you are supposed to feed hatchlings dont you know that are you trying to stunt his growth through starvation so that you will no longer be the runt of this pack of humans ayshen swiftly tore one of the steaming loaves in half then tore each half in half lengthwise onto two of the quarters he laid juicy slices of venison he carved from a roast over one of the fires knife flashing in his blinding speed he topped the meat with some mouthwatering concoction of his own made of finely chopped herbs wild garlic and watercress from a set of nested simmering pots then he restored the top quarters of each and handed one to each of them darian took his gingerly unable to take his eyes from the hertasis lizardlike face ayshen was a kleshya hertasi and did not suffer from the painful shyness shared by all of the pelagirs hertasi including his mate so he was neither offended nor alarmed by darians reaction the boy has never seen one of us eh ayshen chuckled no worries i mind me the time i saw my first haighlei i thought my eyes would pop out of my head to me the idea that you humans had hide colors that wildly different just set my brain afire he turned to darian and cleared his throat to hearth bed and bread be welcome he said in slow and uncertain valdemaran darian jumped but held onto his meal with both hands and made an awkward little bow thanks be to the keeper of the house my hand is at his service he replied in the formal manner ayshen chuckled tell him he shouldnt have said that i need a dishwasher today you were on the roster but with that bad arm you cant lift pots its probably why you got the wound as an excuse snowfire obediently translated and a slow smile crept across darians face i wouldnt mind if he really needs the help the boy said shyly i used to do all the dishwashing for justyn and i could pay you back a little by taking your place the glance he gave snowfire had more than a shadow of hero worship to it but snowfire knew how to deal with that if you have no problem in taking my place i would be grateful he replied and made a face on the whole i dont mind washing dishes its preferable to a lot of other camp chores that i wont escape because of my bad arm and i will miss out on the special treats ayshen keeps for his helpers the ploy worked he not only established that he was grateful to darian for volunteering but that the job of dishwasher brought with it some extra rewards it was arranged that darian would report to ayshen after the evening meal with a bit of trial they determined to both of their satisfaction that ayshen could direct the boy with a bit of mime and a great deal of pointing that certainly went well snowfire thought with satisfaction as he led darian off in the direction of the dyheli grazing grounds he is resilient i must give him credit for that now that he has the concept of nonhuman partners planted in his mind ill show him the next set darian had hardly known what to think when he first saw the hertasi cook ayshen the creature had looked at least at first so very much like the horrible thing that had been leading the enemy fighters but snowfire hadnt been afraid of ayshen and the hertasi himself had been very kind as ayshen had put together a lunch for the two of them and as darian had gotten over his fright enough to look closely at him it was obvious that he wasnt very much like the enemy thing at all darian found himself volunteering to act as a dishwasher and even more surprising found himself looking forward to the task at least now he would be able to accomplish something useful here it was so odd though feeling an urgent need to be useful so whats a hertasi anyway he asked snowfire around a mouthful of bread they are so we believe one of the creations of that same great mage who ended the mage wars snowfire replied as you saw they are descended from lizards and they share many characteristics with lizards cold sends them into a stupor and extreme cold could kill or injure them very badly they act more or less as our helpers they cook and clean for us make clothing act as the assistants for artisans when they are not themselves artisans as well in return we give them the protection of our vales and scouts and things that they need they tend to live in colonies although they take single mates they are one of the five nonhuman races that we tayledras associate and work with five darian could hardly believe it there are five kinds of of things that you have around your vales as equal partners and helpers and not always in the vales the tervardi or birdpeople the kyree or furbrothers and the dyheli or straighthorns usually live outside our vales the hertasi and the gryphons in our vales entwine their lives with ours the others live entirely separate lives from ours and only become partners with us where there are specific tasks that are better done with all our peoples snowfire was so matteroffact about this as if he were telling darian how the hawkbrothers arranged to get things from traders or worked with the valdemaran guard darian found his head swimming first twolegged intelligent lizards and now this in fact snowfire was continuing we have dyheli with us as well as hertasi on this journey they have volunteered in token of their separate alliance with valdemar to act as our mounts and burden bearers selenay has offered in light of the fact that they are grazers and most of the pelagirs are forested to sponsor colonies of dyheli into some of the unused grazing lands on the western border and our dyheli are also along as scouts to investigate this possibility we could say that as grazers they wish to find if the lands and available grasses and plants suit their tastes darian giggled at the word play what what do these dyheli look like darian asked i mean ive heard stories about some of the things in hawkbrother lands but ive never seen any snowfire smiled that my friend you are about to see for yourself look there he pointed as they came around another of the ubiquitous vine curtains and there in a sunny meadow was a small herd of something vaguely like deer with ghostlike coloration of pale beige and cream at least they had four legs hooves and two delicately curved unbranching horns on their heads but the heads themselves were much larger than that of a deer the enormous brown eyes looked more forward than a deers did but the biggest difference was in the shape of the skull a small and delicate muzzle comparatively speaking but an elongated cranium something that could easily contain a brain the size of a mans as he and snowfire stood at the edge of the clearing every dyheli head came up the humans were examined closely but swiftly and then every dyheli head came down again back to the important business of grazing darian blinked at them in awe he was no stranger to the concept of an intelligent fourlegged creature after all he was a native of valdemar and youd have to have the brains of a wheel of cheese not to know all about companions but these creatures were so different do they talk he asked in a whisper not like the hertasi do came the reply the dyheli speak mindtomind some of us find it difficult to speak to them as some of us are better at mindspeech with nonhumans than others snowfire smiled down at him i happen to be one of the lucky ones i find it as easy to speak with them as i do with you easier in fact for i am not translating into a foreign tongue darian turned his attention back to the dyheli i wonder if i could learn to talk to them he mused out loud why not simply try because i dont know if i can he began then realized that snowfire had not spoken aloud in fact the voice he had heard had been entirely in his mind and had not been snowfires one of the dyheli had raised his head again and was walking toward them his eyes centered on darian the delicate creature had no expression to read but the voice in darians head was warm and amused it is a great advantage to speak this way little brother the dyheli stag said to him it requires no translators and it is very very difficult to lie or be lied to it tends to make all things level as it were darian stared up into the stags huge brown eyes and didnt realize that he was holding his breath until his lungs began to ache belatedly he took a gasping breath of air as snowfire chuckled at his expression tyrsell tends to be a bit more direct than i do he told darian i would have waited to test you for mindspeech but his approach is to simply try it and see if you can hear him well i suppose this means that now i shall have to teach you to use that gift oh not immediately his natural shields are good enough to hold for now the stag replied lazily and if it comes to that im as good a teacher as you are better maybe ive had more practice at it are you volunteering snowfire asked as darian felt his mind reeling under this latest revelation why not the boy could use a competent teacher the stag replied teasingly actually and more honestly young darian you need a teacher with a little less to attend to than our friend snowfire i have more time to spare than he the stag lifted his head to look up into snowfires face but i think snowfire that it would be a good thing if you let me give darian your language now it would be better for him if he did not require a translator then for several moments the stag and snowfire looked into each others eyes and darian sensed that they were exchanging words that he couldnt hear snowfire was frowning as if he didnt agree with what was being said finally though the hawkbrother sighed and nodded darian he said carefully i was going to work a very small magic that would allow you to understand our tongue but as my friend and herd leader has just reminded me he can do the same thing without magic and with fewer problems but there are some things that will also happen that you might consider problems like what darian asked immediately having people talking over his head and not being able to understand them had been making him very frustrated although he had been too polite to say anything it might hurt a little it will definitely be a shock to your system you might get some of his memories as well or mine since he will be taking the language of the tayledras from my mind theyd probably crop up in your dreams and they might be disturbing you already know that i am used to fighting my friend is also a warrior he has to be or he couldnt lead the herd and he knows how to use his weapons snowfire glanced at the dyhelfs horns significantly i dont care i mean id really like it if he could do that darian said quickly just at the moment the idea that he might finally be able to understand all the people chattering around him made him almost sick with longing then look into my eyes young one the dyheli commanded and without another thought darian obeyed time slowed then stopped he came to himself lying flat on the grass gazing up at the blue sky feeling very much as if someone had kicked his feet out from underneath him i did warn you snowfire said holding out a hand to help him up and as darian took it and clambered clumsily to his feet lightning flashes and glitter dancing in his eyes he suddenly realized that the language had not been valdemaran so you did he agreed and to his delight he realized a moment later that he had replied in the hawkbrother tongue without thinking about it he felt the back of his head gingerly but the ground had been nicely cushioned with grass and there was no knot on his skull which was a good thing he did have a headache though which felt as if someone had taken the top off his skull looked inside stirred the contents up a bit and then replaced the skull top and left him lying in the grass are you quite all right snowfire asked him with concern i think so but ive got a headache he admitted as he rubbed his temples it doesnt seem to want to go away then he realized that he had not yet thanked tyrsell and he flushed thank you very much sir he said turning hastily to the waiting dyheli and bowing a little i hope i dont sound as if im complaining because im not being able to understand people he groped for words being able to understand people will prevent you from feeling like such an outsider the stag said smoothly you have quite enough troubles without that added to your burden being able to understand their words will help you to understand them and you are quite welcome be sure to come to me when you have time for a lesson in mindspeech until then i hope you learn to enjoy being among us it is the way of a herd to encompass and support darian said that he would reflecting that at least a dyheli would not be able to smack his fingers with a rod like the widow clay who had taught him his letters had the stag nodded and moved back toward his herd flowing over the grass in a way that hardly resembled walking darian steadied himself against snowfire for a few long minutes his head felt compressed twisted and then expanded again to a size larger than his skin could hold there were words for things he had never seen inside his mind now and images associated with rituals and crafts and trees and plants and women and men and clothing and tools and names for all of them there were even some images of things he did not want to understand and a few that he didnt think he was quite old enough for there were even names for tastes he had never tasted and feelings his body had never known darian would have felt disassociated and frightened enough to scream if it werent for the effect of hopeful wonderment these new words were having upon him so many great things had now touched him and were a part of him and there was a spark inside him now that he had names he wanted to learn the meanings well if you have a headache snowfire said gently after a few minutes then this will be a good excuse to go find nightwind and introduce you to the third species that is with us on this expedition snowfire patted him on the shoulder and rubbed at darians back a bit companionably nightwind can get you a soothingpotion and you can meet kelvren whos kelvren darian asked both curious and a little apprehensive his headache had subsided from the worst disorientation and he tried to remember what the other nonhuman races were that snowfire had mentioned one was kyree and one was tervardi oh i think youll like him a great deal snowfire said with a chuckle though you mustnt let him intimidate you he wont try to intimidate you it is simply that sometimes his people do just by being themselves kelvren is a gryphon five snowfire had been struck speechless when tyrsell offered to give darian the tayledras language just what is he planning here he asked himself not with any suspicion that tyrsell intended any kind of wrong but because of what that gift would entail for one thing snowfire certainly hadnt expected the dyheli to make any such offer and for another it was definitely an offer of far more than appeared on the surface what do you think youre doing he asked the stag not that this isnt a great deal more expedient but the boy has no idea what this is going to mean to him that is precisely why i suggested it tyrsell replied calmly blinking as lazily as if he had suggested a change of grazing spots in this case it is quite true that although what he does not know about what well have to do is not going to hurt him what he doesnt know about the mindgifts is and if by taking a few shortcuts we can keep his own budding abilities from harming him and not so incidentally us wheres the wrong the wrong is in the deception snowfire told him severely youre deceiving him into thinking this is something very simple what deception he wont care about what we have to do to put the knowledge in his mind hes only interested in the results tyrsell as was the case with most of the dyheli had a slightly different perspective on morality than humans did to snowfires mind this was one of the twoedged swords of being allies with nonhumans dyheli focused on expediency hertasi saw no harm in meddling in private affairs because hertasi had no such thing as a private affair and gryphons were downright bloodyminded at times and he is rightly concerned only with results too tyrsell continued we know that the fact is that well have to establish links and shields in order to get that knowledge into him but thats of no concern to him he could care less and since those links and shields are not only not going to harm him but are actually going to help him i think that the fact that weii have to put them in place without his actual consent is irrelevant snowfire couldnt put into words why he objected to the dyhelis highhanded assumption that mucking about with someone elses mind didnt matter as long as the results were good but he sent his feelings about it as forcefully as he could tyrsell remained calm switching his tail to ward off some troublesome flies as he continued to bombard snowfire with impersonal logic his eyes warm and serene above the dark cheekstripes that made his face look like a painted mask lets look at this from the position of efficiency can you really afford the time effort and energy it would take to give him the language magically of course not can you keep shepherding him around and translating for him thats equally absurd can you explain to him what links and shields are in a way heii understand right now given that you are not only working with someone who doesnt have the understanding of mindgifts but are having to translate from your language to his not a chance so by doing this you free yourself for other work you give him some muchneeded autonomy and you keep him from being overwhelmed if his gift of mindspeech suddenly decides to develop what would you what could you do if it decided to flower overnight at a time when you were off on a scouting sortie or trying to fend off those barbarians expect wintersky to take care of it hes barely into controlling his own mindspeech as it is leave it to stariall and just how is he supposed to hold the matrices at the same time nightwinds mindspeech is rudimentary she hasnt the tools to teach a beginner and who else is there he will trust snowfire frowned but he had to admit that tyrsell was right you come perilously close to amorality he told the dyheli never my morality is just that of the herd that the herd is more important than a single member and when it comes to it your morals are the same didnt you just say that if it would save the world from another maar you wouldnt hesitate to sacrifice yourself and the boy and anyone else tyrsell held his head up and looked snowfire right in the eyes challenging him stallion to stallion daring him to deny what he had told starfall not more than a few moments ago i said id sacrifice volunteers he replied weakly but tyrsell had him and they both knew it you win he admitted this time and next time you may now that the challenge was over tyrsell was perfectly amiable again dont worry so much about winning arguments my friend concentrate on keeping the herd intact and in good health darian was pathetically eager to have the ability to understand those around him and from the little snowfire could sense from him he would have been willing to get it at almost any cost that soothed his raw conscience a little after hed given his immediate consent the boy waited expectantly eyes focused on tyrsells for the magic to happen get ready to catch him the dyheli warned and reached out to seize the boys mind this was the greatest gift the herd leaders had the ability to overwhelm any mind not heavily shielded and many that were without any damage to that mind whatsoever this was how a herd leader could guide his frightened followers to safety when they were hysterical with terror and unable to think or reason he could seize as many as a dozen minds at once or even more and use those he controlled to guide the rest of the herd behind him dyheli never seemed to resent this perhaps because herd morality was as deeply a part of them as individuality was for tayledras this was how the herd leaders were chosen instead of grappling horntohorn as their distant ancestors had they fought mindtomind and the strongest mind or the one with the most endurance won the right to father the next generation and guide this one a moment later snowfire caught the child as he collapsed all his joints suddenly gone loose every muscle limp he laid darian down carefully in a spot of sun on the grass and lowered all his own shields joining his mind as intimately to tyrsells as he ever had to hweels more so perhaps since that melding was so natural a part of a dyhelis mind with the two of them working as one the speed with which they built temporary shields around darians mind was literally that of thought then snowfire formed a deep link to darian below the level of thought itself so deep that the boy would never know it was there and never detect any difference in the way he felt while he held that link wide open tyrsell went to work on snowfires memories the herd leader extracted not only the language of the tayledras but the knowledge of the language and placed it carefully into the boys own memories building it up from the level just above instinct the way that a baby learns now darian would not have to think to translate he would have the tayledras tongue as if he had been bilingual from his very first word in this fashion tyrsells way was infinitely better than the spell and mindtouch that snowfire had used to learn valdemaran snowfire made a mental note to one day ask darian once the boy really knew what he was consenting to to allow tyrsell to reverse the process and give snowfire such a sure knowledge of the language of valdemar tyrsell was swift and certain there was something about the way that a dyhelis mind worked that when they had tyrsells particular gifts made them instinctive geniuses at laying in languagepaths in the time it took snowfires heart to take three slow beats tyrsell was done he withdrew his mind first leaving snowfire to close all but the deeplink path behind him and setting the shields he had laid in place to fade as the boy took over his own shielding needs darian would hear and understand any deliberate mindtouch on the part of any dyheli or tayledras but no one could force his mind open or really do anything other than talk with him and darian would never hear unwanted thoughts intruding on him if his ability to mindhear suddenly became more than the closerange rudimentary ability he had now as snowfire withdrew and made some swift observations of the boys potential gifts he realized that such a thing was far more likely than he had thought when tyrsell first proposed this operation perhaps it was the sheer number of traumas that the boy had passed through but well going abruptly from normal to wide open was a very real possibility and it was a good thing that snowfire had the deeplink in place at that level he would not eavesdrop on the boys private thoughts but he would know if darian was in distress he would know if any of the boys potentials suddenly opened up and he would be able to track darian if he somehow got separated from the tayledras encampment tyrsell had certainly noticed the same things and very diplomatically did not say i told you so a neat piece of work was all he said and about that moment the boy awoke probably with a splitting headache still snowfire thought not without sympathy the spell would have given him as bad a headache and maybe worse darians words and actions confirmed that diagnosis but he still remained polite enough despite the pain to thank tyrsell for his efforts snowfire noted with pleasure that he spoke tayledras with the unconscious ease of a native tyrsell lost all interest in the boy now that the work was complete that too was typical of dyheli and because snowfire was used to it he wasnt at all offended darian was too preoccupied with his headache to notice what could have been considered very rude behavior but was really only more dyheli expediency but the boy all but forgot the pounding in his skull when snowfire told him that he was about to meet a gryphon a gryphon darian asked incredulously his eyes lighting up with absolute delight a real gryphon here a real gryphon snowfire told him smiling a little at his wide eyes nightwind is only incidentally acting as our healer her main job is to be kelvrens trondiirn since that word was not tayledras but kaledain and not part of the language as darian had learned it snowfire explained it a trondiirn is a special attendant for nonhuman creatures although usually it is only the gryphons who need such help they do all the things that the gryphons cannot it is very difficult for gryphons to manage fine manipulations with talons for instance and they take care of the little ailments that nonhumans fall prey to because they understand these things so well if they are attending to only one nonhuman they often double as the healers for small expeditions such as ours back in the times of long ago a trondiirn would often manage the needs of a very large group of gryphons or other nonhumans but that is no longer the case darian nodded earnestly but it was very obvious that his mind was not on nightwind and her duties is he really as big as they say he asked eagerly is he really as big as a house can he really fly does he eat whole horses in a bite snowfire chuckled oh gryphons are not as large as all that but if they spread their wings wide i think it is safe to say that their wingspan is easily as big or bigger than a house and although they do not eat whole horses in one bite they do eat quite a lot kelvren has to do a great deal of hunting to keep himself supplied with meat can he talk darian asked next practically skipping in eagerness to see the marvel will i hear him thinking at me like tyrsell no he speaks tayledras very well although he tends to have what we call a gryphonic accent youll see what that means in a little snowfire patted the boys shoulder he really is looking forward to meeting you by this time they had wound their way back to the clearing and as snowfire made that last statement a deep voice spoke from the shelter of a shadowy bower immediately ahead of them ah but isss the young gentleman quite prrreparrred to meet me a deeper shadow rose out of the rest and strolled forward into the sunlight then posed perfectly in the best possible light kelvren looked truly magnificent and knew it darians eyes widened and he stared at kelvren with all the fascination of a kaledain messengerbird with a shiny new toy darian had not yet gotten used to the wonder of being able to talk to snowfire in the hawkbrother tongue without having to think about it when a deep resonant voice speaking out of the shadows just ahead of them captured all of his attention he and snowfire were standing in a rare patch of brilliant sun in the middle of the clearing that he had been taken to for the meeting ahead of them the shadows were so deep and black by contrast that he might have been peering into a well when he tried to make out who or what was speaking the contrast defeated him ah said the voice a rumbling bass with odd overtones but isss the young gentleman quite prrreparrred to meet me a moment later part of the darkest shadow detached itself from the rest and moved forward into the sun and although it was not as big as a house it was entirely large enough to satisfy darian the creature that moved into the sunlight was a glistening golden brown with a hint of metallic gold at the edges of each of his perfectlydefined feathers his head broad and handsome with jaunty eartufts had a definite eagle look about it and at a guess the folded wings would easily span the length of a house if not more both front and rear feet ended in formidable talons each as long as darians hand he sported a wide leather collar adorned with delicate scrollwork attached to an equally handsome bodyharness with a chestplaque the front yoke of which had a matching leather pouch attached as he stared down at darian looking every bit as haughty and regal as darian could have wished he took the boys breath away he was in every way a wonder and darian could not have taken his eyes off of him if the earth had fallen away beneath the boys feet once he had come fully into the sun the gryphon didnt move which was probably just as well darians heart was pounding with excitement and he had a shivery feeling as he looked at that huge beak and those cruel talons that his excitement could easily turn to fear i think youve made a conquest kel snowfire laughed his eyes crinkling at the corners with merriment asss it ssshould be the gryphon replied raising his head a bit higher with such unconcealed vanity that darian too was startled into a laugh and the gryphon joined in their laughter proving that he was not unaware of his vanity and the absurdity of it darian this is kelvren skothkae who is an unranked gryphonscout of the full kvala gryphonwing snowfire told him his eyes sparkling kel this is darian firkin kvaldemar unranked kelvren replied cocking his head to one side speculatively perrrhapsss now but i think ourrr wingleaderrr had bessst look to hisss posssition or think about rrretirrring i intend to make a grrreat name forrr myssself on thisss expedition youve certainly said so often enough snowfire teased and kelvren snapped playfully in his direction then turned his head pointedly toward darian pretending to ignore snowfire the boy found himself the focus of those huge piercing eyes and suddenly understood why rabbits froze when hawks caught sight of them and what think you of ourrr little family the gryphon asked arrre we all you had thought we would be when you thought of tayledrrrasss more darian was able to say honestly and with unfeigned enthusiasm i i think that youre all just just unbelievable he shook his head carefully to avoid making the headache any worse and you sir youre just like seeing an amazing tale come right to life in front of me i never thought id ever get to see a real gryphon in my whole life and i never ever thought a gryphon would be as as as wonderful as you are rrreally the gryphon purred and darian could tell that he was very pleased he even preened a little well thank you i hope i can jussstify that impresssssion you could prove how great a tracker you are by finding nightwind snowfire suggested with a twitch of his mouth that showed he was trying hard to keep from laughing pah that takesss no trrracking kelvren replied dismissively you will find herrr at the pool wherrre i left herrr i believe ssshe is waiting forrr you and wissshesss to sssee thisss obssserrrvant young brrrancherrr and you are you coming with us snowfire asked i am ssstarrrved and if we arrre to underrrtake that sorrrtie tonight i mussst eat now ssso i am crrroplight but enerrrgizsssed with that the gryphon spread his wings which were even larger than darian had imagined as snowfire took darians shoulder and pulled the boy back to the edge of the clearing kelvren made one or two experimental wingbeats that sent wind whipping around both of them then leaping grandly into the air with a thrust of his wings that was vastly more powerful than his trial the gryphon took off creating a veritable whirlwind within the confines of the clearing and sending dust and stray leaves surging into the sky in his wake darian stared after him with his mouth dropping open in amazement wings pumping rhythmically the gryphon surged up above the treetops then vanished above the foliage snowfire laughed then patted him on the shoulder he did that for your benefit you know the hawkbrother said with amusement he could very easily have gone to the mouth of the valley and taken off from there in fact it would have taken him a lot less effort but gryphons seem to love to impress an audience and you are the only one of us who isnt used to seeing him take off and land i wouldnt be the least bit surprised if he tries to find out where you are before he comes in for a landing and arranges to make a dramatic entrance in front of you are all gryphons like that darian asked still dazzled most of them endlessly cheerful considerably vain but able to make fun of themselves oh and beautiful of course but we try not to say that too often in front of them theyre conceited enough as it is snowfire chuckled his shoulders shaking a little darians eyes began to water from staring so long into the bright blue of the sky and his head throbbed in protest he moved quickly back into the shadows and snowfire must have noticed the grimace of pain he couldnt repress for the hawkbrother gestured him to take a particular path leading out of the clearing and set off down it himself darian followed him willingly now recalling that snowfire had said something about nightwind having some way of getting rid of that pounding ache the way that the paths here twisted and turned around little groves and vinecovered huts and tiny water gardens made him very confused and made this place seem much larger than it probably actually was it was very bewildering and darian had quite lost his way when they came out into sunlight again at the side of the smaller of two pools of water this was clearly the end of the valley a short cliff cut out of the rocks of the hills rose before them with steep treecovered slopes on either side a spring emerged from the rock at the base of the cliff feeding the two pools and a stream which led from them into the tangle of the tayledras encampment one of the pools was considerably smaller than the other being just large enough for say a gryphon to bathe in this is where you will bathe snowfire said pointing to the smaller pool you see the sluice there lift the lever when you are done and the dirty water will drain away then drop it and lift that lever and new water will flow into the pool from that larger one dont worry about trying to find bathing things just come here and start to undress a hertasi will see you and there will be soap and towels beside you before you are finished disrobing your clothing will disappear as if by magic and clean clothes will be waiting for you when you are done bathing snowfire smiled at his expression of surprise now you see why we hate to travel without our hertasi friends i dunno darian said dubiously looking down at the pool and then out at the spring that fed it it looks awfully cold of all the things he hated most he hated cold baths which was mostly all he got since everybody else in the village had precedence over him at the bathhouse ah i forget you cannot heat your water with magic or can you snowfire looked at him quizzically he shook his head and regretted doing so almost at once as his head protested not that justyn ever taught me he replied well can you call fire the hawkbrother persisted at darians cautious nod he looked satisfied it is the same only spread out over the water and not concentrated on the kindling i would ask you to try it but i think you had better wait until i find where nightwind has gone he peered around the clearing and then left darian to nurse his head beside the pool while he went off to investigate some of the places at this end of the valley that were not immediately visible darian stared at the surface of the pool and wondered why on earth justyn had never taught him how to heat water it would have made a great many winter baths more bearable but maybe he didnt know how darian told himself trying to be fair i mean it could be that only the hawkbrothers know about this sort of thing it isnt all that logical to think you can use the same magic that calls fire to heat up water fire and water are opposites right so maybe it wasnt his fault he didnt know just then snowfire appeared parting the trailing branches of a huge willow and holding them aside to let nightwind pass through them of all of the hawkbrothers that darian had seen thus far she was the only one who didnt have snowwhite hair or hair dyed in patterns of pale cream and various shades of brown her hair was as black as a ravens feather and she wore it in a heavy knot at the nape of her neck with little wisps escaping from it her eyes set under a pair of brows as curved as a falcons wings were a darker blue than the others and her skin was just a few shades duskier her clothing was a bit different too nothing he could put a finger on since he hardly cared what he wore from one day to the next but something he definitely noticed and on the breast of her tunic was a peculiar silver badge rather like the wings and head of a bird of prey he thought perhaps he had seen it before and then he realized that he had in the center of the chestpiece of kelvrens harness perhaps it signified that they werent actually hawkbrothers but were his new memories supplied the word kaledain she had a basket over one arm and a friendly smile on her lips and held out one hand to him which he took in reflex i dont know if you recall me from last night she said her speech betraying a faint accent as opposed to the way his new memories told him that tayledras should sound im nightwind in case youve forgotten or this ruffian forgot to mention my name and i understand you have one demonrending headache well he said feeling suddenly shy it does hurt i can certainly understand that she replied and put her basket down to take his face in both hands turning his eyes into the light and examining them yes indeed i can certainly understand that however i think i have a remedy for you itll taste vile but it will work she let go of him to rummage in her basket as he had to laugh a little at her honest directness i like your claim better than justyns he always said that his potions wouldnt taste that bad and the more he said that the worse theyd taste you can do that to younglings a few times before they stop believing you and then youll never get them to take their medicine she replied holding up a stoppered clay bottle with a little frown i always say things will taste worse than they do and then theyre always surprised follow that up with a honeycandy or a bit of other sweet and they take their doses without much of a fuss she paused to uncork the bottle and sniff this is what i want she looked at him and smiled are you going to need a sweet after your dose not unless that stuff is going to linger in my mouth all day he replied as manfully as he could not after a good drink of cold water she handed him the bottle take a good stout mouthful and swallow it fast he held his breath braced himself and did as he was told the stuff wasnt as bad as some of justyns potions many of which seemed to contain mycofoetida but it was very strongtasting more sour than bitter with an astringent bite he swallowed it before he had a chance to gag and found she was holding out a cup full of water ready to exchange it for her bottle he drained it and passed it back to her she tucked it and her bottle back into her basket well she asked how bad was it not as bad as i thought but gleah nothing id drink for pleasure he shuddered how did you make that stuff anyway justyn always brewed teas and tisanes this is tea concentrated so one swig is as good as a cupful she told him these concentrated versions have to be pretty fresh but things like the headache potion are needed often enough that theyre used up before they go weak i also make some preparations distillations as well as decoctions with spirits of wine as the carrier but those tend to be very powerful and snowfire added helpfully they taste so much worse that none of us ever want to drink them unless we absolutely have to i i think id like to learn how you make them darian said a little surprised at himself and feeling his ears heat up as they reddened with embarrassment maybe i can help then id be happy to show you nightwind promised looking a bit surprised at him herself i always like to have extra medicine on hand and i never have enough time to make all that i want now i want you to sit down for a moment until that medicine takes effect i dont think youll have an unusual reaction but its better to wait a moment and see darian obeyed although he didnt expect to feel anything more than he did with justyns medicines he just hoped this potion would make some of the pain go away quickly without slowing him down too much justyns potions generally didnt do too much unless he drank so much he went from sick to asleep without much warning at the moment it felt as if someone inside his skull was trying to pound his way out look snowfire said pointing up at the sky theres a gyre it must be one of ours its too big to be one of the wild ones around here darian followed his pointing finger squinting until he made out the grayandwhite bird against the grayandwhite clouds a dot moving so fast that darian wondered how snowfire could tell it was a forestgyre much less that it was bigger than the wild ones are the wild ones around your vale as big as the bondbirds he asked with surprise most of them are bondbirds or of bondbird stock anyway snowfire replied still watching the bird shading his eyes with his hand there are usually far more birds around the vales than there are people to bond with because we need a large breeding pool of each species to keep the stock healthy the adult birds are polite to us though rather standoffish unless as adults they decide that they want to bond rather than continuing to be wild sometimes that happens especially in the larger species like eagleowls and hawkeagles he winced and goddess help us bondbird eagles themselves we have two species of eagles that are bondbirds the black and the golden and a colormorph of the golden that looks red they almost never bleach out white since ive never known an adeptclass mage to fly one not too many people of any sort fly eagles for that matter not too many can carry one they arent as greatly oversized proportionately as the smaller species bondbird merlins are about the size of wild tiercel peregrines just as an example but they are very very big and heavy there is one and i mean one kvala tayledras who flies a black eagle and hes the blacksmith that should tell you something darian thought about the shoulders on the smith at errolds grove and how much he could carry and lift and nodded solemnly he tried to picture carrying a bird bigger than hweel and couldnt it must be like carrying a barrel of flour on your shoulder he thought how does someone get a bondbird then he asked curiously not that he thought hed ever get one but it was more likely than being chosen by a companion either an adult picks you out or more often the adult parents pick you as the bondmate for one of their offspring if the adults are bonded to someone they let that person know who the eyas is going to and if that person has experience with downy baby birds very often they coparent with the eyass new bondmate if not they wait until the little one is fledged and lead him to you snowfire turned his attention from the sky to smile at darian thats how i got hweel he blundered down out of a tree behind his parents landed tail over head fluffed all his feathers and told me with the solemnity of a kalenedral that he was ready for me does anybody have more than one bondbird darian asked wishing he could have seen that moment sometimes one of us has an owl and a merlin for day and night scouting i know of someone with a whole flock of ravens and there are others and sometimes your bondbirds mate may decide she wants to bond with you too snowfire raised an eyebrow hweel says his mate is considering it bonding with me that is hweel has a mate darian replied feeling oddly excited at the idea though he didnt know why where is she back at the vale teaching the youngster to hunt i wouldnt have left if there were still young in the nest but by the time we were ready to go the young one was fledged eagleowls lay their eggs in deep winter theyre hatched and fledged by the time most birds are going to nest and once theyre no longer in the nest they dont need their father unless theres more than one to teach to hunt snowfire crossed his arms over his chest and gave darian a measuring look now youve spent plenty of time in the forest can you guess why theyd do things that way uh darian thought hard they build up for egglaying in fall when theres a lot of dumb young animals on their own for the first time then they sit the eggs in winter when there isnt quite as much to eat but they also arent going to have to eat as much then they have babies to feed in deep winter when there starts to be winterkills and coldkills lying around good snowfire applauded then obviously its a good time to teach the youngsters to hunt when there are litters of very young and extremely stupid young rats rabbits and squirrels about not to mention the odd snake or duckling do you have a bondbird darian asked nightwind curiously she broke into peals of laughter mercy no she managed after a moment trust me the gryphons are more than enough for any poor trondiirn to keep up with besides with my temperament id likely end up with something like a raven or a crow and a bird with that much mischief in him would never be able to resist snatching at gryphon eartufts and jewelry and there would never be any peace how is your head its fine he said in surprise realizing that his headache had vanished without his noticing thats good because you promised to help ayshen with washingup and hell be expecting you about now snowfire reminded him now youll be able to talk to him you might just go up and remind him of your promise and surprise him there isnt anything about the tayledras that ayshen doesnt know and there isnt anything that he isnt dying to gossip about nightwind interjected wryly with a tilt of her head so if there is anything you want to know and you feel awkward about asking one of us go ahead and ask him snowfire concluded with a wink darian gave a sigh of relief at that there were things he wanted to know but hed felt uncomfortable about talking to snowfire about them it wasnt that snowfire wasnt kind and it wasnt as if the things he wanted to know were at all personal it was just well they felt like stupid questions and he was embarrassed to ask them of snowfire i look bad enough with him having to rescue me and all he thought i dont want him thinking im so dumb that im going to be nothing but a bother to him if you want to get back to ayshen right now just follow the path and only take righthand turns nightwind added helpfully when youre done well by then the rest of the scouts will have thought over what youve already told them and i suspect someone will come fetch you for another round of questions and this time you wont feel as if theyre talking over your head darian beamed at her thank you he told her both for the directions to ayshens kitchen and for understanding how horrid it had been to hear all those people chattering away being certain they were talking about him and not being able to understand a word of it suddenly eager to find the gossiphungry hertasi and barrage him with a deluge of questions he shyly took his leave of both the adults feeling as if he had been freed from a leash he sped off down the path always taking the righthand turns until he found himself at his goal only a little winded the hertasi who was mixing something in a large bowl looked up at him in some surprise probably because very few people ever ran anywhere in this tranquilseeming place hello ayshen he said cheerfully taking great pleasure in the way the hertasis eyes widened with surprise at his perfect tayledras here i am just like i promised you and tyrsell are in a conspiracy over the boy i know it the two of you agreed to do something with him snowfire said trying not to sound too accusing as soon as the boy had run off just what have you two done to him and dont try to play the innocent with me no child whos just had his teacher go up in flames before his eyes and his entire village overrun by bloodthirsty barbarians can go running happily off to wash dishes darian had become cheerful too cheerful right after tyrsell laid in the tayledras language on his memory tyrsell was quite good enough to have meddled further with the boys memory without snowfire noticing snowfire had seen the change in the boys behavior at once he lost the haunted look that was in his eyes and started acting like a child on an adventure tyrsell has put a little forgetfulness loop in his mind at my suggestion nightwind told him with her usual forthrightness whenever he starts to get frightened anxious or stressed he will forget what he was getting upset about hell know that his mentor is dead objectively but when the memory of that fact starts to make him upset hell get distracted and then temporarily forget the fact its strictly a palliative and it will go away in a few days but we cant have a hysterical boy upsetting starfall you and other key people while youre deciding what to do about this situation furthermore as an empath and the only healer you have i cant devote all my time to him she looked him straight in the eye as challenging as the dyheli had been i went to tyrsell this morning before you saw him and suggested it that was why he was so eager to volunteer his services id wondered snowfire growled not at all happy with the way his opinions had been subverted i didnt see a choice she told him flatly with what wintersky called her take no prisoners expression my only other course of action was to keep him sedated and that would be very bad for him this way he has a chance to absorb the situation without thinking about it for a few days then try and come to terms with it gradually instead of all at once and by then you all should know more about whats going on youll be able to tell him where his people are and what valdemar is going to do about the attack hell be able to make some choices for himself with a reasonable amount of information and well see how hes fitting in and what were going to do with him snowfire knew he was going to have to accept whatever she told him shed done not only because it was already an accomplished fact but because he was not a healer and an empath and his opinions really didnt matter however having nightwind make the decision was a bit more palatable than tyrsell nightwind might primarily treat nonhumans but she herself was human and her reasoning came out of her human experience all right he said with resignation i can see why you decided the way you did and this is better than keeping him drugged and i know why you didnt ask me first because i would have argued with you and last night i was in no mood to argue with you my intentions were in the other direction entirely she grinned at him and fluttered her eyelashes coyly in a way that drew an unwilling laugh out of him as for the headache potion that was all it was now if you need to question him more about the attack snowfire interrupted her with a shake of his head i dont think so what well need are descriptions of the village where things are at least for now kel and hweel and i are going to do a little scouting there tonight just to see who and whats still there she nodded then there should be no problem his memories of the village before the attack are going to be perfectly clear just dont be surprised if he blanks out in describing the things he thinks are damaged hell probably completely forget the fact that the bridge was burned for instance she licked her lips and twisted a strand of hair around her index finger as she paused for a thought in fact hes very likely to act and talk as if the whole town is still intact so dont correct him i wont you say in his deeper thoughts hes still going to be aware of what happened though at her nod he sighed and gazed out over the pool for a moment collecting his thoughts if hes got it in his deeper memories those are what usually come out in dreams well we could be looking at some interrupted nights if he starts having nightmares if he does well move him into the bower and ill deal with it hell very likely have them and in some ways that would be good if he does they will mean hes absorbing and coming to terms with the experience on the deeper level she didnt seem at all adverse to having the boy in the bower the halfcave in the rocky cliff where she had built isolated facilities for those who were sick or injured well if she didnt mind having her sleep disturbed snowfire was not going to try to argue her out of it so he shrugged once again you are the expert i am not and much as i enjoy your company i have a scouts meeting to gather so go gather it she paused resting a hand against the side of his face and making him look deeply into her eyes so he could not miss her sincerity and her regret kechara if i didnt have to balance a potentially dangerous even explosive situation against this boys needs i wouldnt have made the decisions i have but if i didnt also have his welfare in mind i would have told you to pack him up and send him off with wintersky and a couple of dyheli to the nearest large settlement i think that for now at least he will be better treated among us now i must be off too so go find your scouts they parted with snowfire feeling a little better about darians welfare than he had been when it came right down to it the boy could not be in better hands its been a long day snowfire thought as he laced up his climbing boots by the light of the fire and its going to be a long night darian was safely asleep and so most probably were the current inhabitants of errolds grove it was time for that little scouting run little not so little ive never run a sortie against an army before but its not as if i dont have the experience to carry it off snowfire had been an active scout since he was a mere fourteen winters old although he hadnt been permitted in the field against human intruders for the first four years so how much different can they be i wonder than a large bandit gang across the fire from him nightwind was getting kelvren ready kelvrens eyes pinned with excitement the pupils contracting to a mere nothing then widening until there was nothing showing but pupil then contracting again in the firelight the effect was particularly striking his eyes looked as if they were flashing with a gilded light as his golden irises appeared and disappeared nightwind calmly tightened his harness at all points checking his gear making certain that the amplifying metal laceworkheadband of the teleson set was properly in place under the feathers on his head and that it wasnt going to distract him in any way kelvrens mindspeech wasnt particularly strong and this little bit of metal filigree that looked so much like one of his favorite ornaments would help him reach snowfire without effort snowfire was already outfitted for a nighttime sortie his costume of soft blacks and grays was much like his daylight scouting gear except for color or rather lack of it he had streaked his face with random stripes of blackandgray paint and before he braided it he had dusted his hair with a charcoalcolored powder that would cling until washed out he wore black gloves and soft black boots made for climbing his climbing staff was in its sheath on his back and his throwingdarts in a bandoleer across his chest there was a knife at his belt and another in each boot thin and incredibly strong rope with a grappling hook coiled in one pouch at his side a stranglingwire in another and a darker version of his leather armguard strapped in place over his clothing for hweel to land on in case he needed to he probably wouldnt snowfire intended to be up in the treetops and there should be plenty of places for hweel to land without choosing his arm a small herd of three dyheli waiting patiently at his elbow would carry him as far as the clearing where hed discovered darian or farther if it seemed safe that way he would leave no footprints a herd of animals would leave tracks that were much less suspicious than a single animal the plan called for the dyheli to wait for him at the clearing until he returned kel of course would fly leaving no tracks at all think youre ready for this nightwind whispered as she passed him crossing to kels left side to continue her checks he winked he knew what she meant he had made night sorties as a scout countless times but this was kelvrens first offensive act of war that was why the young gryphon was so excited he was about to prove his mettle and he could hardly wait to get into the air hweel by contrast was so utterly calm he seemed bored kel was as welltrained as any silver gryphon ever turned out by the kaledain and since nightwind seemed completely confident in his abilities snowfire was prepared to be just as confident after all she had been a silver for several years before kel even began his training shed seen a great many gryphons wear that stylized badge and she had once said that the silver gryphons had ways of weeding out the unsuitable a long time before they ever put on the badge and harness of a full silver nevertheless snowfire hoped that kelvren wouldnt wear himself out with excitement before they ever got to errolds grove snowfire gave his own equipment one last check swung himself up onto the back of sifyra and turned to kel ready partner he asked the gryphon gave a quick eager nod rrrready he replied waiting none too patiently for snowfires hand signal he launched himself skyward followed a moment later by hweel snowfires little group of sifyra and two mares followed at a careful trot dyheli had much better nightvision than horses but the dark shadows beneath the trees could easily hold unpleasant surprises there was no point in risking broken legs or ankles there was another reason for a more leisurely pace snowfire rode bareback since sifyra and the mares would pretend to be a set of wild grazers it would not do to have something as obviously unnatural as a saddlepad strapped to his back not for the first time snowfire wished silently that dyheli could manage the same smooth gaits as companions allegedly could like all dyheli sifyra had a prominent spine and snowfire expected to know the position and size of every vertebra in intimate detail before the ride was over one of his fellow scouts had once described the dyheli as backbones covered with hair balanced on four springs which was about as succinct a description as snowfire had ever heard if theyd been able to travel at a walk instead of a trot and if they hadnt been going into dangerous territory the ride would have been stunningly beautiful as impressive as these woods were by day at night they were far lovelier at least in snowfires opinion of course he could have been biased in that direction by flying an owl the moon was at its full and well up so soft silvery shafts of light pierced the canopy and illuminated patches of ground all around him the night was anything but still insects and frogs called or sang and an occasional bird pierced the forest with its call harsh or sweet other birds high overhead called complainingly as their sleep was disturbed and bats flitted like bits of the darkness itself in and out of the shafts of moonlight chasing the moths drawn to dance there snowfire was also aware of two other minds linked with his own the everpresent dignity of hweel and the unfamiliar exuberance of kel were waiting for you at the clearing kel sent back and snowfire sensed that he and hweel were perched side by side in the concealing boughs of a great tree on the farther side theres no sign of any trouble or any guards hweel confirmed kels observation without words turning his head and peering through the darkness so that snowfire could see for himself it was very strange to look through the owls eyes from hweels point of view the place was as brightlylit as daylight although the colors were very faded the bondbirds eyes were so much keener than a humans that hweel had no trouble focusing on tiny details far below him on the ground the barbarians had packed up their two dead and left no real traces of the fight behind except for a bit of disturbed rock and scuffed earth hweels keen sight and hearing alerted him to the smallest movements and faintest of sounds even so small as a rat or a mouse would make so if there had been anyone left as a sentry out here hweel would have spotted him without any trouble so the barbarians had not posted watchers out this far from the village did that mean they had simply looted it and left i dont think so there wasnt enough there to loot i think they had some other purpose in coming there and that starfall is right about what that purpose is theyre here for power and perhaps to establish a stronghold here on the border of valdemar motive was irrelevant right now though he was out here to learn facts not speculate on motive go farther in he told hweel go in until youve spotted a sentry then come back here was another advantage of flying an owl sentries would neither hear nor see him and that meant hweel was never a target in nightstalks that gave him a degree of security that those who flew other birds didnt have hweel took off obediently snowfire stopped kel before he could follow wait for hweel to come back i want to get as near as i safely can before i take to the trees it might be easy for you two to flit about but im going to have to work to get in as far as the first sentry hweel returned in fairly short order and as sifyra paced swiftly through the trees snowfire let the dyheli set their own path as he concentrated on what hweel had seen he directed hweel and kel to move nearer to the village and gave sifyra the landmarks to look for just as they came to the edge of the rockstrewn clearing it seemed to his impatient soul to take forever to reach the tree where hweel and kel waited and he knew it seemed like twice that to them they were ready to go and kel probably felt that they hardly needed him well thats where those who are inexperienced differ from old hands im kels backup whether or not he thinks he needs one he pulled out his climbing staff as sifyra approached the giant trunk and swung the barkhook at the body of the trunk with his left hand as sifyra actually came alongside the hook bit solidly into the bark of the trunk and he pulled himself up and off sifyras back and onto the rough bark of the tree with his one good arm as his feet cleared sifyras back he sank his right palmcleat into the bark and used the rough soles of his climbing boots to further brace himself in place as soon as he had a palm grip and secure footing he swung the barkhook up for his next step and worked his way up the trunk like a treehare and nearly as fast because he had chosen a tree with rough bark he was able to keep most of his weight on his legs rather than his arms but by the time he got to where the others were perched his hair was damp with sweat and his muscles burning with fatigue kel and hweel were a pair of oddlyshaped shadows crouched together amid the warm semidarkness here in the boughs the other two were not too impatient when he reached their bough a branch as broad as a highway and as easy to walk on by that time sifyra and the mares had found a patch of grass and were pretending to graze on it with one wary eye out for hunters take me to where the first sentry is and ill stop there he told the other two then you can go on if something goes wrong for you and you cant fly i can take out the sentry before he knows theres anything going on and leave a hole in the line kel nodded that isss a good plan he acknowledged with a little surprise in his voice i had not thought of having to passs ssssentrrriesss on the grrrround hweel just roused his feathers ready to be off this time kel dropped off the bough first but hweel being smaller and more maneuverable among the branches was leading the gryphon before the latter had taken more than two wingstrokes hweel was actually guiding his bondmate as much as the gryphon now snowfire followed them by walking the treeroad balancing along the branches and moving from tree to tree by following hweel to the intersections of branches and jumping from one to the next with the aid of either his grappling hook and rope or his climbing staff it was easy enough to follow the boughs and when he needed a better look at a crossing he examined it through hweels eyes this in many ways was the part of his duties that snowfire lived for there was something about doing all this in neardarkness with the scent of bark and leaves all about him the sounds of insects and frogs far below that made all of his senses come alive he felt as if he could see with his skin and as he concentrated on the placement of each footstep it seemed as if he and the forest were a single living entity he had been doing this since he was old enough to walk as had most tayledras and he didnt even think about the risks anymore though occasionally kel would pause and perch to watch him the gryphons mind fairly radiating pleasure and surprise this was just something tayledras did and it was largely how they were able to travel undetected through the forest it was hard work certainly and required a great deal of planning and concentration more so since he had only one good arm but he was never afraid any more than he was when walking on the ground at this level in the canopy branches tended to intersect when they were about as big around as his waist they were still broad and easy to walk on with very little sway higher up well things would have been more of a challenge he was pleased that he detected the movement of a sentry on the ground below only a little later than hweel did he slowed at that moment and crept forward making no noise at all until he reached the trunk of the tree he was in then he settled down with his back to the trunk to wait concealed from detection from below by the bulk of the branch not that any barbarian would think to watch the tree canopy even if he heard a noise above him now hweel and kel went on as soon as snowfire was settled in place he closed his eyes and opened his senses to the owl concentrating most of his attention on what the bondbird heard and saw for a little while that consisted mostly of branches going past with occasional backward glimpses to make certain kel was following but then the growth up ahead vanished and hweel swooped up to land on a branch overhanging open fields a moment later kel landed beside him and the two of them looked down at the village of errolds grove there seemed to be very little damage only a single house a couple of barns and a handful of sheds were burned although those had been allowed to burn to the ground and there was nothing left of them but piles of blackened rubble with a timber or two sticking out of the ashes the bridge amazingly enough was still there at a single place in the middle the timbers of the floor had been replaced with a patch of newer wood obvious because it shone whitely in the moonlight evidently the fire that justyn had called had been put out before the bridge suffered much permanent damage there was no other sign of conflict hweel could not smell the remnants of smoke from the burnedout buildings for owls had no sense of smell but he could taste it in the back of his throat and he sneezed as it irritated his nostrils snowfire felt his own nose itch in sympathy there were a lot of horses in makeshift enclosures at one side of the town the houses were dark not a single light showing anywhere and from the chimneys a little smoke trailed out showing that the fires were banked until morning there were no tents no sleeping forms in bedrolls out in the open however there were more of those makeshift enclosures everywhere and they were full of livestock evidently the barbarians were all sleeping in houses barns and sheds displacing the animals into the open obviously they didnt care if the livestock broke loose or strayed during the night probably because those animals were all destined for the cookpot sooner or later to the conquerers of errolds grove those animals represented a resource for the present not the future the house nearest them looked as if it might have been justyns cottage unlike the rest it had no cottagegarden and it seemed to match what darian had told them about the place theres something odd over there kel swooped ahead of hweel intent on getting a closer look at whatever it was that hed spotted that was when the two things crawled out from an airspace beneath the very house at the edge of the village that snowfire had been examining through hweels eyes wyrsa snowfire warned kel but they werent wyrsa or not exactly they had a similar look to them as if someone had crossed a dog with a serpent getting something with a houndshaped body scaled skin with the head a melding of viper and canine with sulfuryellow eyes and fangs but the wyrsa snowfire knew had the look of emaciated greyhounds whereas these two well the big one was the size of a pony and had the blocky muscular look of a mastiff and the little one was the size and general configuration of a terrier whatever they were they didnt match the wyrsa that snowfire was familiar with furthermore they seemed to know exactly where kel was the little one started to make a kind of highpitched keening sound as it followed kels flight eyes gazing intently it trotted after the gryphon the bigger creature trailing behind the smaller continuing to emit the whining keen with every passing moment the sound grew louder and it would not be too long before the creatures masters heard it and came to see what the matter was kel looked down at the two creatures with some alarm and ducked into the forest canopy to try and lose them if i hide from them theyii probably lose interest in me and go away he told snowfire coming to a soft landing on a massive branch screened from view from below by foliage hweel swerved to follow them coming down from above kels perch they cant possibly smell me the winds not in their favor its in mine can wyrsa follow a scent snowfire watched them trotting along with the little one still making that annoying whiny noise evidently no one told them that theyre not supposed to be able to find you he suggested as the two creatures broke into a lope and wound up directly beneath kel looking up at him and yes wyrsa can follow a scent trail very well indeed kel suddenly slammed his shields up locking snowfire out of his mind with no warning whatsoever and flung himself off the branch in a steep dive snowfire slipped quickly into hweels head acutely aware of how helpless he was to stop the gryphon and he didnt even know what kel planned to do assuming he even had a plan through hweels eyes he saw the gryphon burst through the foliage at an angle so steep it looked as if kel was falling it took the two creatures below him completely by surprise too they both froze where they were for an instant and that was an instant too long at the last possible second the little one broke and ran leaving the bigger one to stand its ground that was the worst thing it could have done it gave kel the chance for a tailchase and the gryphon snapped open his wings so abruptly that snowfire winced knowing how much the move would hurt kel had made the classic aerial maneuver of trading height for speed fast as the little monster was and it was greyhoundquick kel was faster he hit it with outstretched talons and bound to it bringing it to the ground and pulling it to his beak before it could turn its own teeth or claws on him kel had snapped its neck and just to make sure it was dead gave it a doglike shake by now the bigger creature was charging kel from behind but this time snowfire could do something he had already directed hweel to attack the bigger creatures head and eyes even if those scales armored it the eyes would still be vulnerable and it would stop to protect them hweel went into a dive of his own intending to make a raking pass from behind he hit the creatures head just as it had covered about half the distance between the tree and kel hweels talons scraped across the scales without penetrating but the silent and unexpected attack from behind disoriented the creature and it stopped whirling to face whatever had struck it but of course hweel was already out of reach and his attack had given kel a chance to recover the gryphon launched into the air dangling the body of the smaller creature from his foreclaws pumping his wings laboriously for a few moments then going into a relatively shallow glide beneath the branches the larger creature snarled with rage and followed hweel followed it flying just above the lower branches kel glanced back over his shoulder to make sure the monster was still following him when it began to lag a little he dropped lower and slowed a bit dangling the body of the little creature tauntingly just out of reach that seemed to drive the big one insane with fury and it would redouble its efforts to reach him now kel opened his shields just a little and snowfire seized the advantage just what do you think youre doing he demanded trying not to project the thought with the edge of incipient hysteria that he certainly felt leading the big dog away so i can kill it quietly kel replied sounding amazingly cool i dont suppose anyone told you that wyrsa have poisonous fangs and claws did they he asked just before kel slammed his shields shut again locking him out he tried not to curse with frustration at least i got the warning in he consoled himself and continued to watch through hweels eyes he figured that kel would repeat the same dive and tail chase hed used to kill the little dog he didnt expect what kel actually did and neither did the big dog kel suddenly slowed and went for height again but at the top of his upwardreaching arc he flung the body of the little dog at the big dog with all of his strength snowfire had forgotten that the structure of the gryphons forelegs actually allowed him to throw things if he chose and certainly the big dog hadnt anticipated any such thing the carcass hit the larger animal deadon and sent it tumbling endoverend and then kel went into a dive if hed stayed on the ground to meet it the fight would have been equal with kel having the advantage of size but the big dog having the advantage of speed and poison but kel had no intention of getting within reach of those fangs and claws he made dive after raking dive pounding the thing with fisted talons that sent its head into the forest floor and raking it with open talons with enough speed behind him to penetrate even the tough scales that protected it dive after dive he made choosing to rake or strike based on what the monster itself was doing and how well it had recovered from the previous hit snowfire held his breath and even the normally stoic hweel was excited gripping the bough he had chosen with enough power to drive the talons through the bark and deep into the wood it began to seem as if the thing was indestructible it had taken a dozen blows that would have shattered the skull of a lesser creature and as many raking strikes that left furrows along its head and back wyrsa were known to be tough but this monster was tougher than any wyrsa that snowfire had ever fought now snowfire saw the wisdom of leading it away had this combat taken place anywhere near the village kel would have had an unwelcome audience in very short order whats he doing snowfire wondered fretting it was obvious to him that kel had a plan but what was it surely the gryphon could see for himself that his worst blows just werent having the effect he wanted in fact the monster had worked itself into the partial shelter of a bush and in a moment kel wouldnt be able to reach it at all abruptly kel did a wingover and another steep dive heading deliberately into the bush snowfire flung out a hand and stifled a cry of dismay kel crashed into the bush and brought it down on top of the creature pinning it completely to the ground with so many branches that it was unable to move at all kel stood up still atop the bush holding it and the creature pinned beneath it to the ground then in a manner that was almost insulting it was so casual he began breaking twigs and branches with his beak until he exposed the nape of the creatures neck he contemplated it for a moment as if choosing exactly the right place then his head darted forward savagely and he bit through scales hide and ultimately spine sawing with his beak until the spine was completely severed he stood atop the beast still until its final convulsions were over it took a very long time finally the body went flaccid and kel cautiously opened his shields again im sorry he said apologetically but behind the veneer of apology was a seething cauldron of satisfied bloodlust the euphoria of conquest the thrill of victory there is an old lesson of tadrith wyrsabanes first combat with a litter of changed wyrsa that could sense and eat magic when these followed me i suspected that they were following the scent of magic and i didnt want to give them a chance to get any farther than just the scent apology accepted snowfire replied immediately and congratulations you were truly magnificent i was wasnt i the reply was made with as much wonder as pride and snowfire chuckled under his breath well if hweel could come help carry the body of the little dog i can take the big dog and we can drop them somewhere that theyll never be found is wyrsa meat poisonous not that i know of snowfire told him after a moment of thought i never saw dead scavengers around the carcasses anyway then well dump them in a crotch up in the canopy kel decided immediately their masters will never find even a bone then and it will give the scavengerbirds a good meal or two so that was what they did he and hweel laboring heavily up into the canopy until they were well screened from the ground leaving the two bodies wedged tightly into forks in neighboring trees perhaps eventually bones would fall down but not until every scrap of flesh had been picked away or eaten by insects and larvae and by then the matter of their masters should have been settled afterward both owl and gryphon rested while they conferred with snowfire i honestly didnt see anything that would make me think there were still any villagers there kel told the tayledras as he cleaned the monsters blood fastidiously from beak and talons i will grant you we werent overhead long but i cant imagine where they would put the villagers if there were as many fighters as the boy thought snowfire thought back on the brief look that hed had through hweels eyes and tended to agree we know theyve fixed the bridge and that most of the buildings are still intact we know that the enemy is still in possession of the place because of all the horses we saw thats really what we came to find out if you want to go back im certainly ready kel sighed and spread wings which were probably starting to ache hed put his flying muscles through a great deal of abuse and just about now was when they would start to complain i think we ought he replied trying to sound reluctant i hate to admit it but im not good for much more oh i think you could rise to the occasion if you had to snowfire said encouragingly but i see no reason why you should have to you were mighty enough tonight lets go home very well kel replied and took off carefully gaining altitude until he was above the treetops snowfire began the slower process of making his way toward the clearing where the dyheli waited but kelvren could not contain his pleasure in silence you know i really was good tonight wasnt i snowfire sensed a certain wonder behind the boast and smiled definitely he replied with warmth too busy picking his way through the canopy to give a more elaborate reply but kel didnt seem to mind he was still intoxicated with success and mostly talking to himself i was kel sighed with content i really was six snowfire kept having to hide his smile the next day when he encountered kel the young gryphon was so pleased with himself not in any truly vain way but simply full of joy and astonishment at his own daring deeds he had probably been a great deal less sure of himself at the time than he had pretended in fact he reminded snowfire of a certain young tayledras after his first successful mission some few years ago it was odd how certain things transcended the boundaries of species nightwind of course had made a great fuss over kel over both of them actually but she was more demonstrative with kel so when after greeting the gryphon hed gone to her to ask her to make sure he hadnt done any damage to himself he also asked her why shed been so effusive i was beginning to think you were being a little too enthusiastic he told her you know the way doting mothers make a great fuss over a child whos done something perfectly ordinary i dont mean to try to teach you your job but kels old enough to see through that sort of thing gryphons especially young ones like kel are a lot more fragile than youd think she told snowfire as she checked his arm wound and rewrapped it they need a great deal of encouragement before they become secure in making their own judgments its a fledging sort of thing they really go through several stages of fledging and the most critical is in learning to trust their training and make their own decisions instead of waiting for orders from someone else she sealed down the end of the bandage with a firm finger he really was very clever to remember tadrith wyrsabane and the changed creatures he encountered i can promise you that not one in a dozen of the gryphons ive tended would remember a tale that old tadrith is ancient history and the young ones tend to dismiss history out of hand snowfire thanked her with a smile then stretched out along the rock rimming the larger pool to soak up the sun that was his prescription for muscles aching from his unbalanced climbing last night i think he may be trying to model himself off this tadrith he suggested its just a thought but the way he mindspoke the name suggested something of the sort to me last night nightwind unwound her hair from the knot at the back of her head and shook it free it fell in rippling waves to her waist i can certainly think of worse examples and gryphons that have tried to follow them well for one thing trying to model himself off skandranon would be a very bad thing to do we dont have any stories of skandranon as a young rash and fallible gryphon only those in which skandranon succeeds beyond anyones wildest dreams and pulls off another miraculous heroic coup by this time there is so much myth associated with the black gryphon that trying to emulate him would be impossible and failing would be devastating no he could do a lot worse than try to copy tadrith wyrsabane by the time tadrith was growing up white gryphon was well established and we have plenty of tales about how difficult it was for him to make a name for himself in his fathers shadow snowfire rolled over on his stomach and she began working on his back muscles without his having to ask he sighed with content and occasionally grunted in pain as her hands worked out knots and sore spots he decided to change the subject he really wasnt in the mood to discuss gryphonic myth about those little monsters yip dog and attack dog she said the terms were so strange he wasnt certain hed heard her correctly and craned his head around to give her a puzzled look she giggled at his expression thats what i thought of when kel described them to me the little one was like the small dogs one of the haileigh peoples created theyve made pampered spoiled pets out of a breed that was supposed to be alarmdogs very small very fast very annoying when they see a stranger they swarm him yipping we call them yip dogs and when i reminded kel of them he agreed that the smaller creature was exactly like a yip dog huh good enough name for it he replied so you think this yip dog was meant to raise alarms im sure of it and im sure kel was right from his description it detected the aura of magic that is a part of every gryphon she sounded quite positive and after a moment of thought snowfire was inclined to agree tentatively with that conclusion he couldnt think of any other reason why it would have been able to find kel in the heavy cover of the forest canopy do you think perhaps that it was intended to raise an alarm against people screening themselves magically or using magic to disable sentries or was it set to catch mages trying to use magic to get past magical alarms he asked curiously i cant think of a better reason to have them she told him as she bore down hard on the small of his back after all they dont know that the magestorms are over and a magestorm could disable a magical protection animals on the other hand sleep more lightly than humans and they arent disabled when mageenergy is disrupted fortunately kel followed his initial impulse which was to go away from the place the yip dog was guarding otherwise i think the whining might have escalated to something a lot louder thats what the real yip dogs do if you stay near what they consider to be their territory or worse try to approach it they get positively hysterical and the other obviously the term attack dog suits it snowfire rested his chin on his folded hands to keep it off the hard rock beneath him in fact thats probably why they were paired if whatever the yip dog was warning about kept coming the attack dog was to hold it where it was until the masters came he grinned a little it must have been awfully puzzled about how to get at kel fortunately for us the masters didnt consider a sortie by air she kneaded his shoulders vigorously and he grunted does that hurt yes but dont stop no youre right about that they must not know there are tayledras anywhere about and theyve never encountered kaledain before all i can say is its a good thing we didnt have any human scouts on this one the more he thought about it the more grateful he was tayledras scouts would have sent birds in seen nothing to worry about and might perhaps have been tempted to come down out of the trees and go in afoot to recconoiter they would never have been able to escape the fastmoving monsters and only an eyeshot would have killed the beasts given the way that hweels talons just skidded off the scales the yip dog was probably alerted by physical attributes such as scent and sound as well as by magic she agreed it wouldnt be very bright to have them sound alarms only for the presence of magic im just glad there were only two of them i saw them through hweels eyes and the things did look like wyrsa he told her wondering if she had any more insights gleaned out of kaledain history for him or rather it looked as if their ancestors could have been wyrsa now that triggered a dream last night of all kinds of creatures that looked as if they also could have been bred from wyrsa and that made me wonder when i woke up this morning if the being that darian described as a demon and the creature it was riding could have had wyrsa ancestors he cocked an eye back at her that must have been one hell of a dream she observed im glad i didnt share it still she paused to work on a particularly bad knot in his neck and he clenched his teeth to keep from yelping the story says that the wyrsa tadrith fought were definitely intelligent and there is no reason whatsoever that there couldnt have been more of them created somewhere else or at least more wyrsa changed in different ways the beasts arent exactly stupid so its not that great a jump to significant intelligence intelligence enough to realize that it would be to the monsters advantage to cooperate with a human he hazarded and given that we have a mage with these barbarians who we assume already knows how to make changechildren he took a deep breath as she let up on his shoulders a bit you see where this is going yes and i dont like it but it does make it all the more imperative that we concentrate on keeping starfall safe rather than messing about with these people and alerting them to the fact that were here he felt her hands starting to tremble was the imperturbable nightwind actually afraid she should be intelligent humanlike versions of wyrsa that is a truly frightening thought how did darian sleep last night she asked abruptly changing the subject herself wintersky says he had a couple of nightmares but nothing that even woke him thats enough thanks he rolled back over and let the sun work on his chest muscles i dont know what tonight will bring but so far im going to assume that minor nightmares are good but the ones that send him out of sleep screaming in hysterics are bad as a general rule we dont want him assimilating too much too fast she stretched herself out on the rock beside him ah that feels good hell probably have a hysterical one in a few nights though that is if what tyrsell did fades out at the rate i think it will it might go more quickly hes a boy with a strong will and thats likely to make him fight what we put in place snowfire sighed wonderful well if he gets too hysterical for me to handle remember your promise she laughed big brave tayledras warrior worried about a little boys nightmares big brave tayledras warrior needs his sleep or he isnt going to be much good at protecting annoying little kaledain trondiirn he growled cracking open an eye to see which side of her was uppermost and smacking her on the rump when he had a target that of course led to her rolling him into the water and him pulling her in and a conversation that had nothing whatsoever to do with darian kelvren or wyrsa darian woke screaming from a nightmare of fire to find a sleepy yawning snowfire kneeling at his pallet shaking him gently easy darian the hawkbrother was saying as if he had been saying the words over and over for some time its all right youre just dreaming wake up little brother there was a lot of light around where was it coming from im awake darian said feeling dazed and confused and still full of a sourceless grief and fear im awake good snowfire smiled but he had to put up a hand to cover his mouth as it turnedinto a yawn that was when darian saw the source of the illumination after snowfire moved there was a very dim globe of light hovering just at snowfires shoulder and darian stared at it distracted for a moment it startled him but snowfire didnt act as if it was something strange whats that he asked pointing to it my magelight the hawkbrother replied casually as if he conjured such things all the time perhaps he did and darian just hadnt been awake at the right time to see them he had been so exhausted these last couple of days that he went to sleep almost as soon as the sun went down would you like it a little brighter a heartbeat later the glow intensified a measurable degree you can make those he said staring at it really justyn couldnt then all at once as the sound of his own voice screaming justyns name echoed in his memory his fear and grief had a source his throat closed up and he fought back tears a man shouldnt cry tears were useless they hadnt brought back his parents had they justyns dead isnt he he whispered closing his eyes to hide the pain hes really dead yes little brother he is snowfire replied quietly with an odd inflection in his voice darian opened his eyes to see the hawkbrother looking down at him with what pity understanding he couldnt tell he hadnt seen anyone in errolds grove wearing either expression around him just then over on the other side of the hut wintersky snorted in his sleep turned over and mumbled that seemed to make up snowfires mind about something here he said getting to his feet and holding out his hand we shouldnt wake wintersky and i dont think youll be getting back to sleep soon so lets go for a walk darian hesitantly accepted the outstretched hand snowfire pulled him to his feet then turned toward hweels perch and held out his arm to the huge owl he wasnt wearing his armguard and darian gasped and winced as hweel stepped onto the bare flesh but the owl barely closed his feet around the arm and halfspread his wings to keep his balance instead of maintaining it by gripping the arm snowfire turned to give him a reassuring smile remember hweel isnt an ordinary owl im only going to take him outside to let him step up onto the roof he can be very softfooted when he needs to be for me yes but if he gets unbalanced and cant save himself he may forget whats under those talons mindful of that possibility darian stepped in front of snowfire and held the curtain of vines aside so that the hawkbrother wouldnt have to juggle vines and owl at the same time with a nod of thanks snowfire stepped out into the night with the magelight trailing at his shoulder darian followed him once outside snowfire raised his arm just enough that hweel could move onto the end of an exposed roofbeam hweel stepped off his arm carefully settled his feathers looked all around in that bizarre way only owls could his head went nearly all the way around then he settled on a direction crouched down and pushed off flapping hard vanishing silently into the darkness snowfire turned just as silently and after a backward glance at darian walked slowly along the path after a breath of hesitation darian caught up with him wintersky had given him what he called sleeping clothes that was a new idea to darian who generally slept in that days shirt and put on a clean one in the morning but hed obediently changed into the odd garments every night he saw now that snowfire wore very similar clothing a draped pullover shut of some light looselywoven cool material and drawstring trousers gathered at the ankle made of the same stuff darian felt a little like a ghost walking barefoot through the sleeping camp in the pale garments ghosts how many ghosts haunted errolds grove now one at least or would justyn have stayed to haunt the place what are you thinking snowfire asked quietly hardly above a whisper i was thinking about justyn he replied feeling sorrow again rise to close his throat i think that he must have been a very good and brave man came the quiet reply people of his sort do not need to linger haunting their old homes ghosts are those who left things undone and i cannot think he left anything undone that truly needed doing where he couldnt manage anything more but snowfire must have guessed his question having had no personal experience of one who has gone i cannot give you firsthand evidence he replied as one hand somehow came to rest on darians shoulder as a comforting weight but well i know enough folk who have whose word i trust to make me certain that we do not simply cease to be but as for the nature of the path he took the faith we tayledras profess tells us that each path is different according to the belief and the nature of the one who takes it he paused i am not certain what your people believe but would you care to hear what one who had been a herald supposedly told one of my people i yes darian said after a moment one who had been a herald but heralds dont quit being heralds so he said or so i was told snowfire replied interrupting darians thoughts that when a herald dies he is given three choices one is that he may return again as a heraldtobe the second that he return as a companion and the third is that he have some time in a place where all his desires are granted i suspect that your teacher has been given the same choices darian blinked as his eyes blurred and felt tears coursing down his cheeks i hope i hope whatever he picked he got a lot of magic he choked snowfires hand closed briefly on his shoulder i think that he must the hawkbrother replied in fact i cannot imagine anything else that was too much for darian and he lost his last shreds of control he stumbled and started to sob and found snowfire holding him just the same way as his father used to when some childish grief overcame him darian forgot that he was supposed to be a man forgot that men didnt cry forgot everything except that he had failed to help justyn he had failed to help bis father and mother and now they were all dead and he was utterly alone he cried silently as he had learned to do since his parents death sobs shaking his frame leaning on snowfire who simply held him and rocked a little from side to side saying nothing and only when the worst of his terrible grief had passed did it dawn dimly on him that he really wasnt alone after all finally there were no more tears left and snowfire let him go at the exact instant when he thought of pulling away more than a little embarrassed dont be ashamed for allowing yourself to feel little brother came the quiet words you should rather feel sorry for those who do not they are either cripples or very sick in soul as he stared at the hawkbrother in astonishment snowfire patted his shoulder i think that a midnight swim might be a good thing for both of us he said and gave darian a gentle push to start him moving again darian was in a bit of a daze and it seemed as if they only took a few steps farther before they came to the two ponds their water reflecting the stars and a sliver of moon above them snowfire simply stripped off his garments and plunged in after a moment of hesitation darian copied his example he had expected the water to feel cold but he had been standing in the night air long enough that it was only pleasantly cool he swam back and forth on his back staring up at the stars letting his mind empty of everything he didnt stop until his arms and legs were tired and he was beginning to feel a little waterlogged only then did he stop to tread water and saw snowfire was back on the bank putting on his clothing the magelight still hovering near him but much brighter now he paddled back to the same place and looked up at a towel being held out for him to take he dried himself off and started to look around for his discarded clothing but it wasnt where hed left it quickly he wrapped the towel around his waist wondering what had happened to it when snowfire noticed his confusion and pointed there neatly folded on a rock was a fresh set of garments hertasi was all snowfire said as he turned his attention to carefully braiding his long hair quickly darian slipped into the clean clothes and used the towel on his own hair to cover his uncertainty about what to do or say next the sense of loss never leaves little brother snowfire said in a perfectly normal tone of voice but it does grow less over time as long as you permit yourself to feel if you bottle it inside it only eats at you until you are hollow and full of nothing but grief how do you know darian blurted feeling unaccountably angry then he could have beaten his head against a tree for snapping at snowfire so but snowfire didnt snap back he just finished braiding his hair and looked at darian quizzically who told you that tayledras are immortal he asked whoever he was he was misinformed darian hung his head his cheeks burning im sorry he mumbled i didnt mean you didnt think snowfire corrected with a kindly tone in his voice and given the hour and the circumstances i can hardly fault you you are tired in every way much longer and i will be snapping in an illtempered snarl myself darian flushed even hotter if that was possible i cant imagine you ever doing anything wrong he stammered to his surprise snowfire chuckled oh darian do not ever allow nightwind to hear you or she will fill your ears with the myriad ways and times in which i have transgressed he rolled his eyes skyward i cannot even tell you which is worse that she never forgets or that she is right far too often or at least thinks that she is to his surprise darian found himself smiling a little for he had certainly heard the men of errolds grove making the same complaints in the tavern i guess all ladies are like that the ones at home he stopped in midsentence there wasnt any home anymore and as for the men who frequented the tavern he had no idea where they were or what had happened to them were they even still alive shouldnt he be getting help for them what was he thinking of lolling about in ponds like this when he should be helping the people of errolds grove how had he managed to forget the rest of his people whats the matter snowfire asked breaking into his silence i should what am i still doing here he asked feeling a frantic urge to do something and not knowing what he could do he shifted his weight from one foot to the other in a nervous dance ive got to go somewhere got to get help why am i still here i should be out there trying to get somebody to help us not here enjoying myself before he could yield to that urge and just run off into the darkness snowfire seized his elbow and somehow the mere touch calmed him darian listen to me and please believe me the hawkbrother said urgently hweel and kel and i have been to your village the second night after you came to us we saw no signs that your people had been killed and none that they had been captured either we are fairly sure they must have escaped completely you can be at ease for it seems likely that they have already found help but youre not completely sure darian asked wanting to believe and not sure that he dared to you think theyre all right but you i could not be completely sure without going into the village and looking into all the houses snowfire interrupted and added i think you will agree that this would not be a very wise course of action uh probably not darian replied trying to think where people could have escaped to we think that they probably went down the river snowfire continued there is a place there with fortifications some great lords holding we think kelmskeep darian replied automatically lord breons manor and somehow just being able to identify the place made him lose some of that feeling of frantic urgency what did you see when you went back i have to know what if they didnt get away how would you know then sit here and i will tell you snowfire gestured at a rock that seemed perfectly sculpted to act as a chair and took another like it i do not know if you have been told this but a tayledras can see through the eyes of his bondbird i remained near where we found you in the boughs on the same line as the sentries hweel and kelvren went on since it would be far less likely they would be detected than a human and it would be far easier for them to escape if they were sighted darian nodded leaning forward tensely to better hear snowfires soft voice the bridge crossing the river had been repaired and it appeared that few of the buildings had actually been burned mostly a handful of sheds there were livestock in crude enclosures in the fields and many many horses in better enclosures there also snowfire tilted his head and brushed a strand of hair out of his eyes as darian flinched at the thought of cows pastured in the young crops why do you wince theyre eating the crops darian explained thinking with pain of all the work that the villagers had put into those fields only to have those animals devouring the food that should have gone to feed the village over the winter there wont be anything to last until spring the barbarians of the north which is what i believe these are do not farm much they are mostly hunters crop growing is a task for women and thralls and the men dont trouble themselves with where food other than meat comes from snowfire seemed lost in thought for a moment then came to himself with a shake of his head this tells me that the barns are empty of livestock and there must be something else in the barns i count the horses knowing that northern barbarians are not great horsemen and that there will be a dozen men who fight afoot for every rider i decided then that the barns must be full of those soldiers and the houses are full of the riders who are of higher rank guessing at the numbers by the number of horses i would say that there was no room in the village for your own people and there are no people sleeping out in the open so i think they must have escaped and then darian persisted then what happened then kelvren was discovered and he and hweel had to leave snowfire shrugged eloquently so do you think i am right darian tried to think but he could not imagine where the villagers could be other than escaped if they werent in their own homes or in the barns i guess that must be right he said and suddenly found himself yawning but why cant you attack these people arent you supposed to be valdemars allies arent you going to help if we thought that your people were in danger we would regardless of the danger to us snowfire said firmly but darian just what do you propose we should do you know how few of us there are and you had a glimpse of how many the enemy has in his ranks but magic darian protested you can use magic not as yet snowfire told him not in any way that will balance our small numbers first we must see if your people summon their own aid it would be foolish wouldnt it if we tried to attack and failed only to see an army of your people come the next day having seen what the enemy could do darian had another word for it than foolish he gulped thinking of what a real battle must look like not merely one man with awounded arm but many people hurt even killed and it wouldnt be strangers dying it would be people he knew the thought made him sick to his stomach i think that would be a bad idea he replied weakly on the other hand snowfire continued in that same reasonable tone of voice if we wait long enough the enemy will relax and drop some of their defenses even if help from your land does not come at once we may well have an opportunity to do them a great deal of harm perhaps even enough to drive them away that sort of fighting does tend to make the best use of our abilities with magic darian asked hopefully surely if even snowfire who said that he was inferior as a mage could do things even justyn couldnt what could starfall do well you told us that there was a mage with these people snowfire began i did darian blurted snowfire nodded when you told us of the creature riding the lizard and the men with the aspects of bears only a mage can work such changes which meant that there must be one among them well you know what has befallen magic and you know that our task is to reestablish order in the patterns of magic this means that starfall must before all else seize control of the magic here so that the other mage cant get it darian exclaimed exactly so then once we have control of the magic energy he will be weaker that is the good aspect snowfire frowned the bad aspect is that this means starfall will be busy holding the power and unable to do other things he would otherwise such as watching the enemy from afar or protecting us from the enemys magic and in the meantime the enemy mage is not having to hold the powermatrix and he is free to act none of the rest of us are his equal and i do not know that we could be even acting together so we will ensure that some message comes to your people calling for help and meanwhile we will wait to see what happens wait and see wasnt that what justyn was always harping about patience but this time rushing into things is going to get people hurt and killed he sighed and nodded his head i guess thats what youll have to do he said reluctantly but whatever he had intended to say was interrupted by an enormous yawn and he found himself blinking hard trying to keep his eyes open hold the thought little brother snowfire said and got up whatever it is can wait until morning for now sleep is waiting darian stumbled along in snowfires wake trying to keep his thoughts in order there was something about starfall holding the magic something important but whatever it was it didnt last past putting his head down on the pillow when he woke up his memories of last night and the nightmare that had awakened him were waiting for him snowfire however wasnt he went through most of the day doing whatever chores the hertasi or hawkbrothers asked him to without once seeing his new mentor he guessed that snowfire must be out doing his job scouting and that made him feel a little better something was being done it might not be obvious to him just what it was but clearly the hawkbrothers were not lounging about looking decorative he helped nightwind groom kelvren after the latter returned from his own scouting foray making certain that the enemy wasnt getting too near their encampment kelvren told him more of the nightsortie especially the combat with the two smaller monsters it was exciting but scary too when he thought how kelvren could have been hurt now all those old stories about battles and fighting took on an entirely different complexion when he thought about these people he knew being in the middle of all the hewing and smiting and all the notion of seeing kel sick with poison of wintersky with some terrible wound bleeding into the dirt it was horrible not that he hadnt seen nasty injuries because obviously he had but to think of such things being inflicted by other people on his friends and on purpose to hurt or kill them well it was just entirely different from seeing the results of an accident and it was hard to wrap his mind around the idea not just hard ugly it made him feel horrible inside to realize that people could actually want to hurt other people oh there were plenty of times when hed wanted something nasty to happen to other people but the wish was always vague and illdefined and what hed wanted was for something to happen to them not that he wanted to inflict a hurt but i think i could have hurt those men who were chasing me he considered it a little more i know i could have hurt them i was ready to shoot them he recalled quite clearly how he had felt at the time coldly calculating an eyeshot as if the men were nothing more than treehares he was hunting for the pot but they were going to kill me and snowfire and they attacked the village and for no reason or not for no reason but not for any good reason when he finished with kel who had really enjoyed being able to tell someone about his fight wintersky caught him before anyone else did we need to get the hawk furniture in order wintersky told him and youre the only one free without any explanations of what hawk furniture was or how to get it in order instead the youngest of the hawkbrothers left him in the charge of a painfully shy hertasi in someone elses hut the entire left side of which was full of hawk furniture which was not little chairs and tables for birds of prey as his imagination had devised but the bits and pieces of hawk equipment needed for the bondbirds for all their intelligence bondbirds were still hawks and a hood slipped over their heads would let them sleep in a noisy and brightlylit room darkness makes them sleep the little hertasi whispered cupping her hands over her eyes by way of illustration if the bondmate needs to be awake the bird must still sleep to feel well they must sleep from dawn to dusk she showed him how to clean the hoods made of hard but extremely thin leather odd bulges over the areas of the eyes to keep from touching the lids then when he had cleaned them she showed him how to repair those that were damaged most often it was the braces the leather thongs that held the hoods shut at the back that were damaged broken or worn out that was easy to fix once he saw the odd way in which they were laced so that a hawkbrother could tighten or loosen the hood with one hand and his teeth but sometimes what was damaged was the welt of leather protecting the raw edge of the bottom of the hood or the ornamental knot on top which was supposed to be used to take the hood off and put it on the hertasi let him repair the simplest of these but for the really complicated repairs such as restitching the eyecovers she insisted on doing the work while he watched it was fascinating for he would not have thought that such stubby little fingers could take such delicate stitches most of the bondbirds didnt need restraints such as jesses but all of them wore the bracelets on their ankles that the jesses fitted through the bracelets were good for other things for tying a light string onto for instance that a bird could carry up and over a high branch so that a rope could be pulled up afterward so the hertasi taught him how to cut and oil such bracelets then how to make leather or ropewrapped and padded perches as well hawks took wall or floorperches of tree limbs wrapped in leather while falcons it seemed required perches made of upthrust sections of stump like upthrusting rocks but padded so that the talons of a sleeping bird had something to grip care of the feet it seemed was allimportant and sharp talons were hard on wrapped perches perches had to be made to withstand hard use but not made of things that would bruise or abrade the feet bruised or cut feet could infect leading to a state called bumblefoot which in turn could cripple a bird if not adequately treated he learned more about birds of prey in that morning than he had ever learned in his life and when he and the little lizard were done every bit of equipment that could be mended had been then it was time for lunch and time to help clean pots for a bit it occurred to him after lunch as he stood beside ahalf barrel with his arms up to the elbow in warm slippery soapy water that he had seldom worked this hard with poor justyn but this didnt bother him at all and that was the odd thing maybe its just its just that no one shouts at me or tells me what a terrible ungrateful child i am he concluded its not so bad to work when no one is scolding you of course hed never had such interesting work before which might have been the reason ayshen always had funny or fascinating things to tell him while he scrubbed pots and mending the hawk furniture had been something entirely different from anything hed ever done before it wasnt hard to get through a chore when someone was chatting to you and making jokes and when the chore required concentration and delicacy time just flew by and as for helping to tend kelvren well he had felt positively honored it had been an amazing thing to touch the gryphons huge feathers and make sure the killing talons were pinprick sharp and immaculately clean odd he thought as ayshen left him alone for a moment to tend to the bake ovens i thought kelvren was so old older than snowfire but it was almost as if he was my age i wonder how old he really is there was no way of telling with a bird of course they didnt exactly show their age in any way that he could recognize i like it here he thought with yearning as he watched ayshens back i wish i could stay if only there was some way that he could when things got back to normal would anyone at errolds grove ever want him back was there the faintest chance that the hawkbrothers would want him with them and what if things never got back to normal what if no one wanted to go back to the village would the hawkbrothers be willing to give him a home last night snowfire kept calling me little brother is that just something he calls every boy or darian wintersky popped up behind his back and he yelped in startlement dropping the bowl hed been scrubbing back into the water wintersky jumped with amazing agility right out of the way and didnt even get a single drop of water on himself he laughed and clapped darian on the back sorry didnt mean to creep up on you like that its just habit snowfire wants you for a moment if ayshen doesnt mind not at all the hertasi said without turning hes done twice the work of any of you clumsyhanded louts he can consider his work done for the day why ayshen i am crushed wintersky mocked and threw darian a towel to wipe himself down with come on this wont take long wondering what snowfire could want darian followed the younger tayledras with increasing curiosity he became even more puzzled and a little uneasy when wintersky brought him down a very narrow path into a part of the encampment where he had never been before it was heavily overgrown cool dim and so quiet he could hear himself breathing the path ended in a place completely overshadowed by the branches of the oldest and largest willow darian had ever seen with the usual log hut built right up against the trunk of the tree which was easily as big around as the hut itself no grass could possibly grow here but that lack was more than made up for by the thick moss carpeting the area sitting on a bow perch beside the door was a handsome cooperi hawk watching everything with alert reddishyellow eyes waiting for darian were snowfire and starfall the adept looked very tired as if he had been working all night and darian wondered if he had gotten any rest at all they must be taking me seriously enough that starfall is working himself as hard as he can to keep those people from getting at the magic that was oddly reassuring darian i understand you have been a great deal of help to us starfall said by way of a greeting caught off guard darian shrugged i guess so have to earn my keep dont i he winched a little inwardly for his words didnt sound very polite but starfall didnt seem offended we do expect all of those in our own group to do their share if they are not disabled the older man said gravely we are not so wellequipped that we cannot use another pair of hands in fact he cast a glance at snowfire we could use that pair of hands on a more permanent basis if that would suit you darian stared at him quite certain that his newwon ability to understand tayledras must be faulty starfall persisted grave but earnest our impression is that you do not feel any truly strong ties to those of your people that remain is that impression true he shook his head a little hardly able to believe what he was hearing was starfall making the offer that he thought starfall was clearly waiting for an answer and darian was startled enough to give him stark unvarnished truth uh id say theyd probably be happy to see the last of me right now he admitted shamefaced with no master i go back on the village to care for and i dont think any of them would care to apprentice me now bet they could find all kinds of excuses not to in fact he thought with sudden bleakness for how could starfall take that as any kind of a recommendation then would you care to remain with us starfall asked watching his face intently snowfire has offered to take you as his younger sibling and that is all that i need as elder but there is a condition snowfire said warningly before darian could burst out with an astonished and immediate acceptance you must agree to to apprentice to me in the matter of magic at least for as long as i have the ability to teach you you may outstrip me i do not yet know how strong your gifts may be and if that happens you must go to a real teacher starfall by preference and we shall be gone from our home vale for some time several years perhaps working to establish the leylines and nodes all through the northern part of valdemar starfall added watching him closely so you will not actually see our vale until our work is done if you were hoping for exotic surroundings well our surroundings will be less and less exotic all the time that we are out that is another reason for us to want you with us it would be good to have someone who has a natives command of this tongue at our disposal darian stood rockstill thinking furiously so that was to be the price of being given a place here that he must continue the tedious study of magic of all the things he wanted to learn surely that was the last on the list but perhaps he was doing snowfire an injustice justyn was hardly the best teacher in the world and as a practitioner he was even worse maybe it wouldnt be so bad if he was studying with someone who actually knew something and even if it was just as tedious and boring as it had been with justyn well wasnt that a small price to pay to be where he was actually wanted and snowfire says he wants me for a brother me they want me to be a real hawkbrother he made a real effort to contain his excitement but it surely showed he stifled his urge to shout and somehow managed to turn a grave face toward the adept i would like to stay very much elder he said at last with a little bow to starfall i am honored that you ask me and i certainly accept i promise that i will do all that i can to help everyone here and i will try to be more patient in learning magic starfall smiled and motioned him closer taking his hand the adept placed a pendant into it it was a hawktalon mounted in silver the mounting was decorated with a blue moonstone and strung on a beaded chain welcome to kvala then little brother he said warmly as he closed darians hand around the talon you must wear this as a token of your acceptance into the clan as nightwind does you both bear the talons of my fathers great suntail hawkeagle skyr who shared my fathers labors as a healing adept and went to white at the age of only four i know that you will be worthy of the token even as nightwind is snowfire took the talon from darians nerveless fingers and put it around his neck darian looked up at him trying to find the right words to thank him and failing completely but snowfire acted as if he had already said them you have labored long and hard already and i am not minded to begin your lessons with one today little brother the younger hawkbrother said as he clasped and released darians shoulders why not go out into the forest for a time it will cool your mind and help you think if there was one thing that darian agreed with it was that he needed some time to think this over he nodded but do i need to have someone with me he asked hoping that the answer would be no snowfire shook his head that horse that we stole is in need of exercise he suggested go take it about for a while you will be safe enough riding and you wont have to worry about dyheli chatter in your mind the corner of his mouth twitched a little suggesting to darian that although the remark was intended as amusement snowfire had suffered dyheli chatter in the past as he hesitated a moment starfall nodded at the entrance to his little sanctuary off with you young one i am the one most needful of your elder brothers skills at the moment we have some tricky work ahead of us before we can rest this day perhaps yesterday such a dismissal would have made darian sullen and resentful suspecting that they were getting rid of him so that they could discuss him but now now he had no such feelings if starfall said they had work then they had work and he would only get in the way he stammered his thanks to both of them and turned and ran his heart hammering with so many mixed feelings that he couldnt sort them out properly he already knew where the horse was in the pasture being guarded by the dyheli herd and kept from straying he guessed that the tack would be in a hut he knew was used for storing things with no immediate use and sure enough it was he hadnt saddled many horses in his life but with the help of two amused dyheli who kept the nag from running off halfequipped he managed to get all the gear on in the proper manner it wasnt that the horse was at all illtempered it was more as if it expected bad treatment it didnt fight him but if it could get away without being saddled and bridled it would be very happy to do so the horse sighed with resignation as he clambered into the saddle his stomach aching reflexively as he recalled the last time hed ridden the beast but it seemed tractable enough and it moved out of the entrance to the valley at a calm walk darian was used to finding his way in the forest and had no fear that he was going to get lost he set a general course southward but otherwise let the horse have its head and it ambled on beneath the trees while he let his own thoughts wander they tended to stray into mere contemplation of his surroundings it was so easy to let his mind go blank as he admired a golden shaft of sunlight piercing the green gloom then saw with surprised delight a single flower basking in its warmth like a precious jewel displayed for his admiration it was more comfortable to contemplate the majesty of the enormous tree trunks rising in a neverending vista of columns all around him than to contemplate his own future and the liquid notes of birdsong dropping tranquilly down through the boughs were infinitely preferable to the discords of his past everywhere he looked he saw things that his parents would have drawn his attention to if they had been there summer was not a time to trap for furs so his summers in the past had been spent in exploration here in the hills wonderful and magical spots seemed hidden in every valley sometimes it was a sparkling stream burbling over a stonefilled bed sometimes the stream poured down the side of the hill in a series of exuberant waterfalls he caught sight of a pair of does with their fawns grazing in a tiny pocket of meadow surrounded by mosscovered boulders once they passed a fallen tree that supported an entire community of plants and ferns on its decaying mosscovered side all was well for some time the horse given no commands chose to eat as much as he walked he meandered from one sparse bit of grass to the next the grass beneath the tree canopy was thin and tended to grow in widelyspaced wispy clumps thick growths of fern and moss were more common here than grasses and the horse disdained both darian let the reins hang loose on the horses neck engrossed in his own increasingly troubled thoughts those thoughts werent really coherent too much had happened to him for coherency he had the vague feeling that perhaps this was the root of what bothered him events had taken him so completely by surprise that he wasnt acting anymore he was reacting at least before when anything happened to me it was generally because id already done something to make those things happen he thought and it was usually something that i knew would make trouble it was true he hadnt had a lot of control over his own life but at least hed had some and hed had choices even if it was only the choice to resist what other people had in mind for him but now fate or chance was hitting him with one hammer blow after another not even giving him the time to reel back from one blow before slamming him with the next being invited to join the hawkbrothers was the first thing that had happened in days that involved any choice for him and now that hed accepted he felt strange there was a creeping sense that he had betrayed the people of errolds grove in some way and yet at the same time he resented the fact that he felt that way what right had they to claim his loyalty why should he chain his fate to theirs there was guilt too a great deal of it and he wasnt at all sure what to do about it what had happened to the folk of the village he hadnt made any real effort to find out surely he ought to at least do that and no matter what snowfire said how could anyone be sure there was nothing that he could have done that would have saved justyn maybe if hed been beside his master on that bridge the way any good apprentice would have been the outcome would have been different all right so he didnt have any real magic yet but hed learned a lot at the side of his parents and maybe he would have been able to do something that would have saved them both i could have jumped off the bridge when he set it afire and dragged him along with me i can swim even if he couldnt or his mind buzzed with a hundred absurd things he might have done or could have done or thought he could have done and all of them just made him feel guiltier he became so engrossed in his thoughts that he didnt realize that the horse had stopped eating and was sneaking through the forest at a fast if furtive walk until he saw a landmark he recognized with a start he knew then that they were getting far too close to errolds grove for comfort and made a grab for the reins but the horse was an older hand at this game than he was with a flip of its head it tossed the reins out of reach and increased its pace darian didnt have to be able to read its thoughts to know what they were the beast had scented its herdmates and it was going to get back to them by whatever means it took the blacksmith had explained once why all the horses in the village were kept in a single herd horses werent happy alone and even though the errolds grove herd wasnt a breeding herd the lack of a stallion was no impediment to the horses comfort in each other this horse probably felt the same about the rest of the horses he was used to being with and no dim memory of mistreatment was going to overwhelm the urgent need on his part to get back to the safety of the herd darian considered trying to throw himself out of the saddle but the horse was going faster now and suddenly the ground seemed very far away to a boy whod never done more than steal rides on the innkeepers old pony with the horse moving he didnt know how to get himself out of the saddle and onto the ground without breaking something so he just held grimly to the saddle gritted his teeth against the jolting and prayed that they wouldnt run into any enemy sentries the trees cleared away up ahead and darian felt his heart stop with terror as he thought they were almost at the village but the horse hesitated as the tree cover thinned and darian managed to seize the reins before the recalcitrant beast managed to bolt into the middle of town but then darian realized that the daylight ahead of them was not the daylight of the cleared fields somehow the horse had managed to come out of the forest at the top of the only bluff that overlooked the village how it had managed that darian had no clue but once he dismounted and led the horse cautiously to the edge of the bluff he had as good a view of the village as if hed been sitting in one of the trees but what he saw made his skin crawl and filled him with the desperate feeling he had to do something along with the knowledge that there was nothing he could do in the distant fields were people people he recognized toiling like beasts in the heat of midday hitched to plows like oxen were the biggest men of the village sweating beneath the blows of a whip held in the hands of a stranger behind them guiding the plows through the fields meant to be sown with lateripening crops were the women who were also chained in their places others worked chained at the waist in pairs beneath the watchful eyes of more strangers these men werent wearing the armor that darian remembered but he knew they must be the same men who had invaded the village as to why men were being used to pull the plows instead of oxen well the smell of roasting beef coming up the bluff certainly provided a reasonable explanation there were no oxen now and the horses had probably been confiscated to serve the army how many of the villagers had been recaptured enough evidently to provide fieldslaves for their conquerors darian found his hands clenched on his bow without any memory of reaching for it he could sneak in closer get a position up in one of the trees and start picking off guards they werent wearing armor theyd be easy shots i could kill all the guards i see and they could escape i could lead them to the hawkbrothers right he could kill all the guards that he could see how many more men were there that he couldnt see if theyd gotten to the point this quickly of killing and eating the oxen tough meat at best anger flooded him next anger at the hawkbrothers why hadnt they told him the truth it faded as quickly as it came they hadnt told him perhaps because they didnt know themselves it was entirely possible that this was the first day the villagers had been put to work in the fields why should the enemy have put them out it would have been more logical for them to take their captives away sell them perhaps or put them to work in their own fields back in the northern mountains unless of course they had decided to stay he couldnt do anything here and this was information that the hawkbrothers didnt have he had to get back as quickly as he could its not cowardice to go i cant do anything by myself and stariall and the rest need to know whats happened here carefully he backed the horse into the heavier cover before he mounted he considered his next move carefully he hadnt really been paying attention when the horse took off on its own somehow if there were sentries and there probably were the horse had managed to thread its way past them without being spotted so if he could retrace the horses path he could do the same finally finally something he could do right he felt a grin stretch his mouth an expression that had not been on his lips since his parents died if say rather how quickly the day he could not track a shod horse in the soft earth of the forest floor would be a day when he renounced his heritage and asked to be apprenticed to a clerk he had to cast around a bit before he found the clear trail it had gotten a little muddled when he finally got control of the reins back from the stubborn beast but once he found the trail the rest was easy he soon saw how the horse had gotten up onto the bluff without his realizing it the beast had wound a zigzag course up the slope taking the ascent so gradually that he hadnt known they were climbing he was tempted to cut straight down but reminded himself that the horse had managed to avoid the sentries this way it wouldnt be a good idea to take what appeared to be a shorter path only to run into one of the enemy the horse didnt want to be ridden away from its mates and fought him for a good long time which didnt make finding the path more difficult but did take up more valuable time it was sunset by the time that darian got to a point where he was fairly certain that there were no enemies to watch out for by then the horse was tired enough to stop fighting which was just as well because darians temper was frayed to a thin strand and he was in no mood for further nonsense with a clear path ahead of them darian finally got some revenge he smacked the horses rump with his unstrung bow startling it into a tired gallop and headed for the hawkbrother encampment as fast as the miserable beast would go weary and aching darian found himself the center of another council but now he understood what was being said which was certainly an improvement over the last time hweel had met him outside the valley and snowfire at the entrance darian had feared anger or reproach for being gone so long but to his surprise snowfire had been perfectly calm right up until the moment he had gotten within speaking distance and blurted ive been to errolds grove theyre all slaves snowfires expression had changed completely in that moment and darian found himself swept off the horse and into the middle of a council that was assembled so hastily that people actually came running to the clearing while pulling on tunics or holding halfbraided hair in one hand hertasi simply appeared with boots shirts food hairthongs or anything else that had been forgotten and vanished again one of them left a bowl of stew bread and tea at darians hand without him ever actually seeing the food left there just the flash of a departing tailtip as firelight flickered on the concerned faces of his hawkbrother hosts he alternated bites of stew and gulps of tea with words of explanation the only person missing from this council session was starfall but although no one said anything darian guessed from what wasnt said that starfall had more than enough problems of his own finally the others stopped firing questions at him and began a worried discussion among themselves darian turned his own attention to the remains of his meal too tired and hungry to really think of anything else as he wiped the bowl with his bread wintersky came and sat on a rock beside him i hope you dont think we deceived you darian the young man said leaning forward earnestly after the way that kel and hweel were caught by those magicsniffing creatures we didnt want to risk anything or anyone that might set off more such guardians and someone kept us from being able to use scrying to set a watch on the place magically and it didnt seem advisable to risk being seen ourselves the enemy doesnt know were here and if he did he might decide to attack we were certain that all the barbarians had were houses some stock but never people if wed had any idea that those barbarians had your people wed have risked more to find out for certain then to do something for them i know darian interrupted just as earnestly he scratched his head and gave wintersky an anxious smile i was mad at first but well i had a lot of time to think on the ride back i trust your word i know that if you say you would have done something if youd known what was going on then you would have we should have made sure darian looked up and saw snowfire standing over him his eyes expressionless and flat shadows flitting over his face as the light from the fire shifted and changed we should have made sure the hawkbrother repeated harshly that was a mistake on our part im sorry darian darian shrugged awkwardly wintersky was explaining and id kind of figured some of it out myself you thought everything was all right and you and starfall were busy he reminded his mentor shyly you told me yourself you have to fix the magic so no one else can get at it suddenly the thought hed set aside last night came back to him snowfire how are you doing that are you making just uhm whats the word nodes the way they used to be snowfires expression changed and he looked down at darian with speculation not exactly why darian licked his lips and wondered just how stupid he was going to sound after all compared to what the hawkbrothers knew he didnt know much of anything about magic really but still theres definitely a mage with the enemy right darian asked i mean with them at errolds grove not just working with them or behind the attack snowfire nodded i cannot imagine how they could be blocking our scrying if there wasnt and the mage is going to want that power hed have to want to grab for it he bit his lip hoping that he wasnt going to make a total fool of himself and i guess if there was a big source of power hed try to get to it right before snowfire could answer that he asked another question and there are way too many of those enemy soldiers for us to fight right snowfire looked both guilty and relieved far too many for us to take in direct confrontation he acknowledged yet i do not know how we are to free your people otherwise but what what if you baited a big trap for them darian asked what if you made a big source of magic made it show up all of a sudden wouldnt the mage send out men maybe a lot of them to try and take it over or loot it wintersky suggested his sleepy eyes brightening if you moved it around a little he might get the idea its portable and send his fighters to loot it for him he might think it was an artifact someone had found and i know traps lots of traps darian offered in eager triumph holding out one hand as if he was offering his knowledge as a gift my parents and i thats what we did a lot of the animals we trapped were as big as humans or bigger we could take a lot of the enemy out with traps without ever needing to send anybody closer than bowshot you set a trap that blocks them from going back the way they came then you make sure that they cant get back without having to go through all your other traps thats called a channeling trap maybe we could even fix things up so that the enemy has to divide up into small groups why if we did that we could just have one bowman up in a tree near each trap and what the trap didnt take care of he could snowfire looked at him and beamed with the most wonderful expression darian had ever seen respect and what was more others among the hawkbrothers who had overheard the conversation were looking at him in the same way and those who had been too engrossed in their own conversation to hear were whispering questions to those who had in another few moments they were all looking at him that way and silence replaced the murmur of voices in the clearing just how many traps do you mean when you say lots of traps darian asked rainwind a scout only a little older than most of the rest he stood up and joined snowfire a man who was a little more weathered a little shorter and a little stockier than darians mentor we know some obviously but trapping is not the way we usually deal with things we are more direct and to be honest more accustomed to having a superior force what traps we do use are for snaring game not stopping soldiers he shrugged darian blinked and made a quick mental survey of the traps he and his parents had used for large dangerous clever animals i know by heart maybe six or eight major different kinds that would work against a man or several men at a time he said finally maybe more we might be able to adapt others i know by disguising them or we could combine some i grew up making traps in this part of the pelagiris some of what we caught were probably smarter than these barbarians someone whistled through his teeth with admiration so youd already know how to adapt the designs to use the local cover snowfire exclaimed his whole body taking on a new animation darian nodded entirely using found materials too he said earnestly we only carried basic tools with us when we went out trapping and adapted what we found at the different locations the most we ever carried were some metal triggering devices and those were mostly just time savers i can show you some examples of the traps i know if you can stand to watch im not just talking about different kinds of pittraps i know how to set a pittrap to get a lot of people instead of just one or two i know of snares and dropnets that will get more than one a couple kinds of channelingtraps deadfalls with wood deadfalls with rock ankletraps legbreakers footpiercers he began rattling off the kinds of traps that could be set in such a way that wary enemy soldiers wouldnt see them until it was far too late and the eyes of his listeners either widened or narrowed according to the nature of the listener the others rose to stand around him until once again he was the center of a circle of listeners trapping is just a different kind of hunting my father said that it was hunting while absent using the ultimate in disguise not actually being there if we can do this if we could lure a good number of their people out snowfire murmured to himself as his eyes widened if you can lure them out and we can channel them past the bluff or through a couple of other places where theres only one way to go i can show you where and how to rig a deadfall that will block their way back darian assured him there is one place where the river is very deep and dangerous and the path beside it is narrow and if you can weaken one of the overhangs we can drop a large piece of the bluff just behind them at that point then theyll have to go the way we channel them and that will be a gauntlet of further traps snowfires lips thinned with satisfaction it is cruel perhaps but have they not earned such an ordeal yes darian responded fiercely nodding heads showed that the others agreed with him show us demanded one of the others paper and a charcoal stick appeared when rainwind left the group and returned with them in his hands and snowfire conjured a magelight to give darian brighter and steadier illumination than firelight darian hunched over the first sheet drawing a map here heres the village and heres the bluff and heres where the bluff goes up to the riverbed far enough from the village that they just cant call for help he sketched in the landmarks with a careful hand now if we rig a deadfall here when its triggered itll completely block the way back its all sandstone through there too dangerous to climb the rockpile or at least thats what theyll think their only choice will be to climb the cliff swim the river or keep going whats to stop them from swimming the river wintersky asked some of them did that when they attacked your village and the bridge burned us said ayshen as he strolled into the firelight his sharp teeth set in a grim smile he had one of his enormous cooking knives in one hand forgive me snowfire but this may be the first time in my memory that there has been a combat where hertasi might be of service we can swim like fish how do you think we catch them so big and so fresh and any clumsy human foolish enough to be in the same water with us will not live to learn his mistake or if he does it will not be for long added another hertasi in his shadow who then ducked shyly out of sight if they stay out of sight the enemy wont even know whats attacking the swimmers rainwind pointed out theyve never been here before for all they know that part of the river could be inhabited by gigantic mankilling changed fish theyll have no reason to think of traps at that point i fancy we can be of service in the woods tyrsell was nowhere in sight but it was obvious he had been listening to the council talk exactly how i am not yet sure but certainly we will be useful in some capacity i will have to see the territory first if nothing else perhaps the dyheli could drive the enemy into further traps offered daystorm a female scout it would be useful to have them in a panic fleeing from the sound of many hooves and again it would just look like animals it seems to me go on snowfire urged when the other hesitated well she said it seems to me that we ought to keep things looking like its accident or changed animals as long as possible if we do that they wont actually be looking for traps for a while eventually snowfire began oh eventually a trap will look like a trap of course she admitted but it would be very useful to have them thinking that fate or the forest has suddenly turned against them and therrre isss of courrrssse myssself kel put in gravely sounding quite calm but the pinning of his eyes gave away his excitement his wings were extended a little as if he wanted badly to be in the air at this very moment not if they have bows snowfire replied sternly you are hardly arrowproof and in the air you are a very large target especially in the day so was skandranon kels only reply was a snort but it was obvious that snowfire was going to stand firm i am the scoutleader and you are tacitly working under my command kel he reminded the gryphon he didnt add anything else but kel sighed very well the gryphon said giving in commanderrr we have an advantage snowfire continued many of us are masterlevel mages we can help create these traps with magic at a low enough level that working this magic will not immediately attract the attention of the enemy especially if we shield what we are doing so we can work quickly much more quickly than if we did this with hands alone darian studied his crude map i wish we could get them all with a single deadfall here he muttered and looked up hopefully could you bring down that much rock snowfire sighed before the storms it would have been possible with a waiting crackspell which would create a split at an angle that would cause a slide when it was triggered now no that kind of spell on that scale wouldnt remain stable long enough with the way mageenergy is in flux it depends upon tension through its length we will probably be able to catch the tailmost rank with what crackspells we can set but no more now the hawkbrother joined darian in close examination of the map it might even be worthwhile to do nothing more than block their way as daystorm pointed out so long as they think the fall of rock is accidental they will simply carry on with their original mission and worry about finding a new way back when theyve obtained what they were sent after we dont want them swimming the river of course but other than that we could leave them alone for a while we could lead them quite a merry chase before we start eliminating them with traps and tricks kel laughed a deep rumble in fact my frrriendsss we could let them marrrch unhinderrred and make a nightcamp and rrremove theirrr sssentrrriesss one by one sssilently if posssible he examined his talons critically and held them up shining redly in the firelight think of the consssterrrnation when the next watch came up but the onesss to be rrrelieved werrre poof gone snowfire looked up at him sharply with one brow raised you he said severely are an evil creature i like it tyrsell countered that would be a place where we could be useful it is no difficult thing for one of us to come upon a man silently and unseen i like it too seconded ayshen we might be able to help there if we arent too tired from swimming three or four of us could swarm a sentry and hed never hear or see us coming if we did that windshadow pointed out if we triggered the deadfall set up the traps and left the harrying to our hertasi and dyheli allies we could go in that same night and get the villagers out even if the barbarians have a way to get messages back and forth it wont do them any good the leader in the village is going to be preoccupied with clearing the blockage not watching his back and the leader in the expedition is going to be busy with shadowfiends picking off his men one by one that would also be dividing our forces snowfire objected then sighed and scratched his head no it wouldnt really he corrected himself the hertasi would be of limited use in a raid on the village and the dyheli would serve only as targets true and i would refuse that assignment if you were to give it to me tyrsell replied calmly this plan plays to all our strengths perhaps kel could come with us i can go along as well nightwind offered tyrsell ought to command the group but im not bad with a bow you know kel and i could work together snowfire looked as if he was thinking about the proposition very hard and finally nodded its the best division of labor he agreed and the best use of the limited number of fighters we have darian can tell us and show us what to do and once the traps are all in place we can set the plan in motion as darian looked up at him anxiously snowfire patted his shoulder reassuringly that will take no more than half a week surely your friends can hold out for a few days cant they i know they were being mistreated but they werent in any danger of being handled brutally were they darian wasnt certain but he nodded anyway it wont do any good to rush in there before we re ready he reminded himself a few more beatings arent going to make that much of a difference even if it does make a difference this is better than their alternatives its settled then snowfire said decisively then shook his head i wish there were another way but there doesnt seem to be he pointed to wintersky and windshadow you two go scout with your birds and make us some good maps of the area tomorrow figure the best direction to herd the barbarians and where to get them to make a camp after we block their path behind them the hawkbrothers nodded and snowfire turned his attention back to darian now he said about those traps hours later hands still smudged with charcoal darian stumbled back to the ekele thinking longingly of bed he stopped just long enough to wash his hands and face before stripping off clothing that still smelled of horse getting into a clean set of night clothes and lying down on the pallet he was keyed up enough that he didnt really think hed be able to fall asleep quickly but he was either better at relaxing or much more tired than he thought because he didnt even remember closing his eyes he woke as snowfire and wintersky came in whispering about something and propped himself up on one elbow to blink at them im awake he called softly anything i should know about we just worked out tentative placing for your traps and ways for the hertasi to trigger them snowfire told him raising his voice to a more normal level i didnt expect you to be awake but im glad you are you made all the right choices today and you deserve credit for doing so right choices darian repeated puzzled oh you could have gone charging right into the village thinking you could free your friends but you didnt snowfire said his voice muffled in the folds of his shirt as he pulled it over his head you stayed long enough to make detailed observations then you came straight back here you didnt waste time with accusations and carrying on when you got here you simply told us what you knew and then offered constructive suggestions in short darian you behaved in every way as a man and a warrior and i am very proud of you we all are darian felt his neck heating up and averted his eyes ah he stammered thank you i i dont want anything bad to happen to anybody and he gulped and decided to tell the rest of the truth the horse brought me out on the top of the bluff not down at the edge of the village if id been closer i probably would have done something stupid but there was no direct way down from there and well thats probably why i stopped to think you still made the right choices snowfire sat down on his pallet blinking at him with eyes that looked as large and dark as hweels that is an important thing for you to know heyla its going to be an early day tomorrow and the night is only getting shorter for all your talking wintersky pointed out a little crossly we do not all fly owls here he was already lying on his sleeping pad and he glared pointedly at the magelight above snowfires head snowfire chuckled and the light blinked out good night wintersky he said and good night darian hmph wintersky replied mollified good night good night darian said softly he lowered himself back down onto his pillow and the next thing he knew wintersky was shaking his shoulder and it was morning the day wore on filled with explanations and examples of trap placement and construction around him there were the sounds of wood being chopped branches split and snippets of conversation in tayledras darian caught himself feeling like he was playing once while he bent and notched saplings for lashingtraps he felt a pang of guilt since after all he was engaged in acts of war to cause pain and even death to those who had done the same to his village my village i suppose they are when all is counted up they werent the people i would have chosen to be with but they were better than alternatives yet making traps was at least something familiar from a better time in his childhood it brought back wistful memories of his parents he sighed thinking about them while he tied off his fourth or fifth lasher then hacked away steadily at a branch as thick as his upper arm things would have been so much better if they were here with him now his mother always seemed to know the right things to say or how to touch in just the perfect way to put him at ease his father was always so strong and capable with a quick smile darian a timid voice asked from below a bush two small pebblescaled hands held out a cup of water from under the cover and nothing else of the hertasi could be seen he wiped his brow and murmured a thanks to his largelyunseen benefactor then drank the cup dry in a blink after setting the cup down it was gone and a second hertasi voice spoke from behind another bush darian the stakes you requested are stacked on the east side of the red boulder we hope they will be enough we go now to prepare the vines then there was the slightest rustle of leaves and the sound of scuttling through underbrush and darian was alone again well id better see how many they managed to get done im getting nowhere on this branch and my arms hurt if we cant have enough of these traps ready to stop the soldiers we might only wind up injuring them enough to enrage them not discourage them darian sheathed his knife and started off toward the place the hertasi had told him of hertasi were amazing to him shy ghosts with astonishing speed and industriousness what were their parents like he found it hard to imagine them having families like his or the tayledras and what about the at that moment a large shape detached itself from the shadows of the thicket surrounding the red boulder darian froze in place and then relaxed exhaling sharply when he saw the shape resolve itself into goldentipped feathers the hook of an aquiline beak and the flip and flash of a huge wing refolding against a feathered body the gryphon stalked out looking directly at darian he seemed impossibly huge even at this distance yet darian knew that was only a trick of the mind he caught himself blushing wondering how long hed been under the creatures scrutiny kelvren looked down picked from several clear spots for the most comfortable and sat down waiting for darian to approach the gryphons chest rose and fell quickly as he apparently recovered from some physical effort or other and his gaze appeared to soften the closer darian came to him grrreetingsss darrrian kelvren rumbled as he dipped his beak in a nod i have jussst completed brrringing the ssstakesss the herrrtasssi have made they arrre behind the rrred blouderrr darian nodded selfconsciously i heard i mean one of the hertasi told me thats where they were i didnt know youd brought them though i hope theres enough of them kelvrens eyes sparkled and a moment later he wryly said i think therrre will be enough then he raised his head flicking a tufted ear and blinked a few times before opening his beak kelvren paused roused his feathers and bluntly asked darian what trrroublesss you darian frowned was it obvious kelvren clucked if you werrre not trrroubled i would sssussspect you of not being human but you arrre trrroubled ssso changechild you arrre not ssspeak all right do you have parents darian asked the gryphon chah kelvren barked no i wasss borrrn ssspontaneousssly of an arrrtissstsss drrream and a villainsss nightmarrre darian blushed im sorry it was a stupid question of course you had parents kelvren raised his beak up to point at the sky then looked back to darian if you mean do i know my parrrentsss and rrressspect them yesss verrry much ssso and do i misss them now yesss verrry much ssso he took a step toward the red boulder and darian followed one doesss not outgrrrow the feelingsss of fledging jussst the intensssity of the feelingsss it isss the way of thingsss darian was incredulous and stopped in his tracks you you miss your mama and papa the gryphon walked on without pause and rumbled only dont you darian caught up well yes but youre a gryphon and you arrre a human and we werrre crrreated by humansss and live with humansss and learrrn frrrom humansss and we arrre farrr morrre like you than you know why ssshould humansss have exsssclusssive rightsss to any anxsssiety darian had to laugh at that i guess youre right you probably share your gryphon anxieties with us humans too the gryphon nodded firmly and winked stopped a few steps after reaching the boulder it isss only fairrr afterrr all he pointed his beak ana darian was astonished at what he saw stacked in bound bundles of twenty or more were sharpened stakes in different thicknesses piled as high as he was tall there must have been hundreds of them if not thousands maybe this plan would work after all snowfire had always considered himself to be in fine shape but the need to favor his wounded arm was throwing everything off a little including his balance and as a result he ached with unaccustomed strain a full day of work on mantraps had been more than enough to show him that he probably ought to be in better condition than he was he was stretching and twisting his good arm as he approached starfalls clearing and ekele hoping to ease some of the aches hweel was already ahead of him waiting on a spare perch beside starfalls cooperi hawk snowfire carried a rough meal of cold sliced meat flatbread and wild berries wrapped in a napkin ayshen was not cooking today for he was needed to help set the traps and although he would not have complained had he been asked to cook a supper as well no one wanted to place that double burden on his toowilling shoulders nevertheless they all had to eat it would be cold meat greens and flatbread for as long as those lasted and after that each of them would be in charge of his own food that was not exactly a hardship for a hawkbrother rabbits and treehares were plentiful and the birds more than willing to share a catch with a bondmate snowfire had already decided that he would see that starfall ate and drank if starfalls young bird failed to make a kill out of inexperience hweel was such a fine hunter that he could have supplied the needs of six people not just three he found starfall sitting crosslegged in the center of a containment shield in the clearing beneath the willow branches the adepts eyes were closed but he sensed snowfires presence as soon as the scout arrived for he motioned to his visitor to sit and wait without ever taking his attention off what occupied him obediently snowfire did just that taking weary pleasure in watching the way the light filtering down through the branches changed from pure gold to reddish gold to dark red and finally to the blue of dusk the clearing could have been in the heart of the deep forest it was so quiet and peaceful here and snowfire was content merely to rest both mind and body while he waited for the adept to complete his current task he did not even conjure a magelight he didnt want to disturb either starfalls concentration or the delicate balances of power within the containment shield so the ball of blue light that appeared above his head was the adepts not his and was starfalls way of telling him that the work was over for now there was no outward change to the figure within the shield but a few moments later the shield dropped away and starfall stood up stretching here snowfire said handing him the meal ayshen said i was responsible for making sure you eat so what sort of progress have you made the enemy mage is trying to consolidate power for himself and hes trying to work his way through all of the locks i put on the lines starfall confirmed from the way hes working trying to bludgeon his way through i think hes under the impression that its crude work possibly done by that master of young darian i dont think he realizes that there is still an active worker about and i know he isnt aware of me as long as he keeps thinking that ill be pleased snowfire replied helping himself to some of the berries i have the bare hint of a powerpoint out along the river starfall continued laying a slice of meat neatly on a slice of bread and roiling them up rogeiner i strengthen it gradually as you are setting up the traps hell notice but it wont be enough to tempt him but once the traps are done ill remove it and put it on a dyheli then ill pour enough energy into it that it will look tasty and ill have the dyheli move it farther down the river along the river path at the same time ill build an illusion around it of a heavily armed caravan moving away i want to create the impression that the river has uncovered a talisman or artifact and that someone found it and is carrying it off even if that isnt what he thinks hell still assume the caravan has something tasty and send his fighters snowfire nodded with satisfaction its a good ruse just make sure your illusion wont be broken it shouldnt be ive gotten a dyheli doe to volunteer to carry it starfall applied himself to the food im linking the powerpoint to her once she gets into position but not before i dont want to have a moving powerpoint to attract his attention until then and once were done of course ill gather it back in and use it as the core of the heartstone snowfire swallowed and raised his eyebrows so you are going to make a heartstone here a small one starfall confirmed as he finished his first meat roll and built a second not powerful enough for a clan vale and at any rate it will take a long time before it has accumulated enough energy to be useful it will be four or five years before anyone could use it to create even a small vale snowfire was not at all sure he liked the idea hed thought of several objections when starfall broached the plan and those objections hadnt changed still a heartstone out here why and who are you going to link into it besides yourself why why not starfall responded apparently surprised that snowfire would object at all sooner or later the kvaldemar will produce a mage that can use a heartstone or we will want an outpost here you have all complained at one point or another about the lack of civilizing amenities here well a heartstone will make those things possible eventually snowfire grimaced and meanwhile wouldnt it attract unwanted attention starfall shook his head and took on a little of that arrogance that seemed to come with being an adept oh do trust me to know my business snowfire by the time i am finished with concealing it only another tayledras adept who knew that it was there would be able to find it i hope youre right snowfire replied never mind what more can you tell me about this enemy mage hes certainly strong enough to be an adept or whatever these barbarians call such a thing starfall folded and refolded the napkin pensively if it came to a fight hes not a match for me but he would exhaust a great deal of my resources in defeating him i dont want to have to do that and to keep from coming into direct conflict i will have to be subtle subtlety requires time and concentration rather than power hes powerful enough that it is going to take all my attention to keep him from breaking the illusion finding our encampment and tapping into the new matrix of leylines and nodes which means when we move against the village you stay here snowfire nodded i rather thought youd say that i can leave someone here on guard if you like why not nightwind and kel starfall suggested shes a good shot and hes worth five fighters in intimidation alone and it would keep him out of close combat now that is a good idea snowfire felt a bit more cheered hed been trying to think of a way to keep the gryphon from flinging himself into situations where hed be a target rather than an asset and this was perfect put him in the air and nightwind at the valley entrance put a couple of hertasi and dyheli in the valley right here around starfalls ekele acting as bodyguards that would work very well no matter how clever enemy fighters were they wouldnt get past the combined senses of a gryphon hertasi and dyheli if somehow there was a concerted attack by a formidable group instead of an incursion of one or two fighters starfall would have warning covering fire and time to escape and kel would rightly see this as a trust and an important assignment which it was rather than an attempt to keep him out of combat which it also was how are the traps coming starfall asked as snowfire ran through his mental roster of hertasi and dyheli and made some tentative selections not so badly that anyone is getting frustrated and not so well that anyone is nervous thinking that things are going too well the hertasi are approaching it with their usual zeal and theyve been making enough trap parts that kels had to struggle to keep up with carrying even with dyheli helping snowfire told him and picked up a small twig to draw in the dirt with heres where the main deadfall will be along the river we got that done first before sunrise this morning we found a place where a flood undermined the sandstone of the bluff and cut under it a little farther if there wasnt a magical prop holding it up now it would be down in an instant there is going to be more than enough stone blocking the path that they arent going to want to go back that way this morning we cut a path and aged it then made things so difficult on either side that they arent going to want to leave it he sketched in the path leading away from the river we put in a log bridge over this ravine here that is going to fall apart as soon as anyone puts a foot on it theyll either have to rebuild the bridge or make a strenuous climb down and back up in either case theyll be tired and itll be dusk by the time they reach this clearing he made a circle and tapped it with the twig then that is where theyll stop starfall eyed it with interest and that is when the hertasi and dyheli begin removing sentries and other woodswanderers and while some of them are doing that the rest of the hertasi will be setting the traps we set up today along the trail they came up from the river on snowfire grinned at starfalls look of surprise exactly no matter which way they try to go in the morning theyll run into mantraps i didnt see any reason to give them an unhindered path in any direction by that time theyll already know theyre under attack so theres no point in putting a lot of effort into making traps that will look like accidents when they trigger these traps theyll know its something left for them by an enemy good so far starfall mused but you cant get all of them with traps so so the mantraps themselves form a channelingtrap tomorrow when we set everything up well be leaving one easier direction here he drew a sweeping arrow toward a patch of green moss theyll come out into the clear with no place to go for cover and a ravine at their back it ought to be no difficult thing for the hertasi to pick them off with bows and at any rate by the time the survivors struggle back to the village the rescue should be long over i like it starfall nodded decisively even if the mage at the village can communicate with the fighters out here they wont be able to get back in time to do him any good itll be the middle of the night and the woods will be full of hertasi with knives and traps just waiting to be sprung snowfire nodded feeling very pleased with himself and to avoid leaving a trail back here to the encampment were going to try to get the villagers across the bridge and take them downriver to that kelmskeep place darian told us of i think if anyone follows us it will be that way and i hope there will be a force to meet us from the valdemarans i have sent a message to lord breon of kelmskeep that reached the place today starfall confirmed but then frowned the thing is i do not know if it will be heeded or even seen by the man himself how did you send it snowfire asked a written message delivered by raven to the gatekeeper this morning raindance saw it through the birds eyes she said he seemed startled starfall shrugged it took the bird this long to reach kelmskeep the best we can hope for i think is that an escorting force meet you on the way snowfire sighed well aware that the adept was right best to count on what they had not what they hoped they would have well i leave all the magic doings in your capable hands he said and i will leave the rest in yours starfall stood up and stretched and walked back into the center of the clearing where he took his seat again and closed his eyes a moment later the containment shield had sprung up around him snowfire whistled to hweel who was still gossiping with the cooperi and the great owl launched himself into the air to follow him back to the main encampment what were you two chattering about he asked his bird you dont usually have that much to say to the day birds mates hweel said shortly then elaborated he may be young but he has a mate he has two fledges this year now flying strong snowfire sensed that there was more and he persisted they come all five his mate mine three fledges hweels mindvoice was tentative as if he was afraid that snowfire would object to the arrival of his mate and young that was the last thing on snowfires mind although he wasnt bonded to hweels mate huur she worked with hweel so effectively when she wasnt tending youngsters that he might just as well have been and having a clumsy fledgling around wasnt a bad thing as long as you could keep the youngster close to the camp ill be glad to see them he replied and sensed the relief in hweels mind lt was clever of you to have his mate come with yours the fledges will have protection by day and night on the journey hweel huured a contented little sound of pleasure from which his mate got her name he liked being praised and he had greatly missed his mate so knowing that snowfire would welcome her arrival made him doubly happy it would be no bad thing to have a couple of unbonded birds along with the expedition either they would make excellent camp guards and if the unthinkable happened and someone lost a bird there would be possible replacements at hand enough concentrate on the immediate problem he reminded himself he needed to collect darian and some paper and a charcoal stick it was time to make a detailed plan of how to get into and out of the village hed left darian about to take his turn in the bathing pool by now the boy should be clean and ready for something to eat snowfire was terribly proud of him for darian had worked as hard as any of them and had mastered his frustration admirably when someone didnt quite understand what it was he wanted for a trap the boy had matured a great deal in the last week though it was clear every so often that he was still a boy when this is over he needs some time to play and be young snowfire concluded to himself but right now well none of them could afford to be anything other than mature and responsible he collected more meat and bread from the stores the berries were gone but when ayshen heard who this next meal was going to he pulled snowfire aside and passed him a honeycake surreptitiously the hatchling didnt get enough the last time i made them ayshen said as if daring him to challenge the statement since snowfire had seen darian stuffing himself with the coveted sweets and knew ayshen knew he had it was clear that the hertasi had taken very strongly to the boy ill make sure he knows who sent it snowfire replied and carried the treasure off hed seen ayshen watching the boy out of the corner of his long eye evidently this was the hertasis way of rewarding hard work he met darian on the path hair damp dressed in fresh clothing here i brought you something to eat snowfire said holding the napkin out to him theres a honeycake in there from ayshen there is darian looked as pleased as if it had been a lump of amber i love ayshens honeycakes where can we go so i can eat and help you with those maps of the village you wanted at the same time lets try the council clearing snowfire suggested theres a game place there that no one is going to be using tonight well have a drawing surface there darian nodded his mouth already full of bread and meat he followed snowfire to the clearing and at the far side snowfire took over the game place a flat sheet of rock balanced on a stump that served as a table and two more stumps one on either side of it he took the taller of the two and darian took the shorter as he spread out the first sheet of paper and took out a scribing rod all right he said making a diagonal line for the bank of the river here is the riverbank lets start there put one edge of the forest here and one here darian suggested pointing with a sticky finger and the bridge would be here he devoured the last crumb of his cake and licked his fingers clean while snowfire sketched right now put the back edge of the forest there the road goes from the bridge to the center of town and stops there heres the mill with the waterwheel there theres the forge snowfire was agreeably surprised at the lads clear and precise ability to remember and place everything in the village but there just werent enough adequate areas of cover to sneak a number of people in without getting caught and heres where the aqueduct starts darian was saying and the words brought him out of his thoughts with a jolt aqueduct he said suddenly interested what aqueduct we use it to bring river water to the fields in summer darian explained see it goes around through the middle of the planted fields then to the cistern house and the watering trough in the center of town and where does it stop snowfire demanded whats it made of it stops at the river i guess darian said confused by the sudden barrage of urgent questions theres a waterlifting wheel beside the mill that brings water up to the aqueduct and that brings the water out of the river down to the fields because its always sloping down from where it starts as for what its made of hollow tree trunk mostly its covered to keep trash out of it is it big enough for a man to crawl in snowfire persisted oh certainly and i see what you want to do suddenly darian was all smiles its absolutely big enough for a man to crawl inside whats more even though we use it all summer i doubt that anyones tending to it now i cant imagine a bunch of barbarians thinking to irrigate the fields and i doubt that anyone in the village is inclined to help them by telling them that the fields need water so it starts at the river snowfire asked where precisely now darians face fell i dont exactly know he confessed its all overgrown there i know its somewhere near the mill but not exactly at least i dont know what the place looks like at night its real tall though because otherwise it wouldnt be able to slope down to the fields but if we can find it we can get right into the heart of the village undetected this was exactly the sort of thing snowfire was looking for darian your memory is so good surely you can remember where the aqueduct starts but darian shook his head unhappily i know what it looks like but i cant tell you where to find it he confessed i only remember that its near the mill not in it he looked up at snowfire hopefully i could guide you though snowfire frowned i dont want you anywhere near possible fighting he objected but if you wont let me guide you how do you expect to convince people you arent a different kind of enemy darian asked shrewdly none of them have ever seen a hawkbrother and theyll probably be frightened of you that was something else snowfire hadnt thought of and he hated to admit it but the boy was probably right still it went against the grain to permit someone as young as darian anywhere near combat he argued with the boy for some time and in the end darian had more good sound reasons why he should go than snowfire had counters for them all right snowfire sighed you can guide us but just to a place of safety mind you arent to rush in and try to help if theres fighting youll only get in the way and you might make someone lose his concentration and his life i promise darian agreed his eyes shining snowfire only hoped that both of them and ultimately the village and the hawkbrothers would not regret this decision seven now in some ways came the worst part all of the traps were constructed and set and now came the waiting daystorm had her birds over the village while starfall created his bait and the nagging question was would their foe take it if he closed his own eyes snowfire could picture the scene as clearly as if he himself were there a flock of five crows perched in a tree above the rooftops of errolds grove an unusually silent gathering but no one in the village seemed to notice either their presence or their silence through their eyes daystorm watched the activity in the village below two of the crows were bonded to her the rest were the offspring of her original pair but all were willing to lend her their eyes and wings especially when the activity at hand promised to be entertaining snowfire occasionally envied the tayledras who bonded to crows and ravens the birds had tremendous senses of humor and as a matter of course when the original bird took a mate the mate also became his or her bondbird sometimes hweels sober dignity was a little wearing and he would have welcomed the raucous hooliganism of a band of crows he would also have welcomed having both halves of a pair as his bondbirds he sometimes worried that having an unbonded mate gave hweel divided loyalties last night the dyheli doe pyreen had taken her place upriver carrying the double burden of an illusion of a heavily guarded caravan and the newlystrengthened powerpoint she had remained stationary until daybreak then moved slowly southward mimicking the plodding pace of heavilyladen mules by then daystorms birds had already been in place to see if the mage somewhere below would take the bait tentative experiments had proven that either the mage could not sense anything different about the bondbirds or that there was enough magical energy in the form of his own changed fighters to mask the magic of the birds and their links to their bondmates to snowfires mind that only confirmed his impression that it had been kelvren that the watchdogs had reacted to and not hweel daystorm was simply sitting quietly with her back braced against a tree at the side of the council circle with an eager audience waiting around her she took it all in stride including the audience there was very little that rattled this experienced scout she sat so quietly that she could have been a painted statue for her chest rose and fell so slowly that it would be very difficult to tell that she was breathing her hair shorn short on the sides cut into a stiff crest on the top and braided in a long tail down her back never moved in the fitful breeze that came with sunrise contributing to the statuelike illusion finally she broke the silence theres some activity around the lutters house daystorm announced someone just dashed out now hes going around to all the houses of the village at a run hes pounding on the doors and shouting something at each house now there are men coming out of the houses one out of each walking fast toward the lutter house well that confirmed the guess that whoever was in command of this force had taken over the lutter house which although it was not the largest was definitely the finest house in the village according to darian lutter had been one of the dyemerchants was still the only merchant in the village and was possibly the wealthiest man in errolds grove before the storms by now of course his store of ready cash was used up but his house and the contents were still the finest in the village so naturally the place would be taken by the most powerful person in the invading forces and that person appeared to be the mage that was good to know but it did leave several questions unanswered there was a question of who was in absolute control was the mage the definitive leader or did he serve a military leader was there more than one mage and if so how powerful were the others so far no recognizable mage had come within view of any of the birds just the usual now daystorm announced snowfire sighed after several days of observation they had a good idea of the usual daily schedule once the sun rose the villagers were roused from sleep by the slavemasters they had all been crammed into the threshing barn which was the least weathertight of all of the village buildings serving merely to keep rain and damp away from grain while it was being threshed from the stalk men women and children were all housed together and at a rough guess the barbarians had managed to round up and take most of the villagers prisoner everyone old and young regardless of physical condition was expected to work in the fields or do menial tasks the numbers didnt add up exactly but there were probably a few special slaves in the houses serving the barbarian leaders and elite fighters and thus exempt from field work the fighters are coming out to practice every morning the fighters had limbering and practice sessions before they ate the fighters were mostly housed in the barns though some of them had taken over the houses that those of higher rank didnt want cramming two and three times as many people into each dwelling as the houses had been intended to hold but from all snowfire knew of their way of life they were used to cramming themselves together like wolves in a winter den and probably didnt think they were suffering from overcrowding after the practice sessions were over and the morning meal distributed and eaten the leaders would pick out men for hunting parties and fishing parties and the rest would be drilled in formationcombat that was quite unlike the barbarians snowfire knew of who fought as individuals rather than groups this signified a new and disturbing development and something that would have to be looked into when he had the time if i ever have the time well hed made notes on all of this and if everything went wrong starfall would take those notes with him as he escaped to safety daystorm collected more of an audience as the morning passed after all the preparations the tayledras were on edge and eager to get into action ayshen had somehow found the time to bake more flatbread and hertasi were passing around rounds of the stuff wrapped around bits of honeycomb snowfire took one and munched it without ever taking his eyes off daystorms face she took one without ever opening her eyes but then she had always had an extra sense where sweets were concerned theyre calling the fighters in to eat still nothing from the lutter house i wish we dared send a bird down to the roof to see if it could overhear anything wintersky muttered to him snowfire nodded agreement he would have given a great deal for a set of ears in or on that house in no way would he have ever endangered a bird by putting one there however some of the barbarians knew what tayledras birds looked like for there had been conflict along the northern ranges with barbarians before this even if it somehow escaped notice that the bird in question was much larger than normal well bored barbarians with bows tended to make targets out of anything that moved including each other they seemed to find it howlingly funny to shoot blunted arrows at each other with the intended target trying to dodge and the bowman trying to hit in an embarrassing and potentially excruciatingly painful place snowfire had spent a great deal of time in the past few days watching their antics through hweels eyes he had noted that they seemed to have done a pretty thorough job of looting the village not that there was much to take clothing that didnt fit or that was for a child or a female was either cut up or put to other purposes tools that werent needed for immediate field work had already gone to the forge presumably to be remade into weapons food and drink were gone of course and there were rapid inroads being made on the ripe stuff in the fields any objects of metal had been melted down either to be made into ingots or into arrowheads livestock had either been eaten or would be soon except for horses which had been taken for the mounted fighters anything valuable was presumably in the hands of the leaders by now there wouldnt be a great deal for the villagers to salvage when this was over hopefully they would be grateful just to escape with their lives ah were getting some activity daystorm exclaimed the leaders are coming out of the house now theyre heading for the fighters theyre shouting orders most of the fighters are running back to the barns except for a couple who are going to the houses oh theyre coming back with the leaders armor and here come the rest of the fighters with theirs everyone is getting into armor no thats not quite right everyone except the mounted fighters is getting into armor theyre getting ready to send out a raiding force i think its working snowfire hes taking the bait sounds to me that since your illusion only shows packanimals hes keeping his mounted troops behind rainwind observed shrewdly to snowfire leaning over and speaking in a low voice to avoid disturbing daystorm that would make sense snowfire agreed it would be best not to risk them on this he knows that his foot troops can easily overtake a packtrain and why take the chance of losing a mounted fighter who is much more expensive to replace than a foot soldier its what id do right theyre all getting into formation strapping on their armor daystorm reported and packs theyre taking light overnight packs so the mage has a pretty good idea of how far the target is likely to get before they reach it snowfire nodded with satisfaction that was good it meant that the mage wouldnt think anything of it when his troops didnt make it back by nightfall daystorm continued to report on preparations and then finally said the words he had been waiting for this is it theyre moving out and theyre taking the river road exactly as we wanted them to excellent he exclaimed it was time for the next stage but he didnt have to tell the others that daystorm would leave her crows standing sentry at the village but winterskys bird would pick up the departing troops as they reached the river hweel had already passed word of the departure to sunstone or rather sunstones falcon sunstone was stationed at the bluff and would trigger the avalanche blocking the road wintersky would count them and pass the number on to sunstone sunstone would wait until the last ranks were in view then let the stone bluff fall they had agreed that although it would be a fine thing if they actually caught some of the enemy under the rockfall they wouldnt actually try for anything more complicated than blocking the path behind them all it would be a disaster to have even one of the enemy fighters left on the village side of the blockage for he would return to get help and the mage would detect the telltale traces of magic in the fallen stone so the rock would fall the enemy force would be whittled down they would soon find that the riverside path that had been so easy to follow deteriorated into a hellish nightmare of washouts slippery rockslides and narrow ledges where only one man at a time could pass the river itself was swift and deep there and anyone who fell in would fall prey to ayshen and his friends nor would bodies bob to the surface with obvious knife wounds for ayshen had weighted ropes to keep them on the river bottom all that anyone above would know was that those who fell or jumped in were pulled under and never reappeared that should thoroughly discourage wouldbe swimmers when a path leading inland appeared it would be welcomed with relief and the steep ravine with its derelict bridge would seem no great obstacle until the men tried to cross it only then would they learn that the sides of the ravine were crumbling clay and gravel and the bottom was a morass of sticky muck as deep as a man was tall or perhaps even deeper it hadnt always been that way but ever since snowfire opened up a spring at the bottom it was as difficult as it was to climb down it was even harder to climb up they probably wouldnt lose any men to the climb but theyd be wet filthy and exhausted before it was over meanwhile the rest of the hertasi and the dyheli were all in place waiting for the exhausted and demoralized enemy troops to get to the spot chosen for the ambush the hertasi were making the place look very attractive without making it look like a trap signs of old campfires and just enough deadfall wood piled up would leave the impression that others perhaps the very caravan they were following had camped here before there was a clear cold spring near enough to the campsite that someone should stumble over it and between that ready source of water and the wood already at hand the situation should be too tempting to resist but that would be for later tonight now it would be another long wait until the enemy troops marched past sunstone late this afternoon now that everyone knew the enemy was on the move the group waiting around daystorm broke up snowfire looked up to find darian at his elbow waiting patiently for the scout to notice him what is it little brother snowfire asked do you wish to change the plan for tonight no darian exclaimed no i mean i i am afraid im scared but i dont want to back out or anything i just i just need something to do snowfire understood only too well the need to have something to do before a planned engagement but he was at a loss to think of anything finally he had an inspiration please practice those exercises in magic i have shown you he said earnestly and try to think of ways in which they could be used tonight we will need every weapon at our disposal remember what i said about the way that a small application of magic can be used to a great effect darian grimaced a little but nodded and trailed off to find a quiet place in which to practice hweel hweels mate huur and their young fledgling watched him move off with unblinking gazes then huur yawned hugely her youngster did the same a moment later and both of them shut their eyes and hunched their heads down to sleep they had arrived last night and were probably exhausted they had certainly eaten hugely of the bounty that an excited hweel had provided for them hweel practically radiated contentment as he sat beside his mate and their bumbling youngster huur was considerably larger than hweel as was usually the case with birds of prey and snowfire paused to consider whether he really wanted huur to bond with him after all hweel was quite a burden huur would be worse well it wasnt within his power to decide one way or another it was the birds decision not his and meanwhile hweel was overjoyed to have her beside him and that was no bad thing snowfire had his own ritual of preparation to begin he had things timed to a nicety so that his hours would be occupied and his mind would not be idle to make up scenarios of disaster first he ran through his own magic practice though he didnt have to think of ways in which small magics would be useful in tonights raid for he had plenty of experience along those lines all the while he practiced he sat across from daystorm with one ear cocked in case she said anything about activity in the village he put himself through his paces pushing to speed up the time it took for him to work a particular piece of magic by even a fraction of a breath that was always what he worked toward it would be useless to try for more power for he had reached the limits of his ability there but it was always possible to try for more speed by the time he was done it was about noon he left daystorms side just long enough to collect food for himself daystorm and starfall he left starfalls ration just outside the containment shield though starfall was so deep in concentration that the adept never noticed he was there that was all right the food was covered and would keep and starfalls bird would keep pests from carrying it off then he took daystorms ration to her and the scout accepted it with thanks theres nothing unusual going on at all she said tearing off a strip of dried meat with her strong white teeth she looked very much like a fox when she did that and snowfire wondered if she knew it the only thing going on is that the mounted fighters are all practicing mostly on each other i think theyre pleased that the foot soldiers are gone it gives them more space to practice in thats probably true he agreed and grinned lets hope they forget its practice and take out a few of their own she laughed and he turned his attention to his bondbird how close are they to the trap he asked hweel who was in contact with all of the bondbirds close hweel told him and showed him what rainwinds falcon saw from high above so high that the men below her would not see even a speck in the sky overhead it would not be long now until the first of the troops reached the undermined section of bluff theyre getting close he said aloud to daystorm keep a close eye on the lutter house if this mage has any way of communicating with the other troops well find out about it soon he held to the vision of the river road as seen through the eyes of the circling falcon watching as the antlike foreshortened figures crept along at a maddeningly slow pace the falcon knew exactly where the fall was to take place and centered her circle on that part of the bluff there was no way to communicate with sunstone but part of snowfire ached with tension hoping he would not drop the rockfall too soon the tiny figures crawled onward completely unaware of what waited for them half of them were past the bluff now with most of the rest beneath the area where the rock would come down most of the rest not yet sunstone not yet let them pass now they were either past the fall area or within it but there was always the chance that the rock would not fall as they thought letting one or two escape not yet not yet there the last of them was past the halfway point a little puff of dust at the base of the bluff was all the warning snowfire had sunstone had released the fall it began slowly as these things always did a trickle of rock from the top a rumbling sound then the first signs of the slide most of the enemy fighters reacted immediately they looked up and ran downriver away from the village three hesitated started to run toward the village as snowfire bit off a curse suddenly as a few rocks hit the trail in front of them they paused and reversed themselves but that hesitation was fatal in the next instant they were buried beneath a cascade of dirt and rock that ran out into the river a huge cloud of dust rose and obscured everything even for a falcons sharp eyes and snowfire waited impatiently for it to clear finally the strong breeze from upriver cleared it away and he saw that there would be no passage back across that fall for anyone they had managed to drop far more than he had estimated across the roadway until it all settled it would be insane to try and climb it the enemy fighters milled around the edge as if wondering whether they should make some attempt to rescue their three companions evidently they decided against it or their leaders did for after a bit more confused meandering they formed back up into ranks and moved out along the river again snowfire broke contact with the falcon with a feeling of fierce pleasure the first stage worked perfectly he told daystorm any sign from the mage that he knows what happened she shook her head nothing at all out of the ordinary she reported you ought to check with starfall though he might have noticed something that was an excellent idea and he was not at all loath to follow it he brushed the dust off his trews and loped up the trail to starfalls ekele hoping that the adept was not too lost in his work to speak to him as it happened starfall was just finishing the last of his rations and greeted snowfire with a wave of his hand weve dropped the bluff it worked perfectly and they lost three in the rockfall snowfire reported have you noticed anything from the mage only that hes trying harder than before to take control of the lines and nodes from me starfall replied hes getting aggressive i think hes getting extra energy from his fighters are they doing anything unusual only the mounted ones are left daystorm says theyre practicing against each other and thats unusual because there isnt a lot of room for them to practice ordinarily snowfire cocked his head to the side from what i saw the mounted fighters are the least disciplined would that be enough to generate extra energy for him probably it isnt a lot but these days when there isnt a lot of energy to be had a mage would grasp at anything starfall blinked and rubbed his eyes at least he isnt practicing bloodsacrifice ill say this much for the barbarians so far as i know they dont tend to stoop to that theyll use the power generated by slaughter on a battlefield but they wont practice bloodsacrifice or at least not of humans he grimaced lets hope this lot runs true to form darian would never forgive us if anything like that happened starfall muttered and shook his head well hes due for another try and i need to be on guard keep me informed if you can starfall raised the containment shield again and sank back into his trance snowfire left him with his falcon standing watch and returned to daystorm i think you can drop the close watch on the village he told her starfall says the mage hasnt reacted to what we did at all she sighed with relief oh good if i dont get myself stretched out i wont be any use for the raid ill leave the hooligans in place i dont need them here and theyll call me if something catches their attention good plan he said approvingly and went to check on the others wintersky had taken charge of building their packs each of them would carry an identical load of climbing staff short bow arrows and throwing darts the idea was not to get into combat if they could avoid it the idea was to free the slaves and guard their backtrail snowfire wished he had some other sort of magic than the type he had it would have been so useful to be able to turn water into drugged brandywine and arrange for the remaining barbarians to find it seventeen tayledras and one adopted boy would be the whole of their army nightwind and kel would remain behind to guard starfall with five dyheli and three of the most timid of the hertasi wintersky had finished seven of the packs with ten more to go he was checking each and every weapon with utmost care as he packed it and there was a small pile of rejected arrows beside him snowfire didnt interrupt he had the job well in hand seventeen against how many we must be mad yet if they could just avoid rousing anything or anyone the odds of pulling this off were good or at least they werent insurmountable time to check on someone whose optimism more than equals my pessimism he left wintersky and took the path that led to the pools and kelvren the only quiet place to practice was beside the bathing pools and darian was more than tired of repeating his tiny magics over and over when kelvren provided a welcome interruption what passsesss brrrancherrr the gryphon called as he flew low over the pool craning his neck to the side to keep his eyes on darian when darian waved at him the gryphon executed a slow and graceful gliding turn then backwinged to a perfect oneclaw landing on the rock edge of the pool beside darian darian had to duck his head and shield his eyes against the dust storm kicked up by the gryphons wingbeats but he grinned a greeting anyway nothing much passes except time and thats passing too slowly he complained as the gryphon settled himself with a couple of crisp wingflicks he noticed that kel had a bundle in his right front talon which he placed on the ground behind the rocks just out of sight i want to do something not just sit here i agrrree kel responded readily but i happen to have sssomething you can do do you sssuppossse you could give me a hand with grrrrooming nightwind isss bussy prreparring herrr weaponsss the herrrtasssi arrre all gone orrrr busssy and i am no grrryfalcon to have handsss that hold toolsss well help kelvren in a heartbeat darian was absolutely thrilled to be asked and jumped to his feet prepared to do anything that kel requested do i need to get anything special he asked anxiously the featheroil or anything not featherrroilsss the gryphon replied i have everrrything well need thisss will be battle preparrrationsss with his foreclaw the gryphon picked up the bag which he put down in front of darian he opened it and spread out the contents on the ground it contained the usual brushes and combs but also held files a thin and flexible chest protector that was clearly made to fit over the chestplate on kels harness and a set of sharp metal clawsheaths thessse fit overrr the talonssss kel said indicating the metal sheaths youll have to file my talonsss to fit they arrre a bit longerrr than they werrre when i wasss fitted with thessse darian picked up the set of three files and the rightside set of sheaths and went to work as kel advised and corrected what he was doing he found that if he sat just under the gryphons chin with his back against kels chest they were both able to see what was going on clearly and were more comfortable it was very pleasant sitting there with his back against the feathery warmth of his friend working diligently with the files on the shining black talons he could almost forget why they were making these preparations he couldnt help thinking what the other boys of errolds grove would say if they saw what he was doing now wouldnt their eyes just pop they wouldnt believe what they were seeing imagine me helping take care of a real live gryphon why next thing ill be helping trap a snowdrake or something the talonsheaths fit over each claw and were held in place with a glovelike web of fine strong leather straps the workmanship was really ingenious and the articulation was perfect the sheaths didnt really extend the length of the talons all that much so kel would still be able to walk land and pick things up when darian finished fitting the whole contraption to kels right leg the gryphon had what was effectively a set of four singleedged knives on the end of his leg not only did each sheath taper to a point as sharp as a needle but the first third of each had a real sharpened edge for slashing kel flexed his foot and looked at it with a mixture of pride and chagrin his huge golden eyes blinking slowly as he admired the shining metal now covering each talon harrrd to walk in thessse becaussse of all the damage you dont want me anywherrre nearrr a tent forrr insssstancsse sssstill they prrrotect my rrreal talonsss metal wont brrreak the way a talon can and obviousssly a weapon cant chop one off darian nodded soberly and set to work on the leftside set id hate to see how awful it would be if a talon did get chopped off he could bleed to death much better to have the sheaths even if they were a bit awkward to wear when he finished kelvren reared up on his hindquarters and made a few experimental slashes in the air perrrfect he said with a gleeful sparkle in his eyes you may be my trrrondiirrrn any time oh i dont know about that darian replied blushing with awkward pleasure i dont know a fraction of what nightwind knows and anyway any of the hertasi could have helped you just as well lets get this chest thing on you all right sssurrrely kel agreed dropping back down to all fours it goesss onto the harnessss ssssee the bucklesss then the neckpiecssse wrrrapsss arrrround the thrrroat the protective armor would never withstand the blows of a sword or ax but it would protect against arrows it was made of overlapping articulated plates of a light strong metal totally unfamiliar to darian backed with a thin leather that was the toughest such substance darian had ever seen unlike the talons which were a satin finished highlypolished silver the chest protector was a matte black and would not betray kel by reflecting light the whole thing didnt even weigh as much as a single ordinary breastplate for a smallish human but then it would have to be light if kel was going to fly while wearing it when darian finished buckling it onto the harness kel gave himself a tremendous shake to settle it and had him tighten two or three straps then shook himself again urrrr he said clicking his beak meditatively not the mossst comforrrtable thing to wearrr but then i have hearrrd the human sssilverrrsss sssay the sssame of theirrr arrrmorrr it could be worse you could have a helmet and a stomach plate and things darian pointed out kel shook his head comically i think not the gryphon exclaimed i would not be able to walk much lessss fly thisss isss bad enough and i would not wearrr it had nightwind not insssisssted i fearrr it looksss rrridiculousss well you look tremendously warlike to me darian told him stepping back to admire him from a little distance very impressive terrifying in fact oh do i kel exclaimed ingenuously pleased terrrifying trrruly truly darian told him if i were the enemy id take one look at you and run i wouldnt stick around to find out what you could do to me and the gryphon did make a daunting sight with the metal breastplate and neck guard forming what appeared to be a seamless black shell over his chest and neck one claw upraised and the metal talons gleaming wickedly in the sun it was no exaggeration to say that kel would probably have frightened any of the errolds grove militia members into scuttling back to the village metaphorical tail between his legs but would he have the same effect on the barbarians the plain truth was virtually anything the militia thought of as a monster had sent them scuttling back to the safety of the village what did he know about fighting only what hed heard and read in books i just hope we never find out darian thought keeping his doubts to himself id rather not know than have those barbarians turn up here i think if i was starfall i would feel completely secure with you on watch he said aloud i wouldnt need anybody else rrreally kel arched his neck and his eyes pinned with excitement you arrre too kind i am only a verrry juniorrr sssilverrr i agree with him nightwind said emerging from the shadows of the path you look quite formidable kel starfall will feel quite secure with you on guard and rightly so youre going to do a fine job kels neck arched a little more and he practically purred thank you he said i hope yourrr confidencssse is jussstified nightwind smiled im a trondiim remember ive served quite a few gryphons in the past i have no doubt of it in darians opinion nightwind herself looked just as formidable as the gryphon she had a breastplate made much like his with gauntlets to match a light helm and a bow that darian would never dream of being able to string much less draw he couldnt see the businessend of the arrows she carried in a quiver at her belt but he had no doubt that they were more of the nasty mankilling type that the tayledras were using tonight her hair had been braided back tightly into a nononsense knot at the nape of her neck and there wasnt a single extraneous bead or feather on her spare uniformlike costume like kel her breastplate had a badge embossed on it and he peered at it curiously she noted where his eyes went and smiled this is the badge of the silver gryphons she told him the fingers of one hand lightly caressing the edge of the emblem kel and i are both silvers the only ones in the group i dont think they quite realize yet what that means why isnt anyone else he asked she chuckled because we are the only two kaledain here she told him we arent tayledras at all or rather the tayledras used to be kaledain but the gryphon waved a claw interrupting her you arrre confusssing him kel chided darrrian it isss sssimple long ago therrre wasss one people the kaledain when the cataclyssssm wasss overrr that people wasss sssunderrred the kaledain clan klessshya wasss farrr separrrated frrrom the otherrrsss and thossse within it did not even know if the rrresst had ssssurrrvived sssso they went to sssaferrr landsss wessst and sssouth and became the allliesss of the black kingsss forrr the otherrrr clansss it was differrrent theirrr homelandsss werrre dessstrrroyed ssso they found when they went to look the otherrrsss quarrrelled overrr the ussse of magic thossse who wanted to continue the ussse of it became the tayledrrrasss and thossse who wissshed to ssshun it became the sssshinain but because your people werent fighting over whether or not to use magic you stayed kaledain darian asked scratching his head but if your people went so far away why are you here because we decided that the moment was right to come back north and see what time had made of the lands we left nightwind told him and smiled ruefully little did we guess that wed end up being here at the beginning of another cataclysm at least some of us managed to prevent this one anyway kels version is a very abbreviated one and at some point youll have to hear the whole story prrrobably frrrom one of the kyrrree hissstorrrykeeperrrs kel said meditatively examining his steelsheathed talons becaussse asss sssoon asss they learrrn you do not know the tale you will have no choicsse but to hearrr it nightwind burst out laughing as if kel had said something terribly funny darian couldnt make out just what the joke was but laughed politely anyway well the point is that only the kaledain have the silver gryphons nightwind continued wiping her eyes with the back of her hand they serve a lot of the same functions that your heralds do peacekeepers border guards and as the kaledain militia some day ill tell you why things turned out that way but the fact is that of all the people on this expedition kel and i are the only true warriors mind you some of the others snowfire in particular have seen combat but were the only ones actually trained as warriors one corner of her mouth quirked in an ironic smile to tell you the truth i dont think snowfire quite realizes that about me he still thinks im just an empath and kels attendant we havent had to get our battle gear out before this not that it matterrrsss kel added thisss isss what we prrrrobably would have volunteerrred forrr if he hadnt asssked usss i am a bit larrrge to hide in a waterrrrcourrrse and we are the best sort of guards he could have on starfall nightwind finished thats one of the things were trained for there is always a set of gryphons acting as bodyguards to our chief ally among the black kings but a new set of dazzling possibilities had opened up to darian could i be a silver some day he asked breathlessly now that is an interesting thought nightwind replied looking at him with surprise i never considered that possibility yes i suppose you could youre far too young right now but once youre at the age where we accept candidates you could train as a silver if you still want to be one being a mage would be an advantage kel added his eartufts pricked forward with interest magessss in the sssilverrsss learrrn combatmagicsss verrry ssspecializssed ssstuff it would mean anotherrr ssseverrral yearrrs of ssschooling now that was a daunting thought more training but it might be worth it you certainly dont have to make up your mind right now nightwind said before he could even begin to consider the ramifications of the offer lets get through this then finish up this expedition by the time we get back to tayledras territory youll have a better idea of what you want to do and if that includes joining the silvers kel and i will see that you get a chance to apply and train he stammered his thanks and helped nightwind pack up the grooming utensils aware in a dazzled fashion that he had gone in the past few days from having no choice in his future life to having a bewildering array of choices he did not remain dazzled for long first we have to get through this then i have to make sure that no one in errolds grove thinks he still has any claims on me then then i have to learn how to be a mage and a hawkbrother the enormity of the tasks still ahead of him sobered him quickly he glanced up at the sun and judged that someone would probably come looking for him shortly i ought to go find snowfire he began snowfire has already found you nightwind chuckled and pointed over his shoulder he turned and saw the senior scout coming out into the sunlight by the side of the pool the hawkbrother eyes widened in surprise at the sight of kel and nightwind though his lips curved in a slow smile welladay he said with appreciation in his voice i find all three of the folk i needed to gather and all in one spot very efficient pure coincidence nightwind pointed out but as you can see we are ready to take our posts whenever youre ready snowfire told her with a little salute unless you can think of anything you need to know ill leave you to handle the business of guarding starfall as you see fit darian had the feeling that snowfire had intended to give kel and nightwind some careful instructions and on being confronted by a pair of properly equipped professionals had quickly revised his plans thank you for your confidence snowfire nightwind said without a hint of her usual irony i hope we will prove worthy of it now i take it that you have come to fetch your guide i have he said and turned his attention to darian i hope you are ready little brother because we need to set off soon if we are to be in place after dark darian nodded unable to trust his voice for he knew that the fear rising within him would make it shake even if he wasnt brave he didnt want snowfire to guess i have to go through with this i let justyn down im not going to do that to snowfire come then the hawkbrother said nightwind kelvren wind to thy wings good hunting kel said as nightwind sketched a salute to both of them with a sly wink to darian that made him feel a little better he managed to get out a proper farewell and followed in snowfires wake to where the rest of the hawkbrothers were gathered his heart was in his mouth and he felt queasy but what needed to be done would be done for the most part the journey was a blur to darian the hawkbrothers set a pace he would never have been able to match if he had not been riding the horse stolen from the barbarians he could not for a moment imagine how they managed to keep up that steady lope for furlong after furlong with hweel and huur providing eyes ahead they kept up the grueling trek long after sunset and finally came to a halt somewhere in the deep woods after full darkness fell darian you must get off the horse now whispered wintersky who had been holding the beast by a lead rope to prevent it from bolting off the way it had the last time we will turn the beast loose here for we are now going down to the river darian dismounted stiffly the horses trot had not been a comfortable gait especially not for someone who never had been much of a rider wintersky untied the rope from the horses bridle and used it to flick the beast on the flank with an indignant squeal it trotted off into the darkness leaving them all standing beside one of the enormous trees beneath the whisper of wind in the leaves above darian heard the sound of the river it couldnt be too far off then they were very near their goal the end of the aqueduct that carried water to the village come snowfire whispered somehow he had replaced wintersky at darians side do not fear to keep up we must go slowly now avoiding the sentries as gruelingly swift as the pace had been before it was now just as agonizingly slow the hawkbrothers moved from cover to cover slipping in and out of the shadows like silent shadows themselves and far quieter than darian was darian winced every time he stepped on a rock or a twig for the sounds he made sounded as loud as shouts in the relative peace of the forest but there were other things making sounds out here he was amazed to realize how loud deer were as they came across a pair of does and a fawn feeding hed always thought that deer moved silently but they tramped through the sparse underbrush as noisily as he at last they reached the river itself with no signs of sentries that darian could see but then what did he know hweel huur and snowfire were probably the only ones who would know where sentries were and the point was to avoid them the brush along the rocky riverbank was much thicker than under the heavy shade of the great trees they had more cover to hide in but there were more branches to snap leaves to rustle and rocks to trip over wintersky found a game trail that wound in and out of the bushes often requiring that they go on all fours to keep their heads below the covering undergrowth darian discovered that he had his hands full just following in his wake without making too terrible a noise the river here did not make enough sound to mask their passage though swift and deep there were no rocks or deep bends to cause even a ripple along its tranquil surface a chilling damp breeze rose from its surface penetrating darians clothing it seemed to darian that they had been moving so long that it must surely be dawn and yet by the stars it could not possibly have been much later than midnight when he felt snowfire stop and crouch under the shadow of a bush he stopped as well then felt snowfires hand reach back and tug at his shoulder obedient to the signal he crept forward to peer out at whatever it was that snowfire was looking at is this the place the scout breathed into his ear he squinted and peered out into the darkness straining his ears as well as his eyes when the dark bulk ahead of him failed to resolve into anything he recognized it was his ears that told him they had reached their goal a rhythmic splashing the creaking of wet wood the steady trickle of water they had reached the aqueduct and the water wheel that fed it he put his mouth to snowfires ear this is the place he whispered snowfire nodded and motioned to him to be silent he froze where he was and tried to ignore the three or four insects that decided to negotiate the new piece of territory his legs that had suddenly appeared in front of them he was just glad that snowfire had given him a handful of aromatic herbs to rub all over himself before they left for most of the insects had left him alone tonight finally after what seemed far too long a time snowfire motioned him forward and slipped out into the open himself now for the first time in days darian found himself on totally familiar ground the wooden aqueduct hung above their heads dripping fairly steadily he followed the sounds of dripping until his outstretched hands encountered the ladder that led to the first cleanout door up above he took a chance that one word wouldnt betray them here he whispered harshly and was suddenly surrounded by seventeen hawkbrothers he scrambled up the ladder and felt for the catch that released the door the aqueduct wouldnt have worked for a week if it hadnt been covered to keep leaves and trash out nevertheless things did manage to get in and moss and algae grew in the trough hatches had to be made to permit occasional cleaners usually older more responsible children to scrub the troughs to avoid accidents with overcurious or adventurous younger children the catches were reasonably tricky darian had already served one stint as a cleaner that was how he knew where the catches were and how to open them he had a moment of panic when the mechanism jammed and refused to open but after some desperate prying and jiggling it broke loose and let him lift the hatch up with a sigh of relief he lifted the heavy hatch off to the side darian listened for a moment to the cold water running inside and permitting himself a shiver climbed in he was immediately soaked to midcalf in very cold water but he knew that before they reached the village hed be soaked clear through he dropped to his hands and knees and crawled into the tunnel formed by the trough of the aqueduct and the arch of the roof above it as he crawled forward into the darkness he felt someone immediately behind him now they were all relying on him to pick the right branching the right one would bring them out in the village to the village cistern house right beside the horse trough the wrong one would send them out into the fields somewhere none of the lefthand branchings he reminded himself those all go out to the fields as he crawled he tried not to think about his surroundings it was so dark in here that he couldnt see even a glimmer of light it was cold there was water up to his chest and the roof of the aqueduct pressing into the back of his head and someone hadnt done his job because the floor was slimy with algae he tried to remind himself that it could have been worse things but as he started to shiver that thought wasnt at all comforting its the second righthand branching im sure of it but the longer he crawled the less sure he became was it the second hed been crawling an awfully long time and hed only come to one place where the aqueduct opened up to the right what if hed missed it what if hed gone too far what if they were already crawling off over the fields of barley and turnips then just as he was beginning to panic and thinking about trying to get everyone to crawl backward so he could recheck where theyd been his hand encountered emptiness and water where the wooden wall had been he stopped and reached back with his foot to signal that theyd come to the turning he felt a hand grab his foot and squeeze he moved into the right branch and continued the crawl forward here at least the cleaners had done their job slime gave way to clean wood under his palms and he sighed with relief this must be the correct branch it was the only one that got scoured religiously for it not only fed the horse trough but was the main water supply for the whole village but now he had new worries he froze suddenly they were no longer alone he heard the guards before he saw signs of them heard their voices echoing toward him down the hollow wooden tube he froze in place afraid that they had already caught the sounds of hands and knees shuffling through the water above their heads in another moment he saw little flickering bits of light reflected in the water coming through cracks and crevices in the aqueduct cover theyre going to hear us they have some magic or another yip dog that will sense the hawkbrothers they have a real dog that will smell us up here it was all he could do to keep from shouting in panic as the lights drew nearer as he felt the walls pressing in on him he began to shiver even harder and clenched his teeth tightly to keep them from chattering then miraculously the lights and voices passed right on by he hardly believed it at first and only a sharp prod from behind got him going again twice more lights and voices approached and passed and twice more they all froze in place waiting shivering in the cold water at long last his hand encountered the end of the aqueduct they were in the cistern house where the aqueduct spilled into a storage cistern which in turn led to the horse trough outside the cistern house he hung onto the end of the trough and lowered himself down into the cistern being careful not to make more of a splash than the water pouring into the cistern already made one by one the rest of the hawkbrothers followed first into the cistern then shivering and chilled onto the floor of the cistern house beside him i want you to stay here snowfire said in his ear keep out of sight youve done all you need to he nodded his teeth clenched to keep them from chattering he couldnt have replied if hed wanted to for he was shivering too hard and not just with cold he shouldnt stay here hissed someone else theres no place to hide and only one way in or out and if anyone comes in here after water theyre going to find him snowfire growled but reluctantly agreed let me have hweel check the stable silence then except for the sound of falling water and occasional voices outside the cistern house darian was in a constant state of terror lest some drunkard stumble to douse his head and find them all there at long last snowfire spoke again darian go to the stable he ordered hweel says that there are no humans quartered in there nothing but horses you should be safe enough at this time of night and its halfway between the threshing barn and here we can get you on our way out of the village darian just nodded and waited while the others slipped out two and three at a time his gut clenched tight all the while how am i going to get out of here he asked himself once the last of them were gone i cant move and hide like they can somebody is going to see me for sure as if to underscore that fear he heard precisely what he had feared most to hear the sound of three or four drunken men approaching the cistern house talking loudly in some foreign babble were they coming here where could he hide could he get inside the cistern would they see him if he did as he felt blindly about for the edge of the cistern his hand encountered a bucket that had been left behind and suddenly a plan burst in on his mind in a blaze of illumination quickly he grabbed the bucket filled it at the cistern and just as the men reached the door he opened it trudging openly out into the square with his heavy sloshing bucket exactly as he had hoped the men ignored him he was just another slave and a child at that insignificant and unworthy of a moments thought they shoved past him and as he trudged away he heard them splashing and choking in the water trying to sober themselves up ugh its a good thing that from there the water goes to the horse trough but if i was a horse i wouldnt want to drink it after theyd had their dirty heads in it he continued to trudge toward the stable carrying the buckethandle in both hands hoping that no one would notice his long knife at his side the only weapon he had with him snowfire wouldnt let him have anything else and at the time he had thought it a pitiful excuse for a weapon but he rather doubted that these people allowed their slaves to have anything as dangerous as a knife at last he reached the shelter of the stable he put down the bucket opened the door picked the bucket back up and slipped inside just in case hweel had been mistaken he wanted an excuse to be here and a bucket of water was a perfectly good excuse but it was black in there without even a nightlamp that meant that there was nothing and no one waiting except for horses he waited for his eyes to adjust to the dark listening to them stamping and blowing breathing in the scent of horse sweat and hay once he could see a little he walked up to the nearest stall each of the stalls had an outside halfdoor so that the upper half could be left open for ventilation and in this weather the upper doors were left open all night so the horses got air the beast on the other side of the stall door seemed far too large for the stall hed been put in darian stared at him in awe he was huge bigger than any horse hed ever seen before and a true warhorse every stall in the small stable was full and it was quite clear why the barbarians had put their beasts here instead of using the place to quarter more fighters these horses must easily have been worth a small fortune apiece they were certainly worth more than a simple foot soldier or even a squad of them darian put his bucket down and closed the door then felt for the ladder built into the wall beside him and climbed up into the loft where the hay was stored moving carefully and feeling for each rung to keep from making any noise he would have a good vantage point and a comfortable place to wait as well both loft doors were open to the night air and he got down on his stomach and wormed his way over to the one that pointed in the direction of the threshing barn loose hay covered the floor to the depth of his knees in the middle and his neck on either side mice skittered about in the hay in the silence he heard two of them fighting voicing their anger in tiny squeaks he settled in with his nose barely poking up above the sill of the door and strained eyes and ears trying to penetrate the night the plan called for the hawkbrothers to get to the threshing barn remove any guards that were there and free the villagers wintersky and raindance would lead them through the village across the bridge to the road on the other side of the river and upriver to kelmskeep snowfire and the others would form a rear guard to deal with pursuit nothing in the plan called for actually attacking the barbarians except in the person of the guards watching the captives at the time darian had been disappointed but now he was relieved trapped inside the cistern house he had suddenly become aware that he was one young boy surrounded by many many strange hostile men who would not think twice about killing him once again he felt his insides go to water felt the fear he had experienced when the barbarian army attacked this was not the time or place for a confrontation and now he was glad that snowfire had already made up his mind about that i just wish someone could have told the enemy so wed be sure that they would leave us alone suddenly the peaceful night was split by flashes of red orange and green light and a roar as deafening as the worst thunderstorm hed ever lived through darian stifled a yelp and winced away from the door but immediately reversed himself and peeked back over the top of the sill something awful must have happened out there it was all coming from the direction of the threshing barn and he knew with a thrill of dread that the enemy had not gone along with the plan of avoiding confrontation more brilliant flashes of light lit the village below followed by more tfiundering noises and men boiled out of the nearby houses like so many angry hornets streaming from a disturbed hive his heart pounded and there was a metallic taste in the back of his mouth he began to sweat and had to clench his hands on the sill to keep from jumping up and running out there what do i do where do i go nothing in the plan told him what to do now dont panic think of something he didnt dare move from where he was and yet there must be something he could do if i can stop some of these men delay them if only i had a sling or a rope to trip them with what had he learned how to raise things how to heat water and call fire how to sense magic and wait a minute if i can raise things can i keep them down too late to guess he just had to try spurred by fear and excitement he reached out with his tiny spark of magic toward one of the barbarians running below him and momentarily glued his toe to the ground the man tripped and fell heavily taken too much by surprise to fall properly and darian heard something break with a dry crack though whether it was a bone or a weapon he couldnt tell the man staggered to his feet dazed and stumbled off he was clearly not in a condition to fight now and might not be for a while encouraged darian did it again and once again it worked sending the man crashing headlong into the ground and driving all the breath from his body this one was stunned and only moved feebly rather than trying to get up it took him a long time to get to his feet and lurch away darian tried the trick again and yet again with equal or better success it was working he was doing something if only he knew what was going on out there there was more light real fire this time rising above the roofs of the nearest buildings the harsh smell of smoke and the sounds of shouts and screams in the distance where the barn stood he could not tell what was going on except that the quiet raid had become a fullscale confrontation and that was not good there were no more barbarians where darian could see them and he realized belatedly just how exposed his position was he wormed his way back into the loose hay pulling it up over himself until there was hay all around him to the depth of a pitchforks tines he could still see out the loft door but now he was peeking out from under the hay like a mouse in a burrow he got under cover just in time someone with a magelight following him ran toward the stable and by the long robes the man was wearing he was not one of the hawkbrothers nor one of the barbarian fighters the stable door slammed open as darian lost sight of the man then slammed shut again he heard a thud the creak of wood and a voice uttering what sounded like curses and heavy steps on the ladder he was shudderingly grateful for the cover of the hay as the magelight popped over the side of the loft and the entire loft lit up as brightly as day more heavy steps a shadow passed over dalians hiding place and the man stepped into darians lineofsight he blocked about half of darians view but darian had a very good view of him tall a bit less muscular than the barbarian fighters but just as shaggy and bearded he wore an outlandish reddishbrown robe with a design pieced into it in dark brown leather it appeared to be the stylized head and forequarters of some beast but what darian couldnt tell there was a pendant around his neck that swung into view as he turned a sundisk with the rays in metal but the disk in black an eclipse all his attention was centered outside which was a very good thing as darian was in plain sight from where he stood if he chose to look in that direction is this the mage it must be whats that pendant mean is it magic darian tentatively stretched his new magicsense toward the man and he was all but blinded he shielded himself again as hed been taught and lay there dazed i think this is the mage all right and the man was doing something he had his hands cupped in front of him and he was muttering and from a point just below them darian heard an ominous deep sound of growling and the noise of very heavy feet shuffling away hes hes got monsters hes turning monsters loose the hawkbrothers had no warning of this bad enough that they were facing half an army but no one had thought about facing monsters too he had to do something he had to he couldnt let snowfire down the way hed failed justyn the man was still muttering probably calling up another monster darian couldnt wait any longer with a yell he leaped out of the hay pulling his knife at the same time the man turned quick as a thought but only in time to keep from getting knocked out of the loft door darian hit him with a shock his right shoulder nearly wrenched out of its socket as the man deflected it they both went down in the hay with darian on top he tried to bring up his knife to finish things but the man seized his wrist and rolled to the right now darian was underneath the man tried to get the knife away from him bashing his hand down uselessly into the soft hay his knees digging into darians stomach darian squirmed trying to break his hold and get away and the man held off darians knife hand with his right and got his left around darians throat and began to squeeze he couldnt breathe his throat was agony his chest fek as if it were going to burst his blood pounded in his ears he writhed and twisted clawed for the man with his free hand kicked and thrashed while the man held him down and throttled him dalians mouth opened but nothing eame out his eyes felt as if they were going to pop out of his head his ears and face burned and he couldnt hear anything but a roaring his vision went red then began to tunnel until all he could see was the mans impassive bearded face and that was starting to black out then with no warning the man let him go and flung himself backward darian rolled out of the way coughing and gasping and looked up to see huur attached to the mans scalp flapping her wings furiously and digging bloody furrows along his forehead with her talons she must have come in the hayloft door she saved me the man was screaming at the top of his lungs and flailing at the bird with his fists she in her turn battered him with powerful strokes of her wings disorienting him belatedly darian realized he had to get out of there she hadnt managed a killing hold she couldnt hang onto him forever and once she let go he was free to go after darian again darian scrambled for the ladder and slid down it with his feet braced on the outside of the uprights and his hands slowing him he had lost his knife somewhere he didnt know where but right now all he wanted was to get away but the door was closed and the bar was down across it the magelight dropped down into the stable and the man stopped screaming huur must have let him go please please dont let her be hurt the horses were all frantically stomping and neighing upset by the commotion and wanting to take their agitation out on something or someone the mage would be down there any moment where can i hide that he cant find me there wasnt much room in the tiny stable and with the horses ready to kick anything that stood in their path the horses yes he darted along the center aisle throwing open the doors to the stalls as he went the horses hadnt been tied and once they felt space behind them they kicked and backed out into the aisle then proceeded to fight with each other milling and squealing and providing a barrier of large and angry bodies between darian and the ladder just as he opened the last stall he spotted the mages feet on the ladder and he saw a pitchfork leaning against the back wall he seized it and darted into the last stall dangerously close to the horse that was vacating it fortunately the horse was more interested in getting a piece of one of his rivals than in stomping darian into the straw this stall had no halfdoor at the back and neither did the one opposite it there would be no escape that way as he cowered in the back of the stall pitchfork clutched in his trembling hands he heard the mages voice roaring over the squealing and bugling of the fighting horses and the thud of hooves on wood he heard the louder sound of the stable doors slamming open and then the noise of a riding whip on flesh and the thunder of hooves receding the mage had opened the stable doors and was driving out the horses soon he would come looking for darian ill only get one chance at this darian broke out into a cold sweat shaking all over but his mind seemed strangely sharp and clear and as he watched the lighted space of the open stall door he saw the last of the bulky shadows vanish leaving only the long shadow of a man the magelights behind him he watched the shadow and listened to the footsteps waiting for the moment when the mage would bejust around the corner of his stall the man was thorough he checked every stall while darians heart pounded and his gut churned hes looking at the opposite ones first when he first gets up here ill have just that long while he checks the other one he saw the shadows legs the body silhouetted on the wall he braced himself and with the next step the mage himself appeared framed in the stall door darian charged screaming this time he caught the mage entirely by surprise driving him into the wall and pinning him there he looked terrible with great gouges bleeding down into his face and his robe wet with his own blood but he was obviously far from finished one tine of the pitchfork held an arm pinned between it and the next tine one pierced the mans clothing at his side although darian couldnt tell if it had caught flesh and one was buried in the wood of the back of the stall but the mage wasnt dead and he wasnt done with darian yet there was an insane rage in the mans eyes he foamed at the mouth and he clawed at darian with his free hand failing to reach darian he grappled with the shaft of the pitchfork and tried to wrench it away while at the same time he pushed away from the wall there was blood seeping into the mages clothing but this was obviously not a fatal wound if he could get off the wall he could free himself darian panted bracing his feet in the dirt of the stall floor and hung on with the strength of desperation why wouldnt this man die bit by bit the mage pushed darian back struggling in eerie silence bit by bit darians feet slipped and he scrambled to reestablish his hold if the mage got loose hed kill darian then hed kill snowfire and all the others then hed go after nightwind and starfall and kelvren and all because darian had failed no he screamed at the top of his lungs not this time with a last burst of energy he drove the mage back and felt a surge of elation but the madness left the mans eyes for a moment and the mage screamed something guttural the handle of the pitchfork burst into flame splintered then crumbled away leaving darian standing with a handful of kindling and ash the mage plucked the metal tine out and cast it to the ground contemptuously darian stared frozen the mage laughed and reached out his fingers curling into a claw darian ducked and rolled to the side he came up running or trying to heading for the open stable door behind him the mage screamed something else and the door slammed shut in his face he hit it unable to stop in time and dropped to the floor the mage laughed again and darian rolled over his back to the door and his hand fell on the bar that had held it shut he didnt even think he just grabbed it and came up swinging he caught the mage on the side of the head once again catching him by surprise the man reeled back and darian swung again this time the mage caught the wooden bar and wrenched it out of darians hands throwing it aside darian dove underneath the mans grasping hands gambling that the wound in his side was too painful for him to move easily he somersaulted and came up on his feet on the other side the mage was between him and the door again he looked frantically about for a weapon any weapon his eye fell on the forged tines of the pitchfork as the mage turned this time he didnt dare fail it didnt matter if he died he couldnt fail the others he snatched up the tines braced the rounded end against his chest and charged again but this time with every last bit of strength and every bit of his weight holding back nothing he drove the larger man back against the closed door felt the tines hit flesh that yielded resisted then gave with a wet pop the man screamed horribly he flailed at darian and a terrible blow to the side of his head knocked him away stunning him he fell to the ground as everything went dark he couldnt move couldnt see anything am i blind with a convulsive shudder he managed to move to get to his knees but he still couldnt see anything everything was dark then with a creak one of the stable doors swung open and vague and flickering red light outside proved that he wasnt blind after all it was the magelight that was gone but the mage was still moving in a moment he might get up again he was hurt but by no means dead yet darians right hand was wet as was his sleeve and as he moved it his fingers touched his abandoned bucket he grabbed it and lurched to his feet staggering over to the mage who stared up at him in the changing light spittle at the corner of his mouth he gave the man no chance to act he brought the bucket down on his head as hard as he could if the man wouldnt die at least he wasnt going to stay awake for long he hit the mage a couple more times for good measure then left the bucket upturned over his face and staggered exhausted out into the open he didnt care who or what saw him at this point he stood in the middle of the dirt path swaying on his feet wondering where he should go next the shouting had decreased who was winning then he sensed something gathering at his back something oddly familiar magic but where and when had he sensed something like this before magic like for some reason the sensation called up a memory of justyn but justyn had never had enough magic for him to sense like this except the day he destroyed the bridge fear gave him energy he thought he didnt have he sprinted for shelter any shelter heading for the nearest building as fast as his feet would carry him he reached it just as the stable behind him exploded into flame the shock of the blast knocking him into the side of the cottage he saw fireworks behind his eyes for a moment and had all the wind knocked out of him he struggled to breathe lying on his side trying to make his lungs work again he didnt stay that way for long when his eyes cleared and he got a few good breaths he picked himself gingerly out of the remains of a flower garden he looked around and things were pretty much the same as they had been with a single exception that is what was left of the stable blazed fiercely as if it had been soaked in oil darian went looking for snowfire and the others but didnt have to go far to find them no sooner did he round the corner of the house than he saw the entire cavalcade approaching the hawkbrothers battered and injured but all still alive followed by the villagers the villagers of errolds grove were a far different group of people than they had been a half moon ago they had clearly been kept on short rations by their captors and just as clearly had been worked to exhaustion they were filthy unkempt precisely the kind of folk that they themselves would have turned away from the village as vagabonds clothing dirty torn and tattered in the course of hard labor had not been changed cleaned or mended in all the time theyd been captives some of the men showed signs of beatings all looked as wary and spooked as the horses running freely among the houses but darian had no eyes for them with a joyful shout he ran to snowfire and the others who answered his shout and surrounded him babbling questions while the villagers stared at him with wide eyes the villagers recognized him yes but this was not the same darian that they had scorned and disregarded before one at a time snowfire ordered and some of the babble subsided darian we were surprised by a group coming to claim some of your people we were attacked we took shelter in the barn and were promptly put under siege what saved us was that the elite fighters that were left here had been drinking and simply didnt fight together at all well we were holding our own until we were attacked by a a bearcreature it must have been summoned and controlled by their mage it broke through our defenses and killed three of your people and injured several of us we are sorry there was just nothing we could have done to save them though we tried then the creature suddenly went berserk as if it was no longer under control and turned on the barbarians they had to fight us and it at the same time they killed it but seemed to lose heart and retreated then there was a tremendous roar and flames shot into the sky and their retreat turned into a rout what happened here it was the mage darian said too tired to feel even a flicker of pride in his deed i saw him making magic and i knew i had to do something i think hes dead i think he did what justyn did at the bridge he told the tale as quickly as he could in as few words as possible he was a little afraid that snowfire and the rest might not believe him after all who was he to claim to have destroyed a powerful mage but they accepted his tale at face value and the results were there for all to see so perhaps it was not as difficult to believe as he had feared you were one thing he would not have been concerned about snowfire said thoughtfully he would never have believed that a single young boy could be a threat to him not even when he had the evidence of that threat slashed into his own body he should have known better we all know that the smallest creature can become dangerous when driven to desperation i couldnt have done it if it hadnt been for huur darian said hastily she is all right isnt she one broken feather and a ruffled temper which she has flown off to cool snowfire assured him and looked around at the wideeyed group of villagers surrounding them he switched to stilted valdemaran i believe we hold errolds grove and need not fear the return of the barbarians tonight he said raising his voice i believe it is safe enough to stay and sleep and in the morning begin to rebuild if you will go to your houses we allies of valdemar will secure the place against intruders still shocked and bewildered ready to listen to anyone who offered a voice of authority they trailed back to their houses by twos and threes snowfire divided the hawkbrothers into three groups of five leaving out the two worst wounded to take nightwatches is there anyplace you can go to rest he asked darian with a hand resting lightly on his shoulder would anyone give you bed space you have done more than enough for one night darian felt each and every separate bruise aching thought longingly of justyns little cottage once despised and nodded go then snowfire said giving him a gentle shove i will see that you are awakened in the morning already those not on the first watch were putting out the fire in the blazing stable soon concealing darkness hid the signs of battle leaving only the acrid scent of smoke in the air darian trudged toward justyns cottage wondering what he would find there what he found in the light of a single lantern was signs of recent occupation the furniture was gone probably broken up for firewood the contents of the shelves lay piled in a corner discarded as worthless including all the bad paintings of famous mages and there were bedrolls spread across every available bit of floor he wrinkled his nose at the smell of sweat burned food and unwashed bedding he took the time to throw all the bedrolls out the door and open the windows the fireplace hadnt been swept in ages and it seemed that when the barbarians finished eating they tended to pitch what was left into the fire for it was littered with bones and burned crusts hence the odor of burned food darian climbed the ladder to his loft bed and discovered it was the one corner of the house that hadnt been touched probably because his little bed was too short for any of the barbarians with a weary sigh he tumbled into bed leaving the lantern to burn itself out it was the sound of horses and mens voices that woke him in the gray light of dawn and before he was even properly awake he tumbled down out of the loft and emerged from the cottage with a poker in one hand ready to do battle all over again but it wasnt the barbarians who had returned the noise was the arrival of a rescue expedition men on horses milled around the square all of them wearing lord breons colors and badge more men afoot were rounding up loose livestock and confining it in hastilybuilt corrals darian put down his poker and scratched his head watching all the activity with a sense of bleary bemusement after another moment he quietly got himself a bucket of water and used it to clean himself up wincing as he scrubbed a body that was black and blue from neck to knee once clean and marginally presentable he went back out and joined the milling people picking up what had happened this morning by listening to fragments of conversation lord breon had gotten starfalls message and had gathered his men to respond to it but on the way he had encountered the thoroughly demoralized barbarian foot soldiers and had fought an unequal battle with them then having defeated the barbarians he had been stopped by the rockfall and had been forced to find a place to ford the river to get to the road on the other side by this time of course they were certain that they would find errolds grove occupied by a hostile force and had only hoped to catch the remaining barbarians by surprise ready for battle they had clattered over the bridge a little before dawn only to encounter the sentries after learning that the town was in friendly hands they had made enough noise to wake up most of those who were sleeping when darian wandered in rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand lord breon himself was in earnest consultation with snowfire with townsfolk standing awkwardly about still looking dazed and bewildered though most of them had cleaned themselves up and found more presentable clothing they formed a sad contrast with their oncerespectable selves however and looked rather as if they had grabbed whatever would fit with little regard for the sex or size their garments were originally intended for snowfire spotted him and hailed him with relief here little brother your command of the tongue is better than mine come and help me with this not at all reluctant darian ignored his bruises and aching bones and trotted to snowfires side feeling flushedwith pride when snowfire was at a loss for words he translated lord breon a neat and handsome gentleman of middling age and height clothed in a businesslike suit of riveted armor brown of hair and eyes and beard took the hawkbrothers completely in stride but darians fellow villagers started every time any one of them moved suddenly and kept circling warily around the birds to darians relief he caught sight of huur hweel and an awkwardlooking youngster dozing on the rooftree nearest snowfire where they had evidently been most of the night with daystorms bondbird corbies keeping the natives at a respectful distance my lord snowfire lord breon said when they were finished a look of profound respect in his eyes you have certainly kept things well in hand here i am sure that the queen herself will want to thank you eventually snowfire shrugged we are allies are we not he pointed out and if you had not intercepted the foot troops before they returned we should probably have been forced to defend ourselves from them as we marched these folk toward your holding and safety now they need no longer seek shelter among your people beggin your pardon lutter spoke up interrupting him but we need to know what were to do now the man was a far cry from his former prosperous self he had changed his clothing but it hung on him loosely and his middleaged face bore signs of both fresh and notsorecent bruises in purple black green and yellow what are you to do lord breon looked at him askance why pick up your lives man what else pick up our lives he replied aghast what are you talking about how can we pick up our lives theres nothing left here the barbarians took it all what they didnt eat they destroyed weve no crops no food no herds or flocks how are we to get through the winter dorian snorted with contempt and all eyes turned toward him snowfire looked at him curiously lord breon with surprise and lutter with astonishment turning to anger at having been interrupted by the village scapegrace ill tell you what youve got darian said hotly amazed at their stupidity youve got your homes back youve got a pile of weapons and armor that ought to be worth something youve got a dozen or more real warhorses that are each worth the price of a good house and youve got a whole lot more regular horses too youve got mules and two wagons whatever was in those wagons and youve got the whole peligiris forest to hunt dyefungus in you can buy food again you dont have to grow it what are you complaining about and youve got this lilly the barmaid came up dragging someones oncefine coverlet made into a crude bag across the ground she let the comers fall revealing a mixed pile of coins and jewelry i couldnt tell whose was whose she continued so i just piled them all together but i know that most of this didnt come from errolds grove it certainly couldnt have since a great deal of the jewelry was of gold no wonder the bundle had been too heavy to carry shcar had all this in his room she continued and i thought that when you get done picking out the bits that belong to you lord breon could arrange to sell the rest and buy new stock for everybody who lost beasts and fowl what about the stuff youre wearing asked a woman shrilly and only then did darian look up to see that lilly was bedecked with several heavy gold bracelets chains and oddlooking pendants lilly flushed but looked angry this is mine she replied fiercely i earned every bit of it oh earned it did you the woman snarled at your ease in comfort while the rest of us sweated out in the fields earned it did you for once lilly stood up for herself pulling herself up tall and staring the woman down yes earned it earned it by waiting on shkar day and night doing things i dont even like to think about keeping him and his bullies looking at me and thinking about me instead of you making sure that every time their eyes started wandering toward your pretty little daughter stella harthon that they got pulled back toward me how did you think it happened by magic i fought for all our sakes with the only weapon that i knew would work against them and now im keeping what i earned from them im taking it and im going to go and buy a real inn someplace else where nobody is going to look down her long petty nose at me again darian flushed with anger as he saw sour and angry faces among the women still in spite of the fact that the pile of loot in the coverlet was vastly more valuable than what lilly wore how greedy can they be he wondered but lutter coughed and said to lilly redfaced youre right girl youve earned it and youve earned the right to take it and yourself someplace else if you want to but if were going to get the dyetrade going again were going to need a real inn lilly interrupted him shaking her head though her demeanor softened no if i go elsewhere ill be lilly the respectable innkeeper i can never be that if i stay here im leaving besides she chuckled weakly when i leave itll give your wives a bad example to show their girlchildren i would like to ask you some questions about your time among those men lord breon said with delicate tact you knew the name of one of the leaders for instance shkar she said and shrugged i didnt learn much of their tongue they didnt need me for language lessons and what they wanted they could get by pointing nevertheless you may know more than you think you do lord breon persisted if youd care to come back with me after ive learned what i can from you ill gladly provide an escort to wherever you choose that suits me she turned abruptly arid went to stand among lord breons men who after a stern look from lord breon did not leer or make suggestive comments but simply made a place for her in the meantime the woman is right the lord continued surveying the pile between the loot there and the horses you will have more than enough to rebuild what was lost ill trade ten cattle or twenty adult hogs for each warhorse this minute sight unseen for instance or you can take them to the horsemarket and try your luck there he raked his eyes over the crowd youll have to agree on equal shares as you all suffered equally so far as i can see it will take a great deal of work but in the end errolds grove will be as prosperous as it was before there was some muttering especially among those who had been the most welloff before the invasion but finally everyone agreed now as for darian lord breon began snowfire interrupted him this time with all respect we have already taken him into our clan the tayledras said and darians heart leaped we do not consider him a burden but evidently some word of what darian had done had gotten to the villagers for there was an immediate protest but hes our mage we are going to need a mage exclaimed lutter in dismay what if someone like these barbarians comes back you need a trained mage which darian is not snowfire replied sternly he must be trained and you have no adequate teachers nor are you likely to get any considering how long it took to get you the first one but he can heal as i believe some of you once pointed out any of your young people could learn to do apprenticing for six months with a healer snowfires mouth twitched at the dismay on certain faces darian had to hide his face lest his own expression give him away i suggest you do that perhaps if at some time a generous offer is made you may tempt another mage to come and take residence here until that time i fear you shall have to learn to watch your own borders and defend yourselves but darian felt a twinge of guilt as he looked at the real fear in the eyes of some of them terrible things had happened here things that people would never speak of but which would shadow their dreams for the rest of their lives they would never feel truly secure again what is it lad lord breon asked seeing the doubt in his own eyes what is it to be do you go with the hawkbrothers or do you remain here he looked from snowfires calm eyes to lord breons worried ones and back again i i have to be trained first he said echoing snowfires words and id rather it was with my friends than anyone else but he shook his head and tried to put into words the idea hed had but this place is right on the border right on the edge of hawkbrother lands and valdemar right shouldnt there be someone who was as much a hawkbrother as a valdemaran right here all the time to make sure that there are never any misunderstandings lord breon looked astounded and snowfire impressed and pleased he hurried on and lutter is right errolds grove is going to need a real mage sooner or later the peligirs havent gotten less strange even after the storms if there was a mage here he could look at stuff that was brought out and tell if it was good for anything besides dyeing other things too so couldnt i do both he turned pleading eyes to snowfire couldnt i go with you learn to be a mage and one of the clan then come back here and maybe make a little vale where tayledras would always be able to come it would be a hard life and often lonely being neither of this world nor that snowfire said softly in the hawkbrother tongue but you are correct that there is a need for such a person especially here where there is scope for a great deal of misunderstanding then thats what id like he sighed then he laughed a little and shook his head hellfires i never could take the easy way with anything i am glad that you made that choice little brother the scout replied and switched to valdemaran that is a good plan and a generous one you shall come with us and be trained and when you are ready you shall return here and be a living example of the alliance you shall make for us a haven for our kind and a place where those of valdemar will find help when it is needed sighs and smiles all around but snowfire wasnt finished yet and since it is a plan that shows wisdom beyond your years i shall do as hweel and huur asked me though you are not quite yet of an age for such a joy and a responsibility he smiled after all usually in matters of this sort our winged ones are far too wise to be bound by convention he whistled and held up his gauntleted arm but instead of hweel coming in to land on it the youngster woke up hooted loudly and blundered in to his fist before darian had a moment to think wintersky grabbed his left hand and slipped a shoulderlength glove over it then held it up the youngster made a clumsy hop from snowfires fist to darians and looked deeply into darians dazzled eyes as snowfire laughed with delight at his expression hhello darian stammered beside himself with so much joy and excitement that he shook whats your name kuari the bird said solemnly in his mind l am ktiari i like you well be bondmates yes they want it too the owl didnt move his head but darian knew that they meant hweel and huur sitting sidebyside up on the rooftree i like mice i want to hunt mice bring you some too i have the feeling that hweel and huur have decided that this will ensure your place within the clan little brother snowfire said in tayledras with suppressed laughter in his voice darian didnt care the trust he sensed in kuans voice won his heart as nothing else could have with gentle care he reached up and scratched the youngsters head at the eartufts as he had seen snowfire do for hweel oh i like that i like that better than mice do that a lot kuari closed his eyes in ecstasy all but melting under the caress and butted his head into darians hand i told you daystorm muttered to snowfire in a whisper darian probably wasnt supposed to overhear the boys a natural with the birds hell be fine yes i will be fine he thought his heart so brimming with joy and contentment that there was no room in it anymore for anger resentment or grief yes i will ive got a family adventure a worthy goal im home im finally making my own home darian looked up and out at the villagers who were conspicuously silent one last thing he said boldly i wont even consider returning until there is a portrait of the great mage justyn displayed in a place of honor in errolds grove he paused a moment then added just to make sure a good portrait then darian hawkbrother of valdemar turned his full attention to his new bondmates soft feathers and the shared bliss that came from being with each other maybe the young owls flight was not all that graceful at the moment but in time with support and guidance he would be a master at whatever he tried in time so too would darian and he would be at home wherever he went
