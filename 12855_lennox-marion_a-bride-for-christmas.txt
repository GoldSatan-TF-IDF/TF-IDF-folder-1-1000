marion lennox a bride for christmas chapter one tell me again why ive bought this wedding salon guy carver was approaching sandpiper bay with dismay you didnt say this place was a hundred miles from nowhere you want to expand on the line from manhattan guys partner sounded unperturbed sandpiper bay makes more sense than any other place in australia i told you you told me what it has the worlds best surf malcolm said patiently its surrounded by arguably the worlds loveliest national park and half hollywood owns property at sandpiper bay where are you now on the outskirts it looks dont judge until you see the town even my wife thinks sandpiper bay is great shes furious youre doing the planning and not me as if you could plan a carver salon whats there to plan malcolm demanded order a lake of icegrey paint give the widow a paintbrush and take a few days off i dont have time for a few days off guy snapped irritated by his partners cheerfulness i need to be back in new york on the twentysixth for the film conglomerate do we can handle conglomerate with our hands tied spend christmas on the beach or not christmas was a wasted day as far as guy was concerned and he had better things to do than surf this year hed timed this trip deliberately so hed be flying home on christmas day christmas midair would get him as far away as was possible from useless sentiment hed joined the coast road now and he had to admit the place did look spectacular sandpiper bay appeared to be a tiny coastal village bordering a shimmering sapphire sea with rolling mountains beyond so what am i looking for he demanded of malcolm a shopfront on the beachfront shopping strip its called bridal fluff bridal fluff he didnt explode his voice just grew very calm did i hear right sure did the exowners one jenny westmere widow apart from her dubious taste in naming her salon she sounds competent weve offered her twelve months salary to make the transition easier there cant be a transition from fluff to a carver bridal salon he said grimly ill gut the place he was turning into the main street now and what he saw made him blanch bridal fluff was indeedfluff the shopfront was pastel pink the curtains in the windows looked like billowing white clouds held back with pink and silver tassels a christmas tree stood in the window festooned with pink and silver baubles and a white fluffy angel smiling seraphically down on passersby the name of the shop was picked out in deeper pink gold and silver what the dont judge a book by its cover malcolm said hastily guessing what he was seeing we dont need to give this woman any organisational role were just keeping her on the payroll to keep the locals happy every other salon weve acquired the previous owner has been so chuffed to be associated with the carver salon that the takeovers been a piece of cake the bottom line is money ive checked the books i said it was a good buy and i meant it and if its not if its not well just have to wear it malcolm had worked with guy for years guys reputation for dazzling event management left everyone he worked with stunned but his personal reputation was for being aloof malcolms cheerful nature combined with a brash business acumen that matched guys made them a formidable team together theyd built the carver empire into the most lucrative events management chain in the world no need to fret malcolm was saying now all breezy certainty you and mrs westmere will get on like a house on fire mrs westmere jennifer westmere i told you the widow great guy muttered pulling into a parking lot by the pink door middleaged frumpy and dressed in pink nah malcolm said though he was starting to sound uneasy the reports i have say shes young twentyeight and im stuck with her the contract stipulates twelve months employment ill buy her out guy said grimly i should have stuck to manhattan and paris and london i understand weddings there then wed miss out malcolm cheered up again now youre expanding the carver salons worldwide its time we moved into australia sandpiper bays more hip than sydney or melbourne theres a huge buzz about the carver salons expanding so go meet the lady with the pink fuzz make friends not even close guy muttered as pulled his car to a halt and finished the conversation friends as if jenny was kneeling on the floor and tackling about a hundred yards of hemline when he walked in it was the fourth time shed been around this hem the dressmaker had thrown her hands up in horror and now jenny was left holding the baby so to speak i know its not right the brides mother was saying we practised last night and as she swept up the aisle i was sure the left side was longer than the right or was it the right longer than the left anyway i knew youd want to check it has to be perfect mmphf jenny mumbled through pins and then the door swung open guy carver this mans weddings were known throughout the world he was known throughout the world the phone call to jenny offering to buy her premises had left her poleaxed but why shed stammered and the man handling the deal for guy had given her an honest answer eight of the ten most prestigious weddings in australia have been held within ten miles of sandpiper bay in the last two years malcolm had told her bluntly theres a caveat on new businesses in whats essentially a historic commercial district setting up a business from scratch would be complex our people have checked your premises your building is big enough for us and you already have a reputation for providing service well do the rest if youre at all interested then we just need to settle on a price shed named a figure that had seemed crazy ten minutes later the deal had been sealed jenny had replaced the receiver stunned its more money than i ever dreamed possible shed told her motherinlaw and when lorna had heard how much shed gasped thats wonderful youll be able to buy henry whatever he needs i will jenny smiled her delight even lorna didnt know the depths of her despair at not being able to provide henry with optimal medical treatment but what will you do with yourself thats just it theyre offering me a job doing what im doing now only on a salary twelve months paid work with the possibility of extending it holidays she said dreamily sick pay regular income with no bad debts and guy carver as your boss working with someone the glossies describe as one of the worlds sexiest men theyd grinned at each other like fools at thata twentyeightyearold widow and her sixtyyearold motherinlaw letting their hormones have their head for one wonderful momentand then theyd put their hormones away and thought seriously about what it entailed does he have any idea what hes letting himself in for lorna had demanded a country wedding salon it wont be a country salon for long currently the international jetsetters and the rich locals bring their own planners carver wants that business im guessing most locals will stop being able to afford him just like the rest of the businesses in this town lorna said grimacing sandpiper bays changing its being taken over by the jetset lorna agreed every property within a twentymile radius is being snapped up at extraordinary prices by millionaires who spend two weeks of every year here we cant stop it like lorna jenny was ambivalent about the changes to their rural backwater but there was little choice the guy acting for carver said if i didnt agree then theyd buy out the old haberdashery and set up in opposition wed be left with the brides that couldnt afford guy which would be most of our brides right id go under as it is my wealthy brides subsidise my poorer ones which is why youre a lousy businesswoman lorna gave her daughterinlaw a subdued smile like me which is why im selling jenny said firmly we have no choice so the arrangements had been fine sort of up until now it had been phone calls and official letters with the business operating as normal only there was suddenly a lot more business as people heard the news jenny was fielding phone calls now from as far away as california from brides thrilled with the prospect of a guy carver wedding shed put them off not clear when shed officially be running carver weddings not really believing in the transition herself but now the man himself was standing in the doorway im looking for jennifer westmere he said in a rich gravelly voice and jennys current bride gasped and pointed down shes here jenny pushed aside a few acres of tulle and gave guy a wave mmphf she said and gestured to the pins in her mouth im here on business he said enigmatically and shirley the mother of the bride she was looking after gave a sound that resembled a choking hen youre guy carver youre taking over this salon ooh were so excited guy stilled uhoh jenny thought one of the stipulations in the contract was that this takeover be kept quiet until the salon had been transformed to carver requirements but that hadnt been stipulated until the third phone call and in the interim lorna had managed to spread the news across sandpiper bay there was nothing she could do about that now she watched as guy sat crossing one elegantly shod foot over the other carry on ill watch he said his voice expressionless great jenny went back to pinning her mind whirling the man was seriouslywow he was tall and dark almost mediterraneanlooking she thought with the sleekly handsome demeanour of a european playboy not that she knew many european playboysto be honest she didnt know a single onebut she imagined the species to have just those dark and brooding good looks he looked almost hawklike she decided and she also decided that the photographs shed seen in celebrity magazines didnt do him justice his magnificently cut suit and his gorgeous silk tie screamed serious money actually everything about him screamed serious money there was a ferrari parked outside her front window guy carver was sitting in her salon was he annoyed about the lack of confidentiality was he annoyed enough to call the deal off whats the problem with the dress guy asked in a conversational tone and she mmphfed again and waved a hand apologetically to the brides mother the hems crooked shirley grubb told him beaming and preparing to be voluble kylies not getting married in a crooked dress whens the wedding next thursday shirley looked smug i know two days before christmas is cutting it fine we were so lucky to get the church its just this dratted dress thats holding us up when was the dress ordered oh shes had it for years shirley told him ready to be friendly when kylie turned sixteen i said well buy your wedding dress now while your fathers still working and while jennys here to organise it no matter that you dont have a fella yet just dont put on too much weight that was four years ago and now we can finally use it umright guy said mildly whens the baby due midjanuary shirley said and beamed some more arent we lucky we got the dress made when we ordered it i told jenny to leave heaps to spare at the hem i was six months gone with kylie before my old man did the right thing and heres kylie got her fella the same way hotblooded we are she said preening its in the genes guy appeared to be focussing on the tip of one of his glossy shoes wow jenny thought guy carver chatting to mrs grubb has he any idea what hes getting into she went on pinning it gave her breathing space she thought so much tulle why did you choose bridal fluff to organise your wedding guy asked conversationally and jenny winced she just knew what shirley would say and here it came lornathats jennys motherinlawand me went to school together lorna wont charge me ouch this technically wasnt her salon any more jenny thought nor was it lornas it belonged to guy so this arrangement was made a long time ago when we were girls lorna always said shed plan my wedding and any of my kids weddings and any grandkids weddings and when i rang up last month she said sure lorna isnt planning your wedding guy said mildly it seems jenny is and jenny works for me for the first time shirley seemed unsure her mouth opened and failed to shut again you mean she said at last that we have to pay it was time to enter this conversation jenny carefully removed the remaining pins and set them into her pin box any arrangements i made before mr carver purchased the business will be honoured she said ill take care of kylies wedding and the rest of them shirley looked affronted maybe in my own time jenny said not from this salon well shirley was about to start a war jenny thought and shirleys wars were legion leave it ma for the first time kylie spoke up she was a pale timid young bride and only the fact that her prospective husband was even more timid than his fiancéeand totally besottedmade jenny feel okay about the wedding but now kylie had a flush to her cheeks and she turned to guy as if she was trying to dredge up the courage to ask him something important mr carver yes guy was staring down at jennywho was meeting his look and holding it with a hint of defiance things were about to change in her life because of this man and she wasnt sure that she liked it when did you buy bridal fluff kylie asked and guy turned and gazed at the bride it wasnt a great look jenny thought ruefully the first of her brides that guy was seeing was a waif of a bride in a vast sea of tulle her dress had been made when shed had a size eight waist it had been close fitting then now two strips of satin had been sewn into the waist to accommodate her advanced pregnancy jenny had attached a loosefitting lace camisole to disguise the bulge a little but it was no small bulge the fact that the bulge kept changing meant that the hemline kept changing as well as well as that kylies mother had definite ideas on what a bride should look likewhich was a vision in every decorative piece of lacework she could think of the veil even had tiny cupid motifs handsewn onto the netting seeing the veil turned into a train jenny estimated guy was looking at approximately eight hundred cupids this was not one of her most elegant brides do you officially own this place yet kylie asked and guy nodded with what appeared to be reluctance yes then im a carver bride kylie said suddenly ecstatic she held her hands together in reverence like in those glossy magazines we buy ma im the first australian carver bride i reckon we ought to phone some reporters no guy snapped rising and looking at kylie in distaste youre not a carver bride you are mrs westmeres responsibility my takeover was supposed to be confidential and the namechange wont happen yet therell be no carver brides until my people are here and we can get rid of this he gazed around the salon with distaste this fluff had he made a mistake guy watched as the hemmarking continued its a small place malcolm had told him the council has the power to make all sorts of complications like refusing our requests to expand the building we need to keep the locals on our side make an effort guy maybe he hadnt made an effort but reallykylie a carver bride some things were unthinkable and what had happened to the confidentiality clause it could be a disaster he waited on ignored by the grubbs which suited him finally the hem was finished and kylie and her mother sailed off down the street to spread the news indignation was oozing from every pore they might be indignant but so was he i understood this takeover was to be kept quiet he said in a voice that would have had his secretary shaking cool low and carefully neutral it didnt have jenny quaking your accountant or whoever he is should have said that earlier my motherinlaw had ten minutes between offer and acceptance where that stipulation wasnt known ten minutes can mean a lot of gossip in sandpiper bay it means i can call the contract off fine she said and tilted her chin go ahead he was taken aback she should be apologising hed come all the way here to find the terms of the contract had been breached and all she was saying was take it or leave it hed come a long way maybe it didnt matter so much if he worked hard to get the place sleek before anyone important saw it that meant he also had to get rid of unsuitable clients fast clients like the grubbs had no place in a salon such as this why the hell did you take that pair on he demanded of jenny watching through the pinktinged window as shirley tugged her daughter into the butcher shop next door jenny was still on the floor gathering pins when she answered her voice was carefully dispassionate its obvious isnt it theyre local and im the local bridal salon theyll do your reputation no good at all and as for you being the local bridal salonwe have a contract unless i walk away youre no longer in charge and you wont be doing weddings like this right jenny sat back on her heels and eyed him with disfavour so the pregnantwithtulleandcupids isnt a carver look he choked she eyed him with suspicion and then decided to smile great she said thats the first positive ive seen i hoped youd have a sense of humour he collected himself i havent yes you have i can see it its a pity it seems the only good thing ive seen she went back to gathering pins his jaw dropped she was criticising him he thought astonished she was on his staff criticism was unthinkable he tried to remember when hed last heard criticism from his staffand couldnt you realise things are going to have to change around here he said cautiously therell be less fluff for a start she thought about that as she kept sorting pins and suddenly she smiled which threw him all over again it was an amazing smile he decided feeling more than a little confounded somewhere his vision of the widow westmere was being supplanted by this girl called jenny this woman okay a woman her body was slim and lithe her glossy brown curls were cut in a pert elfin haircut which combined with her informal jeans her tshirt and the smattering of freckles on her nose made her look about fourteen but she wasnt fourteen there were lines around her eyes soft lines of laughterbut more there was that look at the back of her eyes that said shed seen a lot there was not a trace of fluff about her this woman was a widow there had to be some tragedy he didnt need to know he told himself she was here for twelve months to smooth the transition her leaving after that would be marked with a card of personal regret when his secretary put those cards before him to sign he could hardly ever put a face to the name he liked it like that hed gone to a lot of trouble so it was like that he gazed around the shop searching for something to distract him luckily there was plenty of distraction on offer three christmas trees he said cautiously and jenny nodded whatever had amused her obviously disappearing the edge of anger creeping back lorna put up the big one in the window she organises it halfway through november and it drives me nuts pine needles everywhere the one in the entrance is a gift from kylies fiancéhe works in a timber yard and came in with it over his shoulder looking really pleased with himself then the guys at bens work brought me one how could i refuse any of them ben my husband she said and there was that in her voice that precluded questions so he said moving on as she clearly intended him to do we have three fully decorated christmas trees two mannequins in full bridal regalia and one groom in what looks a pretty downatheel dinner suit plus christmas decorations theyre not christmas decorations she said tightly as he gestured with distaste to the harlequin lightball hanging in the centre of the room and the silver and gold streamers running from the ball to the outer walls the ball and streamers are here all year round youre kidding nope she said with a hint of defiance we run the most garishly decorated bridal salon in the southern hemisphere our brides love it carver brides wont she nodded youve made that plain it wasnt kindto swat kylie and shirley like that if anyone publishes pictures of kylie as a carver bride they wont they might be provincial but theyre not stupid they sound stupid what the hell was malcolm about buying this place guy demanded and jennys face stilled you dont like it its a backwater sure its scenic do you know the average income of our locals what has that to do with it a lot i imagine she said theres two types of business in this town first there are the businesses that provide for the original inhabitants the likes of shirley and kylie those who you consider stupid then there are those that cater for the elite we have no less than twenty helicopter pads in the shire millionaires billionaireswe have them all in your terms not a stupid person in sight the town has a historic overlay and a twentyacre subdivision limit so development is just about nonexistent in the last ten years every place coming onto the market has been snapped up by squillionaires you know that or you wouldnt have bought here she hesitated you really want to get rid of the likes of kylie i didnt want to imply all the locals are stupid but if kylie cant afford me she wont be able to afford you none of the real locals will why do you want me to stay on to ease the transition there wont be a transition youve just told kylie there wont be carver brides until your people are here i thoughtaccording to the contractid be one of your people he might as well say it like it was you wont have any authority any last hint of a smile completely disappeared at that so the offer to employ me for a year was window dressing to make me feel good about you guys taking over i cant employ you if you seriously likehe stared around him in distaste fluff the fluffs lornas lorna lornas my motherinlaw she said she was speaking calmly but he could see she was holding herself tightly on rein lorna set this salon up forty years ago she had a stroke eight years ago and advertised for an assistant i got the job and met ben now its my business but lorna still puts in her oar lornas been incredibly good to me if she wants pink and the locals like pink i dont see why she cant have it carver salons are sleek and minimalist of course they are so youre here to toss the fluff ill do the preliminaries he told her thats why ive cometo decide what needs to be done by the look of it well start from scratch well gut the place my staff will take over the rebuilding and everything that comes after but youll still employee me we envisage a smooth transition youre employing me for local colour i didnt say that you didnt have to i cant see me fitting the image of a carver salon consultant have you ever met a carver salon consultant as it happens i have she said almost defiantly a year ago i had awell i needed a holiday and my parentsinlaw sent me to paris i wandered through your salon just to see how the other half live only of course i wasnt up to standard i hadnt been in the salon for two minutes before i was asked to leave if my staff thought you were possible opposition then now thats the funny thing she said shed risen and moved over to one of the christmas trees the angel on top was askew and she started carefully to adjust it then she began to check the lights twisting each bulb in turn taking her attention from him they didnt even ask why i was there she said over her shoulder i could have been there to talk about my wedding i could have been there to make enquiries about anything at all but i was wearing jeans and a tshirt and carrying a small backpack lorna had given me she gave a rueful smile the backpack was pink anyway they obviously sorted me as a type they didnt want they asked me to leave and suddenly there was a security guard propelling me onto the pavement she shrugged given my opinion of carver salons i should have told you to take your very kind offer to buy this salon and stick it but of course its a very generous offer and i need the money and the thought of me being in opposition to you is ridiculous there was a moments silence then guy thought about his paris staff they were the best they ran weddings that were the talk of the world theyd kicked this woman out she must have been humiliated maybe he needed to be a bit more handson he didnt like to be handson he thought suddenly of the first wedding hed planned hed been home from college where hed been studying lawa career his parents had thought eminently suitable but which bored him stupid christathe girl hed been dating since both their mothers had organised them to their first promhad been managing his social life and that had bored him too then christas sister had announced her engagement to someone both families thought entirely unsuitable louise had wept on guys shoulder without parental support and with no money of her own shed been doomed to have a civil ceremony and go without the party shed longed for intrigued guy had set to work hed painted cardboard until his hands were sore transforming a small local hall into a venue that looked like a soho streetscape hed organised the local hotdog vendor to set up in a corner the pretzel seller had come as welland why wouldnt he have an inside venue in the middle of a hot august had been a welcome change guy had built and painted a bar made of plywood but it had looked fantastic guests had had to pay normal price for hot dogs and pretzels and beer but the wealthy guests had been intrigued rather than offended hed persuaded buskers to come including a rap dancer with a hat out for offerings hed been handson every step of the way and hed loved it the bride had been ecstatic christa and guys mother had been less so but when guy had been approached the following week to do another wedding and another theyd been forced to stand by as guys career took off in another direction he remembered the family horrorhis fledgling company had had to fly by the seat of its pants and to risk money was unthinkable christa had been beside herself with rage but hed kept on it had been fun and hed never known what fun was until hed thrown aside the mantle of family responsibility when had he stopped having fun he could hardly remember all he knew was that after christa had been killed it had become his refugeorganising vast numbers of people in glittering social events that held no personal attachment at all his firm had grown so he was now no longer handson he employed hundredsstaff handpicked for their artistic and business acumen would they have kicked this woman out on the street he didnt know and maybe he shouldnt care as long as they did their job well but now he thought back to that first wedding and remembered louises joy he looked at jenny her face a trifle flushed and more than a trifle defiant and he thought hell she must have been demoralised what had she said a year ago i had awell i needed a holiday and my parentsinlaw sent me to paris shed had a what a breakdown what had happened to the husband im sorry he said it wasnt your fault it was though he thought grimly he took the credit for carver weddings he took responsibility for his staff you dont really want to employ me she said do you id rather this place was kept open for business during transition i had hoped to keep the acquisition quiet until i got my staff in place but now its got outits unfortunate but nothing we cant handle i want the place open for queries and future bookings you need to be the front person ill give you a pricing structure so you can give brides an idea of what we offer run the weddings you have now underhe hesitated then said without bothering to hide his disdain under bridal fluff new bookings will be under carver salon new bookings will be expensive were exclusive you dont need to tell me that she grimaced and he was aware of a stab ofregret once upon a time hed tried to make his functions wonderful because they created joy he hadnt heard of the concept of exclusive hed lived on a shoestring hed learned the hard way that was nonsense that last day with christaif you loved me youd keep doing law your fathers expecting you to take over the family firm your mothers scared youre gay guy you play with paints paints and mehow do you think i feel being engaged to a wedding planner shed said the words with such scorn then two hours later she was dead if shed lived he was under no illusion that their relationship would have been over but he knew that his life decision had killed her and his fatherhis father had heard of christas death and it had been as if hed said goodbye to the son hed now never have a wedding plannertwo days later hed had a stroke and hed never recovered guy hadnt gone back to law hed known hed be good at this but right there and then hed vowed that hed be a corporate success their deaths had been crazy and unnecessary no one was going to throw wedding planner at him as a term of derision he worked hard he kept to himself he made money and he carefully didnt know people his life decisions would never hurt anyone again he had become exclusive the telephone cut the stillness and he welcomed it he motioned jenny to answer then picked up a catalogue to flick through while she spoke here were bridal fluff weddings over the past few years catalogued down to the last ghastly feather he flicked through and paused one bridal couple smiled out from the pages dressed like a pair from the set of cabaret he looked more closely taking in details of the setting the whole theme was cabaret it was actually rather good itd be good even as a carver wedding he flicked through a bit more fluff fluffbut every now and then something different there were just a few weddings in here that showed talent he glanced up at jenny and she was smiling and making hand signals a second phone lay on the reception desk she was motioning to him to lift it he lifted it and listened be there for christmas about three hundred people barrets pulled strings and found someone wholl marry them so you dont need to worry about the licence all we need you to do is to turn a christmas feast into a wedding feast ill outline details in my fax the most important thing is that anna needs a wedding gown and shes caught up on location until she gets on the plane but she trusts carver implicitly if he approves it itll be fine therell be six bridesmaids and six groomsmen ill fax through sizes annas only stipulation is that shed like a traditional weddingthe same as she saw at home when she was a little girl the woman hesitated she said something about pink tulle oh we can do pink tulle jenny told her sounding chirpy and still smiling mr carvers good at pink tulle guy stared at jenny astounded youve been really lucky jenny continued ignoring guys astonishment mr carver had stipulated thered be no weddings from this salon until his people were in place but as luck would have it mr carver himself arrived here this afternoon i regret i personally wont be involved but i know im leaving you in good hands sure its fine that you put out a press release if you could fax us a copy itll let us see exactly what tone we need to set the figure per head is perfectly acceptable goodbye and she replaced the receiver with a definite click guy stared at her jenny stared straight back still smiling her chin jutted out just a little and she held his gaze and didnt break what the hell have you done he demanded and she smiled some more a tight strained smile that didnt reach her eyes i just quit you quit the contract says my continued employment is optional if i wish to leave at any time then i can i know it was put there as a sop so im letting you off the hook im walking out now any remaining bridal fluff brides will be looked after by me from home the salons yours but youve just booked a wedding i have it sounds just your style what wedding you were on the phone didnt you hear i heard nothing only barret and anna he paused as an appalling thought hit barret and anna you dont mean barret and anna she agreed smiling benignly surely you of all people know barret and anna barrets just wonis it his second oscar or his third and annas on the front cover of this months glamour theyre getting married he said stupidly and she nodded she walked over to the desk and picked up her handbag it was of ancient leather he noticed his mind settling on details as if they were important it looked as if it was falling apart on christmas day she said following his gaze to her handbag flushing and putting it behind her that gives you ten days to organise it ill send my fatherinlaw to clear the store of my gear well have it out of here by tomorrow night so youll have a clear run youll need it she said thoughtfully three hundred people in ten days what the its a very good idea she said you know annas a local girl shes hardly been home for twenty years and by local i mean sydney but she bought a property here two years back she and barret flew in here after amazon trek for a break and the town went nuts it seems they were planning a christmas party but suddenly theyve decided it would be an excellent time to get married only nothings organised a blank canvas mr carver just how you like it so now you have your very first australian carver bride raring to go three hundred guests on christmas day she smiled some more ten days youll be very busy but mei have a little boy wholl have christmas with his mummy which is just as the world should be now me and my disreputable handbag will take ourselves out of your life good luck mr carver and goodbye chapter two this was no drama guy watched her go with mixed feelings there was a part of him that felt a strange lurch that she should walk away and it had nothing to do with the bombshell shed thrown at him as usual though he attempted to shove personal thoughts aside and slip back into business mode it was difficult to shove the vision of jenny away the way shed carried her handbag barret and anna he had to think barret travers and anna price had a hugely powerful media presence with barret in a movie an immediate box office hit was assured and annas profile was almost the same their impending wedding would turn the eyes of the world right here to what he couldnt put on a huge mediacircustype wedding with this much notice the booking was only five minutes old he had to cancel and fast that shouldnt be a problem hed phone malcolm and get contact details straight away but before he could lift his phone the fax machine on jennys desk hummed into life bemused he watched the feedout recognising it for what it was a press release barret and anna to wed the caption blared wedding to be in sandpiper bay australia guy carvers first australian wedding theyd had it planned before theyd contacted jenny he thought theyd had this press release ready to go why what could possibly add more media hype to this pair carvers first australian wedding guy thought about it and his heart sank anna had been pilloried in the press for her bad taste of course shed want pink tulle he thought pink tulle would be right in her league how to get pink tulle but still be thought cool by the cognoscenti have a carver wedding he had to cancel he stared down at the press release specifically at the tiny cc this was not a press release sent early just as confirmation to him this was a press release which was simultaneously being read by every media outlet in the western world theyd been expecting his yes as perfunctory jenny had given them their yes and theyd told the world if he pulled out now carver event management pulling out would be news people knew he was in australia jenny had just confirmed it so why couldnt he organise the wedding no matter how carefully he explained it anna would take his refusal as a personal slight and the worlds press would agree which meant problems for anna the paparazzi spent their life reporting on annaand barret barret was a loudmouthed boor but he was number one at the box office in contrast anna was struggling a little a few months ago shed spent time in drug rehab and the press had had a fieldday her life seemed to be together now but the media still wavered between idolatry and ridicule if they knew hed knocked her backinternational events organiser guy carver refuses annabarret weddingthe worlds press would say it served her right theyd say shed got what she deserved and the balance might well tip on the side of ridicule which she didnt deserve damn he didnt get emotionally involved he didnt he was right up to his neck he thumped the desk with his fist and a fluffy stuffed dog endowed for some reason with a disembodied head started nodding in furious agreement he stared down at the stupid creature and came close to throwing it through the pinktinged windows jenny was outside the window over the road was the beach a group of teenagers were clustered by the side of the road leaning on their surfboards and chatting to jenny she was laughing at something one of them said she lookedfree of course she looks free youve just sacked her except he hadnt shed walked out on him the thought was astonishing focus on this wedding how long did he have ten days the idea was ridiculous he went through his top people in his head trying to figure who could come no one could come everyone held parties at christmas and every event he had in his mental diary was major thered be repercussions if he pulled anyone out for a wedding like this at this short notice he needed local people he neededjenny she was climbing into an ancient ford a wagon that looked more battered than the decrepit vehicles the surfers were using while he watched she backed out of the parking spot then headed right her wagon passed the teenagers and did a backfire that made everyone jump shed be hopeless he told no one in particular and no one in particular was interested i cant ask her no one was interested in that either he stared at the fax again and swore do i care if the wonderful annas career goes down the toilet he did he thought damn he did two months ago hed catered for a sensational hollywood ball anyone who was anyone had been present he recalled a very drunken producer hitting on anna when shed knocked him back hed lifted her soda water sniffed it and thrown it away in disgust once a tart always a tart love hed drawled at her youre not such a good little actress that you can pretend to be something youre not for ever guy had intervened then handing anna another soda water giving her a slight push away and deflecting the creep whod insulted her by showing signs of investing in his latest project but hed seen annas white face pretence stripped and hed also seen how shed stared into the soda water taken a deep breath and then deliberately started to drink it to change your life took gutswho should know that better than him if anna wanted him to cater for her wedding then he would even if it does mean i have to go on bended knee to the widow westmere jenny pulled into the front yard of her parentsinlaws farm switched off the ignition took a few deep breathshow to explain all this to lorna and jackand a car pulled in behind her a ferrari ferrari engines were unmistakable what are the chances of someone else with a ferrari pulling into my yard she thought and decided she ought to head inside fast close the door and not even look out to see whether mr guy hotshot carver was on her property mrs westmere he called and the moment was lost she sighed leant back on her battered wagon with careful insoucianceand folded her arms what id like to talk to you about your contract its clear she said trying to be brusque i have the right to work for you for a year and i also have the right to walk away any time i like your business manager seemed to think id be jumping all over myself to stay but the obligation is on your side not mine id like you to stay nah she should be chewing gum she decided she didnt have the insouciance quite right youre pleased to be shot of me then she broke a bitshe couldnt quite suppress the mischief or you were until i landed you with the wedding of the century youre going to have to cancel on the biggest wedding weve seen in this place what a shame i cant cancel come on you can afford to lose one wedding all that hurts is your pride and pride doesnt matter to you just look what you did to kylie i is that you jenny jacks voice interrupted and jenny hauled herself away from the wagon and abandoned the insouciance i need to go inside you need to gowherever rich entrepreneurs go when theyre not messing with this town see you later do you have someone out there jack called jenny i need to talk to you mrs westmere she flashed its mrs westmere unless i can call you guy of course you can call me guy bring your visitor in jenny go away she said i need you you dont need anyone you come waltzing into town in your flash car its borrowed from a friend you borrowed a ferrari she demanded incredulously someone just tossed you the keys of a ferrari and said have it for a few days like he has one ferrari for normal use and another to lend to friends his other cars an aston martin he said apologetically and his wife drives a jag i so much dont need this conversation she made to turn into the house but he stepped forward and caught her shoulders the action should have made her angryand at one level it didbut then there was this other part of her he really was a ludicrously attractive male she thought she wasnt the least bit afraid of him well why should she be when she had lorna and jack just through the screen door but there was more than that his grip felt somehowokay it wasnt the least bit okay this was those damned hormones working again she thought shed been a widow for too long but she had protectionagainst hormones as well as against marauding males she hadnt answered jack and jack and lorna had grown worried now the front screen slammed back and jack was on the veranda jack was a wiry little man in his late seventies tough as nails and belligerent to go with it he was crippled with arthritis but he didnt let that stop him whos this he growled before jenny could say a word he stalked stiffly down the veranda trying to disguise the limp from his gammy hip trying to act as if he was going to lift over six feet of guy carver and hurl him off the property guy dropped his hands from jennys shoulders he didnt step away though he stood a foot away from her his eyes filled with quizzical laughter you have a security system i surely do she answered taking a grip of her wandering hormones and turning to face her inlaws jack lornathis is guy carver lorna was out on the veranda now shed pushed her wheelchair though the doorway rolling to the edge of the ramp but no further lorna had once been a blousy buxom blonde her hair was still determinedly blonde and her eyes were still pretty and blue but a stroke had withered one side of her body one side of her face had very little movement and her speech was careful and stilted mr carver she managed he says we can call him guy why are you manhandling my daughterinlaw jack barked and the lurking laughter behind guys eyes was unmistakable i was just turning her in the right direction towards you its okay jack jenny told him mrguys just leaving look at the car lorna said suddenly distracted what is that a ferrari guy said bemused and at that the screen door swung open again dont come out henry jenny said quickly but it was too late henry was already on the veranda she winced she badly didnt want guy to see henry hed already shown himself to be insensitive how much damage could he do now for the crash that had killed his father had left henry so badly burned that for a while theyd thought he might not live the sixyearold was slowly recovering but the scars on the right side of his face were only a tiny indication of the scars elsewhere his chest and his right leg bore a mass of scarring and he was facing skin graft after skin graft as he grew henry should be a frecklefaced kid facing life with mischief and optimism there were signs now that he could be again but the scars ran deep his thatch of deep brown curls stopped cruelly where the scarring began just above his right ear his brown eyes were alive and interestedthank god his sight had been untouchedbut hed lost so much weight he looked almost anorexic compared to most sixyearolds his right leg was still not bearing weight and he used crutches his freckles stood out starkly on his too pale skin standing on the veranda in his overbig pyjamaslorna was sure hed have a growth spurt any minute and she sewed accordinglyhe looked a real waif the surgeons said that in time theyd have his face so normal that as he matured people would think of him as manly and rugged but that time was a long way off from now i want to see the car henry said she held her breath waiting for guy to respond if she had her druthers jenny would keep her private life absolutely to herself a private person at the best of times these last two years had been hell shed been forced to depend on so many people the locals had been wonderful but now she was finally starting to regain some control of her shattered life and the look of immediate sympathy flashing into guy carvers eyes made her want to hit him whats wrong with your little boy how many times had that been flung at her since henry had recovered enough to be outside the house it was never the localsthey all knew and had more sense than to ask about his progress in front of him but the squillionaires who arrived for a week or two were appalling and she wanted to be shot of the lot of them maybe now shed sold the business she could move she thought she could get a great place if she was prepared to go inland a little but jack and lorna had lived here all their lives she and henry were all they had she couldnt leave so now she flinched waiting for guy to say something like they all did whats wrong or gee what happened to your kid why is he so scarred or worse oh you poor little boy but guy said nothing he had his face under control again and the shock and sympathy were gone instead he glanced at the ferrari with affection its a modena f he told henry man to man its ace henry whispered and something in guys face moved somethingchanged if its okay with your mother would you like a ride henrys small body became perfectly still rigid as if steeling himself for a blow imum youre kidding she said to guy i dont kid he said and his voice had changed too it had softened i mean it im assuming this is your son yes but im guy he told henry and you are henry said henry is this your car its borrowed do you have a car like this i have a lamborghini back in new york wow henry breathed and looked desperately at his mother is it okay if i take a ride with him its dinnertime dinner can wait jack growled jennys fatherinlaw was looking at the car with an awe that matched his grandsons if anyone offered me a ride in such a car id wait for dinner til breakfast youre next in the queue guy said and grinned id take you all at once he added apologetically but its hard to squeeze three people in these babies jenny you can go third i dont want to go is it okay if i take henry of course its okay jack snapped as if astounded that anyone could ask that question isnt it girl fine she said defeated and henry let out a warwhoop that could be heard back in main street then he paused you dont mean just sit in it of course not can we go out on the coast road henry asked eyeing his mother as if shed grown two heads never go with strangers her consent meant she knew this guy and trusted him his mother had a friend with a ferrari she could see shed just raised herself in his estimation by about a mile the coast road winds round cliffs with this caritll go like its on rails you wont go fast she knew her voice was suddenly tight but she couldnt help it we wont go fast guy told her and there was that tone in his voice that said he understood how could he understand the remembrance of his hands on her shoulders slipped back into her mind which was dumb henrys in his pyjamas she said too quickly but suddenly that was how she felt as if everything was too quick does he need to change no one notices whos in a ferrari guy told her they only notice the ferrari if youre in a ferrari you can wear what you dwhatever you like youre cool by association are you ready henry yeah henry breathed and tossed aside his crutches and looked to his mother for help to go down the ramp yeah i am he seems lovely hes not back inside jenny was trying to explain the extraordinary turn of events to her inlaws he wont do kylies wedding shes not good enough to be a carver bride kylie is a bit lorna said and jenny glowered and tossed tea into the pot with unnecessary force dont you come down on his side kylie and shirley were great to us they had been all of those dreary months when jenny had needed to be in the hospitalfor three awful weeks henry had not been expected to livekylie and shirley and a host of other locals had run this little farm had ferried lorna and jack wherever theyd wanted to go had filled the freezer with enough casseroles to feed an army for years had even taken over the organisation of local weddings the town had been wonderful and jenny wasnt about to turn her back on them now i know theyre fabulous lorna told her and of course i promised wed do kylies wedding but they wont hold us to more than that i was just so upset with ben dead and we thought wed lose henry you would have promised the world jenny said shirley knows that she tried it on with guy this afternoonand why wouldnt you but i will do kylies wedding for cost and guy cant stop me ill just organise it from here and the rest he can have the society weddings i dont want them theyre the only ones that make us money well survive he paid heaps for the businessmore than its worth but i dont want guy carver as my boss thered be worse bosses jack said and jenny sighed just because the man has a ferrari whats he driving henry for to wheedle his way into getting me to work for him she snapped the mans a born wheedler i can see it he doesnt look like a wheedler to me lorna said shed been laying plates on the table but now she stilled her wheelchair and turned to face her daughterinlaw jenny its been two years we know you loved ben but maybe its time you moved on what are you talking about he looks quite a catch jack said crossing to the door to lookhopefullyout with a bit of luck thered be time for a ride for him before dinner was on the table a lamborghini at home eh you think i should jump him because he owns a lamborghini jenny asked incredulously and jack had the grace to look a bit shamefaced i just meant he just meant dont look a gift horse in the mouth lorna said decisively im asking the man to tea you cant watch me lorna said plonking a fifth plate on the table i just know the nice man will stay the night was interminable jenny couldnt believe hed accepted lornas invitation she couldnt believe he was sitting at her dining table with every appearance of complacency this was a man international jetsetters regarded as ultracoolthe epitome of good taste if they saw him now for a start hed walked in the front door without even appearing to notice lorna and jacks decorations the christmas after ben had been killed when henrys life had hung by a precarious thread lorna had decreed christmas was off it doesnt mean anything shed declared im tossing all my decorations twelve months later shed rather shamefacedly hauled out her nontossed decorations jack and jenny had been desultorily watching television with henry on the sofa nearby theyd been miserable but theyd fallen on the decorations like longlost friends that night had been the first night when ghosts and fear and sadness hadnt hung over the house and this year henry had demanded his grandparents start sorting the decorations on the first day of november so there was a reason why the decorations were just ever so slightly over the top jenny conceded shed hauled henrys chair close beside her he was leaning on her still lit up after his ride in guys wonderful car he was tired now but jenny thought thered be trouble if she tried to send him to bed lorna and jack were chatting to guy as if they were entertaining an old friend and henry was soaking in every word he had a new superhero as for jennyjenny was trying to block out the flashing lights from the realsized sled in the front yard the house and the yard were chockfull of christmas kitsch she loved every last fluffy pink angel she decided defensively trying not to wonder what he was thinking of her if guy didnt like them then he could leave guy carver would be a minimalist jenny thought watching lorna ladle gravy over his roast beef and jack handing him the vast casserole of cauliflower cheese hed like one svelte silhouette of a nativity scene in a cool grey window jenny could count five nativity scenes from where she was sitting the decorations are wonderful mrs westmere guy told lorna and jenny cast him a look of deep suspicion as lorna practically purred jenny thinks maybe the front yard is a bit over the top how could you jenny guy said and cast reproachful eyes at her she choked are you staying until christmas jack asked and guy said he wasnt sure why im asking said jack obviously searching for courage is that every year santa comes to sandpiper bay if youre asking me to wear a santa suit guy said suddenly sounding fearful and jenny looked at guys mediterranean good looks and thought yeah right santai dont think so then no no no jack assured him we have a very fine santa bill went to a training course in sydney and everything but the thing is that every christmas morning santa drives through the town tossing lollies from the fire truck henry interrupted which just about astounded jenny all by itself normally when visitors came henry was seen but not heard henry had been a happy cheerful fouryearold when his fathers car had collided headon with a kid spaced out of his brain on cocaine now henrys world was limited to hospital visits physiotherapy clinics and his grandparents farm for henry to go with guy tonight had been astonishing and the fact that he was chirping away like a butchers magpie now was even more so see theres the problem jack explained growing earnest the problem with christmas in australia is that its at the height of summer in summer theres fires last year the fire truck got called away one minute santa was up top handing out lollies the next he was standing in the middle of main street with a halfempty santa sack while the fire truck screamed off into the distance to someones burning haystack goodness guy said faintly goodness jenny thought suddenly realising where this was going now if you were here young man in your ferrari santa could use your ferrari henry said suddenly wideeyed cool course its not the real santa he explained while guy looked as if he was trying to figure how he could escape hes a santas helper mum told me that last year i sat in the back of our car and the fire engine came right up and santa gave me three lollies that was before it was called away jenny said trying not to get teary too lateshe was teary dratted tears she blinked them away but not before guy had seen she knew hed seen he had hawklike eyes that could see everything mr carvers going home before christmas she told henry feeling desperate arent you mr carver im not sure guy told her and the name is guy youre not seriously thinking of doing the annabarret party id need help a party lorna intercepted brighteyed what sort of party anna and barrets wedding anna and barret lorna paused confused and then confusion gave way to awe you dont mean anna and barret i mean anna and barret theyre getting married here if we can cater if your daughterinlaw will come back as a member of my staff jenny lorna said eyes shining how wonderful its not jenny said he wont do kylies wedding we can do kylies wedding guy said she eyed him with disbelief as a carver wedding i dont think ha she wouldnt like my style of wedding anna wants pink tulle surely you give the clients what they want if it fits into my that is such an arrogant will you two stop it lorna said stuttering in an attempt to get this sorted jenny you need to help him i dont as a matter of interest guy said calmly could you help me if you wanted to do what she said trying to disguise a childlike glower but he saw it and his lips twitched no wonder the glossies described him in glowing terms jenny thought until now shed wondered how the head of what was essentially a catering company had become someone that the gossip columnists described as hot property now she knew guy would just have to look at you with those eyes that held laughter the man was seriously sexy do you have the resources to run a wedding for three hundred on christmas day he asked and she had to make a sharp attempt to haul her hormones into line are we arguing about something thats an impossibility its not impossible she said and then thought maybe she shouldnt have admitted it why is it not impossible anna says she wants pink tulle so the laughter was gone now and she could see why he was also described as one of the worlds best businessmen she could see the intelligencethe focus so we could give her a country wedding kyliestyle it would be so unexpected that shed love it we could put on a country dance jack contributed its great weather this time of year haul some hay bales out into the paddock for seats some more for a bar and shove a keg on the back of the truck keg guy asked faintly fosters jack told him gotta be fosters he means beer jenny told him putting him out of his misery i dont think this crowd would be happy with only beer drinks the least of my problems so whats your problem finding clothes for the wedding party in ten days sourcing food finding staff to wait on tables and clear up afterwards piece of cake jenny said and then thought that was stupid what was she letting herself in for how is it a piece of cake make kylies wedding the first australian carver wedding and ill tell you kylie doesnt want a carver wedding youre making huge assumptions here she flashed and henry stirred and looked up at his mother in surprise lorna shifted her wheelchair sideways so she could take his weight and he moved his allegiance to his grandmother as if he wasnt quite sure who his mother was any more whats the difference between anna and kylie she demanded career choice and money nothing more kylies got herself pregnant but anna ended up in drug rehab two kids getting married kylie does want a carver wedding and she asked first youd seriously make me no ones making you do anything she told him including staying at our dinner table youre telling me to leave i dont like what money does to people the man hasnt finished his dinner yet jack protested have a heart its a bit rude to invite him to eat and put him out lorna added looking curiously at jenny jennys just itching for a fight jack told lorna speaking across the table as if no one else was there dunno whats got into her really its hormones lorna decided you have a nice cup of tea jen lorna she could do the wedding if she wanted to lorna said turning to guy shes the cleverest lass i used to run the salon making dresses for locals and organising caterers for outoftowners only then the outoftowners grew to so many that i had to employ jenny it was the best thing i ever did her mum didnt have any money and her dad lit out early so there wasnt enough to send jenny to anywhere like university she took on an apprenticeship with me shes transformed the business shes just lorna jenny said almost yelling will you cut it out mr carver doesnt want to know about me yes i do he said mildly i need to persuade you to use some of your skills on my behalf where could you get caterers on christmas day i dont you tell him lass jack said dont hide your light under a bushel she stared wildly round but they were all watching her expectantly even henry this town is full of retirees she said at last trying desperately to get her voice under control most of them have a very quiet christmas if we had all the food planned the day beforeif we settled on country fare that all the women round here can cookif anna settled for a late wedding and if we told the locals that they could come to the dance afterwardsthered be queues to work for us locals come to the ceremony he said incredulous not the ceremony the idea would be that thered be a huge party afterwards with workers welcome think of the publicity for anna and barret if you got onto that nice pr person i talked to this afternoon guy stared at her poleaxed it might it might well work she said shes not squeaky clean our anna and this would be great publicity you know about annas past the world knows about annas past this wedding will be great for her it would he agreed and suddenly jennys eyes narrowed thats why youre thinking of doing it she said softly on a note of discovery thinking it through as she spoke i couldnt understand but suddenly she did seeing clearly where her impetuous nature had landed guy the carver empire doesnt need this wedding but anna needs the carver emporium she bit her lip i should have thought about that when i was contacted oh heck i was angry with you and i didnt think to say guy was bewildered was an understatement that jenny was sensitive enough to see connotations that hed only figured because he moved in those circles his estimation of the woman in front of him was changing by the minute gorgeous smart funny he didnt do gorgeous smart and funny he didnt do complications he rose so sharply that he had to make a grab to catch his chair before it toppled i need to go you havent had coffee lorna said mildly but he didnt hear he was watching jenny you agree to staying on my payroll until christmas can kylie have a carver wedding yes he said against the ropes and knowing it she hesitated but then gave a rueful smile okay then ive never worked for a boss before what about me lorna said indignant and jenny grinned thats different i walked into your shop for the interview and ben was there i was family from that minute on you were too lorna said and reached over and squeezed her hand family something knotted in guys gut that he didnt want to know about he backed to the door where are you staying young man jack asked my secretary booked a place for me braeside you been there yet no i youll never find it jack said with grim satisfaction its up back of town by the river tourists get lost there all the time it seemed a source of satisfaction jack was looking at him with what seemed to be enjoyment i have directions ive seen the directions they use youll be driving through the mountains til dawn jennyll have to take you jenny stilled then she nodded as if she agreed you will get lost ill drive there and you can follow me what fun is that jack demanded you havent had a drive in his ferrari ive got a better idea you drive him home in his ferrari and then bring it back here then pick him up on the way to work tomorrow morning i cant drive a ferrari jenny said astonished course you can jack said roundly if you can make your ancient bucket of bolts work you can make anything work her wagons held together with string he told guy she ought to buy another but shes putting every cent she owns into a fund for henrys schooling his face clouded a little theres been a few costs over the last couple of years we hadnt counted on of course guy thought his eyes moving to henrys face the little boys face was perfect on one side but on the other were scarslots of scars i cant drive a ferrari jenny said again and he forced himself to think logically which was hard when his emotions were stirring in all sorts of directions yes you can he said and managed a smile that he hoped was casual there you go then lorna said triumphant jack and me will put henry to bed henry your mother is going to have a drive in the lovely car isnt that great ace said henry chapter three it felt weird jenny thought as they walked across the yard towards his car it was almost dark she should be reading her son his bedtime story she shouldnt be climbing into a ferrari you drive guy said and tossed her the keys this is a bad idea she muttered this is a borrowed car surely your friend wouldnt agree to me using it if you crash it ill buy him another the idea made her stop in her tracks youre kidding why would i kid i dont want to go with you she said and it was his turn to pause and stare you have ethical objections to money no i you should be charging kylie theres no need for you to be broke isnt there she snapped and glared giving your services for free is noble but you have no idea do you this communitywere here for each other we do what has to be done and asking for payment your career is a bridal planner selling yourself short is stupid when ben was killed henry was injured and he had to spend months in a burns unit in the city she snapped jack has macular degenerationhis eyesights not what it should beand lorna hasnt driven since her stroke shirley grubb was one of a team who took it in turns to drive jack and lorna down to see us twice a week for nearly six months every other day they drove lorna into the bridal salon and someone stayed with her all the time the business stayed open there were casserolesyou cant believe how many casseroles and you know what not a single person charged us did they sell themselves short mr carver guy he said automatically and opened the drivers door of the ferrari get in im not driving you are driving you need to bring it home yourself so you can try it out now we can take my wagon your wagon backfires backfiring offends me and i have no intention of being lost in these mountains for want of a little resolution on your part get in and drive it was such a different driving experience that she feltunreal the road up to braeside was lovely it followed the cliffs for a mile out of town and the big car swept around the curves with a whine of delight by the time the road veered inland following the river she had its measure and was glorying in being in control of the most magnificent piece of machinery shed ever seen nice huh guy said five minutes into the drive and she flashed him a guilty look shed been so absorbed in her driving that shed almost forgotten he was there almost its fantastic you get this wedding working for me and you can keep it she almost crashed she took a deep breath straightened the wheel and tried to remember where she was dont be ridiculous im not being ridiculous ill merely pay my friend out its not like its a new car its not like its a new car she said mocking no thank you mr carver my salary is stipulated in the contract ill take that but thats all id be obliged to you for ever and ive had obligations up to my neck so leave it he left it there were another few moments of silence while jenny negotiated a few more curves it was so wonderful that she could almost block guy outand his preposterous offer feels great doesnt it he said and she was forced to smile its magic yet you dont want it i couldnt afford the trip to sydney to get this serviced she told him much less the service itself leave it alone im not used to having my gifts knocked back get used to it jenny im not for sale guy she said roughly and dont interfere with my life i intend to do these two weddings and then get out of your business for ever youll go back to manhattan and live your glamorous life a thousand miles from mine what do you know about my life he said startled and she screwed up her nose in rueful mockery ive spent the last two years in doctors waiting rooms so so i reckon ive read every issue of celebrity magazine thats ever been printed with you being rich and influential and associated with every celebrity bash worthy of the name your life is fair game i know how rich you are i know you dont like oysters and you never wear navy suits i also know you were in a car crash with your childhood sweetheart about fifteen years ago her father and your father were partners shed been at your parents company christmas dinner alone and then shed collected you from some celebrity bash youd been organising she was killed outright your parents disowned you then they said shed been drinking because she was angry they said if youd stayed in the family law firm like you were supposed to it would never have happened and youthe glossies say youre still grieving for your lost love are you no he said stunned i hope youre not she took a deep breath deciding whether to be personal or not what the heck its hard she confided bens only been dead for two years but you know my photographs of ben are starting to be clearer than the image i hold in my head i hate that are you better at it than me can you rememberwhat was her name or do you only remember photographs it was christa he said in a goaded voice i cant imagine why youd be interested enough to read about us i wasnt very she admitted it was just something to read in the waiting roomsomething to take my mind off what was happening to henry but i remember thinking it was crazy wearing the willow for someone for fifteen years so how long do you intend to wear the willow for ben im not youre living with his parents thats because theyve become my parents she said sometimes i wonder whether i fell in love with ben himself or if i fell in love with the whole concept of family like you tonight looking round the dining table and lookinghungry i didnt he said revolted can we leave it with the inquisition sure she said and she thought maybe she had pushed it too far this man was supposed to be her boss she should be being a bit deferential subservient he didnt make her feel subservient he made her feel she didnt understand how he made her feel she tried to conjure ben up in her mind kind gentle ben whod loved her so well its tough he said into the stillness and she wondered what he was talking about the first christmas was the worst but its still bad he added and she knew he knew its okay but its tough ive got thirteen years before i catch up to you in the mourning stakes she snapped and turned the car into the front yard of braeside heres your guesthouse it was a fabulous spot guy thought staring around with appreciation the moon was glinting through bushland to the river beyond hanging low in the eastern sky over the distant sea the guesthouse was a sprawling weatherboard home with vast verandas all around ive heard its sumptuous jenny said climbing out of the car to stretch her legs youve never been inside the likes of me id be shown out by security guards im sorry about paris i shouldnt have told you about paris she hesitated while he hauled his gear from the trunk are you serious about me driving this thing home you realise itll be parked near chooks chooks feathery things that lay eggs park it as far away as possible guy said sounding nervous okay i was just teasing i might even find a tarpaulin ill collect you tomorrow at nine then with or without chook poo fine he said he turned away but then he hesitated thank you for tonight he said and we really will give kylie a great wedding i know we will she trusted him she thought she wasnt sure why but she did but suddenly she didnt trust herself she should get into the drivers seat she told herself guy needed to walk away but thenand why she didnt knowit was as if things changed the night changed jenny he said uncertainly i know she said but she didnt know anything except that he was going to kiss her and she was going to let him she could have pulled back he was just as uncertain as she wasor maybe he was just as certain he dropped his holdall moving very slowly he reached out and caught her hands tugging her towards him she allowed herself to be tugged maybe she didnt need his propulsion thank you for dinner he said and she thought hes making this seem like a fleeting kiss of courtesy though both of them knew it was no such thing youre welcome she whispered his lips brushed hers a feather toucha question and not an answer youre very welcome she said again as he drew backand suddenly she was being kissed properly thoroughly wonderfully shed forgottenor maybe shed never known this heat this feeling of melting into a man and losing control just like that there was warmth spreading throughout her limbs a lovely languorous warmth that had her feeling that her world was changing right there and then and it could never be the same again she kissed him back demanding as much as he was demanding of her tasting him savouring the feel of his wonderful male body under her hands guy carver guy carver this was crazy she jenny westmere mother of henry wife of bento kiss this man she was out of her mind panicked she shoved her hands between her breast and his chest pushing him away he released her at once he tried to take her hands but shed have none of it she was three feet away from him now four no no his eyes were gently questioning not laughing she couldnt have borne it if he was laughing no jenny i only kiss my husband she said and the words made perfect sense to her even if they didnt to him but it appeared he understood youre not being unfaithful jenny it was only a kiss only a kiss then why was her world spinning im not some easy country hick i never thought you were youre here until christmas will we see you again after that probably not were ships passing in the night she took a deep breath and steadied so maybe wed better do just thatpass im not into relationships he said not even smiling im not about to mess with your tidy life my lifes not very tidy she confessed but thank you nowi think id better go home youre brave enough to drive the ferrari by yourself something tells me itd be far more dangerous to stay here with you she muttered but ill pick you up in the morning as long as you promise not to kiss me again you want me to promise yes i do she said and if her voice sounded desperate she couldnt help it i wont kiss you again i know a mistake when i see one im a mistake absolutely he told her this whole place is a mistake i should leave now only of course he didnt he couldnt he booked into the fantastic guesthouse hed been delivered to he rang malcolm in new york and confirmed that there was no one who could get here on short notice to take over organisation scooping the barret and anna wedding is fabulous though malcolm was chortling every bride in australia will want you after this its just as well youre there to do it handson youll use the local staff great make sure you dont mess up the local staff guy thought of what he had to build onjenny and by the sound of it a crew of geriatricsand he almost groaned its the best publicity we could think of malcolm said jovially ill manage the film conglomerate do were fine only they werent or he wasnt guy lay in the sumptuous fourposter bed that night listening to owls in the bushland outside and wondered what he was getting into he didnt know and he didnt want to find out and five miles away jenny was feeling exactly the same when she got back to the farmhouse henry was asleep and lorna and jack were filling hot water bottles from the kitchen kettle did you have a nice ride dear lorna asked and for the life of her jenny couldnt keep her face under control lorna watched her daughterinlaw her eyes twinkling he seems verypersonable she said speaking to no one in particular and jenny knew her motherinlaw was getting ideas which were ridiculous they were ridiculous she scowled at her inlaws and went to bed but not to sleep she stared at the ceiling for hours and then flicked on the lamp and stared at the picture on her bedside table her lovely ben whod brought her into this wonderful family whod given her henry i love you ben she whispered but he didnt answer if he was here hed just smile and then hug her she ached to be hugged by ben yes by ben she told the night guy carver has been here for less than twentyfour hours hes an international jetsetter with megabucks he kissed me tonight because ill bet thats what international jetsetters do hes your boss jennifer westmere you need to maintain a dignified employeremployee relationship dont stuff it up and dont let him kiss you again he wont want to he might she wasnt sure who she was arguing with if anyone could hear theyd think she was crazy ben she whispered and lifted the frame from the bedside table and kissed it she turned off the lamp and remembered the kiss not bens kiss the kiss of guy carver chapter four jenny arrived at guys guesthouse the next morning wearing clothing that said very clearly she was there to work plain white shirt kneelength skirt plain sandals guy emerged dressed in fawn chinos a lovely soft green polo shirt with a tiny white yacht embroidered on the chestjenny bet it had to be the logo of the worlds most exclusive yacht cluband faded loafers he looked at what jenny was wearing and stopped dead the carver corporation has a dress code he said whats wrong with this its frumpy it was too in fact jenny had worked quite hard to find it thered been an international lawnbowls meet in sandpiper bay two years ago and shed helped organise the catering the dress code for that had meant shed had to go out and buy this sophisticated little outfit and she hadnt worn it since its my usual work wear she lied yesterday i was too casual we were both too casual he agreed and she blushed right get on with it so where do you want to start ive come here to plan the refurbishment of the salon thats important but theres the little manner of two weddings leave the planning to me he said and she subsided into what she hoped was dignified silence she was this mans employee hed kissed her she should forget all about that kiss she should lets not aim at the stars here she told herself lets just be a good little employee and put the memory of that kiss on the backburner but not very far back he was out of his depth theyd purchased three salons so far in this round of expansion in each of those guy had visited early taken note of the features of the building as they were then brought his notes back to his cool grey office in manhattan and drawn them up as hed like them to be with plans prepared hed sent a team of professionals to do his bidding and six months later theyd opened as a carver salon now thanks to lornas indiscretion the carver name would be used before he could leave his imprint he had to get rid of the fluff and fast instead of sitting down calmly planning for the future he was trying to figure how he could get this place clear so if the media arrived to see the latest carver salon theyd see something worthy of the name how to transform fluff to elegance in a week and how to ignore jenny sitting silently at her desk she sat with her hands folded in front of her a good little employee waiting for instructions what was it about this woman that unnerved him why was she so different he didnt do relationships he didnt phone kylie he said at last goaded tell her shes having a carver wedding i already have she said meekly he was out of his depth he needed help here i need your assistance he snapped and she nodded ready to be helpful yes sir jenny sir will you cut it out cut what out i dont know where the hell to start he confessed and watched as she struggled to keep the expression on her face subservient youre asking for my input i want some solid help here he told her i assume youre not just the girl who mans the desk youve been running this place on your own since lornas stroke but youre in charge im waiting for orders we need to get a dumpster he said in exasperation something to get rid of this lot you have two weddings to organise before christmas and youre planning to redecorate the salon she said cautiously right she lifted the phone ill order a dumpster dresses he said in increasing frustration we need to organise a wedding dress and attendants outfits they might take some time jenny said and started dialling he lifted the phone from her hand and crashed it down onto the cradle if i dont get some solid help here ill sack me she said and smiled damn the woman he knew she was competent he wanted to take her shoulders and shake her he wanted to kiss her that thought wasnt helping things at all his normally cool calculating mind was clouded and it was clouded because this woman was looking up at him with a strange enigmatic smile this woman who was as far from his life as any woman hed ever met this woman who was up to her neck in emotional entanglements his employee he took a deep breath turned and paced the salon a couple of times trying to clear his head he knocked one of the bridal mannequins and spent a couple of minutes righting it he turned to jenny and she was watching him her eyes interested her head to one side like an inquisitive sparrow forget shes a woman he told himself and forget shes an employee lets get this onto some sort of even keel jenny im out of my depth here he told her i dont know where to start she stilled the faint smile on her face faded hed shocked her he thought whatever shed been expecting it hadnt been that there was a long silence she could keep up the playacting he thought and she was definitely considering it the role of subservient employee was a defence he watched as indecision played on her face finally she broke her face was incredibly expressive he thought he saw the exact moment she put away the playacting and decided to be upfront two weddings she said the biggest problem is the dresses we need to get things moving there are three local women with the capacity to sew fast and well contact them no she shook her head theyre all up to their ears in christmas preparations then what there are a couple of oldies i know who love babysitting she said they have very quiet christmases so they may be prepared to help jonas bucket had an accident at work some years ago and is confined to a wheelchair he loves christmas cooking so if i what are you talking about he was lost mary sarah and leanne are my seamstresses she said patiently mary and sarah have small kids and leannes having eighteen people for christmas dinner if i ask them to sew for me theyll say no but if i say ive already organised childminding and cooking and housecleaningand someone to set leannes tablethen theyll jump at the chance to escape by sewing now now what he said stunned youre the boss she said but if i were you id sit down and write the menu for the barret and anna wedding we need to get the food ordered right away theyve elected to do a christmas theme so well keep it like that roast turkey and all the trimmings for a sophisticated she did say pink tulle jenny said though she sounded a bit less certain of her ground so she did guy said thinking fast and then looked up as the doorbell tinkled it was kylie she was dressed in pregnancy overalls with a white tshirt underneath with her face flushed with either nerves or excitement and her blonde curls tied up in two pigtails guy decided she looked like one of those russian mazurka dolls if you pushed her shed topple over and then spring right up hi kylie jenny said and guy winced this woman was a client his first australian carver wedding mum just rang me kylie said with a nervous look aside at guy she says mr carvers agreed to do my wedding he has jenny said but theres no need to change your plans well do your wedding exactly as weve planned it no said kylie there was a moments silence no jenny said at last cautiously and received a furious shake of her head in reply you dont want a wedding of course i want a wedding kylie said me and daryl are really excited but but what jenny asked its mums wedding she burst out and daryls mums theyve been at us for ever to get married and of course we want to but we didnt want this we thought maybe wed just have the baby and then go somewhere afterwards and get married quietly but from the minute we told them we were expecting theyve been at us and at us until finally we cracked and that dressmum had you make it for me when i was sixteen she chose it not me every week since then mum gets it out and pats it do you know how much i hate it no jenny said stunned i cant tell you kylie declared but i loathe it i would have gone along with it fine i said to daryl whatever makes them happy but when mum rang and said i could have a carver wedding i thought suddenly a carver wedding i could maybe have it like i want elegant sleek sophisticated something so when our kids grow up theyll look at our wedding photos and think wow just for a bit our parents werent assistants in a butchers shop if you knew how much i hate pink tulle your six bridesmaids are in pink tulle jenny murmured exactly kylies colour was almost beetroot as she desperately tried to explain herself it was bad enough when i was skinny but now ill look like a wall of cupids coming down the aisle with a sea of pink tulle coming after she turned to guy they say in the fashion magazines that you can perform miracles get me out of cupids and pink tulle please there was a deathly hush we cant jenny said at last kylie the dresses are finished theres less than a week to your wedding and we have another enormous wedding to cater for on christmas day the passion went out of kylie like air out of a pricked balloon and defeat took its place in an instant shed expected this guy thought her request had been one last stand but defeat had been expected thatll be for someone rich ill bet kylie said but it wasnt said in anger it was said as a fact and there was a wealth of resignation in her voice someone who can afford any wedding she wants and who has enough guts to stand up for it guy looked suddenly at the girls hands they were scrubbed almost raw there were jagged scars on two fingers you work in a butchers shop kylie he asked her and kylie bit her lip yeah morriss butchers next door thats why i could come so quickly but i should be back there now youll work there after youre married course i will she said its daryls dads shop and theres no way we can afford for me to stay home were having a weeks honeymoon staying at daryls aunties place ill have another week off when the babys born then well set up a cot in the back she shook her head sorry it was dumb to ask i gotta get back she sounded totally resigned guy thought accepting jenny was watching him what had kylie said when she first arrived they say in the fashion magazines that you can perform miracles he couldnt perform miracles of course he couldnt but anna wants pink tulle he said slowly and jenny nodded she seemedcautious thats no problem we can order more but anna will be more than happy with a kitsch wedding he said jenny you said you have three through as he spoke from the sound of the fax they sent me kitsch is exactly what she wants and anna has six bridesmaids so so we swap he said and his organisational mode slipped back into place just like that jennys presencejenny herselfhad somehow thrown him off course hed been feeling out of control since yesterday but suddenly now hed slipped back behind the wheel knowing exactly where he was going well take kylies wedding dress and bridesmaids dresses and well alter them to fit anna and her followers he said jenny you said you have three dressmakers ready to go lets get the measurements and get them started kylie your bridesmaids mmm she was staring openmouthed whats kitsch she said what your wedding was and what it wont be any more he said my alternative bride and her friends will think its fun its fun when youre not forced into it do your bridesmaids all have little black dresses the sort of thing you wear when you want to be elegant course kylie whispered not seeing where he was going i mean everyone has to have a black dress for when you dunno what else to wear would they be upset to lose the pink tulle you have to be kidding they hate pink tulle as much as i do two of them are my sisters and three of them are daryls sisters so they have to do what our mums say the other ones my best friend and doreen says the pink tulle makes her look like a kewpie doll right guy said lets go for an elegant christmas theme deep crimson and a rich dark green seven dresses jenny said faintly six bridesmaids in their lovely black dresses it means they wont have to spend a cent and theyll have already chosen something that looks great on them therell be no onestylesuitsall disasters theyll wear their hair sleek and elegantup if its long in sophisticated chignons or if its short ill arrange really good cuts ill do it myself if need be black strappy shoes the only colour about them will be a beautiful crimson and green corsage thatll bring in a tiny christmas theme which seems appropriate at this time of the year ill get onto a sydney florist this afternoon and organise the best what about me kylie whispered and the men gangsterstyle suits and hats guy decreed well hire them from sydney or fly them from new york what do you think gangsters kylie said the beginnings of anticipation curving the sides of her mouth into a smile hats and braces and white shoes youve got it daryl will love it guy smiled great and you he looked at kylie for a long minute while jenny watched in dumbfounded silence kylie lets not try to disguise your pregnancy lets be proud of it im thinking pure white shot silkjenny can we get shot silk sure jenny said dazed a really simple dress guy said shoestring straps and a low sweetheart neckline that accentuates those gorgeous breasts kylie started to blush but he wasnt distracted hed grabbed the pad beside the phone and was sketching like this practically bare to the breasts softly curving into your waist accentuating the swell of pregnancy curving in again and then falling with a side slit from your thigh to your ankles i bet you have great legs kylie was staring at the sketch entranced daryl says she subsided yeah she whispered my legs areokay the sketch was growing under guys hands and she couldnt stop watching wow that even looks like me what are you doing to my hair piling it up in a thousand tiny curls on top of your head he said the simplicity of your bridesmaids hair will accentuate yours well thread the same crimson and green though your hairjust a little youll carry a tiny bouquet of fern and crimson rosebuds and if you want whwhat she stammered well thread tiny silver imitation pistols through the ribbon of your bouquet youre a gangsters moll this is a shotgun wedding and youve got your man kylie stared jenny stared then as one they burst out laughing my mum will hate it kylie said when she finally recovered its a carver wedding take it or leave it oh ill take it kylie whispered smiling now through the beginning of unshed tears yes please youre a magician kylie had left them to spread her news guy was left with jenny who was staring at him as if hed grown two heads im no magician he said but he was aware of a tinge of pleasure it was a pleasure he hadnt felt for a long time andwas there also a tinge of excitement he wanted to do this well he thought and when he tried to figure out why he knew that it had little to do with the reputation of the carver empire it was all to do with making jenny smile and he had made her smile she was definitely smiling i need to organise cars he said trying to move on there are limousines booked limousines wont do transfer that booking to annas if you can for kylie we need to get buicks or something similar well take the theme right through well never get them locally ill try sydney kylie cant afford well cover the cost ourselves he said as the first australian carver wedding itll more than pay for itself in publicity as for dress weve done gangstertype weddings in my other salons so gear shouldnt be a problem ill fly in costumes for the waiting staff he paused i assume you have staff booked of course i have staff booked she said incensed this wedding is planned down to the last pew ribbon well use some of those resources for the anna and barret wedding well design the wedding for kylie from scratch and use the basis of kylies for annas itll work ill need to paint sets for the gangster setting ill see if we can get a smoke machine from sydney a smoke machine it creates the haze without the health risk i should have everyone smoking either cigars or gauloise but ill bet you have laws preventing it we do there you go then a smoke machine it is now lets look at these dresses and see if any of them might fit without alterations youre good she said on a note of discovery and guy stopped making lists and glanced up at her youre surprised you said you could even cut hair theres nothing i havent been landed with in the years ive been building this business i know my stuff jenny i wouldnt be here if i didnt he smiled at her look of scepticism you dont need to worry he said softly well look after kylie the first australian carver wedding will go off with a bang it surely will she said awed and then suddenly as if she couldnt help herself she slipped out from behind the counter took two steps forward and kissed him it was nothing like the kiss theyd shared last night it was a kiss of gratitude nothing more and why it had the capacity to make him feel as if his feet werent quite on the ground he couldnt say youre making kylie happy she said softly thank you think nothing of it he said or he tried to say it but the words werent quite there he was staring at jenny as if he didnt know what this wasnt the type of woman that attracted him he hadnt exactly been celibate since christa had died what had jenny said it was crazy wearing the willow for someone for fifteen years he hadnt or maybe he had but only in the sense that he never got emotionally involved where relationships went he used his head and not his heart it did his firms reputation good if he was seen with alisters on his arm he chose glamorous women who could make him laugh but who knew commitment was neither wanted nor expected but jenny she was dressed like a prim secretary like a repressed old maid like something she wasnt he knew she wasnt because otherwise why would his body be screaming that it wanted this womanhe wanted this woman she was a complication he told himself desperately and hed spent his entire adult life making sure that he had as few complications in his life as possible i need to go check the facilities at annas property he said and if he sounded brusque he couldnt help it she grabbed her bag its in the hills north of town ill find it he said and she hesitated and then put her bag down again you want me to stay here yes fine back to being subservient ill make lists of whats needed she hesitated that is if you want me to i want you to fine what was it between them what was thisthing it felt like some sort of magnetic charge with both of them hauling away from it fine he repeated and he leftbut some important part of him stayed behind and he couldnt for the life of him think what it was chapter five they worked brilliantly as a teamapart for the next few days plans for the two weddings proceeded as swiftly as for any function guy had organised in manhattan most of it was down to jenny guy just had to hint at a suggestion and she had it organised she seemed to know every last person in a twentymile radius of sandpiper bay he needed oysters she knew the couple who leased the best oyster beds he wanted lobsters she knew the fisherman fantastic greens her husbands best friend had a hydroponic setup where they could get wonderful produce straight from the grower jenny wrote out a menu for annas wedding and when guy read it he grinned it was inspired yabbies prawns oysters lobsters scallopsseafood to die for and all in enough quantities to make their overseas guests drool after the main courses the menu became even more australianpavlovas with strawberries and cream lamingtons ginger fluff sponges chocolate éclairs vanilla slices lashings of homemade berry icecream bowls and bowls of fresh berries guy thought of how much this would cost in new york and then he looked at the figures jenny had prepared and blinkedand then he thought hed charge new york prices anyway it would mean he could put more into kylies wedding he could employ a really excellent band but this was all discussed by phone guy had left sandpiper bay to make a sweep of sydney suppliers the time away let him clear his head in truth the day hed tried to find annas property hed become thoroughly lost hed got back to the salon flustered and late and jenny had merely raised her brows in gentle mockery and not said a word shed known very well what had happened he thought and he didnt like it he didnt like it that she could read him so hed gone to sydney he wasnt escaping he thought it was merely that things needed to be organised in sydney on monday three days before kylies wedding five days before christmas he returned the beach was crowdedsummer was at its peak and there were surfingtypes everywhere bridal fluff was closed what had he expected he asked himself jenny had told him things were going well and besides he didnt want to see her did he he let himself into bridal fluff there was a typed list on the desk of everything that had to be done for the two weddings with a neat tick beside everything that had been done she was good he didnt want to think about how good she was he drove back to his guesthouse dumped his gear and made his way disconsolately down to the lobby he needed something to do anything even if it was just to stop him thinking about jenny especially if it was to make him stop thinking about jenny you should go to the beach the guesthouse proprietor told him its a wonderful day for a swim i need to he started and then thought no he didnt need to do anything the beach looks crowded thats just the front beach his host told him theres no need to be crowded at sandpiper bay all the kids go to the front beach they say the surfings better there but in truth its just become the place to be seen and being so near christmas therell be lots of outoftowners coming for picnics family parties and such if you want a quiet beach i can draw you a map showing you nautilus cove which has to be one of the most perfect swimming places in australia so ten minutes later he was in the car heading south for a swim there were two cars at the side of the road when he pulled upexpensive offroadersand he was paranoid enough to be thankful they werent jennys there might be a couple of locals there hed been told but they wont mind sharing actually he did mind sharing but it was a bit much to expect to have the beach to himself and two cars hardly made a crowd there were a few empty beer cans by the side of the road that gave him pause for a moment in this environmentally friendly shire roadside litter was cleared almost as soon as it happened were the owners of the offroaders drinking no matter he could handle himself he just wanted a quick swim he tossed his towel over his shoulders and strode beachwards as he topped the sand hill the cove stretched out before him breathtakingly beautiful golden sand gentle surf sapphire sea there was a group of youths at the far end of the beachthe offroaders occupants surely not he thought frowning they looked too young to be driving such expensive cars someone was yelling it looked a small but intimidating group of youths drunken teenagers showing off to each other he didnt want trouble and they looked like trouble hed find another beach but then he hesitated a figure broke from the group someone shoved and the figure stumbled there was raucous laughter cruel and jeering someone was in trouble they were a few hundred yards from him and it was hard to see but thenhe focussed it was a woman he thought and the woman seemed to be carrying a child she took a few more steps towards him jenny she was trudging through the soft sand carrying henry henry was clinging to her his face buried in her shoulder as the taunts followed them get the hell off our beach they yelled take your deformed kid with you a beer can hurtled through the air it didnt hit jenny but it hadnt landed before guy was hurtling down the slope as if the hounds of hell were after him jenny she was carrying a bag which looked a load in itself she was concentrating on putting one foot in front of another making sure she kept her balance in the soft sand she didnt see him approach every fibre of her being concentrating on getting off the beachfast he reached her and put out his hands and stopped her she flinched backwards jenny she looked up at him her face pale and gaunt but as she saw who it was relief washed over her she almost sagged gguy get us out of here she stammered another beer can headed in their direction youre not moving fast enough someone yelled from the group hey mister keep away from them the kids a mutant go guy said urgently and put his body between her and the barrage of cans and foul language if he could have picked her up and carried her he would have but picking up jenny and henry and their gear was a bit much even for someone with superhero aspirations go on up to the road he told her get to my car and wait for me but go he tugged his cellphone from his belt its for emergency here isnt it yes but go she went she didnt have a choice he stood his ground and dialled and two seconds later he had a response he stood facing the teenagers and spoke into the phone loudly and firmly loud enough for them to hear theres a group of what looks like underaged drinkers on nautilus cove he told the officer whod answered his call im guessing theyve been driving drunk and none of them look old enough to hold a driving licence their cars look expensive the kids average age is about sixteen so im guessing the cars are stolen theyre throwing beer cans at a woman and child on the beach its ugly well have someone there in minutes sir the operator said can you stay on the line sure youll hear everything that goes on ten or eleven youths were staring at him now with the uncertainty that stemmed from being drunk and out of control and seeing someone acting in control they could turn on him he thought but he had a window of opportunity to stop that happening they didnt know who he was he sounded authoritative and they were too drunk to act fast if those cars are stolen he said loudly but calmly then you all have a major problem the police are on their way you can stay and get arrested or you can go now they stared at him in silence drunk and still aggressive but obviously trying to think one took a menacing step forward guy didnt budge his face stayed impassive the road into this beach is a onelane track he said conversationally as though informing them of something important they should have remembered if you try and drive out youll meet the police coming in theyll block your way there was a further uneasy silence then hey jake im off one of the kids at the back of the group sounded suddenly scared its my old mans car if im found in it ill be grounded for years as far as im concerned you pinched it not me he turned and stumbled away halfrunning halfwalking heading northwards along the beach around the headland were more beaches and bushland where maybe he could hide himself and then head home to be innocent when his father found the car missing geez jake my old manll do the same another said already backing and starting to run macwait up but you guysve got the keys jake yelled and hurled another can after his retreating mates some of the other kids were backing away now half seemed inclined to stay with jake the others seemed inclined to run were on our way the policeman said on the other end of the phone line and guy nodded and held the phone helpfully out towards the kids the police are on their way this officer says so hed like to talk to you jake go to hell jake yelled is that jake marny the officer asked ill ask him guy said and held out the phone again he says are you jake marny geezhe knows us the cops know us one of the kids yelled panic supplanting aggression in an instant and that was enough for them all they were stumbling away heading after the first two boys for a long moment jake stared at guy murder in his eyes but it was the drink guy thought underneath jake was nothing but a belligerent kidand a kid alone now as his friends deserted him he picked up another can and hurled it but he didnt have his heart in it what will you do jake guy said and jake turned and found all his mates had gone without him he turned and ran the police arrived before guy had made it up to where hed parked his car he told them what had happened briefly and succinctly and left them to it theyd radioed in the registrations of the cars as soon as they saw them they knew the kids youll take care of mrs westmere and henry they asked sure he told them and headed up the track to find them theyd reached his car jenny was leaning back on the bonnet still hugging henry her face buried in his hair jenny she looked up and he saw that her face was rigid with tension and with anger she was fighting back tears the little boy was huddled against her and clinging his body language was despairing guy had never had anything much to do with children hed met malcolms kids beautifully dressed and with precocious social manners he was godparent to their youngest and sometimes he even took them gifts thank mr carver their father would say and the appropriate child would smile thank you mr carver this is a cool present they were welltrained welladjusted kids with two solid parents and all the advantages in the world but this mitehe was too thin he was wearing some sort of elastic wrap on one of his legs and around his chest his face was scarred and it was creased with crying but now he faced guy with the same sort of determination guy saw in his mother he wouldnt show the world he was upset he blinked back tears and gulped guys heart twisted this had nothing to do with how he felt about jenny here was a whole host of other emotions he didnt get involved too late he looked from jennys face to henrys and back again and he was so involved he knew that from this minute on nothing would be the same again tell me what happened he said and something about his voice made jennys face change her defences slipped a little we were going to have a picnic she whispered and he reached forward and took the basket from her grasp it suddenly seemed to be unbearably heavy he would have liked to take henry too but henry was clinging to his mother as if hed never let go jacks been delivering christmas presents he dropped us off at one and was going to pick us up at three but but but i reckoned without henrys scarring she whispered those kidsthey arrived about fifteen minutes after we did they were dreadfulwerent they henry what happened jenny shook her head but henry surprisingly took over we had a ball he said mummy threw it to me and i missed it and it rolled along the beach and ended up near one of the mens beer cans when i went to get it he said i was deformed he said get lost you ugly deformed little s henrys words were spoken almost exactly as hed heard them guy heard the vindictiveness in the childs bleak recital and he flinched he tried to find his voice but it wasnt there there werent words he wanted to dont jenny whispered and he knew she was reading the primitive desire that was starting to buildto launch himself back down the beach and punch jake and his mates until they bled it would achievenothing and the police were there theyd be taken care of why do you think they said that he said at last he didnt recognise his voice he didnt recognise his feelings dumb fury and more i dont know henry whispered i dont know either he was fighting desperately for the right words here for any words at all it surely isnt because youre deformed henry youre wearing an elastic bandage and you have a couple of manly scars that doesnt make you deformed the boy kicked me he was probably jealous guy said swallowing his anger with a huge effort he set jennys picnic basket on the ground and hauled it open inspecting its contents with a critical eye it gave him something to do independent or not afraid of relationships or not he wanted to hug them and hold them close but he knew theyd accept no such gesture and such a gesture wouldnt help nor would violence he had to come up with something better i thought so he said feeling his way theres pink lemonade in here and great food they only had beer jealousy makes people say funny things do you think thats it i dont know henry said staring down at the pink lemonade thats silly not as silly as calling you names guy took a deep breath and turned his back to them both when people have been angry about things theyve called me names too a lady burst into tears at a swimming pool once she called me a poor thing she was stupid im not a poor thing at all take a look at this he tugged his shirt over his head baring his back theyd be seeing the myriad of scars running down the left side of his body he heard jennys intake of breath and he winced the last thing he wanted was sympathy but this was the only thing he could think of to do his scars were a bleak reminder of the night christa had been killed shed been speeding in her fathers maserati and she had been furious why cant you be a lawyer shed screamed i refuse to be married to some dope who organises tinpot weddings and doesnt have any money to even pay for a decent car you drive a van with a wedding logo on it ill be damned if im ever seen in it shed slammed her foot on the accelerator making the point that the van he drove could never be as fast as this guy could still see the truck in front of them the drivers face frozen in horror as their car slid on black ice over to the wrong side of the road straight into him theyd hit almost broadside killing christa instantly and throwing shards of splintering metal into his side hed learned not to hate his scars but until now hed never been grateful would you call me deformed he asked henry his tone carefully neutral youve been cut henry whispered and youve been burned most people start out as babies with no marks on them but as interesting things happen they get marked we all get marked from life somewhere i read that the native people in australia deliberately make scars on their chests to show theyre grown up i think the more marks you have on you the more interesting you become he smiled at the little boy searching for a response so you and me henrywere really interesting and drunk people stupid people get jealous or sad that theyre not mature those guys on the beach were stupid kids whod drunk too much theyll be sick soon and theyll go to sleep and wake up with a headache and then theyll know theyve been dumb and theyve been wrong but meanwhile we should enjoy our day enough hed made his point now he needed to lighten up hey theres more here than pink lemonade he said turning back to the basket do you have enough picnic for me too yes said henry jenny was doing a lot of silent blinking he glanced back to the beach where a couple of the youths had been caught before theyd disappeared round the headland he could see glimpses of them though the treespolice and kids the kids were gesticulating wildly after their mates they needed to leave here he thought he didnt want any more invective as the police brought the kids up to the cars are there any more beaches around here jenny he asked theres another cove about a mile south she managed in a voice that was none too steady butwe havent got a car so its the ferrari guy said and grinned three people and a picnic basket in a ferrari we need to squash and we need to leave now before we have police watching i think what i intend to do might be just a little illegal but desperate times call for desperate measures everyone in your car henry said brightening immediately now absolutely now guy said with a lot more certainty than he was feeling lets go so independent aloof guy carver had a family picnic jenny couldnt believe it shed seen this man in celebrity magazines shed never dreamed he could behuman but human he was from squashing them all into his ferrari from helping her to put on suncream from making sand bombs he was more than human she thought of the gift hed given henry by showing him his scarred back and the tears kept welling such a gift was beyond value henry had been given back his pride but she couldnt say anything guy was acting as if the whole ugly incident hadnt happened and so must she they ate lunch and henry chattered about anything and everything a contented sixyearold having a blissful day out with a man who drove a ferrari and had life scars what a hero she watched as guy spoke to him man to man and her sons dreadful day disappeared to nothing and heroworship took its place she didnt blame henry she was getting pretty close to heroworship herself guy lent her his cellphone she contacted jack to tell him guy would be bringing them home so not to worry about collecting them then they spent a couple of hours in the shallows teaching henry to float the little boy hadnt spent much time in the water since his accident and he was nervous up until now jenny hadnt persuaded him to put his face under water but hed do anything guy asked by midafternoon he was floating kicking his scarred little legs taking a brief gasp of air and floating again im swimming he gasped exultant lit with happiness and jenny had to do a whole heap of blinking all over again finally he was exhausted guy carried him up the beach and towelled him dry while jenny packed the picnic gear they loaded everything once more into the ferrari and guy drove home with henrys legs on his knee picnic gear covering jenny and a liberal supply of sand coating everything every ferrari should look like this jenny said squashed and happy its perfect it is guy said and smiled at her and jenny felt her heart flip and flip again she was so close dont she told herself fiercely this man is not of your world he is nothing to do with you he just happens to be wonderful right now but not tomorrow then they were pulling into the farm and jack was limping down the steps to greet them looking worried theres been news about trouble with some kids on the beach jack growled jenny the police rang and say they want a statement from you what happened whats wrong nothings wrong jenny said quickly somethings right mr carver taught henry to swim i can swim grandpa henry said sleepily i can really really swim and mr carver says one day ill be a champion youre a champion already jack said gruffly and lifted his grandson out of the car he looked from jenny to guy and then looked at his little grandson his mouth twisted maybe the police had told him what had happened jenny thought but he had the sense to let it go mother mr carvers taught our henry to swim jack boomed and lorna waved her delight from the veranda how wonderful mr carver what are you doing for christmas its guy guy said and were putting on a wedding on christmas day but not until late lorna called christmas dinners always at midday youre to come to us now no argument a place will be laid youre coming for christmas henry said sleepily and jenny watched guys face as he stared at henry he was fighting something jenny thought and he waslosing ill come he said if i can get all the arrangements in placeill be here hes lovely late that night jenny was sitting on the veranda with her motherinlaw watching the stars over the distant ocean and listening to the soft clicking of lornas knitting needles guy of course guy lorna said and smiled jenny hes just what you need i dont need anyone of course you do lorna said equitably youre a lovely healthy young woman youve lost ben and thats dreadful but ben would be the first one to say you shouldnt spend the rest of your life grieving i could never leave you jenny said and lorna looked at her face and saw the emotions working there so you are feeling of course im feeling jenny burst out hes gorgeous and id have to be nonhuman not to feel that but he can have any woman he wants hes a squillionaire as soon as this weddings over hell go back to his life in new york and if he asked you to go with him he wont jenny he wont she said definitely and even if the impossible happened and he did do you think i could take henry away from all this theres no way and you know it she gave herself a mental shake and managed a grin okay hes gorgeous and if he happened to kiss me again he kissed you lorna squeaked and jennys grin firmed theres things that even you dont know lorna westmere its true i find him enormously attractive and the memory of ben wont hold me back but its only for a few days and then itll be over guy spent much of that night awake thinking of christa thinking of jenny hed loved christa he thought he remembered the bleakness the guilt the horror of those weeks after shed been killed but in contrasthe remembered the joy of christas life how shed made him laugh how when shed agreed to marry him hed felt like the luckiest man in the world but then things had changed shed hated his new career thered been fight after fight the relationship had soured to the point where if she hadnt been killed it would have been over hed thought hed been in love and hed been wrong and such a fundamental mistake had stayed with him ever since hell if he could be so wrong about someone hed believed he loved so much how could he ever commit again he couldnt so what the hell are you thinking of now he demanded of himself aloud and there was only one answer youre thinking shes gorgeous youre thinking that shes been through hell and her little boy needs someone and youre thinking of marrying it was an incredulous demand into the darkness youre thinking of taking them home why not the idea was so far out of left field that he almost laughed but but it wouldnt mess with my life he told himself shed come back to new york wed get the best medical attention for those scars henry could go to school jenny could work in the company and live with you of course live with me he told his alter ego letting the picture of domestic bliss build i have a huge apartment theres room to spare henry could have his own wing and jenny and i there was the nub of the matter jenny and i jenny jenny as shed been today dressed only in a bikini all womanly curves defending her son defiant taking on all comers jenny squashed into his ferrari giggling with her son meeting his eyes over henrys head and sharing his laughter jenny you havent even slept with the woman he told himself and he sounded desperate even to himself how do you know you want her every night for the rest of your life because i do he thought suddenly sure it was crazy it was way too fast but the thought of jenny in his bed was suddenly immeasurably enticing its too soon he told himself his heart for once agreeing with his head the way youre feelingit might just be sympathy its not sympathy and you know it it might be you thought you loved christa you wouldnt be committing in the same way he told himself you can stay independent whats the harm if it doesnt work what do you have to lose nothing if you stay independent can you stay independent maybe i can try chapter six kylies wedding took place two days before christmas and it was more than kylie and daryl had ever dreamed of kylie moved though her wedding day in a blissful whirl she looked totally in love with her weddingand totally in love with her man daryl too looked as if all his dreams had come true he had the woman he loved and he had a wedding ceremony that would be the talk of the district for years for it was a true carver wedding the man had brilliance jenny thought gazing round the transformed hall where the reception was being held it was no longer a hall instead it was a smoky gambling den straight out of the nineteentwenties guy had spent the last few days painting sets organising props training a couple of acting students hed flown in from sydney throwing himself into this wedding as if it was a vastly publicised celebrity wedding instead of the wedding of two butchers assistants with no profit to be made at all his work was worth it for the sheer pleasure it gave jenny decided it was fantastic as every guest arrived they gasped in wonder joining instantly into the pleasure of makebelieve mingled with a truelove wedding the press arriving to see the first carver wedding in australia were hauled right into the theme being directed to point their cameras at the grooms right side and make him look good or theyd be wearing concrete shoes before they knew what had hit them the photographers didnt know where to point their cameras next even shirley grubb abandoned her need for pink tulle and embraced the theme with enthusiasm oh jennyive been dreaming of this wedding since kylie was born and i so wanted everything to be right she confided towards the end of the evening i was so upset when kylie told me she wasnt doing it my way but nowmy two sisters are here their daughters had flash weddings in sydneyno money sparedand you know what theyre jealous theyre jealous of their little sister who married fred grubb and never has any money to her name she hugged jenny and there were tears slipping down her face hes fabulous she whispered youre so lucky guy was fabulous jenny was lucky jenny examined the comment from all sides then decided to ignore it and hand out a few more drinks she couldnt quite ignore it guy was everywhere working handson making sure the event went without a hitch he was dressed as a bodyguard armed and dangerous his slickeddown hair making his face look somehow menacing his mock pistols too obvious moving among the crowd making amiable ifyoudonthaveagoodtimeillpunchyourlightsout commentssure his wedding couple were safe id think i was safe if i had him for a bodyguard too jenny thought while she dispensed drinks but she shoved the notion aside and went to make sure the cake an overblown affair adorned with a miniature gangster and his bride driving away in their fancy carwhere had guy found these propswas ready for cutting she put the thought of guy to one side but she stayed achingly aware of him and guy he moved through the wedding with his customary efficiency ensuring each and every guest took home memories to cherish whether it was adroit flirting with the bridesmaids bullying uncle ern to take cousin cecilia onto the dance floor or removing the third glass of champagne from fifteenyearold berts grasp and replacing it with cola that stuff is a ladys drinki never touch it he told the kid who gazed at guy in suspicion and then decided that maybe cola really was okay wherever there was a need there he was but at any given moment guy knew jennys whereabouts she was dressed in a pert maids uniform doing the same as him working the crowd he watched her laughter and her affection for these people he watched as people responded to her with affection and the more he saw of her the more his mind had to dwell on jenny the night wore on the crowd started to thin his awareness of jenny built and the crazy idea from the night after the beach incident became louder and louder in his head youre thinking of marrying yes yes he was he couldnt stay independent without her he thought it was a dumb notion but maybe if he married her and kept her safe he could get her out of his system or not whatever youre thinking of marrying jenny had no time to talk to guy until daryl and kylie had driven away their foundfortheoccasion buick trailing a suitable clattering of ancient shoes and tin cans the guests dispersed with reluctance the crew cleared the mess and jenny was left with guy that was fantastic she told him as they emerged into the warm night air glad to be free of the fog inside it was the best wedding it was wasnt it guy said he flicked a switch and the lights of the hall disappeared they were left in darkness their two cars standing in solitary state in the abandoned car park id forgotten how much fun it was to be handson i loved it she sighed in exhausted pleasure theres no nicer thing than a truly happy wedding no he said and paused it was one am it was time she was home jenny thought ruefully henry would be awake at six and the next day was huge there was still planning to do for anna and barrets wedding and christmas was in two days time christmas christmas without ben was awful shed hated the last two christmases but nowthings had changed she thought and she wasnt sure how all she knew was that in the last few days shed changed she was no longer dreading christmas because of this man maybe but he didnt have to know it she thought hed set something free in her that she hadnt known was imprisoned she felt light and happy and young whoa this man was dangerous she decided happy and young or not she was henrys mother and she needed to go home to bed goodnight guy she said and turned away but his hands came out and caught her shoulders turning her back to face him jenny mmm she had to stay cool she told herself she mustnt let him see that just by touching him he couldhe could he kissed her she let him kiss her how could she not it was a lovely languorous kiss a kiss to melt into a kiss to lose yourself in he was so big and dangerous and warm and safe and wonderful these were crazy thoughts she was crazy she decided as the kiss went on and her entire being was consumed with the feel of him the thought of him guy it was a magic end to a magic eveningto be kissed by guy her life had been barren for too long to have this mans hands hold her to have this magic sensation drifting through herit was wondrous the kiss went on and on and she took as much as she gave it was a healing she thought as she savoured the feel of him it was a lovely way to end her mourning and at some deep primeval level she knew it was more than that there was no thought of ben as she kissed him but as he pulled away at last she caught at the ragged ends of her selfcontrol and told herself that of course this was because of ben she was a widow and now she was reemerging to the outside world this was nothing more than a reawakening so she sighed with absolute pleasure as he broke the contact as he held her at arms length and smiled down at her in the moonlight she sighed with pleasure and tried to hold back the regret that the kiss was at an end and she tried to think of ben youre beautiful he said and she managed to smile back youre not bad yourself buster she whispered though im not sure i go for the hair oil im serious he told her her smile faded and she looked up at him wondering serious i want to ask you something she didnt want to talk she so wanted to kiss him again she desperately wanted to kiss him again butshe was a sensible woman she had to move on about barret and annas wedding she asked can it wait until tomorrow im really tired jenny i wondered if youd be interested in marrying me she stilled the words seemed to echo over and over in the stillness marrying hes gone mad jenny thought at last the romance of tonight must have gone to his head i beg your pardon she whispered and he raked his fingers through his hairthen remembered the oil slick he stared down at his oily fingers with a rueful smile urk ive made a mess of that of what of my proposal he took a toobig handkerchief from his breast pocket and carefully wiped his fingers clean i havent had that much practice you see i didnt mean to do it then why did you she was having trouble making her voice work she was having trouble making anything work i could make you safe he said and she looked up at guys earnest face at his mock pistols and his slickeddown hair and suddenly irresistibly maybe even hysterically she started to laugh what he said sounding offended and she bit back her bubble of laughter and tried to be serious or tried to be lighthearted or something i dont need a bodyguard she told him but it was a very nice offer thank you im not offering you a bodyguard im offering you a husband she stilled at that her laughter fading it wasnt a joke then he wasserious he was asking her to marry him the idea was so preposterous that she almost choked im already married she said before she could stop herself and she watched as his face changed what im married to ben she said stupidly ben was killed two years ago yes but she took a deep breath searching forsearching for she didnt know what i cant remember him properly she said inconsequentially i cant remember the way he held me i cant jenny its natural was it she felt her heart clench with a wellremembered pain ben was dead move on people said her own motherinlawlet ben go and she had tonight for the first time she had but to have this moment become a decision about the rest of her life ben her heart screamed ben im not ready to let you go hes my husband she whispered hes in my heart i thought you at least would know that guy stood gazing down at her in the silence i do know that then why you make me feel different you make me feel different too she said and she put her hand up to his face and cupped the curve of his jaw the feeling she had thenit was indescribable say yes her heart screamed say yes before he changes his mind i cant do it she whispered you must see its impossible why is it impossible henry henry would come with us he said strongly taking her hands in his trying to make her see where his thoughts had taken him you cant tell me hes getting optimal medical treatment here the worlds best doctors are in new york she stilled youd take us both to new york of course but our home is here i have a massive apartment in manhattan you can see the statue of liberty from our home is here her voice was flat without inflexion and suddenly desperately weary do you think i could leave lorna lorna has jack she does and she has me and she has henry were family guy you dont need family at christmas she whispered youre saying that two days before christmas that i dont need a family hell jenny this is ridiculous she said trying hard to be strong we hardly know each other and yet you feel what im feeling i dont jenny he said and the hands holding her shoulders suddenly firmed youre lying of course she was lying whatever he was feeling she was feeling too multiplied by about a thousand he drew her into him his lips met hers and she feltshe felt heat the word slammed in her mind as the sensation slammed through her heat a conflagration that was allconsuming starting from her lips and flooding through the rest of her as if she was dry tinder and a match had been held to the alltooready fuel she wanted him with every inch of her being her lips opened under his she welcomed him with joy her hands came around his chest and tugged him closer guy the kiss went on and on neither could stop it why should they guy had asked her to marry him this man who was holding her who was making her feel as if life itself could start now guy he was her employer the thought slammed into her mind and somehow it steadied her the thought had her remembering that her feet were planted on sandpiper bay groundand had to stay that way somehow she tugged back and guy gazed down at her in the moonlight concerned what is it sweetheart what right did he have to call her sweetheart she loved it she decided butshe couldnt guy leave it she demanded and he let her take a further step back the fact that her body was screaming to remain in his hold had to be ignored it must be whats wrong if you werent my boss id slap your face she managed why for taking liberties you want to be kissed i dont you do he was teasing her with his eyes he was smiling down at her and there was suchlove she was imagining it love no she was married to ben i still love ben she said and tilted her chin maybe i still love christa but its memories that we love and memories make cold bedfellows you want me in bed shed started to shake and it wasnt from cold bed with this manbed with guy a man would have to be inhuman not to want you in his bed she could do it she thought she could just step forward into this mans invitation and let her life be taken over she could be guy carvers wife the thought scared her witless she steadied trying desperately to see his invitation for what it was for some reason he wanted her well maybe that wasnt so strange because she wanted him too but he was a billionaire and he lived in new york in a massive apartment henry would have the best doctors and sheshe shed be guy carvers wife it seemed so ridiculous that she almost laughed almost you dont even know me she whispered you dont know henry i know that i want you but i she tilted her chin again and met his gaze knowing what had to be said and knowing she had to say it guy i want family im offering your name your millions its a fantastic offer she managed a rueful smile theres probably thousands of women whod jump at what youre offering and if i was alone maybe i could make a go of it youre saying were sexually attracted and we definitely are but thats not enough to build a marriage im cinderella and youre prince charming but i have a feeling that marriage for cinders had its downside ive never heard any fairytale where they divorce he said startled but she refused to smile no she said thoughtfully but being all alone in his castle with everyone knowing shed come from rags to richesshed have to be grateful for ever and if shed had a son then that little boy might feel the same and resent it youre flying off at tangents he said half laughing and she grimaced i am she said softly but im thinking forward you see i must i have a future but its inextricably tied up with henrys future and lornas and jacks and this little town her chin tilted some more when i first came here i was needful she told him this little town made me happy and ill not walk away because you make me feel wonderful i make you feel wonderful he demanded pouncing on her words and she felt a stab of sudden anger of course she said scornfully but youve jumped in at the deep end youve figured for some reason that you want me and the easiest way to have me is to install me in manhattan and have me in the pieces of time you have left over from the rest of your life whats wrong with that he couldnt see she had to be grownup for the pair of them she thought miserably she had to be sensible her heart had to be ignored she was a married woman with a son to care for with responsibilities with christmas in two days and she hadnt even made her mince pies if you dont know then i cant teach you she said she took a deep breath leaned forward and kissed him lightly on the lips a feather kiss that was over before he could react then she stepped back and felt for the handle of her wagon door she slid in still looking at him thank you for the proposal she whispered it wasmagic but youre my boss guy and thats the way it has to stay now im going home to my family i have christmas to organise hed made a proper hash of that how could he go home to sleep he couldnt so he made his way to the little beach where he and jenny and henry had swum only days before family what was she asking him to do take lorna and jack as well as henry back to new york with him no she wasnt asking anything of him he thought she was simply looking at his offer in surprise and rejecting it out of hand it wasnt a ridiculous offer hed made it to no other woman but christa christa would have been happy with what he was offering jenny he thought he could have provided everything shed needed she would have been able to do whatever shed wanted jenny wasnt christa christa had been easier hed known what christa had wanted shed wanted what their parents wanted prestige and money he had that he was offering it to jenny and shed knocked it back what else did he have to offer her nothing so move on he told himself you offered to marry her because you felt sorry for her was that right no it was much more he wanted jenny in his bed so its sympathy and sex you can find sex elsewhere she doesnt want the sympathy youve made your offer and its been rejected so move on back to thinking of jenny as an employee she wasnt the least like an employee she was justjenny chapter seven the next day was frantic barret and anna and entourage arrived and had to be taken through the arrangements then the arrangements had to be tweaked so bride and groom were happy and those tweaks werent insubstantial guy whod worked with both barret and anna before did the front work while jenny stayed in the background last night might not have happened she was briskly efficient and very very capable theres an extra bridesmaid get her here by two this afternoon and well fit her out we have half a ton of pink tulle and our seamstresses are enjoying themselves anna doesnt like the wedding cake no thats okay well soak it in brandy and call it christmas pudding for the party afterwards i can get a couple of ladies onto sponge cakes now have her draw up details of decorations gifts for the bridesmaids pearls yes its too late to get seven identical necklaces locally but i can contact a jeweller in sydney and have them couriered she reassured him every time he called her and after every call he felt about ten years old and as if she was his schoolteacher that was the tone she was taking he thought cool distant and bossy she was also never there every time he found an opportunity to visit the shop she was somewhere else she hasnt finished her christmas shopping one of the sewing ladies told him the three women seemed to be having a wonderful time sitting in the back room with a vat of coffee and half a ton of chocolate biscuits their fingers flying i think shes gone to find a present for lorna hush guy turned to the shops entrance to see jack pushing lornas wheelchair inside i dont like knowing my presents before christmas day lorna called so if you know dont tell guy im pleased we found you im busy he said and then thought maybe he shouldnt be that blunt jenny obviously loved this woman it was justlorna was part of the family thing that was threatening to engulf him i wont hold you up lorna replied her voice holding a hint of reproof and im not asking any favours so you can stop looking like that we just called to remind you that youre doing the santa run in your ferrari tomorrow you need to be at our place at nine henrys really looking forward to it hell hed forgotten hed also forgotten henrys face when hed thought it might happen but why not ignore a few buts here he told himself he could do this it didnt mean getting emotionally involvedor any more emotionally involved than he already was okay hed do it and then hed walk away hed moved his return flight to the day after christmas his escape route was organised how could you ask a woman to marry you and then look forward to getting back to your own life he was having an internal conversation watched by lorna and jack and three seamstresses but the conversation went on regardless easy he told himself i didnt ask to join her life i asked if shed join mine no wonder she refused you fine he managed and if he sounded ungracious he couldnt help himself ill be there great jack said warmly well hang up a stocking for you a stocking wait and see lorna said our santa does the best stockings hes still coming for christmas dinner of course he is he promised and hes coming at nine for stockings hes cute lorna told her daughterinlaw he drives a wonderful car henry thinks hes the ants pants guy carver is not the ants pants he is an american billionaire who happens to be my boss im sewing him a stocking lorna he cant have a stocking everyone in the whole world needs a stocking now what will santa put in it chapter eight christmas morning guy woke as was his custom at five am there was nothing to do there had to be something one of the biggest celebrity weddings of the year was scheduled for five this afternoon he lay and watched the weak rays of dawn flitter across his counterpane mentally ticking off everything that had to be done hed made huge lists and jenny had delegated every person in the town seemed to have something to do the normal sleepinginfrontoftelevision end to christmas day was not going to happen in sandpiper bay jenny had hauled in every local and a few tourists as well and shed given everyone a job and the best thing was that nearly all of them were doing it for nothing barret and anna can pay guy had growled when jenny had told him yes but most of the towns folk believe in christmas so whats that got to do with it they believe its wrong to work on christmas day but if its for something like aiding the tsunami effort itll strike a chord one of our local kids is working in the international aid effort and youre asking barret and anna to give a donation to charity no im asking barret and anna to pay a fair price for labour and then well give it away it doesnt make sense maybe for you it doesnt she agreed but for usits our way she glared at him if you want to take our profits for yourself whoa he told her and then he thought what sort of employeremployee relationship was this shed just given away his profits but there had been no arguing and now the whole town had jobs to do for the good of the tsunami relief effort he could lie in bed and stare at the ceiling and think he should be back in new york why should he be back in new york christmases back home were simply an excuse for ostentation he hated christmas even before christa had died hed hated christmas five am nothing to do until nine he hated christmas nine he walked up the veranda steps carrying expensive truffles and vintage wine the screen door slammed open and a pyjamaclad urchin catapulted through crutches tumbling as henry toppled forward to hug his legs a labrador puppy came bouncing after him the puppy reached henry and henry abandoned guy he sat down on the veranda and shoved his nose into the puppys soft fur this is patsy he told guy his voice muffled by puppy she was on my bed when i woke up and shes all mine and i have to train her thats great guy said feelingemotional that was the end of that resolution then and theres more small boy and pup looked up at him eyes glistening with christmas joy weve been waiting and waiting and santas been and theres stockings for everyone but mummy says we cant open them until you come come on in jenny said and he raised his eyes from her son and smiled at jenny she was simply dressed in clean jeans and tshirta tshirt adorned with sequins carefully sewn on to make a picture of rudolph the rednosed reindeer she had two glowing santa clauses hanging from her ears she was smiling who needed grinning santa clauses when there was a smile like this youre overdressed she told him a suit at nine on christmas morning pyjamas are more the go i dont wear them he told her and she blushed a great blush it made him want to keep it impersonal he told himself harshly well at least wear a christmas hat she said and handed him a hat then when he didnt react she took it back reached up and placed it on his head a red and white santa hat forget the hat she was so close she smelled of pine needles and mince pies andand jenny there was mistletoe over his head he couldnt see it but he was sure of it the desire to take her into his arms and kiss her senseless was suddenly overwhelming but lorna was at the door with jack behind her laughing and calling for them to come in its all very well for henry jack complained hes got his puppy but every single one of my presents is still wrapped and if we dont get to these stockings soon im going to bust comparisons of this christmas to every other christmas hed known were ludicrous as a child he remembered formal christmas mornings drinks with business acquaintances where children were seen and not heard a ludicrously overthetop lunch where he was the only childhe hated the food and he hated the waiting the waitingthen his parents would sleep off their lunch and some time towards evening his mother would call him in and theyd open their gifts they werent permitted to open them early as the tree looks so much better with gifts under it and well keep that effect until all our guests have gone whatever his gift was it would have been exquisitely wrapped and hed have to admire the wrapping it was never anything he wanted it was always something someone had recommended oh we gave guy a miniature violinso sweetim sure hes musical he takes after my side of the family not his fathers there was no violin today this little family lived on a shoestring the major present was the puppy the rest of the gifts weresilly some were silly some were sensiblebut it was a great mix he watched as henry unwrapped coloured pencils a new collar and lead for his dog and a vast parcel that turned out to be three months supply of puppy foodhenry was so delighted he couldnt stop giggling and there was a pause in the proceedings so patsy could be photographed sitting on top of her future dinnersa rubber toy in the shape of a chook for patsy a game of wooden blocks that henry received with joy interspersed with thesefor they took turns to open giftswere the adult presents romance novels for lorna and a crazy device for massaging feet that patsy took instant exception to a new summer hat for jackhe had to take off the reindeer antlers he was wearing so he placed his new hat on and then propped his reindeer antlers over the top and for guy hed expected nothing of course hed expected nothing but there was a whole stocking stuffed with silly things when he saw the stocking he felt his heart sink expecting to be embarrassed that this family had spent money on his behalf but the stocking simply made him laugh his very own pair of christmas antlersto go on top of his santa hat a red nose that flashedwear it now henry decreed and he did a mangoa perfect piece of fruit wrapped with care a vast red ribbon around it he stared at the mango and jack grinned and handed him a knife and a plate and said eat it now matecos its christmas so he took off his red nose and spread mango from one ear to the other and it was the best thing hed ever eaten what else a boat made of ice lolly sticksi wanted to make you a ferrari henry told him but youve already got one and this floats ive put water in the bath all ready you want to see so they had to troop into the bathroom and watch henrys boatthe jenniferpatsytake her maiden voyage round the bath and then they had to rescue the jenniferpatsy and haul patsy out of the bathtub and dry her and then dry themselves and then watch as guy opened his last present which was a glitzy magazine titled how to plan your perfect wedding lornas idea mate not ours jack said hastily and then they were all laughing and lorna was handing round mince pies and it was time to take the ferrari on its santa run which was crazy all by itself santathe local police chiefwas waiting at the police station with a paper bag of mince pies at his side to keep his strength up guy collected santa and his lollies then he followed santas directions and made a clean sweep of sandpiper bay santa rang his bell with such strength that guys ears would take months to recover from every house came children and adults and oldies and santa tossed lollies indiscriminately even from the vast houses owned by the squillionaires came kids and dogs and men and women all at various stages of christmas all smiling all cheering as they got their lollies and then disappearing back into their homes to celebrate the festive season their last stop was back at the farm santa had arranged for his wife to collect him from there santa emptied the remains of his sack onto their veranda and then drove away in state in the towns police car now dinner lorna declared and guy wondered how he could eat any more but of course he didand how could he ever have thought he couldnt he remembered the sophisticated christmases hed endured as a kid there was no comparison he ate turkey and gravy and crispy roast potatoes and every sort of vegetable he could imagine with relish then jack demanded he light the puddingand how could he not eat pudding after that brandy sauce brandy butter cream or icecream lorna asked jenny grinned and said hell have all four mum just like everyone else and guy looked across the table and thought shes calling lorna mum and suddenlysuddenly he wanted to do exactly the same if he married jenny he could henry was down on the floor subsiding into an afternoon nap with patsy and guy thought i wonder what the quarantine regulations are for taking dogs into the us its not going to happen jenny said softly and he looked across the table and saw a flash of sadness behind the laughter that had been there all morning it was as if she knew that what he was offering was seriousbut it wasnt enough he couldnt leave her he couldnt no one sleeps before the washing up lorna said and guy heard himself saying ill wash up thats my christmas gift to you hed brought excellent wine and chocolates as gifts but he knew now that they were dumb gifts sure they liked them but mangoes were better i wont let you do it alone jenny said and grinned nobility is my middle name jack lornathat means you sleep immediately henry and patsy already are asleep guy into the kitchen arent i the boss he asked and everyone smiled not around here mate jack told him gripping his wifes hand and holding it tight the women in this family make the rules so they stood in the kitchen and he washed and she wiped and suddenly the noisy fun gossip faded to nothing there was a silence which should have been a contented silence but it wastense jenny he tried softly but when he glanced at her her smile had faded and her face was rigid with strain dont say it guy she whispered this is my family this is my place im not going anywhere the wedding was due to take place at five pm they left at three only patsy opened one eye and wagged a weary tail as they departed they drove in jennys wagon as they had final supplies in the back everythings there guy told jenny i ran a final check before i came to your place and i ran a final check before everyone woke up jenny retorted too many cooks mr carver doublechecking doesnt hurt anyone he replied as they drove down the magnificent eucalyptlined driveway of annas mansion there was a cluster of expensive cars parked in front obviously belonging to inhouse guests within two hours thered be hundreds of cars ill check the bride you check the groom jenny told guy forgetting she was the employee again but acting on a rule they both knew the most important duty in any wedding ceremony is to make sure you have two live bodies willing to say i do they rang the bell a butler opened the doorand here was the first discordant note of the day a mans voice was raised in fury you cant do this you bitch ill ruin you ill see your name raked across every tabloid and its no holds barred if you call this off just because of some moralistic damned scruples then ill see you in hell have you got any idea of what thisll do to your pr before they had time to step insideand before the butler had time to do what he should have done in times of crisisrefuse admittancebarret himself shoved his way past them they stared after him as the movie star disappeared behind the house there was the sound of a motor being gunned into lifeand then the squeal of a car being turned too fast and driven too fast away theres your groom mr carver jenny murmured wincing now for the bride anna surprisingly seemed to still be in control she was sitting on the second top step of the great staircase as if her legs had given way but as jenny approached she even managed a shaky smile thats two less guests for the wedding she murmured were minus one groom and were minus one bridesmaid happy christmas she sniffed oh help happy christmas to you too jenny murmured and sat down beside her while guy looked on from below stairs umwas that what i think it was have you just called off the wedding you bet anna whispered i may live to regret it but i dont think so she looked down to her butler max i wont be needing you for a bit should i start phoning a few people max asked sounding horrified maybe i can stop a few coming theres three hundred people coming to this wedding guy said theyre coming from all over the world and the weddings less than two hours away our chances of stopping the crowd are negligible in that case go and have a stiff drink anna told the butler or two stay sober max guy warned were going to need you yes sir the butler said he looked at his mistress in concern then he looked from guy to jenny and back again fix it if you can he said softly i dont think shes seeing what shes done im seeing what ive done all too clearly anna retorted i found him with one of my bridesmaids in georgias bedroom in georgias bed i havent done anything barret on the other hand can you verify this guy asked the butler and max nodded i was coming upstairs to remind miss anna that you were to be here at three miss anna was standing at miss georgias bedroom door looking gobsmacked anna said and suddenly she giggled it sounded dangerously close to hysterics you saw them too didnt you max yes miss but there are indeed buts guy said gravely id imagine barrets heading straight back to hollywood anna if hes true to form hell slur your name in every ear that matters people expect barret to play around they wont feel sorry for barret theyll feel sorry for you i dont care anna said defiant but jenny saw the tremor in her fingers and knelt to sit beside her and take her hand to her surprise the woman gripped and held hard wheres everyone else guy was asking and jenny thought hes done this before hes coped with disasters like this we had eggnog for brunch anna explained barret made it everyones halfdrunk already so theyre sleeping it off or i thought they were sleeping it off i dont know how barret managed her voice trailed away in disgust good jenny thought if she was up to technical thinking then maybe other sorts of thinking were possible too she glanced down at guy their eyes locked and she could see that he was thinking exactly what she was thinking guy had agreed to do this wedding because he felt sorry for anna nothing had changed and if anna had to be protected no one must feel sorry for you she said and guy nodded as if hed just been about to say the same thing what do you mean anna demanded and guy took over anna youve just come out of rehab everyones looking at you if i know hollywood theyre expecting you to fail and theyre half hoping you will half the people coming to this wedding will be coming out of curiosity he hesitated but then he went straight to the hard question did you touch the eggnog i drink soda water she said stiffly and guy nodded i knew youd say that its why im giving you a carver wedding you deserve a second chance but the way im seeing it this could be your ruin unless we turn it around unless we make this into a celebration regardless youve ditched all the other bad habits barret was simply the last habit you ditched what said anna lets get this organised he said striding up the stairs to join them anna and jenny were still sitting on the second top stair they shifted sideways and he sat down too so anna had jenny on one side and guy on the other with max watching stunned from below we need to move fast what said jenny if people have flown from london and new york and wherever to see a celebration and they dont see one theyre going to be disappointed guy said and its christmas day which makes it worse theyll be hugely disappointed if theyre turned away without food and hungry disappointed celebrities can get nasty if they dont see you theyll talk about you until the next sensation happens anna shuddered dont what should we do jenny asked simply and waited we go ahead as if it was meant to happen he said anna you need to act when all your inhouse guests wake and your other guests arrive you greet them as if this is the best thing that can possibly have happened i dont know how i know how guy said jenny the time to be taken for the ceremony needs to be taken up with something else i want a map of the way to the beachthats about half a mile from here isnt it down through the hills an easy walk i thought so as every guest arrives theyre to be handed a champagne cocktail a tube of sunscreen and a bathing costume and sarong if they dont have their own jenny get onto the local store owners now tell them well pay ten times face value if they have the stuff we need here in half an hour oh and the camping store i want as many folding tables as they have plus beach umbrellas same price applies double it if you need to as the workers arriveour people are due here at fourtheyll start ferrying the wedding breakfast to the beach i want people toddling over the sandhills cocktail in handwell have people along the way replenishing glassesarriving at the beach and seeing anna in all her glory all my glory anna said gulping and looking awed youll be floating on a sea of flowers youll be wearing a tiny bikini and holding a fruit cocktailsomething nonalcoholic but no one need knowsomething that looks truly splendid well have your bridesmaidsminus one who i trust will take herself the way of your bridegroomfloating round on air mattresses well use all the wedding flowers and make them look sumptuous and youll be saying welcome to the rest of my life this is who i am a woman who can put on the best party in the world itll make barret look stupid and you look magnificent but anna whispered but but what theres still the celebrant she whispered theres all the pink tulle i have editors from the top celebrity magazines flying in especially to see a wedding they will see a wedding guy said whose he took a deep breath mine and then he looked at jenny ours for a moment there was nothing but silence jenny stared at guy anna stared at guy and then anna turned to jenny youd pretend to get married but thered be no pretend about it guy said softly anna i love this woman thats me jenny thought dumbly hes talking about me ive already said i wouldnt she whispered and guy nodded and reached across anna and took her hand i know i was dumb excuse me but you dont want me sitting in the middle here anna said sounding close to hysterics and guy grinned ive already proposed to the woman in moonlight it didnt work im trying again stay where you are harumph said max from below and guy nodded you too i need witnesses what said jenny and paused you mean what am i asking guy said he hesitated then ploughed on a man making a confession before all this morning i opened my stocking and found a boat made with ice lolly sticks so what she whispered and he smiled let me finish he said i need to jenny fifteen years ago i turned my back on a career in law and used my savings to buy what must have been the most battered van our side of the mississippi i was so proud of that van i used to walk round and pat it but then then christa was killed she was guy said and the shock of her death made me thinkwell that her values were true i wanted to show myself that the sacrifice was worth it and some warped twisted part of my brain said the way to do that was make money and you have anna said youre such a success not a success if i cant have my jenny he said and his eyes were holding jennys and they might as well be alone i met jenny a little more than a week ago and i love everything about her i love her bravery and her honesty and her caring and her laughter i love her son and her sons puppy and her motherinlaw and her fatherinlaw i love the place where she lives i was dumb enough to think maybe i could marry part of that and cart it back to new york set it down as a possession but its not like that is it jenny you refused me for all the right reasons i im not asking you that same question now guy said softly im asking if youll let me share your life if youll let me take over where ben left offloving you loving what you are and where you are justloving guy ive been thinking he went on as if he was nervous that shed say no before hed fully explained after the christmas stockingall the way round sandpiper bay with santa beside mei thought what did you think anna asked awed and jenny thought shed asked the right question she should have asked it herself but the words wouldnt quite come out i thought i could move my base to here he said i thought we could make sandpiper bay the wedding capital of the world he grinned though i think wed need two sets of premises well take over the haberdashery and use part of it to incorporate bridal fluff for any bride who wants fluff and well have a special rate for localskids whove lived in the district for years and cant afford normal rates he hesitated maybe we could extend that idea to our other smaller premises too he said it takes thinking about but then im not going to be working so hard in the future im going to be doing a lot of lying on the beach with our son and our puppy and i can think things through then our son jenny said astounded and guys smile became almost shamefaced its not my right to share henrys life he told jenny but if youll let mei want to so much you have no idea how much i want to share you love henry almost as much as you he said still gripping her hand still holding her eyes while anna sat hornswoggled in between i thought i loved christa and my shock at her death left me thinking i didnt know what love was but i do know what it is i know who it is its you my love my jenny there was a moments stunned silence while everyone held their breath jenny didnt move it was left to anna to respond well anna said well well echoed jenny she shook her head as if shaking off disbelief my thoughts exactly are you going to accept anna asked i only ask because times getting on max said from below grinning broadly and ive thought of something you cant just swap from one wedding to another theres laws in this country four weeks notice before a wedding can take place but we could make our promises today jenny whispered and the whole world held its breath you mean it guy asked at last and she smiled of course i mean it i shouldnt i loved ben so much but these last few daysive been thinking and thinking and the more i think the more i know ben would say to grab life with both hands she hesitated and ive been following your logic does this mean you want a shonky van again and not a ferrari it might guy said cautious and jenny beamed hooray she said then lets do it well write it into the wedding vows you get my wagon and i get the ferrari he lunged at her across annas kneesand anna movie idol of millions a woman whod just been betrayed and whose wedding plans were in the dust dissolved into helpless laughter while guy carver of the carver corporation reached across her and kissed his intended bride as if there was no tomorrow chapter nine guy carver was a wedding planner extraordinaire his own wedding was no exception he would have liked to have had more than a few hours notice but given the circumstances what was achieved was little short of miraculous firstly he barked orders at everyone while jenny and anna looked on in admirationand with just a touch of the giggles then he swept jenny into her wagon and carried her back to the farm for im not doing this without consent he said ignoring jennys protest that jack was her fatherinlaw and no consent was needed he carried her into the farmhouse as a groom carried his bride he woke the startled lorna and jack and henry and patsy from their afternoon nap and asked with all the deference in the world whether there were any objections to his taking jenny for his bride they were delighted its so lovely lorna sniffed well miss you sweetheart but we always knew youd move on then youll be disappointed guy said roundly youre stuck with the lot of us for ever me and jenny and henry and patsy and whoever else comes along mind ill have to make the odd trip overseasbut maybe we can all go maybe youll even like new york they were speechlessfor a whole two minutesand then lorna started to plan so youre getting married this afternoon were having a ceremony this afternoon to get anna out of a hole jenny told her the press will indeed see a carver wedding well repeat our vows in a month for the legalities well repeat our vows night and morning for the rest of our lives guy said exultantly but lorna was concentrating on more important issues you need a dress jenny not the one you wore for ben no jenny said she grinned delirious with happiness and ready to be silly maybe i can wear togs and thongs togs and thongs guy queried bikini and flipflops jack translated and guys face brightened i can cope with that you can she cant lorna said roundly jenny dear mmm jenny was hugging henry who was carefully thinking about all the rides he was now going to get in a ferrari yes i never suggested it when you married bento be honest i loved it that we made your wedding dress together but nowi dont suppose youd consider wearing mine yours jenny said awed oh youre practically the same size as i was forty years ago and the fashions have come back so they all trooped into the bedroom to lornas camphor chest and then lorna realised that this was serious and turned and shooed out the menfolk you get back to annas she told guy youll see jenny at the ceremony and not before yes maam but as guy made his way out through the front door lorna wheeled herself out of the bedroom in a hurry i know its a minor detail she called but we need to know when and we need to know where the when was eight pm the where was on the beach the very loveliest time of day the beach was crowded with celebrities from all over the world and almost every inhabitant of sandpiper bay in their midst was anna bouncing around as if she had the world at her feet whatever mortification she was feeling she was hiding it with brilliance it would be barret who was mortified now guy thought watching as anna attracted everyones admiration he could even feel sorry for barret anna was lovely she wasnt as lovely as jenny guy was standing on the shoreline where sunwarmed sand gave way to sand made damp by the receding tide there was a temporary altar behind him and the celebrant was beaming before it in truth the celebrant was a little put outshed expected to marry superstarsbut the fact that she was marrying guy carver and the wonderful jenny who everyone knew almost made up for it there was only one attendant guys best man was henry who held the ringthe sandpiper bay jeweller had been delighted to open for such a needwith the reverence it deserved henry had his own attendantpatsy was right by his sidebut she wasnt diverting henry from ringminding his hero was at stakea stepfather who had the marks of life upon him he kept glancing up to guy as if he might evaporate and every time he did guy looked down at him and winked henry was practising winking back they look like two cats with one canary one of the reporters said to her photographer and the photographer sniffed her agreement its beautiful if you get that lens wet youre dead meat the reporter said but she sniffed too and then the bride arrived by tractor you couldnt get over these sand hills except by foot or allterrain vehicle so lorna dressed in her wedding best drove a trifle erratically but with aplomb while jenny stood on the side and held on for dear life the crowdwiselyparted before them lorna reached her destination flushed with success jack helped his daughterinlaw down and jenny was deposited by guys side to be married with this ring i thee wed maybe the photographers camera did get wet then for there was hardly a dry eye on the beach as jenny and guy stood together against a backdrop of setting sun and sea and mountains and were made one its a perfect carver wedding jenny whispered as their wedding kiss finally ended and guy smiled at her with a smile that said life for both of them was just beginning i brought you lousy christmas presents he told her i had to make up somehow merry christmas mrs carver with all my love marion lennox
