killer of men christian c ameron the thing that i remember best and maybe its my first memory too is the forge my father the smith aye he farmed too because every free man in boeotia counted his wealth in farmland but pater was the bronzesmith the best in our village the best in plataea and women said that he had the touch of the god upon him because he had a battle wound that made him lame in his left foot and because his pots never leaked we were simple folk in boeotia not fancy boys like athenians or joyless killers like the men of sparta we valued a man who made a pot that didnt leak when pater pounded out a seam that seam held and he liked to add more he was always a man to give more than he got so that a housewife who paid him ten hardwon drachmas and a bowl of potted rabbit might find that pater had put a carefully tooled likeness of demeter or hecate beneath the rim of the pot or worked her name into the handle of the cauldron or tripod pater did good work and he was fair whats more he had stood his ground twice in the storm of bronze so that every man knew his measure and for all that he was always ready to share a cup of wine so the front of the smithy had become a gathering place for all the men of our little village on a fair day when the ploughing was done and sometimes even a singer or a minstrel a rhapsode the smithy itself was like a lords hall as men brought pater their quarrels all except his own bloody family and more of that later or came to tell him their little triumphs he was not much as a father not that he hit me more than a dozen times and every one deserved as i still remember i once used my fathers name to buy a knife in the polis a foolish thing but i wanted that knife it broke in my hand later yet another tale lass but i meant no harm when pater learned that i had pledged his name for a simple blade hed have made me himself he struck me with the whole weight of his fist i cried for a day from the shame he had the raising of us all to himself you see my mother was drunk from the time i first remember her drinking away the forge pater would say when the darkness was on him shes your grandmother lass i shouldnt speak ill of her and ill try to tell her true but its not pretty she was the daughter of a lord a real lord a basileus from down the valley in thespiae they met at the great daidala in the year of the olympics and the rumour of my youth had it that she was the wildest and the most beautiful of all the daughters of apollo and that pater swept her up in his great arms and carried her off in the old way and that the basileus swore a curse on their marriage i respect the gods ive seen them but im not one to believe that hera comes to curse a womans womb nor ares to push a spear aside the gods love them that love themselves mater said that so she wasnt a total failure as a mother i reckon but she never did aught to love herself and her curse was her looks and her birth she had three children for pater i was the middle one my older brother came first by a year and he should have had the smithy and maybe the farm besides but i never faulted him for it he had red hair and we called him chalkidis the copper boy he was big and brave and all a boy could want in an older brother i had a sister too still do unless artemis put an arrow into her my mother gave her the name of penelope and the gods must have been listening i know nothing of those first years when pater was as handsome as a god and mater loved him and she sang in the forge men say they were like gods but men say a great many things when an event is safely in the past they tell a lot of lies ill no doubt tell you a few myself old mans prerogative i gathered that they were happy though but nothing ended as my mother expected i think she wanted something greater from my father or from herself or perhaps from the gods she began to go up in the hills with the maenads and ran wild with other women and there were words in the forge and then came the first of the theban years when the men of thebes came against us what do you know of thebes it is a name in legend to you to us it was the curse of our lives poor plataea so far from the gods so close to thebes thebes was a city that could muster fifteen thousand hoplites while we could in an emergency and freeing and arming our most trustworthy slaves muster fifteen hundred good men and this is before we made the great alliance with athens so we were a lonely little polis with no friends like a man whose plough is broken and none of his neighbours have a plough to loan they came at us just after the grain harvest and the men went off to war whenever i hear the iliad thugater i weep when i hear of mighty hectors son being afraid of his fathers shining helmet how well i remember it and pater standing there in his panoply the image of ares he had a bronzefaced shield and a splendid helmet he had forged himself from one piece of bronze his horsehair plume was black and red for the smith god he wore a breastplate of solid bronze again of his own making and thigh guards and arm guards of a kind you scarcely see any more aye they were better men he carried two spears in the old way and long greaves on his legs and when he stood in the courtyard with the whole panoply he gleamed like gold mater was drunk when she poured the libation i can see it in my head she came out in a white chiton like a kore going to sacrifice but the chiton had purple stains when she went to bless his shield she stumbled and poured wine down his leg and the slaves murmured and she wept and ran inside so pater went off to fight thebes and he came back carried by two men on his chlamys and his spears and his shield was gone we lost and pater lost most of the use of his left leg where mater spilled the wine and after that there was nothing between them but silence i suppose i was five chalkidis was six and we lay in the loft of the barn and he whispered to me about paters part in the battle and about our cousins the grandsons of paters fathers brother aye thugater we count such relations close in boeotia pater had no brothers his father must have read hesiod one too many times and this batch of surly cousins were the nearest relations i had on paters side on maters side they scarcely allowed that we were kin until later and thats another tale but a happier one my brother said that pater was a hero that hed stood his ground when other men ran and he saved many lives and that when the thebans took him they hadnt stripped him but ransomed him like a lord i was young and i knew nothing of ransom only that pater who towered over me like a god was unable to walk and his mood was dark the other corvaxae were the first to run chalkidis whispered they ran and left paters side open to the spears and now they slink through the town and fear what pater will say we were the corvaxae the men of the raven apollos raven look up lass theres the black bird on my aspis and may the gods send i never feel it on my arm again you know what the sage says count no man happy until he is dead i pour a libation in his memory may his shade taste the wine the black bird is also on our sails and on our house i was five i knew little of this except that i knew that pater told me it was a good omen when a raven landed on the roof of the smithy and our women were corvaxae too blackhaired and paleskinned and clannish no man in our valley wanted to cross my mother or my sister in their day they were ravens of apollo and the truth is that my story starts in that fight it is from that day that the other corvaxae turned against pater and then against me and from that day that the men of plataea decided to find a new way of keeping their little town free of thebes it took pater almost a year to get to his feet before that year i reckon we were rich as peasants in boeotia measured riches we had a yoke of oxen and two ploughs a house built of stone with a tower a barn that stood all weather and the smithy pater wore the full panoply when the muster was called like a lord we ate meat on feast days and we had wine all year but i was old enough to understand that at the end of that year we were not rich maters gold pin went and all our metal cups and my first bad memory my first memory of fear is from that year simonalkes the eldest of the other branch of the corvaxae a big strong man with a dark face came to our house pater had to walk with a crutch but he rose as fast as he could cursing the slaves who helped him my brother was in the andron the mens room pouring wine for simon like a proper boy simon put his feet up on a bench youll be needing money simon said to pater not even a greeting paters face grew red but he bowed his head are you offering me aid cousin simon shook his head you need no charity ill offer you a loan against the farm pater shook his head no he said if pater thought that he was hiding his anger he was wrong still too proud smith simon said and his lip curled proud enough to stand my ground pater said and simons face changed colour he got up is this the famous hospitality of the corvaxae simon said or has your whore of a wife debased you too he looked at me neither of these boys has your look cousin leave my house pater said i came to tender help simon said but im met by accusations and insults leave my house pater said simon hooked his fingers in his belt and planted his feet he looked around is it your house cousin he smiled grimly our grandfather built this house why is it yours simon sneered he was always good at sneering and snapped his fingers perhaps youll marry again and get an heir my sons are my heirs pater said carefully as if speaking a foreign language your sons are the children of some strangers on the hillside our cousin said pater looked as angry as id ever known him and id never seen two grown men take this tone the tone of hate id heard it from mater in the womens quarters but id never heard it rise to conflict i was afraid and what was i hearing it was as if cousin simon was saying that i was not my fathers son bion pater shouted and his biggest slave came running bion was a strong man a trustworthy man with a wife and children who knew hed be freed as soon as the money came back and he was loyal thats right thugater melissa is bions granddaughter and now shes your handmaiden shes never been a slave but bion was once as was i lass so dont you wrinkle your nose youll be even poorer if i have to kill your slave simon said pater thumped one crutchstep closer and his heavy staff shot out and caught simon in the shin simon went down and then pater hit him in the groin so that he screamed like a woman in childbirth i knew that sound well enough because bions wife provided him with a child every year pater wasnt done he stood over simon with his staff raised you think im afraid of you you coward he said you think i dont know why im lame you ran you left me in the bronze storm and now you come here and your mouth pours out filth he was panting and i was more afraid because simon was wheezing down on the floor and pater had hurt him it was not like two boys behind the barn it was real simon got himself up and he pushed against bion let go slave he croaked or ill come back for you he leaned against the doorway but bion ignored him linked an arm under his chin despite his size and dragged him from the room all the oikia the household slaves and free followed the action into the courtyard simon wouldnt stop he cursed us and he cursed the whole oikia and he promised that when he came into his own hed sell all the slaves and burn their houses now i know it for what it was the blusterings of an impotent but angry man but at the time it sounded like the death curse of some fallen hero and i feared him i feared that everything he said would come to pass he said that hed lain with our mother in the hills and he said that pater was a fool who had risked all their lives in the battle and who sought death rather than face his wifes infidelity he shouted that we were all bastards and he shouted that the basileus the local aristocrat would come for the farm because he was jealous of pater and all the time bion dragged him from the yard it was ugly and when he was gone pater wept and that made me even more afraid it seemed as if the roof had fallen in on our lives but it was not many weeks later when pater brought the priest to the forge all the way from thebes he rebuilt the fire and the priest of hephaestus took his silver drachma and made a thorough job of it he used good incense from the east and he poured a libation from a proper cup although made of clay and not metal as we expected because chalkidis and i were old enough to help in the forge he made us initiates bion was already an initiate hephaestus cares nothing for slave and free but only that a craftsman gives unstintingly to his craft and he advanced a degree it was very holy and it helped to make me feel that my world was going to be restored we swept the forge from top to bottom and pater made a joke the only one i can remember i must have the only clean forge in all hellas he said to the priest the priest laughed you took that wound fighting us last year he said he pointed at paters leg aye pater allowed he was not a man given to long speeches front rank the priest asked pater pulled his beard you were there the priest nodded i close the first file for my tribe he said it was a position of real honour the priest was a man who knew his battles im the centre man in the front rank pater said he shrugged or i was you held us a good long time the theban said and to be honest i knew your device the raven apollos raven for a smith my father grinned he liked the priest a small miracle in itself and that smile made my life better were sons of heracles here i serve hephaestus and weve had the raven on our house since my grandfathers grandfather came here he kept grinning and just for a moment he was a much younger man my father always said that the gods were sufficiently capricious that we needed to serve a couple at a time that was paters longest sentence in a year the priest laughed i should be getting back he said itll be dark by the time i see the gates of thebes pater shook his head let me relight the fire he said ill make you a gift and that will please the god then you can eat in my house and sleep on a good couch and go back to thebes rested the priest bowed who can refuse a gift he said but paters face darkened wait he said and see what it is the lame god may not return my skill to me it has been too long the fire was laid the priest went out into the sunshine and took from his girdle a piece of crystal a beautiful thing as clear as a maidens eye and he held it in the sun he called my brother and i followed him as younger brothers follow older brothers and he laughed two for the price of one eh he said is it magic lord my brother asked the priest shook his head there are charlatans who would tell you so he said but i love the new philosophy as much as i love my crafty god this is a thing of making men made this it is called a lens and a craftsman made it from rock crystal in a town in syria it takes the rays of the sun and it burnishes them the way your father burnishes bronze and makes them into fire watch he placed a little pile of shavings of dry willow on the ground then he held the lens just so and before we were fidgeting the little pile began to smoke run and get me some tow from your mother and her maidens the priest said to me and i ran i didnt want to miss a moment of this philosophy i hurried up the steps to the exhedra and my sister opened the door she was five blonde and chubby and forthright what she asked me i need a handful of tow i said what for she asked we were never adversaries penelope and i so i told her and she got the tow and carried it to the priest herself and he was tolerant flicking her a smile and accepting the tow with a bow as if she were some lords kore serving at his altar and all the time his left hand holding the lens never moved the light fell in a tiny pinpoint too bright to watch and the willow shavings smoked and smoked i could blow on it i said the priest looked at me strangely then he nodded go ahead he said so i lay down in the dust and blew on the shavings very gently at first nothing happened and then i almost blew them all over the yard my brother punched me in the arm the priest laughed quickly i ran into the shop where pater stood by his cold forge with a distant look on his face and i took the tube we used for controlling the heat of the forge a bronze tube i ran back into the yard put the end of the tube near the pinpoint of light and gave a puff and before my heart beat ten times i had fire the priest wasnt laughing any more he lifted the tow put the flames in the midst and caught the tow so that he seemed to have a handful of fire and then he walked into the forge at a dignified pace and we followed him he laid the fire in the forge under the scraps and the bark and the good dry oak and the nightblack charcoal from mighty cithaerons flanks the fire of the sun brought down from the sky by his lens lit the forge pater was not a man easily moved but he watched the fire with a look on his face like hunger in a slave then he busied himself managing the fire the hearth had been cold for a long time and he needed coals to accomplish even the slightest work so my brother and i carried wood and charcoal and the priest sang a long hymn to the smith god and the fire leaped and burned through the afternoon and before long there was a good bed of coals pater took down a leather bag full of sand from his bench and he had bion cut him a circle of bronze as big as a mans hand then with that hungry look he took the bronze in his great hand and set the edge to the leather bag and after a brief pause his rounded hammer fell on the bronze in a series of strokes almost too fast to see thats another sight ill never forget pater almost blind with his lust to do his work and the hammer falling the strokes precise as his left hand turned the bronze strike turn strike turn it was the bowl of a cup before i needed ten breaths not a priests holy cup but the kind of cup a man likes to have on a trip to show hes no slave the cup you use to drink wine in a strange place that reminds you of home outside the shadows were growing long in the forge the hammer made its muffled sound against the leather pater was weeping the priest took the three of us and led us outside i wanted to stay and see the cup i could already see the shape i could see that pater had not lost his touch and i was six or seven and all i wanted was to be a smith like pater to make a thing from nothing that is the true magic whether in a womans womb or in a forge but we went outside and the priest was holding the tube of bronze he blew through it a couple of times and then nodded as if a puzzle had been solved he looked at me you thought to go and fetch this he said it wasnt a question so i said nothing i would have thought of it too my brother said penelope laughed not in a year of feast days she said one of maters expressions he sent a slave for fire from the main hearth in the kitchen and he put it in the fireplace in the yard thats where pater kindled the forge in high summer when it was blinding hot and he blessed it he was a thorough man and worth his silver drachma unlike most priests ive known blessing the outdoor hearth was something pater hadnt even considered then he built up his little fire and the three of us bustled to help him picking up scraps of wood and bark all over the yard my brother fetched an armload of kitchen wood and then the priest began to play with the tube blowing through it and watching the coals grow brighter and redder and the flames leap hmm he said several times i have spent much of my life with the wise i have been lucky that way that everywhere ive gone the gods have favoured me with men who love study and yet have time to speak to a man like me but i think i owe all of that to the priest of hephaestus he treated all of us children as equals and he cared for nothing but that tube and the effect it had on fire he did the oddest things he walked all over the yard until he found a whole straw from the last haying and he cut it neatly with a sharp iron knife and then used it to blow on the flames it gave the same effect hmm he said he poured water on the fire and it made steam and scalded his hand and he cursed and hopped on one foot penelope fetched one of the slave girls and she made him a poultice and while she nursed his hand he blew through the tube on the dead fire and nothing happened except that a trail of ash was blown on my chiton hmm he said he relit the fire inside the forge the sound had changed i could hear my fathers lightest hammer when you are a smiths child you know all the music of the forge going taptap taptap he was doing fine work chasing with a small chisel perhaps i wanted to go and watch but i knew i was not welcome he was with the god so i watched the priest instead he sent bion for a hide of leather and he rolled it in a great tube and breathed through it on the fire and nothing much happened he and bion made a really long tube as long as a grown mans arm from calfs hide and the priest set bion to blow on the fire bion did this in the forge and he was expert at it and the priest watched the long tube work on the fire hmm he said my brother was bored he made a spear from the firewood and began to chase me around the yard but i wanted to watch the priest i had learned how to be a younger brother i let him thump me in the ribs and i neither complained nor fought back i just stood watching the priest until my brother was bored it didnt take long my brother didnt like being deprived of his mastery who cares he asked so the tube makes the fire burn i mean who cares he looked to me for support he had a point every child of a smith learned to use the tube as did every slave the priest turned on him like a boar on a hunter as you say boy who would care so answer this riddle and the sphinx wont eat you why does the tube air make the fire brighter eh hmm paters hammer was now going taptaptaptaptaptap who cares chalkidis asked he shrugged can i go and play he asked be off with you achilles the priest said my brother ran off my sister might have stayed she had some thoughts in her head even as a little thing but mater called her to fetch wine and she hurried off may i touch the lens i asked the priest reached up and put it in my hand he was down by the fire again it was a beautiful thing and even if he said it had no magic i was thrilled to touch it it brought fire down from the sun and it was clear and deep i looked at things through it and it was curious an ant was misshapen some parts larger and some smaller dust developed texture does it warm up in your hand when you bring down the sun i asked the priest sat back on his heels he looked at me the way a farmer looks at a slave he is thinking of purchasing no he said but that is an excellent question he held up the bronze tube neither does this but both make the fire brighter what does it mean i asked the priest grinned no idea he said do you know how to write i shook my head the priest pulled his beard and began to ask questions he asked me hundreds of questions hard things about farm animals he was searching my head of course looking to see if i had any intelligence i tried to answer but i felt as if i was failing his questions were hard and he went on and on the shadows grew longer and longer and then my father started singing i hadnt heard his song in the forge in a year indeed at the age i was at id forgotten that my father ever sang when he worked his song came out of the forge like the smell of a good dinner soft first and then stronger it was the part of the iliad where hephaestus makes the armour of achilles my mothers voice came down from the exhedra and met paters voice in the yard these days no one teaches women to sing the iliad but back then every farm girl in boeotia knew it and they sang together i dont think id ever heard them sing together perhaps he was happy perhaps she was sober pater came out into the yard with a cup in his hand he must have burnished it himself instead of having the slave boys do it because it glowed like gold in the last light of the sun he limped across the yard and he was smiling my gift to you and the god he said he handed the cup to the priest it had a flat base a hard thing to keep when you round a cup let me tell you with sloping sides and a neatly rolled rim hed riveted a handle on simple work but done cleanly and precisely hed made the rivets out of silver and the handle itself of copper and hed raised a scene into the cup itself so that you could see hephaestus being led to olympus by dionysus and heracles when his father zeus takes him back dionysus was tall and strong in a linen chiton and every fold was hammered in the bronze heracles had a lion skin that pater had engraved so that it looked like fur and the smith god was a little drunk on the happiness of his fathers taking him back the priest turned it this way and that and then he shook his head this is kings work he said thieves would kill me in the road for a cup like this yours pater said the priest nodded your gifts are unimpaired it seems he said the cup was its own testimony i remember the awe i felt looking at it untouched by the rage of ares pater said i owe more than that cup priest but thats what i can tithe now the priest was visibly awed i was a boy and i could see his awe just as surely as i had seen simons fear and rage it made me wonder in a whole new way who my father was pater summoned bion and bion poured wine cheap wine for thats all we had into the new cup first the priest prayed to the smith god and poured a libation and then he drank and then pater drank and then bion drank then they gave me the cup and i drank your boy here has a gift too the priest said while the wine warmed our bellies hes quick pater said and ruffled my hair first id heard of it more than quick the priest said he drank looked at the cup and held it out to bion who filled it he started to pass it back and pater waved at him all servants of the smith here bion he said so bion drank again and let me tell you when the hard times came and bion stayed loyal it was for that reason pater was fair fair and straight and slaves know something for you to remember when youre tempted to a little temper tantrum eh little lady hair in your food and piss in your wine when you mistreat them right anyway we drank a while longer it went to my head the priest asked pater to think about moving to thebes said pater would make a fortune doing work like this in a real city pater just shrugged the joy of making was washing away in the wine if i wanted to be a theban he said id have gone there when i was young he made the word theban sound dirty but the priest took no offence and then the priest turned back to me that boy needs to learn his letters he said pater nodded good thing for a smith to know he agreed my heart soared i wanted nothing nothing more than to be a smith i could take him to school the priest said pater shook his head youre a good priest pater said but my boy wont be a pais in thebes again the priest took no offence you wont teach the boy yourself he said no question to it pater looked at me nodded agreeing no he said its my curse ive no time for them teaching takes too long and i grow angry he shrugged the priest nodded theres a heros tomb with a priest up the mountain he said leitos pater said he went to troy calchas is the priest a drunk but a good man he can write the priest asked pater nodded the next morning i rose with the sun to see the priest go i held his hand in the courtyard while he thanked the god and pater for his cup and pater was happy he reminded pater that i was to learn to write and pater swore an oath unasked and the thing was done i wasnt sure what i thought about it but that was paters way a thing worth doing was done the priest went to the gate and blessed bion pater took his hand and was blessed in turn may i have your name priest he asked back then men didnt always share their names the priest smiled im empedocles he said he and pater shook hands the initiates way and then the priest came to me you will be a philosopher he said he was dead wrong but it was a nice thing to hear at the age of six or seven or whatever i was whats your name he asked arimnestos i answered it must seem strange to you sitting in heraklea where we rule propontis as far as the wild tribes that in boeotia two towns a days walk apart could be inveterate enemies its true we told the same jokes and we worshipped the same gods and we all read homer and hesiod praised the same athletes and cursed the same way but thebes and plataea were never friends they were big dandified and they thrust their big noses in where we didnt want them they had a federation which was a fancy way of saying that they would run everything and the old ways could go to tartarus and all the small poleis could just obey so i was five or perhaps six when pater went away and came back wounded and the men of thebes had the best of it they didnt harry our orchards or burn our crops but we submitted and they forced little plataea to accept their laws and there it might have remained if it hadnt been for the daidala you think you know all about the daidala my dear because i am master here and i make the peasants celebrate the festival of my youth but listen thugater it was on the slopes of cithaeron that zeus first feared to lose the love of his wife hera she left him for he is a bad husband and he cheated on her and you must tell me should your husband ever forsake your bed ill see to it that he returns or hell wear his guts for a zone at any rate she left him and when she was gone as is the way with men he missed her so he asked her back but when you are a god and the father of gods aye or when you are merely a mortal man and full of your own importance it is hard to ask forgiveness and harder still to be refused so zeus went into boeotia and in those days there were kings he found the king a plataean of course and asked him for advice the king thought about it for a day if he had any sense he asked his own wife then he went back to mightythewed zeus and he no doubt shrugged at the irony of it all and he said mighty zeus first among gods and men you can win back beautiful coweyed hera if you make her jealous by making her think that you intend to replace her for ever so he proposed that they make a wooden statue of a beautiful kore a maiden in a wedding gown and that they take it to the sacred precincts on the mountain and imitate the manner of men and women going to a wedding hera will come in all her glory to destroy her usurper the king said and when she sees that its nothing but a billet of wood shell be moved to laughter and then youll be reconciled perhaps zeus thought it was the silliest plan hed ever heard but he was desperate to an old man like me it seems a deeply cynical plan but for all that it worked the wedding procession wound up the hillside and hera came and destroyed the statue with her powers then she saw that she had merely burned a piece of wood and she laughed and she and zeus were reconciled and celebrated their eternal marriage again so every town in boeotia used to take turns to celebrate the daidala fortyeight towns and in the fortyninth year the great daidala when the fires burned like the beacons burned when the medes came and they would compete to celebrate with the best festival the largest fire the finest ornaments on the dresses the most beautiful kore but as thebess federation gained power so thebes took over the festivals they would allow no rival and the daidala was celebrated only by thebes and little thespiae and our plataea only our two little states dared to insist on our ancient rights now when the men of thebes bested us that time our leaders signed their treaty accepted their laws and accepted the federation the way a poor man accepts a bad sausage in the market when he dares not haggle but the treaty said nothing about the daidala and plataeas turn was coming her first turn to celebrate the festival in nigh on fifty years for a year after the battle men said little about it but then the plataean daidala was just a few years away and towns worked for years to make the festival great so it was that not long after the priest came to our house this is how i remember it and the forge fire was relit men started to come back to the forge first they came to have their pots mended and their ploughs straightened but soon enough they came to talk as the weather changed and pater worked outside men would come as soon as their farm work was done or before and they would sit on paters forging stumps or recline against the cows fence or her shed they would bring their own wine and pour it for each other or for pater and they would talk i was a boy and i loved to hear men talk these were plain men not lords but not fools either even here in this house i hear the life of the rustic made a thing of fun perhaps perhaps there are boors who think more of the price of an ass than of a beautiful statue what of it how many of these philosophers could plough a straight furrow eh girl there is room in the world for many kinds of wisdom that was the revelation of my life and you should write it down hah it is good to be lord at any rate by the end of the day wed have the potter karpos son of phoibos the wheelwright draco son of draco the leather worker theron son of xenon some of their slaves and a dozen farmers in the yard and they would debate everything from the immortality of the gods to the price of wheat at the market in thebes and corinth and athens athens how often in this story will i mention her not my city but crowned in beauty and strong in a way plataea could never be strong yet capricious and sometimes cruel like a maiden as you will be soon enough my dear athens is now the greatest city in the world but then she was just another polis and outside of attica men paid her little heed yet she was starting to learn her power i must weary you with some history athens had been under a tyranny for forty years the pisistratidae some say that the tyrants were good for athens and some say they were bad i have friends of both groups and i suspect the truth was that the tyrants were good in some ways and bad in others while the tyrants were lording it over athens the world was changing first sparta rose to power initially by crushing the cities nearest to her and then by forcing the rest of their neighbours into a set of treaties that compelled them to serve sparta now in the peloponnese everywhere else too only men of property fought in the battles slaves might throw rocks and poor farmers might throw a javelin but the warriors were aristocrats and their friends armies were small because there are thank the gods only so many aristocrats in the world but when sparta created her league she changed the world suddenly the peloponnese could field a bigger army than anyone else spartans are great warriors just ask them but what made them dangerous was their size sparta could put ten thousand men in the field the other states had to respond thebes formed her own league the federation of boeotia but other states had to find another way to provide that manpower in plataea we took to arming every free man even so we could never as i have said muster more than fifteen hundred armed men in athens the tyrants kept their armies small they did not permit men to carry arms abroad and when they had to fight they hired mercenaries from thessaly and scythia they didnt trust their people dont fool yourself honey were tyrants too at any rate while i was a boy the pisistratidae fell the survivors ran off to the great king of persia and athens became a democracy suddenly in a day athens had the manpower to field a big army ten thousand hoplites or more the athens of my boyhood was like a boy who has just developed his first muscles youve stayed awake through my history lesson that fellow who is courting you must be having his effect the point is there is a point honey that for the first time athens was feeling strong and she was suddenly open as a market for the plataeans just over the mountains and guarding the pass to thebes some of the richer farmers had learned that if they carted their olive oil and grain and wine over the mountain to athens they fetched a much better price than they got in the market of little plataea or in the market of mighty thebes i longed to go to athens i dreamed of it i had heard that the whole city was built of parian marble lies of course but you have dreams of your own you know what dreams are like and we heard that the alcmaeonidae were building the new temple of apollo at delphi of marble it had never been done before and it was a marvel draco the wheelwright as close to a good friend as pater had went on a pilgrimage to delphi and came back singing of the new temple bah give me that wine cup and never mind an old mans digressions anyway the talk that summer was of the daidala and the price of grain epictetus was the richest of the local farmers hed been born a slave and made all his wealth from his own sweat and he might have been old hesiod reborn a hard man to cross but hed just made the trip to athens the year before and he swore by it i remember the day that he pulled up with a wagon full of hired hands this is the party he said he had a grim deep voice no party here pater said he was making a cauldron a deep one and the anvil sang with every stroke as he bent the bronze to his will just a bunch of loafers avoiding their work there were twenty men around the forge yard and they all laughed it was midafternoon and there wasnt a lazy man there they had a skin of last years wine the good purple stuff that our grapes make at home dark as tyrian dye epictetus got off his wagon and his hired men climbed down it was a high wagon dracos best work the kind that would carry five farms worth of grain he had a grown son epictetus son of epictetus who was a shadow beside his hardworking father bring our wine son the father said and then he walked into the yard it was quite the event because epictetus never came to loaf in the forge yard he said that a man had but one life and any time he wasted counted against him with the gods he was the only farmer in boeotia who owned four ploughs he only needed two but he built the other two just in case he was that sort of man so he came into the yard and pater sent me for a stool from the kitchen it was like one lord visiting another i fetched a stool and epictetus the son poured wine from a heavy amphora for every man in the yard i had a taste of paters it was not cheap epictetus looked around ive picked the right day he said he nodded i have a thought in my head and i cant get it out i wanted to talk to the men the real men without giving myself away to the theban bastards in town pater handed bion the new cauldron punch her for rivets he said did you pour me a new plate bion nodded he was better at casting bronze even than pater smooth as a baby he said hell be a rival to you when you free him draco said no pater said he pulled his leather apron off and tossed it to another slave then he poured some water over his head wiped his face with a rag and walked back it is good to see you in my yard and a guest is always a blessing pater said and poured a libation i always have time to listen to you epictetus epictetus bowed he rose as if speaking in the assembly and in a way he was for in the yard were the leaders of what might have been called the middling sort the men who supported the temples and shrines who served in war there were some aristocrats and two very rich men but the men in our yard were well they were the voice of the farmers if you like men he said how imposing he was tall strong and burned so dark that he looked like mahogany even at fifty he was someone to be reckoned with men of plataea he began again and suddenly i knew that he was nervous that made me nervous too such a strong man and rich last year i went to athens he said you know that athens has overthrown the tyrants they are gone fled to the great king in persia or dead he paused and smiled a little but you know all this eh im a windbag listen athens has money their silver owls are the best coin in hellas and they have an army they muster ten thousand hoplites when they go to war he looked around took a sip of wine they have so many mouths to feed in their city that they need our grain aye they import grain all the way from propontis and the euxine men shifted restlessly im no hand at this so heres what im trying to say we cannot fight thebes alone we need a friend athens should be that friend they need our grain he shrugged i talked to some men in athens they talk to farmers as if they were men of substance in athens not like some bastards ive known eh and the men i talked to were very interested interested in being friends he looked around i remember that i found the idea so exciting that i thought i might burst athens glorious athens as an ally which goes to show what you know when youre seven years old the rest of them shuffled their feet and looked at the ground draco shrugged listen epictetus your idea has merit and its time we started to talk about these things no man here will deny that we need a friend but athens is so far over the mountains five hundred stades as the raven flies more for a man and a cart myron another farmer leaned forward on his heavy staff athens would never send their phalanx over the mountains to protect us he said he had a scar on his thigh from the same fight where pater had been made lame we need a friend with five thousand hoplites who will stand their ground beside us not a friend who will come and avenge our corpses epictetus nodded to myron they had each others measure those two it might be true he said but we need a friend far enough away that he wont force us to be more than just an ally he looked around like thebes and the socalled federation all the men spat at the mention of thebes myron nodded thats sense how about corinth evaristos the handsomest of the men shook his head corinth is too close and has too many ships and too few hoplites and no need for our grain and loves thebes too well draco held out his cup to one of our slaves a splash more darling he said what of sparta theyve an army worth something or so i hear ten times the distance as athens epictetus said i know draco said i made my pilgrimage last year to olympia we know many of the men called tired of dracos endless travel tales listen you oafs draco shouted they jeered him with humour but then they were silent he went on sparta is not like us their citizens all they do is train for war and fuck little boys hilarion put in if the least rich of the farmers he was the most cheerful and the best with a crowd and the least respectful of authority he shrugged hey ive been to sparta women there are lonely draco glared at hilarion whatever their personal foibles gentlemen theyre the best soldiers in greece and they dont farm or make pots or work metal they fight they can march here if they have a mind to their farms will be tilled whether they march or not their wives are lonely whether they march or not hilarion added maybe while they march to save us ill just slip over the isthmus and visit a few of them pater spoke for the first time hilarion he said softly he met the younger mans eyes and hilarion dropped his sorry he said pater walked into the middle of them my sense of what you say he began is that you all support the idea of finding ourselves a foreign friend they looked at each other then epictetus stood and emptied his cup thats the right of it he said but none of us knows what will suit us athens or sparta or corinth or perhaps megara pater shrugged were a bunch of boeotian farmers epictetus here has at least been to attica and dracos been to the peloponnese he looked around who would want to be our friend epictetus winced but said nothing if we trained harder our men could beat the thebans said myrons son a firebreather called dionysius and then wed have no need of these foreigners myron put a hand on his sons shoulder the boy was only just old enough to take his stand and hadnt been there for the defeat boy when they bring five thousand against our one thousand he said theres no amount of training that will help us no man here cares a tinkers damn how many we kill only that we win the older men nodded agreement the iliad was a fine story for children but boeotian farmers know just what war brings burned crops raped daughters and death the glory is fleeting the expense immense and the effect permanent they talked more but thats how i remember it the day the idea was born in fact it was just grumbling we all hated thebes but they werent hurting us any epictetus stayed to dinner though and he offered to carry the cream of paters work over the mountains to athens and back if it didnt sell and pater agreed then epictetus commissioned a cup hed clearly seen the priests cup and wanted one for himself a cup i can drink from in the fields or at home he said what do you want on it pater asked a man ploughing a field epictetus said none of your gods and satyrs a good pair of oxen and a good man twenty athenian drachmas pater said or for nothing if you carry my goods to athens epictetus shook his head twenty drachmas is what youre worth he said and ill carry your goods anyway if i take it as a gift i owe you if i pay you you owe me thats the kind of man he was pater worked like a slave for the rest of the summer making finer things than were his wont he made ten platters the kind gentlemen served feasts on and he made more cups including the fanciest of the lot with a ploughman for epictetus and he made a corinthian helmet simple in design but perfect in execution even in the summer of my seventh year i knew perfection in metal when i saw it pater had no patience in him to teach the young but he let me put it on my head he laughed youll be a big man arimnestos he said but not yet he made bronze knives for me and for my brother fine ones with some work on the backbone of the blade and horn scales on either side of the grip i worked like a slave that summer because we were poor and we had just bions family as slaves and bion was far too skilled to waste his time putting air on the fire or punching holes in leather or any of the other donkey work and though my brother was too small to plough he ploughed anyway with help from bions son hermogenes together they made a man occasionally men like myron would appear out of the air and take a turn at the plough or repair a wheel or perhaps sow a field we had good neighbours when i wasnt in the forge i was in the fields too i loved that farm our land was at the top of a hill a low hill but it gave a view from the house in the paved yard where men stood to talk you could see mighty cithaeron rising like a slopeshouldered god and you could see the walls of our city just across a little valley up on cithaeron we could see the heros tomb and the sacred spring and if we looked towards plataea we could see the temple of hera clear as a lamp in a dark room the trees of heras grove were like spears pointing up the hill at our little acropolis even though they were stades away we had an apple tree at the top of the olive grove and i went up and trimmed the new growth in the spring and again in the autumn we had grapes on the hillside and when we had no other work to do hermogenes and chalkidis and i would build trellises to carry the vines there was a small wood by the stream at the base of the hill and the old people had dug a fish pond i could pretend that we were great lords with our own hill fort and our own woods for hunting although we didnt have an animal larger than a rabbit to hunt but theres no memory dearer to me than walking home from the agora in plataea with bion we must have just sold some wine or perhaps some oil and i was allowed to go to town walking home past the turning where our road went down to the stream and then up the hill to our house and thinking this is my land my father is king here most nights unless mater was raving drunk wed meet in the courtyard after dinner and watch the sun set we had a swing in the courtyard olive tree pater showed me the grooves in the branch that bore it sunk into the wood the way chariot wheels will cut ruts even in stone the swing had been on that tree for many lives of men it may sound dull to you dear but to watch a sunset from a swing on your own land is a very good thing it must have been after the festival of demeter because all the harvest was in that epictetus arrived with his wagons he had two no one else we knew had two wagons well he said when his wagons were in the yard pater and bion had all the bronze laid out so that our courtyard looked as if it had been touched by king midas epictetus walked around handled everything and finally nodded sharply he picked up his cup snatched it up and then looked at pater for confirmation that it was indeed his dont get many requests for a plough and oxen pater said epictetus looked at it then hefted it in his hand bion stepped forward and poured wine into it you have to feel it full he said with a smile epictetus poured a libation and drank good cup he said pay the man boy he said to his son id rather have it in bronze from athens pater said less a quarter for cartage epictetus asked less an eighth for cartage pater said epictetus nodded and they both spat on their hands and shook and the thing was done then the hired men loaded all the work of a summer and the big wagons rolled away down the hill i was old enough to know that all of paters stock of bronze was rolling away in those carts he had nothing left but scraps to make repairs if robbers took epictetus on the roads we were finished i knew it and i felt it over the next weeks pater was a fair man but when he was dark he hit us and those weeks were dark one afternoon he even hit bion savagely and i dropped a fine bowl and he beat me with a stick he beat my brother when he caught him watching the girls bathe and he raged at us every day mater was sober it has an odd sound to it but it was as if she knew she was needed so she stopped drinking and did housework she read aloud to us every day from a stool by her loom and she was very much like the aristocratic lady shed been born to be i loved her stories she would tell us the myths of the gods or sing pieces of the iliad or other stories and i would devour them the way my brother devoured meat but when she was done and the magic of her voice faded she was just my dull and drunken mother and i couldnt like her so i went back to the fields it was in those weeks that i went into plataea with bion and pledged the familys credit to an iron knife only the gods know what i was thinking a little boy with an iron knife who had a perfectly good bronze one on a thong round his neck children are as inscrutable as the gods pater beat me so badly that i thought i might die i see it now i had pledged money he didnt have and we were at the bottom all our harvest and all our work was off at athens or lost on the road i see it now but at the time it hurt me far more than just a beating i decided that night tears burning down my face that he wasnt really my father no man could treat his son that way that was a deeper pain than any blow i still bear it the next day he apologized in fact he all but crawled to me making false jokes and wincing when he touched my bruises alternating with making light of my injuries it was a strange performance and in some way it was as confusing as the heavy beating and then he recovered whatever daimon was eating his soul he rose above it it was three weeks or more after epictetus had left and he was a week overdue pater came out into the vineyard with us and started building trellises work he never did as if it was the most natural thing in the world he didnt complain and he didnt hit anyone and we worked steadily all day under the high blue skies of autumn the grapes were almost ripe and the trellises creaked bion and i were both physically wary of him we had bruises to prove that we had the right but he passed no reproof harder than a look my brother fell on a vine and wrecked an hours work but pater merely shook his head and took up his light bronze axe he went off to the wood to cut more supports and sent my brother to the river to cut reeds it was an autumn day but hot beautiful you could see the stream glinting and the line of the oeroe river down the valley i sweated through my chiton and stripped it off to work naked which meant a slap from mater if she caught me but she wasnt likely to come out to the vineyard bion had brought a bucket of water from the well he offered me the first dipper i was the only free man on the hilltop but id learned some things even at that age ill drink last i said i saw a spark in bions eye and knew id hit that correctly i remember that and the beauty of the day but most of all i remember that pater came for us he didnt have to you see he was down at the wood and hed have seen epictetuss wagons turn off the road he might even have seen them three stades away or farther and as the master and the man with so much to lose it would have been natural for him to take his axe and go down to the yard and leave us to work on the hilltop but he didnt he came up the hill hobbling quickly come with me he said he was terse and all of us even bion thought that there might be trouble we put our tools down and followed him through the vineyard to the house pater said nothing so we didnt either we came into the yard and only then could we see the hillside and hear the wagons in the lane i couldnt see my face but i could see hermogenes he flashed his father a smile of utter joy he said youll be free which meant nothing to me at the time epictetus was driving his own oxen on the wagon his son was beside him and he had two of his hired men in the box but the second wagon was gone and the smiles must have been wiped from every face in the oikia even the women were leaning over the rail of the exhedra epictetus the younger leaped down and ran to the heads of the oxen and he flashed pater a smile and then we knew as old epictetus got down he couldnt keep the smile off his own face then the hired men got down and they threw heavy wool sacks on to the ground they made a noise like rock but thinner copper i knew from the sound and then tin wrapped in leather from far far to the north epictetus came forward with his thumbs in his girdle it was cheaper to buy copper and tin than to buy ingots of bronze he said and ive watched you do it if you dont like it he raised an eyebrow ill lend you the wagon to get it back cyprian ingots pater said he had the heavy wool bags open by aphrodite friend you must drive a fair bargain if all this copper and tin is mine for twenty drachmas less an eighth for cartage epictetus shrugged but he was a happy man a man whod done another man an unanswerable favour fifty drachmas of silver less an eighth cartage he said i spent thirty of your profits on new material it seemed like sense pater was kneeling in the copper like a boy playing in mud i owe you he said epictetus shrugged time you made some money youre too good a man to starve you know how to work but not how to be rich he held out a bag three hundred and seventytwo silver drachmas after my cartage and all that copper he nodded and theres a man coming to see you about a helmet from athens pater didnt seem to know what was being said so he fixed on the idea that the man from athens was coming three hundred and seventy drachmas he said he and epictetus embraced that night mater and pater sang together they were a remarkable couple when sober and friends to each other youll never credit this thugater but youll find it hard enough when you are my age to look back and see your father and mother clearly and if apollo withholds his hand and pluton grants fortune enough that i live to see you with children at your knee why then youll remember me only as an old man with a stick eh but i love to remember them that day in later years when i was far away a slave i would think of pater dressed in his best a chiton of oiled wool so fine that every muscle in his chest showed and his neck like a bulls and his head he had a noble head like a statue of zeus his hair all dark and curled he always wore it long in braids wrapped around the crown of his head when he was working later i understood it was a warriors hairstyle braids to pad his helmet he was never just a smith and mater when sober it is hard for a child to see his mother as beautiful but she was men told me so all my childhood and what is more embarrassing than other men finding your mother attractive her eyes were blue and grey her nose straight her face thin her cheekbones high and hollow i often wonder how many mother heras in the temple were carved to look like mater she would come down in a dress of tyriandyed wool with embroidery not her own athena knows and she was trim and lithe and above all to me sober the next day pater freed bion he offered him a wage to stay and sent for the priest from thebes to raise bion to the level of a free smith bion and pater dickered over the price of his family and pater settled on two years work at the forge bion accepted and they spat on their hands and shook the following day pater came to me where i was sweeping time to go to school he said he didnt smile in fact he looked nervous im sorry boy sorry i beat you so hard for a drachma knife he handed it back to me hed confiscated it and the bronze one hed made for me i made you a scabbard he said indeed he had a bronze scabbard with a silver rivet decoration it was a wonderful thing finer than anything i owned thank you pater i mumbled i swore an oath that if we made it through the summer he paused and looked out of the forge if we made it through the summer id take you up to the heros shrine and pay the priest to teach you i nodded i mean to keep my word but i want you to know that youre a good worker he nodded so put your knife round your neck lets see it now go and put on a white chiton as if you were going to a festival and kiss your mother mater looked at me as if id been dragged in by the dogs but then she smiled today she looked to me like a queen you have it in you to look like a lord she said remember this she held up her mirror a fine silver one that hadnt been sold while we were poor with aphrodite combing her hair on the back i saw myself it wasnt the first time but i still remember being surprised at how tall i was and how much i really did look like my idea of a lord fine wool chiton hair in ringlets and the knife under my arm then she offered me her cheek to kiss never her lips and never a hug and i was away i walked with pater it was thirty stades to the shrine of our hero of the trojan war and i wasnt used to sandals pater was silent i was amazed that he hadnt sent bion or someone else but he took me himself and when we had climbed high enough up the flank of the mountain to be amidst the trees beautiful straight cypress and some scrubby pine he stopped listen boy he said old calchas is a worthy man for a drunk but he that is if you want no part of him run home and if he hurts you ill kill him he held my shoulders and kissed me and then we walked the rest of the way calchas was not so old he was paters age and had a fuller beard with plenty of white in it but he had the body of an athlete he didnt look like a drunk i fancied myself an expert after all i knew every stage of maters drinking from redrimmed eyes and foul breath to modest bleariness calchas didnt show any of that and he was still i saw that at once he didnt fidget and he didnt show anxiety but it was his eyes that held me he had green eyes as i do myself and id never seen another pair they also had a particular quality they seemed to look through you to a place far beyond i know dear my eyes do the same but they didnt then i dont think most of the farmers of the valley of the asopus knew what calchas was they thought him a harmless priest a drunk a useful old man who would teach their sons to read it is almost funny given what plataea was to become that in all the valley there wasnt a man hard enough to look the priest in the eye and see him for what he was a killer i lived with calchas for years but i never thought of his hut beside the spring and the tomb as home from the edge of the tomb i could see our hill rising thirty stades away and when i was homesick i would climb the round stones to the top lie on the beehive roof and look across the still air to home and often enough he would send me back on errands because we paid him in wine and olive oil and bread and cheese and because he was a kind man for all that his eyes were dead hed wait until i cried myself to sleep a few nights and then hed send me home on an errand without my asking that whole first autumn i learned my letters and nothing else for hours every day and then wed scour his wooden dishes and his one bronze pitcher a big thing that had no doubt been a donation in the ancient past he didnt speak much except to teach he simply taught me the letters over and over again endlessly patient where pater would have been screaming in frustration id like to say that i was a quick learner but i wasnt it was early autumn and everything was golden and i was an outdoor boy caught in his lessons i wanted to watch the eagles play in the high air and the woods around the shrine fascinated me because they were so deep and dark one day i saw a deer my first and then a boar i felt as if i had fallen into the land of myth travellers sometimes came over the mountain to the shrine not many but a few they were always men and they often carried weapons a rare sight down in the valley calchas would send me away then hed sit with the men and drink a cup of wine they were soldiers of course soldiers came to the shrine from all over boeotia because the word was that the shrine and the spring provided healing to men of war i think it was calchas who healed them he talked and they listened and they went away lighter by a few darics and some care sometimes hed get drunk afterwards but mostly hed go and say some prayers at the shrine of the hero and then hed make us some barley gruel his food was terrible and always the same black bread bean broth without meat water ive lived in a spartan mess group and eaten better at the time i cared little food was fuel calchas had fascinating things in his hut he had an aspis as fine as paters a great bowl of bronze and wood with a snake painted in red and a hundred dents in the surface he had a sword a long sword with a narrow blade nothing like paters long knife he had a dull helmet a simple one not a fancy corinthian like paters and his cuirass consisted of layers of white leather scarred and scuffed and patched a hundred times without a scrap of bronze to brighten it he had a fine hunting spear beautifully made by a master with a long tapering point of steel chased and carefully inlaid in the median style and a bow of foreign work with a quiver of arrows he was content to let me touch it all which i was never allowed with paters kit all except the bow so naturally i had to steal the bow it wasnt hard his hut had one piece of ornamentation a window made from panes of horn pressed thin and flat it let light in in the winter and it was beautifully crafted the gift of some rich patron it was made to pivot on a pair of bronze pintles cunningly fashioned calchas used to laugh about it he called it the gate of horn and said all his dreams came through it and he also called it the lords window a foolish thing to have in a peasants hut he said although that window alone allowed me to read in the winter i had soon learned that i could get in and out of that window i whittled a stick with my sharp iron knife so that i could prise the window open from outside i waited till he was drunk then got in and took the bow and quiver and ran off up one of the hundreds of paths that led from the clearing by the spring i found my way to a small meadow with an old stump spotted on an earlier ramble and my adventure came to an end when i tried to string the bow i spent the afternoon striving against the power of a mans weapon and i failed so i carried the bow and quiver back down the mountain and sneaked them into his hut returning the bow to the peg where it hung after lessons the next day i said master i took your bow he was putting away the stylus and the wax sheets he made he turned so fast that i flinched where is it he asked on its peg i said i hung my head i couldnt string it i never saw his hand move but suddenly my ear hurt hurt like fire thats for disobedience he said calmly you want to shoot the bow yes i said i think i was crying he nodded im sending you for more wine he said when you come back perhaps well make a bow you can shoot he paused and well do the dances the military dances now what letter is this he drew one and i said omicron good boy he said my ear still hurt all thirty stades home my brother was working in the forge and he didnt like it its odd being brothers we were alike in so many ways and we were always friends even when we were angry but we wanted different things he wanted to be a warrior a nobleman with a retinue and deer hounds he wanted the life mater wanted for him and all i wanted to be was a master smith irony is the lord of all honey i got what he wanted and he got a few feet of dirt but he was a good boy and he was in the forge doing the job that i would have sold my soul to do thats the way of it when you are young i showed mater my letters and sang her the first hundred lines of the iliad which calchas had also taught me and she nodded and kissed my cheek and gave me a silver pin at least one of my sons will grow up a gentleman she said tell me of this calchas so i did i told her all i knew about him which proved under her medusalike glare to be little enough but she smiled when i said he ate black bread and bean soup an aristocrat then she said happily not my idea of an aristocrat but mater knew some things better than her eightyearold child i stayed at home for two days while pater gathered some wine i helped in the forge and saw that my brother had already learned a few things hed made a bowl from copper and he was scribing it with a stylus just simple lines but to me it looked wonderful he pulled it from my hand threw it across the forge and burst into tears and we embraced and swore to swap when pater and calchas wouldnt know it wasnt an oath either of us meant we knew wed never fool an adult and yet it seemed to comfort us and ive long wondered about which god listened to that oath there were changes mater was better that was obvious the house was clean the maids were singing and my sister smiled all the time we had a new slave family a young man a thracian and his slave wife and their new baby he didnt speak much greek and bion didnt like him and the man had a big bruise on his face where someone had knocked him down hard his wife was pretty and men in the forge yard watched her when she served them wine not that pater allowed anything to happen thats where you really betray your slaves thugater but i get ahead of myself the talk in the forge yard was louder than when id left even two months before and it was cold outside so there was a fire in the pit skira the thracians wife served wine with good grace and her husband worked the bellows while bion made a pot the men in the yard talked about thebes and plans for the coming daidala it was just three years away pater was suddenly an important man we had a donkey wed never had a donkey before and pater said hed send hermogenes with the donkey to carry the wine for me that sounded good but the donkey and the wine and hermogenes took time to prepare and it became clear that i wasnt going back to calchas on the second day either which was fine by me the loafers were all gathered draco had built epictetus a new wagon and had it standing by the gate ready for delivery it was even taller broader and heavier the wheels just narrow enough to fit in the ruts of the road we were all admiring it when a stranger turned into our lane from the main road he was riding a horse as was his companion i think honey because you know a world where every man of substance has a horse that i have to stop here and say that though id seen horses by the age of eight id never touched one no one i knew had a horse horses were for aristocrats farmers used oxen a rich farmer might have a donkey horses did nothing but carry men and farmers had legs i dont think ten families in plataea owned a horse and there were two of them coming up our lane they had cloaks and boots both of them they were clearly master and man the master had a chlamys of tyrian red with a white stripe and a chiton to match milk white with a red stripe at the hem he had red hair like my brother but even brighter and a big beard like a priest he wore a sword that you could see even at the distance of a horses length was mounted in gold all conversation stopped listen thugater in the boeotia of my youth we bitched quite a lot about aristocrats men knew that there were aristocrats we had our own basileus after all although he didnt have a goldmounted sword i can tell you and local men knew that mater was the daughter of a basileus but this was the genuine article frankly he looked more like a god than most statues id seen he was the tallest man there by more than a fingers breadth and i knew nothing of horses but his big bay looked like a creature out of story i still think of that man i can see him in my minds eye ill tell you a truth i worshipped him i still do even now i try to be him when im lording it over some court case or petty tyrant even his servant looked better than we did in a fine chlamys of dark blue wool with a stripe of red and a white chiton he didnt have a sword but he had a leather satchel under his arm and his horse was as noble as his masters and yet this god among men slipped from his horses back and bowed i seek the house of the bronzesmith of plataea he said politely can any of you gentlemen help me myron bowed deeply lord he said chalkeotechnes the smith is working we are merely his friends the redhaired god smiled is that wine i see he asked id be happy to pay for a cup none of my family was there i stepped forward no guest of this house should pay for his wine i said in the voice of a boy pardon lord skira a cup and good wine for our guest skira scampered off and the redhaired man followed her with his eyes then he looked at me you are a courteous lad he said boys dont talk back to lords i blushed and was silent until skira came back with a fine bronze cup and wine i poured for the man and he cast much the same look over the cup as he did over skira he drank in silence sharing with his man some of the loafers began to talk again but they were subdued in his presence until he slapped the wagon nice he said nice and big well made thanks draco said i made him how much for the wagon the man said already sold draco answered in the voice of a peasant who knows that hes just lost the chance of a lifetime so build me another the man said what did you charge for this one thirty drachmas draco said meaning you charged fifteen doubled it for my goldhilt sword and youll be happy to make me two wagons like this for forty the man smiled like a fox and i suddenly knew who he must be he was odysseus he was like odysseus come to life draco wanted to splutter but the man was so smooth and so pleasant that it was hard to gainsay him as you say lord draco said and then pater came he still had his leather apron on he came out into the yard saw the wine in the mans hand and flashed me a rare smile of reward you wanted me lord he asked do you know epictetus i count him a friend pater said he showed me a helmet in athens i rode over the mountain to have you make me one the man was half a head taller than pater and greaves paters brow furrowed there are better smiths in athens he said the man shook his head i dont think so but im here so unless you dont like the look of me id thank you to start work tomorrow i have a ship to catch at corinth wont the captain wait for you lord pater asked i am the captain the man said he grinned he had the happiest smile id seen on a grown man i sent them round from athens i dont think any of us had ever seen a man rich enough to own a ship before the man held out his hand to pater technes of plataea pater said men call me miltiades the lord said it was a name we all recognized even then the warlord of the chersonese his exploits were well known for us it was like having achilles ride through our gate oh fame is a fine thing he said and his servant laughed with him while we stood around like the bumpkins we were pater made him a helmet and greaves right enough and miltiades stayed for three days while pater did the work and chased and repoussed stags and lions on to his order i saw the helmet often enough in later years but i didnt get to stay to see it made i was shipped back to dull old calchas with the wine i did carry with me one gem that night my brother and i lay on the floor in the room over the andron and listened to the men talk miltiades and epictetus and myron and pater miltiades taught them how to have symposia without offending taught them some poetry showed them how to mix their wine and never ever let on that he was slumming with peasants its a fine talent if you have it men call it the common touch when they are jealous there was nothing common with miltiades he was as i said like a god on earth for the pleasure of his company and the power of his glance he gave unstintingly of himself and men loved to follow him he talked to the men about alliance with athens i was eight years old and i understood immediately that he didnt need a new helmet he probably had ten helmets hanging from the rafters of his hall in the chersonese mind you as it turned out he wore that helmet for the rest of his life so he liked it and it always put me in mind of my father later and what my father might have been aye those are tears little lady were coming to the bad part but not yet aye not yet so we listened as they talked almost plotted but not quite the talk was pretty general and never got down to cases miltiades told them how valuable an alliance with plataea could be to the democrats in athens and how much more they had in common and they listened spellbound and so did i then late in the evening i think id been asleep miltiades was making a point about trade when he stopped and raised his kylix i drink to your son arimnestos miltiades said a handsome boy with the spirit of a lord he guested me and sent a slave for wine as if hed hosted a dozen like me i doubt that id have done half as well at his age pater laughed and the moment passed but i would have died for miltiades then of course i almost did later and the next day i went back to my priest on the mountain and it seemed as if all hope of glory was lost i spent the winter with calchas he made me a bow it wasnt a very good bow but with it i learned to shoot squirrels and threaten songbirds and he took me hunting when the winter was far enough along i still love to hunt and i owe it to that man in fact he taught me more than miltiades ever did about how to be a lord we went up the mountain rising before the sun and running along the trails through the woods after rabbit or deer he killed a wolf with his bow and made me carry the carcass home the thing i remember best from that winter is the sight of blood on the snow i had no idea how much blood an animal has in it oh honey id seen goats and sheep slaughtered id seen the spray of blood at sacrifice but to do it myself i remember killing a deer a small buck my first i hit it with a javelin more by luck than anything how calchas laughed at my surprise and suddenly from being big at least to me it seemed so small as it lay panting in the snow with my javelin in its guts it had eyes it was alive at calchass prompting i took the iron knife that id earned with a beating and i grabbed the bucks head and slashed at its throat it must have taken me eight or ten passes the poor animal may artemis send that i never torment a creature like that again its eyes never left me as it died and there was blood everywhere it flowed and flowed over me warm and sticky and then cold and cloying like guilt when you get blood under your nails you can only scrape it out with a knife did you know that theres a moral there i suspect and i was kneeling in snow cold on bare knees the snow filled with the blood like a brilliant red flower it transported me it seemed to me to carry a message theres a philosopher teaching at miletus these days who says that a mans soul is in his blood i have no trouble seeing it yes the story i learned letters day by day and week by week when i could make out words on papyrus the rhythm of our days changed we would hunt until the sun was high in the sky or just walk the woods climbing up and up on cithaeron until my legs burned as if the fire of the forge was flowing in my ankles and then back down to the hut to read by the good light of day and every day we did the dance the pyrrhiche first naked and then in armour when i was older it was a good life by spring i was bigger and much stronger and i could go out in snow wearing a chiton and come back with a rabbit i understood the tracks animals made in the snow and what they meant and i understood the tracks men made on paper and what they meant once i got it i got it i may have been the slowest starter in the history of reading but after the first winter i had hesiod down pat and was off on the odyssey of course it is easier to read a thing when youve listened to the story all your life of course it is honey but i loved to read when the snow had gone from the hills and the sun grew warm calchas stopped hunting wed eaten more meat than id ever had in my life but he said that spring was sacred to artemis when animals came down from the high places to mate i wont kill again till the feast of demeter he said and his lip curled unless its a man oh yes the man he killed came to rob us it was six months since id been home and calchas had me running every morning before the sun was up running and running on the trails behind the shrine so i was running when the thief came and the first i knew was when i came back into the clearing naked and warm and found calchas with a sword in his hand the thief had a machaira a big knife or a short sword depending on how you saw it from where i stood it was huge stay well clear boy calchas called out to me so i ran around the man he sounded desperate just give me the money he said no calchas said he laughed i was getting a chill it wasnt summer and i was naked and the man with the sword had the same desperation in his voice i had heard from simon calchas backed away to the tomb and the thief followed him just give me the money he shouted calchas sidestepped the thiefs clumsy advance suddenly the thief had his back to the tomb just give me he asked and he sounded as if he was begging calchas raised his sword i dedicate your shade to the hero leitos he said and then the thiefs head fell from his shoulders and blood sprayed i had seen calchas kill animals and i knew how deadly he was so i didnt flinch i watched him arrange the corpse so that the rest of the blood poured out on to the beehive of the tomb a man has even more blood than a deer i went in and put some clothes on and my hands shook later we buried the corpse calchas didnt pray over it i sent him to serve the hero calchas said he needs no prayers poor bastard he and i buried the thief by digging with a pick and a wooden shovel and in the process of burying him i realized that there was a circle of graves around the tomb calchas shrugged the gods send one every year he said that night he got very drunk next day i ran and played all day because he didnt get up except to warm some beans but the third day when i came back from running i asked him if hed teach me to use the sword spear first he said sword later im telling this out of order but i have to say that the only problem i had with calchas and lessons was that once i had my nineyearold growth spurt he wanted me as soon as he put his hands on me that first day teaching me the spear i knew what he wanted i didnt want it there are boys who do and boys who dont right girls the same i imagine so i kept away from his hands he could have forced himself on me but he wasnt that way he just waited and hoped and whenever he touched my hips or my flanks id either flinch or go still he got the message and nothing had to be said it was a shame in a way he was a good man and an unhappy one he needed friends drinking companions and a life instead he taught a boy who didnt love him and listened to the sins of wandering mercenaries i have no idea what he had done or where but he had condemned himself to death sometimes good people do sad things honey and when a person decides to die they die i believe that calchas lived a little longer to teach me or maybe i just like to think that summer came and i went home to help bring in the barley i could read and calchas sent me home with a scroll to follow while i was away from him the ship list from the iliad and i told him that mater had scrolls of theognis and he asked me to borrow them for him my house was different pater was rich no other way to put it we had three slave families tilling i was almost superfluous to reaping although i put in one hard day setting the sheaves mostly i read aloud to mater who was the friendliest i can ever remember her she was drunk when i arrived and ashamed of her state but she sobered up by the next morning and bustled about the place the irony of it was that she could by then have acted like a lady there were six or seven slave women i didnt even know their names there was a new building in the yard a slave house my sister had changed she was seven and sharptongued busy teaching her elders their business she had a fine potteryandcloth doll from the east that she treasured she sat in the sun and told me stories of her precious doll cassandra and i listened gravely my brother worked the forge and resented it but his body was filling out he already looked like a man or at least he looked like a man to me he wasnt interested in anything i could tell him so i left him alone but on my second evening he gave me a cup hed made a simple thing with no adornment but the lip was well turned and the handle well set pater put in the rivets he admitted then with a shrug i can probably do better now he frowned and looked away i loved it i imagined drinking with my own bronze cup by a stream up on the mountain hephaestus bless you brother i said so you like it he asked suddenly he was my brother again the next day was like the old days and the resentment was gone so that i was able to show him a better way to fling a javelin and he loved it and he took me into the shop and showed me how he raised a simple bowl wed come a long way as a family when my brother could work a sheet of carefully poundedout copper without permission from pater in fact pater came in looked at his work and ruffled his hair then he turned to me how are your letters boy he asked your mother claims you can read odd how fast the mind works when fear comes in for one moment i thought that i would impress him and then i thought that perhaps that would be an error because my days on mount cithaeron would end and there would be no more rabbit hunts in the dawn and in that one burst of thought i understood how much i had become separated from the world of the forge but of course the desire to please pater won out i can read the iliad pater i said and write all my letters pater handed me a piece of charcoal and a flat board he whitewashed and used for designs write for me write this cup is of miltiades and technes made him i thought for a moment and then somewhat daring i changed the words so that i needed only two i wrote in a clear hand like a good craftsman i knew that pater would engrave the words if mine were good enough two words greek is a splendid language for ownership ofmiltiades bytechnes i wrote pater examined it he could read albeit slowly then he smiled my brother winked at me because we could count those smiles on our fingers they were so few and so valuable mmm he said he nodded then scribed it on copper twice to be sure then he put it on a cup he had around the base he used a very small chisel a new tool and clearly expensive with a fine handle to work the letters deeply chalkidis and i watched together until he was done chalkidis pounded the bronze to sheet pater said i made the cup you provided the letters he nodded obviously satisfied he will like this pater had a standing commission making armour and fancy tableware for miltiades pater wasnt alone miltiades bought dracos wagons almost as fast as he could build them they might have asked themselves why an athenian aristocrat didnt buy these things closer to home but they didnt mater did she mentioned it at least twice a day your father is rushing to his doom she said miltiades is as far beyond your father as he is beyond me sober maters intelligence was piercing and cruel sadly the gods made her so that she was only happy when she was lightly drunk witty flirtatious clever and social but sober she was medea and dead drunk she was medusa i read to her and she lent me her book of poems and said that she would come and visit i like what i hear of your calchas she said has he made love to you yet she was born of aristocrats you see and that was the way even in boeotia men with boys and women with girls at least in the aristocracy i blushed and stammered so he hasnt thats good you wouldnt like it would you she said this stroking my cheek scary itself in a way she never touched us no i said no she was sitting on her kline a low bench like a bed she reclined pulling her shawl about her when that urge comes on you tell me and ill buy you a slave for it i had no notion what she was talking about any more than i understood what calchas wanted except as a vague fear and in many ways i liked calchas better than i liked mater i found that i was eager to get back to the shrine i said my goodbyes with more relief than longing hermogenes came back with me we had a good walk ill be free next year he said wistfully lets pretend youre free now i said you can use the practice he looked at me how do i pretend to be free he asked i laughed calchas tells me that we all pretend to be free i said a typical boy trying to sound as adult as his teacher but you can meet my eyes when you talk and tell me to fuck off when i make you angry come on pretend hermogenes shook his head youve never been a slave arimnestos he said no one pretends to be free and i guarantee you that no free man pretends to be a slave we arrived at the shrine near nightfall hermogenes stayed the night and we took him hunting in the morning he was an excellent rabbit killer trained by hunger and he quickly won calchass praises i was jealous names flew and some nineyearold punches in the midst of a flurry of blows i called him a slave and he stopped moving i never saw the blow from calchas it caught me in the ear and knocked me flat are you a gentleman he asked me from the advantage of six feet of height you invited him to be a free man you asked him to trust you then you called him a slave can you keep your word i was resentful but i wasnt a fool pain has a remarkable effect on boys i sat up i apologize hermogenes i said formally i meant it only as a hateful word like bastard i tried to grin it off calchas shook his head thats a worthless apology young man you must never call a bastard bastard or a slave slave unless you want to fight to the death trust me im a bastard i know we ended up apologizing to each other very formally there was some silence and some walking apart calchas laughed called us girls and led us up the mountain after a deer it was late but the lady of animals sent us a good buck and hermogenes and i ran him down with javelins calchas working carefully through the trees to push the deer back on our weapons and we killed when the sun was almost in the treetops then calchas made hermogenes cut the bucks throat and anointed him with blood on his face as he had with me arimnestos says you are to be a free man calchas said you must learn to look other men in the eye and to think of them like this and he pointed at the corpse of the deer slave or free a man is nothing but a pile of bones and flesh with blood in the middle hermogenes didnt say anything but he embraced me and when he went to leave we clasped hands as if we were men we sent hermogenes home with a haunch of venison and a couple of rabbits which no doubt made him a hero to his family hermogenes and i date our friendship from that morning but i had to be a slave before i learned how true calchass words were in the boeotia of my youth we were poor men and though we thought we knew the world we knew little of what passed beyond our town and our mountain and our river these were the borders of our lives festivals came and passed and sowing and reaping and i was getting older hard men came to the shrine and calchas sat up the night with them the second year one tried to rape me and calchas killed him i was wellnigh paralysed with fear although i managed to bite his hand so hard he screamed after that i was more wary of the hard men i spent more and more time practising for war calchas was a warrior i had realized that although i couldnt put a day to the thought all the men who came were fighters too it was as if they belonged to a guild just like the smiths or the potters which was odd because in the boeotia of my youth every free man had to be a warrior but no man i knew actually liked it like sex and defecation it was something every man did but only boys talked about what a pretty blush so i trained with him i wasnt always aware that he was training me he had exercises for every hour of the day and many of them were remarkably like work gathering firewood breaking it in the breaking tree chopping the bigger pieces into firewood lengths for the hearth with a sharp bronze axe and then splitting them this task could consume as much time as calchas wanted it to consume we needed wood come winter and the use of the axe taught me many things that just as with smithing precision was more valuable than raw strength for instance that the ability to hit twice in exactly the same place was better than hitting once in two different places ah my dear you will never fight a man wearing bronze but you must accept the word of an old man you can kill a man right through his expensive bronze helmet if you can hit the very same place often enough calchas was no hoplomachos not just a fighting master he didnt have a special dance to teach nor were his lessons about the sword as organized as his lessons in writing rather wed be deep in a passage of the iliad and he would look up and make such a comment as i just made arimnestos hed say you know that if you hit a man often enough in precisely the same place in the helmet his helmet will give way and youll spill his brains id look at him trying to imagine it and then wed go back to the iliad there is a passage late in the poem when achilles is still sulking and hector rages among the greeks and several of the lesser heroes form a line lock their shields and stop hectors rush i remember him singing that whole passage softly the autumn light came in strongly through our horn window and dust motes floated in the shaft of light when this happened i liked to imagine that the gods were with us calchas looked up into the shaft of light and his eyes were far away thats how it is when the lesser men seek to stop the better you must lock your shield with your neighbours put your head down and refuse to take chances let the better man wear himself out against your shield poke hard with your spear to keep him at arms length and refuse to leave the safety of the shield wall he shrugged pray to the gods that the killer finds other prey or trips and falls or that your own killers come and save you but you were one of the better men i said you werea a killer suddenly his eyes locked with mine and i could see him in his highcrested helm his strong right arm pounding a lesser mans shield down down until he made the killing cut i could see it as if i was there yes he said i was a killer of men then his eyes slipped away i knew where he was he was on a battlefield i still am once you have been there you can never leave a sowing and a reaping and another year animals died under my spear i read all of theognis from maters book and came to appreciate that grown men had sex with boys and grew jealous when they took other loves and that aristocrats could be illtempered and avaricious like peasants you should read theognis my sweet just to understand that being wellborn is a thing of no value i read hesiod too i knew much of him by heart by now of course in boeotia he is our own poet and we spurn mighty homer so that we can love hesiod better besides his poems are for us farmers is achilles really a hero hes as much of a bitch as theognis to my mind hector is the hero and even he would not have made much of a farmer well perhaps i do mighty hector wrong given a month of rain hector would not surrender or sulk in his barn i was bigger i was stronger i could throw a javelin farther and better than any boy my age in the valley and calchas was talking about the boys games at places like olympia across the river the farm grew richer every grape vine was trellised and trimmed the apple trees had supports on the branches and all the new growth was excised in spring by what seemed to me to be a phalanx of slaves miltiades money could be seen everywhere in our community myron had two ploughs epictetuss younger son peneleos went with the great man to fight and his father bought a second farm for his older son there was talk of his older son wedding penelope when she turned twelve or thirteen hermogenes was freed and joined his father as a man who worked for wage all their family was freed now and bion made himself a helmet and a great bronze shield and was welcomed into the taxis not all freed men were so welcomed but bion was a special case i went with my brother and hermogenes to watch the men dance at the festival of ares all of them had practised the dances since they were old enough to learn twelve or thirteen in most cases and my father had done well by bion teaching him something that i knew pater did only with the quickest of learners so bion did not humiliate himself although as a newly freed and enfranchised man there were farmers eager to see him fail thats how men are honey dont you know with peasants it is the same in asia and aegypt and boeotia they think there is much evil in the world and little good and that one mans gain is anothers loss if bion was free then a free man would become a slave so they whispered i watched them dance i had seen it before it was magnificent and made my blood run fast two hundred men in bronze and leather swaying in line turning around thrusting with their spears parrying with their shields two years and more on the mountain and i knew those moves better than the dancers i watched with a critical eye and honey there is nothing more critical than a boy of eleven it was also my brothers first year in the dance he was well kitted with a fine corinthian helmet and a big shield to keep him safe in the storm of bronze i watched him dance and thought he did it well enough but the boy in me couldnt avoid criticism so that night i asked him why he didnt change the weight on his feet when he went from defence to attack of course he had no notion of what i was talking about but only heard his younger brother finding fault we wrestled in the barn to a draw i was weaker but i knew quite a bit more theres a lesson there too all my skill and i had quite a bit of skill already was not enough to match his longer reach and his smiths strength and even with my blood up i wasnt fool enough to put a finger in his eye but the next day he cut two poles and asked me to show him what i meant so i showed him as calchas showed me how the movement of your hips reinforces the push of the spear or the rise of the shield chalkidis was no fool no sooner did he see than he was asking questions and he took his questions to pater pater came and watched us his eyes narrowed i sent you up the mountain to learn to read and write he said what is this i was proud of my martial skills so i showed him i showed him the guards that calchas taught and the spear attacks i could hit my brother at will although when i had the weight of a real aspis on my shoulder i could barely move pater shook his head foolishness he said all you should do is keep your place in the shield wall the rest is madness the moment you lunge the enemy to your right plunges his spear in your thigh or your neck every attack you make leaves your shield side uncovered he shook his head calchas must stop teaching you this nonsense he is a great warrior i said hotly pater looked at me as if really noticing me for the first time there are no great warriors pater said there are great craftsmen great sculptors great poets sometimes they must put a spear on their shoulder but nothing about war is great pater looked across the valley towards the shrine your teacher is a broken man who keeps a shrine about which no man cares a whit he teaches boys to read and he nurses old hatreds i think that it is time i brought you home many men care about the shrine i said there were tears in my eyes pater dusted his hands come he said we walked to the shrine i argued and pater was silent when we arrived pater ordered me to collect my things and he went and spoke to calchas alone i still know nothing of what they said to each other but i never saw a frown or a harsh word i collected my javelins my spear deer killer my scrolls and my bedroll i put them on the donkey and went to kiss calchas goodbye he embraced me time for you to go out into the world he said your father is right and i have probably filled your head with nonsense i knew that he would be drunk before we walked to the base of the mountain but i smiled and kissed him on the lips which i had never done on the way down the path i stopped he will die without me i said i was eleven going on twelve and the world was much less of a mystery to me than it had been by leaving i am killing him pater embraced me i think it is the only embrace that i remember he held me for a long time finally he said he is killing himself you have your own life to lead we walked home pater silent me crying i went back to working the forge although i now lagged far behind my brother i read to my mother who fussed over my hands and bellowed abuse at pater about how his noble son was being forced to peasant work pater ignored her i lose track of time here i think it was the same summer as i left calchas but it might have been the next they were golden summers and the wealth of plataea came in with the grain we sold much of our grain in the markets of attica and now that we were the richest peasants in boeotia our fathers plotted how to spend our wealth on the greatest daidala in history men came to the yard of the smithy and leaned against the new sheds or sat on the stools that now littered the yard drank paters excellent wine served by a pair of pretty slaves and planned the daidala there was no other discussion that summer for the next spring was the moment when we would watch the ravens on the hillside choose our tree and set in motion all the traditions and customs and dances and rituals that would lead us to a successful festival a festival that would cause other men across boeotia to envy our wealth and curse us or rather that was the plan for before the summer was old enough for the barley to lose its green the word came to our valley that the men of thebes were preparing the great daidala and had ordained that plataea was but a community of thebes and not a free city whats more thebes had voted a great tax to be placed on us to support the festival i had missed two years of talk in the courtyard but little had changed the speakers wore a better quality of cloth but they were the same men solid men who were a little richer but had no toleration for fools myron was not the richest but he tended to speak for paters friends in the assembly and there was talk of making him archon instead of the old basileus the old basileus was now poorer than pater the world was turning on its head the word of the theban tax goaded them even more than the word that we would not host the festival peasants hate it when other men take their money i know that hate steal the money of a slave and look at his eyes that is the look of a peasant who is taxed simon had joined the men in the yard i wasnt there when he moved back into our lives it seems odd after all that happened but peasants quarrel as much as aristocrats and then settle their differences or simply move on simon came back and i continued to hate him but pater treated him with courtesy and all was well it was simon who said the words on everybodys mind we should fight simon said every man in the yard sipped his wine and nodded we should ask the spartans for an alliance draco said epictetus the younger spent more time in the yard than he should have but he was rich enough already that slaves did all the farm work for him and he wandered about with a body slave like a lord it made his father frown but his farm ran well enough and he was growing into a big man who spoke well and would fight in the front rank he stood up we should offer alliance to athens he said miltiades is a friend of every man here draco shook his head miltiades is our friend but hes almost an exile this year they refused to let his ships land last autumn men say hell make himself tyrant of athens hes no help to us besides and draco looked around as if expecting enemies to leap from behind the forge sparta is ready to make war on thebes once we take it to the assembly thebes will know what we are about myron said pater stood forward i remember him from that afternoon how dignified he was and how proud i was that he was my father he looked around the circle of men what if we decide on a thing here in this yard he said and then myron travels around and talks quietly to other men of substance he paused and fell silent he was never a man for big talk myron nodded we might call it something different we might call it the salt tax it took a moment to explain to draco who could be slow and to my brother who had no notion of the duplicity an assembly could practise but thats what they did they called the alliance with sparta the salt tax and myron went from oikia to oikia around the whole polis so that when they went to the assembly where the thebans waited and voted for a salt tax the thebans were suspicious but nothing could be proven then the farmers sent draco myron and theron son of xenon one of our richest men and he sold his leather armor as far away as peloponnese his son began to wear spartan shoes and myrons son began to puff out his chest and speak of buying himself a horse epictetus came by and frowned we owe miltiades better than this he said we should send him word pater shrugged he is an exile in a barbarian land he said epictetus looked around the yard his money bought everything here send word to your son then pater said miltiades has a factor at corinth i have a shipment of armour for him ill send word to him but draco has the right of it miltiades is our friend and our benefactor but he has no power in boeotia uhh epictetus grunted pater sent my brother with the armour to corinth he came back with some fine pottery and a new donkey and a small pile of silver coins he was proud of himself hed been far from home over the mountains and returned without incident pater nodded and sent him back to the forge i suppose it was a form of compliment that pater always assumed that we would succeed at anything he assigned us but an actual compliment would have gone a long way the message must have carried though because just after the feast of demeter the great man himself came up the lane riding another magnificent horse he wore a golden fillet in his hair and he looked even more like a god the thing that made him stand out to me this time was that i could see hed been trained the same way i had i could see it in how he stood and how he walked i still did the exercises that calchas had taught and twice id gone deer hunting alone and once killed a deer id taken calchas wine he ruffled my hair and said little i left offerings at the shrine when he wasnt there or perhaps he was there lying drunk on his pallet and waiting for me to go away at any rate miltiades came and stayed the night and pater invited epictetus along with myrons son dionysius and my brother i was too young for the andron but i served the wine they spoke of politics about athens and sparta and thebes our friend draco has it wrong miltiades said sparta is not going to make war on thebes sparta is making an alliance with thebes to isolate athens i thought that the redhaired man was angry but hiding it well dionysius was braver or more foolish than the older men what do you care sir he asked athens has exiled you miltiades leaned back on his kline i was filling his cup and he put a hand on my hip you fill out well boy he said who taught you to move like a gymnast you make the other boys look like farm workers i froze i knew that touch pater laughed hes as much a farm worker as the rest he said and miltiades laughed with them aristocrat that he was then he shrugged city politics cant be so different in plataea and athens he said im an exile but i will always be a man of the city i have a settlement of my own and colonists every man of whom is a citizen somewhere else by the gods i have some of your own young men and we are still loyal to our homes would you want me to convince your sons to be my citizens rather than plataeans they nodded we all understood him so i watch out for the good of athens he went on athens needs plataea plataea needs athens sparta will take your alliance and later hell shove it up your arse his crudity hit them hard he was a brilliant speaker capable of using all words big and small rough and elegant and he could modify his text to his audience a wonderful talent but most of all he was a charismatic man later i saw him in an assembly of thousands and his words carried an army at close quarters he was as deadly in argument as he was in combat epictetus frowned what do we do lord we did not seek to displease you miltiades shook his head my fault for not voicing my desire openly i shouldnt have made you guess im not usually so coy i want this alliance i want plataea welded to athens with bonds of bronze and iron he grinned his infectious grin well well see your embassy will be back soon enough doubtless the spartans will accept and shaft you later but perhaps i can speak sense into you before that he laughed ill go and visit the old soldier on the hill calchas do you know him pater glanced at me he was my sons tutor he said miltiades gave me an appraising glance really old calchas took you on what did he teach you reading pater said quickly hunting i said before i knew what i was saying pater frowned but miltiades smiled you hunt take me in the morning lad well have a fine time he is my son my father said carefully i understand miltiades answered we went up the mountain together i rode his horse my arms around his waist and a bundle of javelins in my fists i showed him my prize spear and he looked it over carefully and admitted that it was a fine one for a lad my age i realized that i was striving for his approbation with every breath i never wondered why his slave had stayed on the farm or why he didnt lend me his slaves horse although in truth i probably couldnt have ridden her it took us less than an hour to cross the valley and mount the slopes to the shrine we rode into the green meadow and dismounted i ran to the door of the hut but calchas didnt answer my knock the sun was just rising and miltiades was fully active he was never a sluggard even with a skinful of wine he had a fine canteen covered in leather and he spilled a libation to the hero then he tethered his horse and we went up the trails behind the tomb at a run he was in magnificent shape ive seldom seen a man with a better command of his body and we ran six or seven stades without stopping until we were high in the oak forest i thought we might catch up with the old bastard lord miltiades said he was scarcely panting no tracks on the trail i said i was breathing hard again the lord looked at me carefully good eye he said can you find me a buck lad so we moved quietly across the mountainside it took me an hour to get the spoor of an animal and another hour the sun was getting too high to put the small buck between us i charged it yelling hard and it broke away from me running for its life right at the athenian but i hadnt seen the other buck he was a magnificent animal as big as a small horse and in autumn hed have carried a rack of antlers big enough to sell even in high summer he had started his horns he rose out of a tangle of brush crashed shoulder to shoulder with the younger buck spilling him and saving his life and sprang his leap was so high and so hard that miltiades stood with his mouth open his javelin cocked and forgotten in his hand as the buck sailed over his head we didnt touch either animal miltiades slapped me on the back you can stalk he said not your fault i missed my throw boy and what an animal artemis held my hand i felt her cool fingers on my wrist i swear that beast must be her special love we walked down the mountain together the sun was too high to try again i potted a rabbit foolish enough to sit in the middle of the trail eating a leaf and miltiades praised my throw sweet praise such as i never received at home yet he was not just a flatterer he made me throw for him six or seven times and he adjusted my body each time correcting my tendency to advance my right foot too much and there was none of the urgency to his touch that id felt with calchas he taught well and when he threw his own spear a heavy longche that i would be hardpressed to toss across the meadow he threw it as zeus on high throws a bolt of lightning i was worshipping him by the time we returned to calchass hut and the shrine i wanted to see him miltiades said ill fetch him out i said bold as brass lord he may be a little drunk miltiades laughed you fetch him out of there he said ill sober him up or give him some decent wine better than the piss you peasants drink it was the first time id heard miltiades speak ill of us he could only guard his tongue so long ah listen honey he was not a bad man as powerful men go he saved greece he was good to me but he was used to the finest horses the most beautiful women it was our foolishness that made us think he was happy to drink sour wine with peasants in boeotia i climbed in through the window of horn id done it dozens of times once to steal the bow i told you that story as soon as i got it open the stick id whittled to prise the window open was still leaning where id left it flies came out buzzing like some evil thing in canaan men call the lord of the dead the lord of the flies it was just like that as if all the flies made a single creature and moved with one will i dropped from the sill into the room and it smelled of old leather and bad food at first i thought he had gone leaving a rotten haunch of venison and an old brown cloak on the deers carcass in the middle of the floor but of course he was there the details came to me one at a time although i think i understood as soon as the flies buzzed past me in the window the odd shaft of light over the deer carcass was shining on the sword the sword was stuck hilt first into the floorboards there was no deer carcass calchas had wedged his sword into the floor and fallen on it he had done it so long before that the brown cloak was just his hair and the last of his skin over his bones how long since i had crossed the valley and left a sacrifice at the tomb how many times had i come when he already lay here dead i wonder in a way if i had already known because i had said my goodbyes and i didnt weep i went to the door unbarred it and found the bronzeshod shovel pater had made for him with his athletes pick i carried them out into the yard and went straight to the tomb miltiades called something but i didnt listen instead i began to dig i didnt see miltiades go to the hut but i know that before the sun rose much higher he was at my side his lords hands digging in the earth with mine we did a proper job not much to burn miltiades said when i began to pile up the winters supply of wood in the yard it was old wood and a little rotten he hadnt cut more nor had he burned much last winter this was the wood i had cut while training i piled it high i was tempted to burn the cottage but i knew that another man would come to mind the tomb why ruin it for him then i went in and spread my cloak on the floor i lifted his corpse and put it gently on the good wool some pieces of him fell away i was not squeamish i filled my cloak and carried him into the yard i put copper coins in the empty sockets of his skull and set the bag of my cloak and his bones on top of the woodpile then miltiades got a flame going with his fire kit he was a great warrior miltiades said twice he saved my life in the haze of battle once he saved my ship and he could sing poetry like a bard he was a gentleman like the heroes of old may his shade go with theirs to the island of the blessed for he was all the old virtues together in one man then i wept i said a few halting words and the flames rushed up and consumed him but he lives in my words honey honour him he made me in a way he made you because he put the skill of arms in me and because of him i am not dead his death was the beginning of everything that went wrong miltiades and i went back home you might think that id have shouted at pater but i didnt pater knew that is he knew when we were riding away the day he took me from calchas he knew what would happen and he told the truth we didnt kill him we were like a sword left lying in a tavern and then used in a murder we were the instruments of his death i think some of calchas passed through the skin of my hands and into my heart i think i became a man while i carried his body light as dried bone out to the yard to burn him on his pyre is that just memory playing tricks mater had never met him but she wept for him nonetheless odd in a way he had no use for women and yet a woman who had never known him mourned him somehow it was fitting we kept a threeday vigil at our home as if hed been family and miltiades joined in or led us and that bound him to us even more and us to him he sat with mater and read to her and told her she was beautiful she drank a little and flirted harmlessly then draco and theron came back riding donkeys they came into the yard failure written on their bodies like words on papyrus draco dismounted first and he didnt meet miltiades eyes but told the story simply and quickly the spartans had derided the three of them called them peasants and rebels and told them to take their petty attempts at democracy to athens where such things are welcome draco wasnt a broken man but he was changed by the experience he was used to being taken seriously and hed been treated like a boor and a dolt he complained long and hard indeed for the rest of his life he complained of the treatment he received in sparta myron came later he complained less but his resentment was hotter perhaps as a farmer and not a craftsman and as a member of an old family that claimed descent from the gods he actually thought of himself as an aristocrat anything is possible but the insults of the spartans made his blood boil the difference was that he never spoke of it again neither did theron for other reasons as you shall see epictetus followed and then the archon himself he had a horse although it looked like a sorry beast beside the fine mounts miltiades had brought mater wanted to know who had arrived and i went up to the womens quarters to tell her your father is about to find out why a man like miltiades has cooled his heels for five days in our house she said will you grow to be a man like him like miltiades or just another good craftsman like your father poor man i led him to this i couldnt just be the wife of a smith and now were about to be part of a political game she gulped wine i should fall on a sword like your teacher he knew what he was about i sighed and left her i served the wine that night when they decided to send the salt tax to athens miltiades sent his slave with them and stayed with us well over the border from his home city we didnt have to wait long the events of that summer were like one of the storms that roll down the valleys of boeotia first you see the storm the black clouds rising like the strongest towers spiralling up over the mountains and then you hear the thunder and when the thunder comes honey you run or you get wet at first it seems very far away a murmur on the far horizon and perhaps a prayer to the storm god then before you know it unless you are in the barn or house youll be wet through your cloak and chiton in an instant as the lightning flashes every few heartbeats and crashes to earth sometimes all around you and the wind rips branches from the trees and the end of the world seems just one bolt away when the men of plataea sent myron to athens the storm was still a tower of darkness on the horizon and we were blinded by our own desires but the desires of men are nothing when the gods send a storm the first drops of rain were falling and only miltiades knew how big the storm was and he didnt tell us athens sent a deputation back in a week riding on horses over the trade road they brought a decree welcoming miltiades back and they brought us a treaty the men of plataea signed the treaty promising to stand by athens and athens promised the same the men of the city went to the temple of hera and swore together in the sacred precincts pater went and my brother i was too young it was a magnificent summer i remember them coming back from the temple all the men of our valley in their long clothes chitons and the big cloaks we wore then they made a beautiful procession i thought that this must be how the king of persia looked the sun was high and the sky had the magnificent blue that is so hard to remember on a rainy day like this we were all proud that athens wanted us and the men from athens acted as if we were men of worth i remember that time as happy perhaps it is just by contrast with what came after the men of athens went home and miltiades went with them pater went back to work on an order for spear points draco went up the mountain with both his sons to cut oak for wheel rims myron went home to watch his slaves reap his barley i began to form my first cup it wasnt going badly when the athenian herald rode up the valley summoning us to war two weeks thats how long we had before the storm broke i never doubted that i would go with the men i went as a shieldbearer of course a hypaspist i was too young to fight as a hoplite these days men take slaves but in those days it was more acceptable to take boys just short of manhood to carry your equipment hermogenes went for his father and i went for my brother my father took a slave we never thought to refuse the athenians and aside from my mother who wept and railed against the fates there were few who saw how completely the athenians had duped us they were not saving us we were marching to protect them but no one said so we took less than a week to muster we might have mustered faster but our farmers needed to get their crops in it was already known in the polis that thebes intended revenge that we were viewed as rebels they might come and burn our crops if we didnt bring them in it was bad enough leaving grapes on the vines and olives on the trees i have no idea whether any man suggested that we either forget our alliance with athens or simply send a minimum of men we were proud peasants and we sent the whole of our muster over the mountains men like myron worked like slaves to get their harvest in i remember working in the fields with hermogenes and our slaves already feeling like a man at war i drank wine with the men in the evening and hoped that they would present me with an aspis and put me in the taxis farmers freed slaves to fill out the ranks but i was not invited we went across the mountains after the feast of demeter we marched up the same road that passed the shrine and every man in the ranks touched the tomb and i thought of calchas wed heard that the spartans and all their peloponnesian allies had marched around the south end of the mountain and entered attica boys like me feared that we would be too late war is something a man should want to be late for we crossed into attica and the spartans were sitting across the stream from the tower at oinoe a fortification the tyrants of athens had built against this very kind of war of course sparta had been an enemy of tyranny but when the spartans saw how strong the new athens was going to be they became enemies of democracy as well nation states are always that way honey they have no more morality than a whore in the piraeus looking to score some wine anything to get what they want ares how we feared the spartans cleomenes their king a famous man had with him only a thousand spartiates the spartan citizens and there were six thousand athenian citizens but he made up the numbers with allies cities of the peloponnese that had to fight when sparta said fight and how the athenians cheered us although we brought just a thousand hoplites they gave us the honour of the left end of the line the position of highest honour is the right flank if the right gives way an army is done dead miltiades father also called miltiades held the right of the line with the senior tribes of athens they looked magnificent with cloaks of tapestrywoven wool and the whole front rank had bronze breastplates like heroes every man had a horsehair plume in his helmet they made us look like farmers hah we were farmers half our men had leather caps only the front rank had helmets and half of them were openfaced war hats my father was one of only a dozen fighters with bronze panoply and not all our front rank even had leather to cover their bodies a couple of men wore felt hermogenes and i were psiloi that meant that we were to run close to the enemy throw rocks at them and goad them into action sometimes psiloi just yelled insults it was all rather like something religious psiloi rarely harmed anyone i had six good javelins quite a few for a boy my age but then none of the others slave or free had spent two years on the mountain hunting deer i gave three to hermogenes myrons youngest son callicles was our leader he was a year older than me and bossy i was used to my brother who would listen to any argument i made and judge it on its merits slow and careful and totally solid my brother callicles had none of those qualities my halting attempts to tell him that i knew a lot more about this game than he did led to him putting an elbow in my nose he caught me by surprise and had me on the ground in an instant i broke free before he could hurt me but i chose to obey we camped for two days watching the spartans the alignment meant that if we fought wed be the ones facing the spartiates theyd be on the right of their line and wed be on the left or ours there was some talk but none of the men had much time for us boys except my brother he told me how scared he was i feel like im going to die he said im cold all the time im going to be a coward and i hate it i hugged him youll be brave i told him just dont be too brave i grinned and gave him calchass advice which must have sounded foolish from a beardless boy stay in the shield wall and dont let anyone over your shield i said he laughed at me despite his fear im in the sixth rank he said safer than we are in a storm at home he laughed but then he was serious were going to form deep to slow the spartans down he said pater says if we form a dozen deep well stand longer it sounded like sense to me still does in those days honey men didnt fight as they do today well the spartans did they were orderly and careful but most men didnt even form a proper phalanx with ranks and files something every city does today no back then we were still like the war bands of the lords in the iliad men would cluster around the leaders like trees around a spring and if a leader died all his men would run but my father paid attention to things he saw and heard and it was he who had suggested that the men of plataea should each have a place a rank and a file and should practise in those places the way the spartans and the best of the thebans did their apobatai the elite fighters who had once been the charioteers and now pater had ordered them to fight in a very deep order in those days twelve deep was twice as deep as most men fought but i digress as usual i could tell that my brother was afraid i wasnt afraid i thought that it would be like deer hunting i imagined that id run around the flank of their line and throw my javelins into this packed mass killing a spartiate with every cast calchas had told me the truth about war but my ears had been closed it may sound odd to you but i took quite a shine to young callicles he was arrogant but he was older and that matters to peasants and when he saw how far i could throw a javelin he only had one he treated me differently in an afternoon of rock and javelinthrowing on the height beside the tower i became his second man his phylarch and we copied our elders speaking at length about our tactics as boys will we made the other boys do as we did and we practised running and jumping and throwing javelins and rocks most boys merely had rocks the slaves hung back fair enough it wasnt their fight those who had been freed had everything to gain by fighting well but those who were still slaves had no interest in the fight at all they sat around until we yelled at them and then the older ones were slow and so obviously unwilling that they poisoned our confidence these men were masters of avoiding work and a couple of teenaged boys were nothing to them these were men who were used to dealing with the wrath of pater or epictetus the elder by the third day it looked to all of us as if there would be no fight and the athenians heaped praise on us just by coming wed given the peloponnesians pause now they were outnumbered and it appeared theyd expected the thebans to join them but the thebans werent there yet or werent coming at all ill have a lot to say about war honey i may put you to sleep with it for a month while i weary you with my story and one thing ill say a thousand times is that every army has its own heart its own soul its own eyes and its own ears in that army that peloponnesian army they didnt really want to be in attica they were all too aware that the spartans were only there to support their alliance with thebes and the spartans as was their way had shown their lack of interest by sending only a token force under the junior king as they did again later against the medes never trust a spartan honey anyway they should have known that the bloody thebans were coming they were a hundred stades away or less ares must have laughed cleomenes finally committed to fight because the peloponnesians were starting to leave him allies were freer in those days they told the king of sparta what they thought and then they marched away not many of them but enough to make old cleomenes decide to fight before he had no army at all we knew that the thebans were coming it was said around every fire the athenians and all the farmers of attica they had farmers too were already looking over their shoulders and doubting the new leaders that theyd elected but miltiades and his father were everywhere even among us putting bars of iron into the spines of every man miltiades even came and watched our boys practising he praised my javelin throw and an hour later his slave came and gave me a pair of spears with blued steel heads even now the memory of them makes me smile they were fine weapons i thought my spear deer killer was a fine weapon it had a bronze head made by pater with its name engraved on the spine but it was crude next to these with their red hafts and their blueblack heads i kept deer killer and the gifts and gave my other javelins to other boys callicles took the best and gave his own to the poorest three javelins for the richest boys a hemp sack full of rocks for the poorest what fools we were and our fathers were being matched against the red cloaks of sparta the day dawned i slept well enough unlike my father my brother and most of the other plataeans the heralds had been exchanged the night before by the time we ate our barley porridge miltiades the elder had made his sacrifices he found them auspicious im sure they were auspicious for athens i had never seen a phalanx form pater was one of the chief officers of the plataeans and he walked up and down forming men into their place in the ranks his black and red double crests nodding as he walked and he looked as noble and as deadly as any spartiate i marvelled at his performance he knew who was steady and who had nerves and he placed them as gently as possible avoiding any form of insult i was proud that he was my father still am i saw that cousin simon was in the sixth rank what fool of a polemarch had ever put him in the front for the last battle he was green already in the middle hed be safe and he wouldnt hurt anyone then i saw that he was one man to the right of my brother chalkidis looked worried but he waved he was the only man in the sixth rank who had greaves and a fine helmet thats what you get when you are a bronzesmith and the son of a bronzesmith he had his helmet tipped back on his head the way you see the goddess athena in her statues and he managed a solid smile for me i pushed through the ranks and hugged him leather cuirass and all i was jealous but he looked magnificent and he was still a head taller than me and suddenly all i wanted was for him to succeed and be a hero and when we were done embracing i hurried to the roadside shrine and poured a little of paters honeyed wine on the statue of the lady and prayed that he would be brave and succeed in battle i had no doubts that hed be brave before my first battle story is told i think i have to speak about courage honey are you brave you dont know but i do youre brave and when its your turn to face the womans version of the bronze storm when a child comes from between your knees into the world you may scream and you may be afraid but youll do it youll get it done no one expects you to like it but all your friends all the womenfolk whove borne their own children theyll crowd around you wiping your brow and telling you to push its the same for men no one is brave no one really deep down wants to be achilles what we all want is to live and to be brave enough to tell our story and older men whove done it before will call out and tell the younger men to push the thing is hardly anyone is such a coward as to stand out you are there with the whole community around you courage is asking a girl to marry you alone against her parents courage is standing before the assembly and telling them theyre a pack of fools courage is fighting when no one will ever see your courage but when the phalanx is locked together its hard to be a coward fucking simon he was no coward in other ways but when the phalanx formed he lost his wits gods how i still hate him our phalanx looked a poor thing next to the athenians they had blue and purple and bright red and blinding white and we had all the homespun colours of peasants pater had a good cloak and so did a dozen men all miltiades friends the son of the basileuss sister looked as good as the athenians the rest even some of the better men looked drab and dun we formed our boys in a thin line in front of our fathers we saw the athenian psiloi they were a poor show compared to us all slaves and half of them didnt even have rocks so we joked that there was one thing we did better than the men of athens we were still forming when the spartan helots came across the ground at us they had rocks in bags and they threw hard i caught one on my shin and i fell that was the glory of war just like that the first rock and i was down two or three of us fell and the rest of the boys ran like deer on the mountain i hadnt even had time to think about how i might be a hero i hadnt even thrown a spear but my pater was right there so close i could almost touch him and i was not going to run besides as i got up i found that i couldnt my shin hurt too much and there was blood the helots were almost close enough to touch too in fact two of them had just begun to lob rocks at our phalanx they ignored me i killed the one closest to me deer killer knocked him flat just as she had done a dozen times to deer that got their attention a rock came so close that it brushed my ear like the whisper of a god telling me that i was mortal i planted my feet ignoring my shin and a beautiful bluetipped spear killed a second helot they died this is no boyish boast we were as close as your couch and mine honey and i threw to kill they broke they were slaves and like our slaves they had nothing to gain from bravery they didnt even care about avenging their comrades slaves have no comrades they turned and fled as our boys had just moments before thats when i learned that calchas had come into my body when i burned his corpse because when they fled i killed another i liked it i cocked back my arm and threw my spear into the back of a fleeing slave and i liked it then i hobbled forward and retrieved my javelins behind me the leftmost athenians and the rightmost plataeans were cheering they were cheering me it went to my head like unwatered wine the other boys came back fast enough they werent cowards they just hadnt understood the game we still didnt understand callicles slapped my back and we ran forward together i tried to angle across the spartan front because i knew wed be safer on the flank but i was slowed by my shin when i looked up the spartans terrified me its not like being in the phalanx out there in the middle between the armies and the spartans they all look the same with matching shields of bronze like the richest athenians and with almost identical helmets i actually wondered who made all those helmets they looked very fine and they scared me but i couldnt flinch now although a curious reaction hit me i still remember it i felt cold as i hobbled forward and i began to shake then the other boys began to throw we were too far away and callicles started to yell like a real officer pushing them forward he turned his back on the spartans and yelled at us to come on come on throw from closer i was near him when i saw the spartan fileleader call an order and four hoplites burst out of the front of the shield wall they came so fast they were like javelins themselves they were all athletes in high training of course not boys i knew from the first long leg kicking that they were faster than i was when i wasnt injured there were only four of them against thirty of us callicles died first the fastest spartan singled him out i remember that the spartan had a smile on his face under the helmet i screamed at callicles to run but the fool stood his ground and threw my secondbest spear and the spartan ducked his head and it passed him he never even slowed and his long doru went into callicles above the groin and drove out of his back like some wicked growth and then there was an explosion of blood front and back id seen it a hundred times hunting callicles was a dead boy all four of them killed a boy like farmers cutting weeds the leader killed a second boy next to hermogenes hermogenes fell to the ground without being touched and then used his javelin to trip the lead spartan he went down in a clatter of armour but he was up in less time than it takes to tell the sentence yet he was off balance and he was using his shield hand to push himself off the ground calchas had taught me better than that it was my worst throw of the day i was terrified and elated at the same time and my deer killer went into his left arm behind his shield pinning the arm against the shield back and he couldnt get it out the others stopped to help him because he was bellowing and then hermogenes grabbed me and helped me run by all the gods my thugater i thought those were my last moments and when we were clear of the spartans i vowed that i would never ever put my body in front of the phalanx again i vowed it like a drunkard vowing not to drink hermogenes and i got clear of the right flank we had no idea where the other boys were then we lay down in the grass and heaved ares we were alive wait until you bear a child honey youll feel the same rush of eudaimonia unless artemis comes for you avert but when we looked up the spartans were charging they came forward to the music of pipes and all the giants going to war with father zeus couldnt have looked more dangerous or noble the rest of the peloponnesians hesitated and the athenians came forward cautiously but they came on and the plataeans werent cowards they went forward into the spartans the two lines hit each other like well like two phalanxes coming together imagine every cook in this town with every bronze kettle and a wooden spoon flailing away at it imagine every man bellowing with all his might that is the sound of the storm of bronze the battle line hermogenes and i watched from the safety of the far right and we saw what happened when the spartiates hit our fathers they reaped them like wheat thats what happened what made the reputation of plataea was not that our men were great fighters at least not that day what forged our reputation for ever was that our men wouldnt run but hermogenes and i watched men die it was horrible and aweinspiring the two blocks of spearmen crashed into each other at the same speed and not a man flinched spartans tell me that they remember that day well because so few foes withstand the impact yet the men of plataea slammed in aspis to aspis and then the killing started we watched as the helmet plumes in the front rank went down it took only seconds and it seemed as if the whole front rank was gone and then the plataeans gave ground grudgingly but they lost ten steps i think it was pater who stopped it from being a rout pater gave ground but bion says he killed a man a spear thrust to the throat against a spartiate fileleader then he and bion pushed into the gap and bion says they each took a man down no one cares in the heat of a fight whether you kill your man as long as you put him down in that little eddy of the overall whirlpool of plataean defeat the spartans hesitated how often did men push through their front rank i think it was pater i could see the plume on his helmet when the others like myrons were gone and then the fileclosers planted their feet and pushed at the back of the plataean lines and suddenly the plataeans werent moving back they were standing firm but some of the spartans had broken through the front ranks where men were capable and expected to fight soon they were pounding the rear ranks to ruin killing like the machines that they were a few men broke from the rear of our phalanx and ran and simon must have been one of them but elsewhere our neighbours closed their files and shocked the spartans whod broken their ranks crushing them like insects stabbing them front and rear theres a reason why breaking ranks is punishable by law and a reason why veterans call it foolish the spartans thought that wed break but we didnt and their young men died who knows how long the men of plataea would have held the spartans another fifty heartbeats perhaps perhaps less the spartans were going to win the miracle of ares is that our men stood their ground at all they held for the time a goat takes to birth a kid the time it takes a smith to make a sheet into a bowl with a few quick blows of skill but the peloponnesians didnt know any of this what they saw was that the athenians outnumbered them and that their precious masters were being held up by a bunch of farmers from boeotia the allies broke like songbirds faced with an eagle they broke before the athenians even hit them they ran before the spears crossed and not one of them stood the spartan king cursed no doubt and then backed his phalanx away step by step unbeaten virtually victorious but they backed away and the plataeans had just barely clung to their formation from where we stood hermogenes and i knew that more men had started to flee from the back of our deep block but enough stood to hold on just barely plataea was never the same no one cheered ive been on a hundred fields honey ive won against the odds and seen black defeat but thats the only time ive seen men so shattered by victory that they couldnt cheer nor did they pursue the men of plataea shifted and recovered their ranks because they were good men and then they stood silent awed by their own success then some of the fallen began to stand up myron got to his feet bleeding from a thigh the red coming in little spurts where something big had been cut let me tell you how it is in the line honey when you go down and you can fall just because you lose your balance why then you wont ever get up in that fight against honourable men if you stay down and pull your shield over your body no one will kill you just for sport maybe they will strip your armour if they win but no one will kill you you hope anyway myron stood and began to sing he sang the ravens of apollo from the daidala and all the voices of plataea took it up boys and men we all knew it it was an odd song for a battlefield the song men sing while they wait for the ravens to pick us a tree to make the statue of the fake bride who knows why myron chose that song across the field the athenians were slowing theyd never reached the peloponnesians and now ranks untouched they were coming to a halt and heads were turning to look at us just two stades away the spartans halted in perfect order covering their camp the plataeans kept singing then cleomenes made a mistake he didnt trust the thebans and his peleponnesian allies were running all the way back to their homes and the plataean farmers were singing as if they could stop the spartans every day for ever that song had more effect on the battle than paters stand honey that song was defiance of a different sort whether it was true or not the ravens of apollo told cleomenes that there were men opposing him who would not flinch if he came on again and if we held him for a hundred heartbeats then all the hoplites in attica would be in his flank cleomenes sent a herald he requested a truce to collect his dead by our law of war this ended the battle and allowed the defeated free passage home and it meant that whatever the thebans might do the spartans were done what changed our world was that cleomones sent the herald to us rather than to the athenians that was respect they knew they were the better men and men who are better are never petty they respect accomplishment and they respected that we tried so their herald came and he walked towards pater pater looked around but the archon was dead and myron who had started the song was down again sitting on a rock supported by his sons pater had two wounds on his sword arm i had his helmet under my arm and he was pouring his canteen over his head hey bion called hey look sharp technes the herald is coming pater looked up and there was the spartan resplendent in his scarlet cloak with a heavy bronze staff to show his status he bowed pater returned his bow head dripping water i remember how the water from his canteen mixed with the blood on his hands and arms cleomenes king of sparta requests your permission to retrieve and bury his dead the herald intoned pater didnt smile i did i was wearing a smile as big a wolfs hermogenes had his fathers aspis on his own arm and he was grinning like a fool bion was grinning too but pater simply nodded our archon is dead and our polemarch is badly wounded pater turned to the plataeans am i in command he asked again there was no cheer just a soft grumble but every man in the first two ranks nodded so pater turned back to the herald the plataeans grant the truce he said no mention of himself or his own name oh he made me proud and with those words the battle of oinoe came to an end the athenians killed a hundred peloponnesians more or less the slow ones i assume since the peloponnesian allies didnt linger to fight they put up a magnificent trophy on the acropolis a chariot and a set of slave fetters to celebrate their victory over the spartans the medes later pulled it down and took the bronze but the base is still there with eight lines of verse they dont mention us but on the day they treated us like heroes come to earth miltiades ran up his plume nodding and embraced pater and then every man he could find his investment had paid off men began to trickle off the ground we had our dead to bury and the spartan helots were coming for their own we had fortyfive dead seven of them died in the week after the battle so on that morning we had thirtyeight bodies and one of them was my brother he lay with his face to the enemy a spartan spear in his right side under his sword arm he fell clutching the spear and the other fifth and sixthrankers brought the spartan down and killed him because my brother held that spear point with his dying hands i wept pater wept bion and hermogenes wept and myron and dionysius wept we all cried the spartans had nine dead two more died later so we lost fortyfive to their eleven if you want to understand the heart of phalanx fighting honey and i can see you dont you need to see that pater killed three of those spartans and that our whole thousand lived or died by the actions of a few valiant men myron didnt give a foot of ground bion followed pater into the hole pater made epictetus and his son gave ground but then they locked their shields with men in the second rank and held the rush and dionysius killed a spartan in the fifth rank when they broke through take away any of those actions and the result is different karpos our best potter died and theron son of xenon who made all the harnesses and wineskins and much of the armor the men wore pater said he was the first to die a spartan spear in his throat at the first contact and he didnt live to see cleomenes come to us for truce after refusing our embassy we buried the dead the boys and the slaves did the work the men sat and drank they had endured the storm of bronze for the time it takes a man to run the stadion and they were exhausted that night it rained we were wet and cold but pater came and wrapped his arms and his heavy thracian cloak around me he was still crying but he held me tightly and after a while i slept the rain stopped and i was cooking eggs id purchased a boeotian hatful from a shy girl who had crept into our camp with the dawn i used paters money and his flash of a notquitesmile told me id done right i had a fine bronze patera with the figure of apollo as the handle it wasnt paters work it was his fathers work and the planishing on the pan was like a reminder of greater days if wed lost it would have been loot for a spartan miltiades came to pater with a wagon he had a dozen athenians with him important men with tyrian purple in their cloaks pater was eating a bowl of eggs with a scrap of stale bread technes of plataea all athens mourns your losses miltiades bowed he had a priestess of athena with him and she was dressed even at that hour in the whitest chiton id ever seen with gold thread in the hems bumpkin that i was i couldnt take my eyes off her pater had a mouth full of egg he swallowed his eyes were red from weeping and he wore a damp chitoniskos of linen that had once been off white and neatly pleated and was now grey with age and shapeless there were slaves in our force who dressed better than pater he rose to his feet i was not chosen in the assembly to lead the men of plataea he said formally but until the assembly chooses another i accept your words on behalf of all the men of our city miltiades spread his arms wide it was interesting to watch him be a public man i had only seen him at close range he was about twentyfive then just coming into his powers plataea brought one eighth of the force we had to face the peloponnesians miltiades said we offer plataea one quarter of all that we took with our spears and we call you the bravest of the allies the wind ruffled their cloaks pater said nothing but the men of plataea behind him were gathering and they began to shout approval almost a cheer then the priestess stepped forward and she chanted a prayer to the lady and all the men present joined her then she purified us for killing she was good her voice was gentle and firm and every man felt better for her words and the spirit of the goddess that we call the lady and athenians call athena was on all of us miltiades invited pater and myron to attend him at a meeting of the commanders i found pater my best chlamys and i put it on him with a gold pin from the loot pater was above such things but myron gave me a nod of approval no one wanted pater to look like a ragman in front of the athenians the two of them came back before the sun was high and their faces were strained and pater had black marks in the corners of his eyes pater ignored my questions and sent me and hermogenes and every other boy we could find to assemble all the plataeans there were only a thousand hoplites and another thousand boys and slaves we assembled before the birds stopped singing we were on the hilltop by the old fort and pater and myron carried spears as if they jointly were speakers pater nodded at myron and myron held up his spear men of plataea he said he was leatherpale hed lost quite a bit of blood and he walked carefully where the athenian doctor had burned the wound near his groin he might have been a walking dead man if the deadly archer willed it but myron had the courage that allows a man to go about his business even with a wound the archon died serving the city we have no new archon and we have no strategos who cares someone called lets go home we can debate in the assembly men of plataea myron said his voice was quiet but men were silent to listen to him the army of thebes is a days march away and the men of athens call on us to stay and fight that was greeted with a wave of grumbles and muttering pater stood forth he held up his own spear dont be fools he shouted we fight them tomorrow with athens by our side or we face them in a month at home alone that shut them up then pater nodded we stopped sparta he said what has thebes got now they cheered everyone hated thebes sparta was a noble and scary monster from travellers tales but thebes was the familiar enemy myron pointed at pater i move that technes of the corvaxae be strategos they didnt roar pater had none of the magnetism that can make men love you but every hand went in the air myron nodded to pater pater pointed his spear at myron i move that myron of the house of heracles be archon of the plataeans until we stand in the assembly and so it was done before the day was another hour older the shieldbearers were packing we had donkeys now dozens as part of the spoils of the peloponnesian camp i was trying to figure out a foreign pack frame on a stubborn beast when paters hand fell on my shoulder take your brothers armour he said and take hermogenes as your shieldbearer you will stand with the men tomorrow no more playing with the boys and just like that i was a hoplite we marched east across attica and the thebans retired before us confused by this turn of events i sweated in my brothers armour and pater adjusted it at an attic forge borrowing tools to change the waist of my brothers bell corslet and the pinch of his greaves his helmet fitted me very well pater wept while he worked by the third day we thought that the thebans would melt away and then we had word that there was yet another army coming from euboea the euboeans hated athens truth to tell athens is arrogant and most cities hate her then miltiades father showed why he was a strategos to be reckoned with he woke us four hours before dawn and we left our fires burning and the slaves and boys to watch them and we marched east and then north men who travelled said we were somewhere near tanagra i only knew that the weight of my dead brothers arms his panoply was the same as the weight of a fiveyearold girl and i was carrying it over a mountain miltiades the elder had a good plan to march around the thebans and catch them napping and force them to fight cut off from the euboeans but the thebans were no fools they had spies and scouts and their slaves probably traded food with our slaves they knew we were coming and they marched in the dark too determined to ambush us on the flanks of mount parnes and as with most battles neither plan bore the least resemblance to the mess that followed plataeans were the left of the army and this meant that we were the rearguard the last men to march crossing the flank of mount parnes on goat tracks we marched in double file two wide it took hours to go a few stades and where i trudged we seemed to stop more than we walked by the luck of tribe and farm i walked next to simon no one had mentioned that he had run from the spartans i didnt even know that he had run only two or three men had broken and while i was pretty sure he was one he wore a plain old helmet with no crest and he had no blazon on the leather face of his shield like most of our men now he walked beside me and we did not talk he was much taller and broader than me indeed i was thirteen and too young to stand the storm of bronze but i think that pater felt that we needed to make up the holes in our phalanx who knows what he thought he never discussed such stuff with me at any rate simon was a head taller and much heavier with muscle and in the dark on the flanks of parnes i learned what he really was his spearbutt flashed in the moon and i ducked and then he used his hip and almost pushed me off the trail and off the mountain calchas dead calchas saved my life roughhousing with a bigger stronger man had taught me many tricks i swayed armour and all and got my feet planted simon kept right on walking and the man in the file behind me cursed that was the first of three times he tried to trip me and once i think he meant to put his spearbutt through my eye but i was wary and after the third time someone in the file we were all neighbours and myrons dionysius was right ahead of me someone said something to our phylarch old epictetus and he trotted back and asked simon what he was doing simon flashed me a smile im just clumsy he said and this boy cant really carry the weight of his panoply epictetus peered at me i had my helmet up on my head and i was sweating like a deer bleeding out i tried to grin too heavy for you he asked no i said simons a bastard epictetus shot him a glare yep he said most of our file laughed watch yourself simon im watching you thats when i think simon decided to kill us right there on the mountain up until then i think he just hated us quietly but i called him a bastard and old epictetus agreed and everyone laughed and the fates spun we were the last miltiades and his tribe were the first and the thebans were waiting in ambush it should have been a disaster theres no better position for a phalanx than catching your opponent strung out over a goat track but the thebans moved late and they were late straggling into their ambush site hoplites dont usually ambush each other maybe they felt unmanly who knows what a theban thinks at any rate they fucked it all up the result was that their men blundered into miltiades in the dark instead of an ambush we had a mob fight in the first light the first i knew was that the files started to move faster and then they stopped and then we could hear it fighting one battle made me an expert but this didnt sound like the fight with the spartans this sounded like chaos come to earth and it was neither side ever got a phalanx formed thats what everyone remembers about the battle of parnes our files and theirs poured into each other in the scrubby broken ground on the northern shoulder of the mountain and the push of men behind kept adding fighters it was so dark that with your face inside your helmet you couldnt be sure of the man on your right or left unless you tapped their shield with your own twice epictetus stopped us without orders and formed our files up close he was doing what he knew how to do forming the block that would keep us safe but both times the path soon narrowed to nothing again and we had to file off an hour after we first heard the fighting exhausted with the fear of waiting and the fatigue of marching we rounded a bend and saw the fight the sun was a red ball on the horizon to the east and we caught glimpses of the sea to the north as the trail climbed and dipped and then the fight was right there a spears throw away i could see paters double plume he was standing still shield against his knees arms crossed the valley was full of men locked in combat and it was a swirl of death because the armies had never formed no man had a front or a back and there was no safety and no shield wall the athenians were begging us to come on come on and still pater looked out over the valley i for one was in no hurry to plunge into that maelstrom and then pater made his decision i could see it in the set of his shoulders and the movement of his back he made his decision and we were moving not down into the battle but across the hillside to the north pater began to run and the files ran after him it might seem a simple thing to lead a thousand men around a battle that is only two stades or so wide one man can run the stade in the time another man sings a song but a thousand men take a hundred times longer or so it seems when the fate of your city rests on the outcome and we were scared honey wed been promised a stratagem and an easy fight and this was chaos and death pater ran north and the files followed him just over the brow of the low hill where you first see the polis at tanagra in the distance he turned west halted and ordered the files to form that was easy hed picked a piece of flat ground and each file ran up directed by their phylarch and paters spear and they halted to the left of the file before them so that in the time it took the sun to rise a fingers breadth the phalanx was formed minus the cowards and the men who couldnt make the run i made it simon didnt i wonder what he might have done had he made it to the front but the run left him behind about sixty men stayed in the rear this always happens so the phylarchs say a few words to the men who make it to the fight and then they close the files suddenly i was in the fourth rank my hand was cold and clammy on deer killer i had a heavy javelin to go with her and thats all i had i had no sword on the other hand i had armour like the best men epictetus put me in the fourth rank because in his opinion i was more fit for combat than the eight men behind me he was right but at the time i thought him a monster for putting me so close to the front i was one file from the far right bion was my fileleader and pater was about a spears length away when we closed our ranks and files in the synaspismos then we sang the paean usually men sing it before they charge but not always i dont know what happened to the paean at oinoe whether i have forgotten it or whether we didnt sing it but i was in the phalanx at parnes and i remember singing roaring my fear out inside the bronze helmet that my brother had died wearing in the closed ranks you are three feet from the men on either side so that the rim of your shield can just touch if you move to tap them something men do all the time as they wait you start a few feet from the men in front and behind but as a fight goes on everything closes in well thats what usually happens you end up in a tightpacked mob that pushes together and sees only with the eyes of the front rank in that fight i had no idea what was happening in front of us from the moment that our files closed up i could see dionysiuss leatherclad back and i could see paters plumes and the rim of my own aspis we pushed forward we marched together to the sound of the paean we had a slight hill behind us and we went down the hill and then our front slammed into the fight friends enemies the front of a phalanx has no allies we went down into the fight and the only sign i had that pater was facing death was an increased pressure on my shield but they melted in front of us i stepped over a man who was down i looked down hard enough in a helmet and saw his eyes peeking over the rim of his shield and the black blood on his legs i let him live and so did everyone else we started to plough through the maelstrom dust rose with the sun and the battle was not ending we pushed forward a step at a time and i was hot and miserable my spear held pointup so that it wouldnt foul the men ahead of me sometimes the man behind me a middleaged farmer from two farms beyond us a bitter man named zotikos pushed too hard and i was sandwiched between the curved front of his aspis and the curved back of my own i was too small for this and it hurt zotikos always apologized to me every time he slammed in sorry kid hed grunt no good at this shit he was pale with fear but he pushed i know now what happened in the front rank but at the time i knew nothing except that pater was alive because i could see his plumes and hear his voice and we should have been winning an easy victory we were the only formed troops on the field and the thebans were outnumbered maybe they were stubborn boeotians just like us maybe the phalanx isnt as important as men think to be honest ive seen unformed mobs stop a phalanx several times only ares knows we pushed forward and our frontrankers stabbed with their spears athenians rallied on our right and thebans melted away and then suddenly we stopped calchas was right it is the killers who are dangerous the rest of war is very like a sport like pushing and pulling and spearfencing all together but when the killers come it is nothing like a sport i dont know who they were a brotherhood some men who had trained together as boys or more likely a band of aristocrats they had good armour and they knew their business perhaps they were mercenaries at any rate they hit our phalanx when we were tired and lazy and confident that nothing would stand against us epictetus went down and as i raised my head to look dionysius took a blow to the helmet and down he went and just like that i was in the front rank facing a killer i had all the time it took him to push past dionysius to see that he was clad from head to foot in bronze with thigh guards and arm guards and knuckle guards like a professional and he had a bronzefaced shield and a heavy spear and a double plume of red you must lock your shield with your neighbours put your head down and refuse to take chances thats what calchas said when you are faced with a killer in the bronze storm there are two things that tempt you one is to run that way lies instant death the time to run has long passed when the man in bronze is at the end of your spear the other temptation is to attack this is a twin child born of the same parent fear you attack to prove to yourself that you are not afraid and because you have no real hope or to get it over with i have seen lesser men kill greater but it doesnt happen often so the second is as hopeless as the first although it makes a better story for your mother because youll be dead calchass way is the way that takes care and time and discipline but as dionysius fell his aspis fouled the killers spear and i got a breath to think i backed one step and shoved my aspis high and hard against the man next to me he was eutykos a young man from a good family later on we were friends and i loved his sister id met her of course at festivals and she was pretty but at thirteen you dont look at girls as much as you should hah so i locked my shield with eutykos and the killers doru crashed into my aspis high he was going for my helmet but i had tucked my head so that only the top of the helmet came above the rim of my aspis he swung again and his doru glanced off my helmet but i had no crest to catch the point and he lost his balance and crashed against me breast to breast old zotikos stood his ground he threw his shoulder against my back and held me against the killers shove bless him and he went one better while the killer rained blows of his spear on my head and aspis zotikos rammed his spear into the killers shield full force i got to breathe eutykos poked at him too on my left straton myrons older son locked his aspis against mine only then did i realize that the voice shrieking lock up was mine now the killer was facing three men six really because none of our followers flinched and the spear points were coming for him locked up and secure we began to kill him i have no idea who got him later my spear point was bloody and the blood dripped down the shaft and over my hand but zotikos also had blood on his and so did straton perhaps we all took him it doesnt matter no man no man born of women can face six steady hoplites even if they are so scared that shit runs down their legs that one fight was the battle for me im sure that other men did great deeds and i am sure that the prize of honour went to miltiades the younger who cut a red swath through the thebans and broke their centre his sword was like a thunderbolt so men said i never saw him by ares i didnt even see pater and i could have touched him with my spear point but i saw the killer and i held my ground still makes me smile honey and then the thebans broke and we ran them down i killed some poor exhausted sod who begged me to spare him but he didnt drop his sword and i was too tired to take a chance hard to tell what was in my head i asked his shade for pardon the next day i think that if hed let the sword go or stopped waving it id have let him live when the pursuit starts the shield wall collapses winner or loser and every man fights on his own eutykos stuck by me but none of the rest of my filemates were anywhere to be seen and we picked up prisoners and fought our last fight in the middle of a thousand screaming attic farmers some brightly armoured aristocrat knocked me flat and another yelled cant you see the yokel is a plataean and they ran off elsewhere we had no dead dionysius was deeply unconscious and he slurred his words for ten days and missed the third fight but he lived to thank me for covering his body thats what his father thought i did and it saved my life later we picked up our wounded and treated them as best we could the athenians had taken it much worse they had hundreds of dead the thebans had more the north end of the valley was carpeted with theban dead we stripped them with gusto their herald came and they made their submission and myron hobbled off pater couldnt even walk he was so tired and on that very spot on the south bank of the asopus the boundaries of free plataea were settled between archons and heralds a deputation of corinthians neutrals and honest men settling the matter and guaranteeing it myron was no fool by settling the borders and not making high demands he ensured that the treaty would last and he ensured that he would be elected archon and by enlisting the arbitration of corinth he won us another ally as i said we stripped their dead our boys and slaves brought the camp up and we loaded carts with theban camp furniture and theban armour pater got quite a bit he was strategos a tribunal met and discussed simon he was not the only man to miss the fight but he was no mans friend and his cowardice was a public disgrace even other men who had missed the fight too tired to keep up they claimed complained about him simon spoke well enough in his own defence and he knew as we all knew that we still had to fight the euboeans so he asked that he be allowed to fight in the front rank the phylarchs discussed it and refused but they put him in the second rank behind bion two men in front of me to earn back the respect of other men after the tribunal pater told me that hed asked that i have that spot and so the gods speak to us thugater if i had stood there well i would be a bronzesmith in boeotia and you would never have been born i was tired after the fight and i slept before the light failed but the next day i was full of energy thats how it is for the young honey you recover fast pater and epictetus and myron took much longer we sent the spoils home over cithaeron and marched east into the rising sun to fight the euboeans it was insane three battles in a week ah you brighten youve heard of the week of three battles eh i was there honey and after the first two the plataeans thought that they were gods and the athenians the same i said that every army has a heart a soul eyes and ears after the thebans that army was as one we were still atticans and boeotians athenians and plataeans but we shared water and wine and jokes not one of us doubted that we would rout the euboeans they were soft their days of greatness were in the past and they had hoped to ride on a chariot of war driven by thebes and sparta now their mighty allies were gone and their army marched back out of boeotia over the bridge at chalcis and stood waiting for us it was just seven days since the spartans had sent their herald to pater when we marched over the bridge around midday we did it well wed been together for two weeks and by greek standards wed become veterans i was in my second fight as a hoplite and my shin still hurt from the rock a week before and i could see simon two places in front of me as we closed our files to the right the euboeans formed very close and stood with their shields overlapping awaiting our charge they didnt come forward and to me at thirteen they didnt look soft at all we marched in easy open order until we were a stones throw away if they had any psiloi they didnt come out neither did ours then we closed we closed by doubling our files from the rear so that seventhrank men became frontrank men the halffile leaders this was the closest order i remained in the fourth rank and zotikos was now in the front he swore and complained and grumbled as we closed and bion told him to keep it clean for the gods and zotikos said something under his breath and older men laughed now we were a spears throw from them we were locked up in the same close order we were on the left and again we were facing the cream of their warriors the men with the best armour the right of their line pater stood clear of our line it was the only time i ever heard him speak before a fight at least for so long were going to walk forward in time to the paean just as we did at parnes and when we hit their shield wall we push straight on use your shoulders their line is thin and they are already afraid we have faced sparta we have nothing to fear here men beat their spears on the face of their shields miltiades came running down the face of the army when he was in front of the leftmost athenians he raised his spear sing he called even as an enterprising euboean threw a spear at him insults were called we ignored them although they were so close we could see faces shield devices bad teeth and good teeth pater started the song and every voice picked it up we sang the first verse standing and then the whole army athenians and plataeans moved forward perhaps our line wasnt perfect but i remember it as perfect and when we were a spears length from the euboeans i knew wed won a veteran at the age of thirteen i knew as surely as if athena sat on one shoulder and ares on the other that the men of euboea would break when our shields hit theirs we must have had a bow in our line because pater and bion hit them a heartbeat before the rest of the line or perhaps the euboean line had a curve in it we hit and the front opened like a door paters helmet flashed in the brilliant noontime sun and his plumes shone like the wings of some godsent bird and we gave a great shout as the aspides clashed and their line broke up the way a pot breaks when dropped on flagstones from a height even as the euboeans broke i saw pater fall i saw the way his head turned and i saw that he fell forward as if pushed and i know now as if i had seen it that simon had stabbed him in the back under his back plate but i couldnt see and battle deprives a man of many of his wits all i thought at the time was that pater was down though the battle was already won pater was down somehow i got my legs on either side of his chest and stood my ground because the euboeans werent beaten their front ranks crumbled but then stiffened much as ours must have done against the spartans and they came back at us like men i saw simon with a short sword in his hand dripping blood he was green his lips were white with fear and his eyes met mine i didnt see it oh ill tell it in its place but thats when the euboeans counterattack struck and i wasnt in the fourth rank any more because i wouldnt give over paters body i had no idea if he was alive or dead but i stood my ground like a fool and then in that moment i found out why old men and poets call it the storm of bronze i got my dead brothers aspis up and the hammering knocked me down over pater i was too small to stand the pressure of ten or fifteen weapons beating against my shield but other plataeans crowded in around me they saw who was down and they were men too they pushed and killed i could smell the copper of blood the heavy waft of excrement that men release when they go down the cardamom and onions theyd eaten for lunch i got a knee under me and pushed my spear under the press and felt the soft yielding resistance of flesh as i cut some poor bastards sinews then i took my first wound its this one see and it saved my life as youll hear right through the top of the thigh honey some big bastard stood over me and pushed his spear right down over my aspis it didnt cut the muscle praise to ares but i went down blood spurting between my fingers with deer killer forgotten in the euboean grass i fell on top of pater i made the mistake of falling forward over my shield and some euboean bastard hit me on the head when i awoke i was rolling in my own filth and vomit wearing the shackles of a slave part ii some made slaves war is the king and father of all and some he shows as gods others as men some men are freed and some are made slaves heraclitus fr hard to imagine what that awakening was like for me i had a fever my wound was oozing pus not that i knew that yet i was off my head and i had never been on a ship i had no idea why i was wet why the world swayed why it was so cold it didnt take me long to know to know honey that i was dead and in tartarus for some forgotten sin i didnt think that i was dead i knew it i flailed and swallowed my own filth i was shackled under a rowing bench in the bottom rank of rowers no one expected me to row only free men rowed back then but i was shackled flat with eight other slaves destined for market not that i understood i knew nothing i went down again i awoke a second time when a tall man poured water over me while another man held his nose they looked at the pus thats when i saw my leg red and angry and inflamed and flinched the tall man with the pointed beard prodded my leg and i was gone again i surfaced a third time in a pen somewhere in asia i learned i wasnt shackled but my thigh still bled pus like a boys spots i had a fever like a child and the other slaves there were hundreds avoided me as if i had the plague for all they knew i did slaves dont help each other honey that lesson hits you right away when you go from the brotherhood of the phalanx to slavery i was never completely out again i raved and no one bought me i wasnt worth an obol the wound on my thigh wept pus as they say and because of it no one buggered me not even the sick bastards who live at the bottom of the muck of the slave trade no one made me play their flute or any of the other things they do to slave boys and girls you ever wonder why harmonia flinches every time you move your hand honey you dont want to know have you seen the kind of slaves who sit in corners rambling talking crazy and never raise their eyes no you havent i never buy em not even for rough work people can be broken just like toys i missed being broken because i was so disgusting bless the lord of the silver bow and his deadly arrows his ravens sit on my shield to this day because of that beautiful stinking pus i watched it they raped a boy until he stopped complaining just a spears length from where i lay he was thracian and he got up silently from their abuse and killed himself ripping his guts out with a stick but few are so determined honey you have no idea what a person can put up with what depth of cowardice we discover when by small surrenders we can stay alive eh oh yes me too im sure id have given in i was just a boy and unlike the brave thracian i was utterly disoriented i couldnt imagine how id come to be a slave and i couldnt get my feet under me so to speak and i had a wound the slaves themselves prey on the weak oh yes no honour among slaves i had no food ever no honest boy came and brought me bread they ate my gruel and my soup and one day i awoke to find two bigger boys discussing my squalor and deciding i wasnt worth a fuck pardon me honey but they meant it and then they pulled up their rags and pissed on me this is harder for you than the death of pater isnt it hard to picture the noble aristocrat as a victim your own father with boys raining yellow urine in contempt hard to imagine me as a worthless slave the dishonour the shame eh listen honey you know what achilles says better to be the slave of a bad master than king of the dead right i was alive i told you that i tell the truth at least as i remember it who is this fellow youve brought to listen to me you look like an ionian young man well eat well you are my guest and guestfriendship still counts for something eh odd as it sounds ive always thought that the urine saved me being pissed on it made me angry and i think it washed the wound persians and aegyptians use piss that way maybe not maybe the deadly archer simply looked the other way and i healed but by the lady i was weak i was so weak that i couldnt stand i hadnt eaten for two weeks at least i didnt even know where i was but i knew that i was angry and i wasnt going to die so that they could defecate on my corpse i decided that i had to eat and to eat i had to fight off all comers and take food the thing is i couldnt fight i could barely drag myself to the place where the food trough was filled the boys who ate the most food were bigger tougher and none of them had a wound id like to say that i thought of something noble like the plataeans at oinoe they didnt win by fighting better they merely refused to break fair enough but i didnt really have a thought in my head i was an animal i decided that if i could endure pain i could eat i noticed that other slaves tried to take their food off into a corner and eat like animals on a kill ripping a haunch and running but it occurred to me in my feverish desperation that i could simply eat while they beat me id tear food out of their hands and put it in my mouth ive seen a starving cat do the same on a wharf in aegypt that was my plan and it worked well enough it only worked because they feared the guards we had scythian guards now that i know the sakje better i suspect that few if any were actually sakje they were probably a rabble of persian bastards halfmedes halfsakje and bactrians scum but armed scum soldiers with bows they didnt do a lot except prevent escape and punish us if we hurt each other too much after all we were worth money but they watched us with the lazy amused contempt of the better man for the worse all free people know they are better than slaves slaves have no honour no beauty no dignity nothing that makes them worth knowing why its all taken from them with their freedom thats why the ones who might have had dignity kill themselves they watched us for entertainment they loved it when we fought and they would wager money on their favourites one old fellow had wagered money that i would live i figured it out from listening to him argue he felt that id already beaten the odds so the first day that i decided to eat when i grabbed bread from the trough and stuck it in my mouth and when a bigger man hit me with his fist i kept eating i took a blow to the head and my nose broke and blood sprayed i kept eating then the cage opened and the old sakje waddled in and kicked my tormentor in the head i ate his food too while he lay unconscious i ate it all the next morning he was groggy i ate his food again his partner one of the boys who had pissed on me hit me in the face where my nose had been broken and i vomited from the pain then i picked up my bread and ate it disgusted yet in the evening i felt better despite the inflammation of my whole face i got to the food trough and waited when the bread loaves began to fall into the trough i waited for the food melee to begin and then i punched the biggest boy in the ear down he went once he was down i kicked him in the head and took his bread while i ate i kicked him again and hurt my foot the next morning the other slaves gave me space at the trough my guard laughed when he saw me later i heard him demand payment but the other soldier told him i would be dead before the end of the day he said this in ionian greek a variant on our language well you know honey and this fellow you brought with you grew up with it so i wont bore you with how it still sounds alien to me now it didnt take long to realize that my two tormentors were planning to kill me murder was not so infrequent in the slave pens i watched them from under my hair my lank filthy hair full of bugs and saw they were together i had united them or perhaps they were allies before my coming although as i say such alliances are rare for slaves of course they were waiting for my scythian to go off duty i watched them and i waited and i tried to plan but i was still wounded and i was still weak and they were bigger and tougher and there were two of them i was beginning to think of attacking them if only to get it over with while my scythian was on duty when the cage opened and a priest came in he was fat and clean and his eyes were sharper than deer killer six of the archers came in behind him he began to gesture with his staff and the men and boys he pointed out were taken i was the last to be chosen someone was purchasing a packet of slaves ten or twelve in a single lot i was being used to make weight which meant that somebody was getting swindled i was as likely to die as live slave traders the very lowest form of life eh we were fettered together by the necks and wrists and marched off up the road i had no idea where i was and no idea where i was going and i didnt care i had already surrendered i might not have broken yet but i was breaking because i had no one to talk to and no one to care about i plodded along behind another man as close as if we were filemates in the phalanx and i didnt know his name on the other hand neither of the boys who had wanted me dead were in the purchase i was going to live if i could just get through the walk to wherever we were going i had thought that the trip over parnes was the hardest thing i would ever do marching with all the weight of my brothers armour but this was far tougher although the pace was gentle enough i was touched with the whip only once for falling and otherwise we were fairly treated we walked some stades perhaps my fever was still on me but i scarcely remember a moment of it i knew we were by the sea or perhaps a great river i assumed we were in euboea for the first time i wondered how i had come to be a slave when none of the other men were plataeans or even athenians and as far as i could remember we were winning the battle when i fell but that made no sense the farther i walked up a long river valley in the brilliant noon sun the more unlikely it was that i was in euboea for one thing except for the old bridge euboea is an island it has neither great mountains nor a huge river i was walking along a great river deep enough to carry a warship with three tiers of oars it flowed out of a pair of mighty mountains in the purple distance or so it seemed when i raised my head and looked around when we stopped at a well and the guards paid silver for water the people were small and brown not much browner than i was myself but brown with that flawless skin that marks lydians and phrygians not that i knew that then and of course our guards were scythians id seen scythians in pictures and pater had fought some and miltiades had fought thousands and run away from others a story he loved to tell as we walked and my thigh throbbed i saw that there were trees i didnt know and the goats were different i kept walking what could i do we walked up that valley for a day ive ridden the distance in an hour the guards must have had orders to go easy on us but i never expected to live we had a meal of gruel and bread in a village on the flank of a mountain still above the beautiful river i squatted next to the safestlooking male are we in asia i asked he looked startled when i spoke he chewed bread and his eyes flicked around as he considered his answer finally he nodded yes he said he pointed up the valley where something winked like fire ephesus he said i was such a bumpkin that i had never heard of ephesus whats ephesus i asked you are a fool he said and turned his back we walked on in the cool of the evening and before true night fell we were in the streets of a city more beautiful than anything i had ever seen in boeotia or attika the streets were paved in grey stone there was a temple that rose from the peak of the acropolis over the town and it was made of marble it looked like a house of the gods and the roof was gold that was the fire i had seen ten stades away the houses were brick and stone every one of them bigger than anything at home water flowed from springs through fountains it was like a mortal going to olympus i had never seen anything like it and i gaped like the barbarian i was the people were tall and handsome and they looked like greeks dark hair straight noses finebreasted women and strong men with a proportion with fairer skin and red and blond hair they were taller and more handsome than boeotians but not a different race i felt even dirtier the guards moved us carefully from square to square so that we didnt offend the citizens as they strolled through the cool evening air but several men and at least one woman stopped to look at us women in boeotia seldom leave their own farms i was not used to seeing a halfclothed woman in her prime gawping at slaves and mocking the guards i stared at her she turned and stared back and then her hand moved and she tried to strike me i moved my head the man with her stopped he was examining the older man who had called me a fool now he turned and looked at me he was even taller than the other tall men with the muscles of an athlete and the chiton of a very rich man he looked at me for a moment and then threw something at me it was a nut he had been eating nuts and he threw hard i caught it he nodded whispered something to the beautiful woman at his side and turned away then the guards moved us on up the acropolis and into a slave barracks at the bottom of the temple district in the morning i was sold to the man who had thrown the nut he came in person to collect me i had no idea what he saw in me any more than i knew why i was a slave but the man obviously saw something he liked and bought it or rather his beautiful wife did later i came to know that he was simply that way and his life of random acquisition had probably saved my life and my spirit for the slaves who went to the temple sometimes became priests but those who didnt died of the work the rest of the parcel i came up with carried mud bricks for the new priests barracks for two years backbreaking labour in the sun a priest told me that my new owners name was hipponax and that i should call him master and avert my eyes hipponax put his carnelian seal on a clay tablet grabbed me by the neck and hustled me out of the slave barracks at the portico of the great temple he stopped and looked me over then he made a face well he said you were cheap he laughed aphrodites tits boy you stink lets get you a doctor we walked down from the acropolis past the magnificent steps to the temple of artemis and into the lower temple precinct where he took me to the temple of asclepius we dont even have asclepius in boeotia hes a healing god i was there for three days they cleaned my leg and poured wine over it twice a day and wrapped it in bandages i was bathed and fed well coarse food but there was barley bread pork and lots of onions and i ate like a horse let me give you in a sentence the difference between ephesus and plataea at the temple of asclepius i was housed in the precinct of slaves i thought i was living with aristocrats my bed had linen sheets and a white wool blanket and they gave me a linen chiton to wear as if it wasnt worth more than my best spear i was waited on by free men and women until i was healed imagine most of the other men in my ward were victims of old age and most of them were thracians in fact the overwhelming number of slaves in ephesus were thracians blond men and women with robust bodies and big heads and i didnt have a word in common with them on the third day my new master came and fetched me i was clean all my hair had been cut away and my head shaved i thought it was a condition of servitude but it turned out that they did it to rid me of lice they shaved my pubic hair too that worried me easterners were notorious for their sexual licence i wore my linen chiton when i followed my master on to the street the sun reflected from marble and pale grey stone blinded me i had a crutch and i hobbled along behind him as best i could we walked down just one level of the town the acropolis was at the top and then the temples and then the rich he took me into the main entrance of his house and it was so magnificent that i stopped behind him and looked in the entranceway under the gate that led from the street to the courtyard there was a fresco of the gods sitting in state painted in colour on the plaster on either side carved as if from life there was a maenad on my right and a satyr on my left once i walked two more steps under the portico and into the courtyard i saw that every column was a statue of a man or a woman each standing like slaves awaiting service holding the roof and under the arches there were more painted scenes scenes from the iliad and scenes of the gods zeus ravished a very willing europa and the only cowlike thing about her was her eyes achilles held his arms high in triumphant revenge and hector lay at his feet welcome my master said he smiled lets have a look at you he pulled my chiton off the beautiful woman came out into the courtyard followed by two female slaves all three of them were perfumed and all three were wearing garments better than plataeas finest wedding dress the lady had gold earrings and a necklace as broad as a soldiers girdle that seemed to be tied with the knot of heracles in gold although i didnt think that was possible i caught her name from my master she was euthalia and that name was right for her for she was beautiful and wellformed and childbearing had not touched her except to give her the strength of face that most matrons get when they have had the rearing of a child i took the knot of heracles as a sign heracles was the family patron and there was his sign in the home of my master heracles had been a slave i took it as a sign and i still think it was they ran their hands over me and played games the slave girls fetched a ball and threw it at me i caught it the man nodded then he swung a stick at me slowly but with some force i moved i ducked i ducked a blow and caught a ball without dropping my crutch finally the man nodded what do you know of horses he asked nothing i said both master and mistress looked disappointed nothing speak the truth boy i shook my head i have touched a horse i said that made mistress smile he could be taught she said he will be too tall soon master said but it is worth a try he put a finger under my chin and raised my face the way a man does with a shy girl whats your name boy arimnestos i said of plataea youre a greek he said yes master i answered he shook his head well im glad to have a greek slave but the man who sold you is a fool you were a free man werent you and you were trained to be an athlete he glanced back he almost treated me as a person and not a household object i am hipponax youve heard of me no master i hung my head he had expected me to know of him he had expected me to know of horses too i had never thought of calchass training as training for sport i was trained to hunt and fight i said master he pursed his lips and looked at mistress she smiled back at him it was good to see them together they were so much of one mind dont be offended because a slave does not know your poetry dear he cant read after all i wondered if i was foolish to brag about my skills but i did not want to go back to the priests and they seemed like good people i can read and write i said you can read and write doric master asked or ionic or both i can read the iliad and the odyssey and alcaeus and theognis i said mistress smiled broadly i think you owe me a new robe of my own choosing dear oh that daxes will be so angry she clapped her hands then she came and ran a hand down my flank and i shivered and she laughed you can fight catch a ball and read fine accomplishments for a young man but your name is barbarous i think we shall call you doru a spear a dorian an intrusion to our family she smiled at me and turned back to master i am going to try and spend a few useful hours accomplishing something at my loom master kissed her shoulder it was a shock everything was a shock but his casual open affection wasnt something i had ever seen greek people do i can think of another role for him if he can hunt and fight he said and read as can i but lets have him put to the farm with some reins in his hand first she said and he can always drive for archilogos if he cant last a race so he can my dear your usual splendid eye for good muscles he turned back to me arimnestos we are sending you to learn to be a charioteer do you think you will like that i might have said many things instead i shrugged really i was ten thousand stades from home and my world was dead what was i to do escape it never crossed my mind it sounded better than being pissed on or hauling mud bricks for priests so i went to the farm with an old slave and slept well enough and in the morning i started to learn to be a charioteer i was never a great charioteer i stood at the reins in some races on the farm and i never won the truth was that hipponax had me pegged as soon as they gave me good food i grew so fast that i was too heavy for even a fourhorse team in a race as a military charioteer i would have been like a god but chariots were hardly ever used in combat any more scyles was my teacher he was an old man from mytilene on lesbos and had been a charioteer all his life i was unsure whether he was a family retainer or a slave he seemed part of the horse farm as much a part of it as the old stallions and the young mares i will disappoint you again by saying that my slavery was so soft that i enjoyed it and my door was never locked not even the first night i could have picked up my crutch and hobbled away at any time and a week later when i was almost fully healed and the growth began i could have run but run where my honey back to plataea across the sea i was in mighty ephesus in asia the slave of a wealthy man no one seemed to know anything about my home or even about the war that id been in i asked i asked scyles from the first day he shrugged and said that no one in the real world cared a damn what the barbarians of athens and sparta did he called them bumpkins clods and to be honest honey i wasnt really so anxious to get back to green plataea sounds shocking doesnt it i was a slave and i didnt want to return to my homeland and be free but freedom is a word we use too easily i think now older and wiser i can say that i was free for the first time i was free of my father who was in many ways a cold unfeeling bastard who seldom had any time for me there ive said it i never mourned him not really i was proud of him but i couldnt muster much regret that he was dead and mater i wouldnt have crossed ephesus wouldnt have walked down the steps to the temple to see her so be shocked if you like i can remember the first night sitting on the cool marble floor of the slave quarters the slave quarters had a marble floor and thinking that i must be a poor son because i didnt want to go home i cried a little i began to wonder if i was going to be a cold unfeeling bastard like my father and ill say it again in ephesus no one had ever heard of plataea among a thousand shocks i received that autumn this had to be the greatest that to the greeks of asia mighty athens and military sparta were clods of no importance interesting too that this was soon to change and that i would play my part in making it change i dare say every man in ephesus knows where plataea is now nonsense i can drink wine at this hour wine is always good for a man pour it full theres a dear now where was i ah yes life as a slave not a bad life they called me doru all of them so that for a while i simply forgot my name as soon as my thigh was healed i had a training schedule and i was massaged and exercised by professionals i learned to ride and to feed horses and to keep them happy i never loved horses ive known a few that were smarter than a rock but not many theyre stubborn and stupid and not unlike cats except that cats dont injure themselves the moment you turn your back at any rate after two weeks scyles said i would never be a charioteer and he was right but we kept trying i loved to drive we started with a little pony cart and i fell off a dozen times trying to make tight corners but i was healed up by then and we had exercises wonderful exercises like balancing on a board placed across the hollow of a shield so that the face of the shield was in the dust and you could tilt and fall so easily wed fight that way to practise balance and the pony cart id ride on the pole or ride the pony until i was comfortable anywhere in the cart or out of it that was scyles way then we tried a twohorse chariot with real horses and i broke my arm the first day that took months to heal and i spent that time doing exercises and working like a normal slave in the kitchens scyles ran a tight farm and he knew his business if i wasnt learning my new trade i could at least run the treadmill that lifted water from the well it was while i was healing my arm that i discovered what stallions and mares were born knowing if you take my meaning one of the kitchen girls asked me how strong my spear was all the girls laughed even the oldsters and that night she had me there wasnt a great deal of foreplay and she laughed at how quick i was this from a girl no more than my own age girls can be cruel but we played quite a bit and i played with other girls too slave girls like to be pregnant it makes for less work and it makes the owner a profit unless hes a fool we had a rich owner and no one was threatened with being sold away so the girls played it was as much of an education as the athletic training in its way the truth is honey it was a happy time there was hardship and i was aware that i was not free but i was young and i had food sex challenge all in all life was simple and easy we worked long hours when we built a structure over the privy we worked six straight days from dawn until dusk but when we were finished we had done something other slaves ploughed sowed and reaped and i did some of all of that work once i was healed we had most of the religious feasts too really in some ways i did less work than i did later as a free man on a farm where everyone is a slave slavery does not seem so bad we did have some troubles there was a boy i hated he whined he was weak he went out of his way to avoid work and he refused to change he also peddled tales to the overseers who was having sex with whom who had eaten too much who drank the masters wine his name was grigas and he was phrygian and there was a thracian boy that i liked although slaves find it hard to be friends real friends because so much of that has been taken from you but silkes was a handsome youth and he was a great wrestler hed been taken in a war and insisted that some day he would escape he was the first man i heard discuss escape as if it could be done one afternoon we were lying in the horse barn wed curried all the hunters and all the chargers and chariot horses and ponies and now we were flopped on the spare feed straw that lay heaped where grigas had failed to make neat haystacks so what if you escape i asked where would you go home silkes said how i asked he shook his head i dont know he said if i have to walk on water ill walk home he looked at me perhaps ill hunt fish with my spear and light a fire on floating weed now youre just talking foolishness i said if they catch you you wont be brought back here learning to be a charioteer youll end up breaking rocks or cutting salt or rowing something crappy so silkes asked its all slavery im not a slave im a free man he rolled towards me youre just a greek slavery is natural for you i broke his nose before he got me in a hold and pounded my head against the barns wall and yet we were not really angry but we both missed work because we had hurt each other and because of it and because grigas reported us we were brought before the chief overseer amyntas amyntas was a macedonian and he was a hard man but fair we all thought he looked us over why did you fight he asked i was ready for him over a girl i said i looked sullenly at silkes who glared back which girl amyntas asked sandra in the kitchen she and i got along i knew she wouldnt talk he nodded ive heard that you two were discussing escape he looked at me i was a greek i didnt flinch but silkes blushed amyntas shrugged you are a stupid thracian why did you fight him silkes looked at me he hit me he said and the girl he was the worst liar id ever met no wonder they call thracians barbarians amyntas nodded again he had a table in the farmhouse that he used as a desk and it was piled with scrolls he pointed at me five blows with a riding whip he said he pointed at silkes ten blows five for damage to your masters property and five for attempting to incite escape you will be punished this evening go to work the waiting was the worst and the humiliation everyone came to watch and grigas stood at the front openly gloating i took the five blows well enough i probably cried out but i didnt scream or cry silkes took his ten in total silence we were whipped naked after i took my five sandra handed me my chiton grigas laughed i guess we know who has the power here he said he was too smug i halfturned as if to talk to sandra and then i hit him with the full force of my fist i hurt him too i received ten more blows from the whip as grigas was still unconscious i felt i had won the next morning i stood before amyntas alone he was behind the desk i was in front of it he had a bronze stylus in his hand and two sets of wax tablets open you have injured the slave grigas he said good i said he nodded i begin to feel that you are rebellious listen to me young man do not choose this road master and mistress have plans for you plans that will help you all your life if you choose to be rebellious i will have to inform them they will sell you is that what you want i kept my eyes down no i said you want to rebel please do not do it you dislike grigas he is useful to me and i will protect him you will treat him with respect and that is all am i clear amyntas got up yes i said good go back to work he said that was it grigas gloated and i took it silkes was disgusted and ceased to be my friend a month later he ran i never heard what happened to him well thats not exactly true but lets save that bit shall we grigas was still there though gloating he was beginning to have a belly a fifteenyearold slave with a belly and he began to force the girls i was healed and had gone back to riding and driving i could pretend that i was no longer part of the daily rhythm of the kitchen what was it to me but it hurt me each time i had to turn away from that little worm each time i saw him fondle a girl each time he made a better slave knuckle under but i knew that i was not going to be a charioteer and that put me in a bad position as a slave if i failed as a charioteer and as i say scyles knew from the second week that i lacked the love of horses then i could be resold for another task more slaves arrived a new cook a pair of horsebreakers and some field slaves i saw that grigas was going to own them that they accepted his vicious authority and i saw his effect on the place when id arrived people were for the most part happy no one was happy any more i thought it over quite a bit scyles caught me at it one day late spring almost a year since id become a slave he watched me for a moment and then shook his head you think too much he said i nodded acknowledging that he was right whats the problem a girl a boy scyles was all right he either wasnt a slave or he wasnt part of the hierarchy of the place amyntas never tangled with him grigas is evil i said scyles nodded and looked away so so i said so nothing i had learned not to discuss important things you see scyles was watching a filly he didnt take his eyes off her good and evil are words philosophers and priests use he said what do you want to do i shook my head in mute negation i wasnt going to tell him can i tell you something lad he said and his voice was kind you wont be a good charioteer i know i said although hearing it from him had the force of an axe blow he nodded dont be stupid he said but he makes things worse for everyone i said not just me everyone scyles scratched his chin and continued to watch the filly interesting i barely know him hes an informer he forces the girls he humiliates the men just for fun the other night he made a farmhand lykon the big one made him give up the girl he liked then he took her just like that that sort of stuff never used to happen scyles nodded it only takes one he said then he looked me in the eye planning to beat him senseless he asked i sat silently and stared over his head scyles nodded because if you do that hell just report you hes probably too stupid to understand that you were born free and might choose to accept punishment to hurt him born slaves are always mystified by the actions of free men somehow that speech moved me deeply perhaps because scyles identified me as a free man if i do nothing then i truly am a slave i said scyles twitched his lips you are a slave he said but he looked around listen lad use your head thats all i can say i nodded and i thought about it some more as it turned out the action was absurdly easy i overplanned and then the gods handed me my enemy a lesson there i decided to kill grigas plain simple murder not a fair fight he had to go and i decided that i didnt need to be caught to prove to myself that i was a free man i decided to drown him in the baths i made some preparations and i changed my routine so that we would be in the baths at the same time i was bigger and stronger i imagined that i would hold him under water no screams not a bad plan we bathed together twice the second time he spent the whole bath telling me things that turned my stomach he had decided that i liked him he was a fool i stole a small wooden mallet from the woodshop so that i could knock him unconscious and hid it in the towels and rags by the big wooden tub that evening master came he arrived in a fourhorse chariot i was able to drive four horses by this time and i was impressed at his skill considering that he was an aristocrat he called for scyles and the two of them had a long talk they kept looking at me it made me sad i really was a slave to think that i was going to be sold away i liked the farm apart from grigas and i could tolerate him now that i held his life in my hand master chatted for some time with scyles and then the two came to where i was cleaning tack master had some beautiful halters worked in bronze and silver fine lydian work doru he called and i ran to them he nodded to me scyles says that you will never make a charioteer he said he says that you can drive and handle horses that you are safe and unexceptional and that you dont love horses i stared at the ground it was all true master raised my chin mistress and i have another plan for you my son needs a companion he is a little younger than you i think but you will make a good right arm so would you like to come back to the city with me and try working for my son i had learned a great deal about being a slave on the farm so instead of sullen silence i pretended to be delighted yes master i said and clapped my hands he looked at me a long time and i wondered if he was fooled let me see your thigh he said i raised my chiton and he looked at the wound it looked then much as it does now a red fish hook after a few moments he frowned is there pain he asked just before the weather changes i said otherwise none he nodded tomorrow we will go to the city say your goodbyes and finish your tasks yes master i said i thought i would never settle grigas and the thought made me feel like a failure but the gods had other ideas sometimes chance tyche is better than any plan of men i was ordered by the head cook to run to the village market for some rue i had good legs by then i think i was a foot taller than i had been at the battles and i could run so i set off into the late afternoon with a few obols clutched in my fist i got the rue from a peasant woman in a stall covered in hide then i turned and ran back to the farm my legs eating the stades i doubt that i was even winded as i passed the barn and then i heard the sound of a woman crying i ran into the barn i was moving fast tyche sat at my shoulder and there were furies at my back grigas was up in the loft with a girl he was making the smallest kitchen slut blow his flute he had her hairanyway thats not a thing to tell you honey i ran straight to the ladder and climbed and i suspect he never heard me she was doing what she had been made to do and was crying i pushed her aside broke his neck and threw him from the loft his head made the sound a wooden mallet makes as it hits the cows head when the butcher is slaughtering he hit the stone floor of the barn but he was dead before he left my hands i was eating dinner when they found his body i laughed good riddance i said and amyntas looked at me i met his eye the next day i drove masters chariot from the farm up the mountain to ephesus proud as a king i had learned three lessons from the murder lessons ive kept with me all my life first that older people are wise and you should listen to them second that dead men tell no tales and third that killing is easy hipponaxs son was archilogos i see you smile honey its true he was my master and i was his slave the gods move in mysterious ways archilogos was a boy of twelve years when i was fourteen he was handsome in the ionian way with dark curly hair and a slim build he could vault anything and he had had lessons in many things swordfighting chariotdriving and writing among them he was the most medified greek i had ever met he worshipped the persians he admired their art their clothes their horses and their weapons he practised archery all the time and he had a religious regard for the truth because his fathers friend the satrap had told him that the only two requirements for being a persian were that a boy should shoot straight and tell the truth i should speak of the satrap in the sixtyseventh olympiad when i was young persia had conquered all of lydia although theyd effectively had the place many years before almost fifty so ephesus like sardis was part of their empire they ruled their greeks with a light hand despite all the cant you hear these days about slavery and oppression their satrap was artaphernes he is so much a part of this story that he will vie with archilogos for the number of times i mention him he was a handsome man tall and blackhaired with a perfectly trimmed beard and bronze skin his carriage was wonderful he was the most dignified man ive ever known and even men who hated him would listen respectfully when he spoke he had the ear of the king of kings great darius he never lied as far as i know he loved greeks and we loved him he was a fearsome enemy too oh honey i know he was a good friend to hipponax whenever he came to ephesus and that was at least once a year he would stay with us and he was a real persian not a mixedblood a noble of the highest sort my new master wanted to grow up to be that man artaphernes was in the house when i was brought from the farm i had driven the chariot and i was flushed with masters praise he said scyles was surely wrong as id scarcely bumped him once in driving up the mountain now this was certainly a bit of foolishness but flattery was like water to a drowning man when i was a slave when did you last praise a slave honey exactly the persian was in the courtyard when i came in i was dressed in a short wool kilt like a charioteer he was wearing trousers and a coat made of embroidered wool and he was reading from a scroll master was behind me giving instructions to another slave and i was alone so i bowed and remained silent i had never seen a persian before the persian returned my bow and my silence after a pause where our eyes met he went back to reading his scroll master came and the two embraced sorry to be absent for your arrival my lord hipponax grinned you are reading my latest why do you do yourself so little justice the persian asked he had very little accent just enough to add a tinge of the exotic to his voice you are the greatest living poet in greek or persian why do you seek praise in this manner hipponax shrugged i am never sure he said the persian shook his head it is this unsureness that makes you greeks so different and perhaps makes your poetry so strong he nodded at me this young gentleman has perfect manners hipponax flashed me a smile he is to be my sons companion your praise pleases me he is a slave the persian looked at me we are all slaves under the king but this one has dignity he will be good for your son he shrugged i had no idea he was a slave as far as i was concerned artaphernes could do no wrong then master took me into the house and brought me to his son archilogos was in the back garden shooting arrows at a target he had a persian bow and the lawn was decorated with arrows youll have to do better than that if you want to be a persian his father said i thought that he was not particularly happy to find his son shooting archilogos threw the bow on the ground in anger then he looked at me whats he for the boy asked he was a boy to me i was a grown man as far as i was concerned your mother and i have chosen him to be your companion master nodded i give him to you we call him doru but you may ask him his name he is greek he can read and write archilogos looked at me for a long time finally he shrugged i can read and write he said can you shoot a bow yes i said ignoring both of them i picked up his bow it was heavier than any id shot but i had all kinds of new muscles i raised the bow drew and shot all in one motion as calchas had taught me and my arrow flew true and struck the target not in the centre but squarely enough archilogos went and hugged his father who winked at me i thought that they were the happiest family i had ever seen their happiness helped to keep me a slave when i could have run they seemed so happy that most of their slaves were happy too it was a good house until the disaster came and the fates ordained that they be brought low i loved them that first night we watched the persian shoot he had his own bow lacquered red and stringed in something beautiful and he shot arrow after arrow into the target without apparent effort i had never seen an archer so deadly mistress lay on a kline at the edge of the garden watching she shared the kline with master and we heard their conversation and their commentary as we shot the persian watched them from time to time and i could see that whatever his friendship for hipponax he found her very much to his taste i shot adequately artaphernes coached my new master and he shot well enough and then the persian ordered one of his troopers one of the persian cavalrymen in his escort to come up and shoot the man had been down in the lower city probably up to no good but he shot with gusto and he shot well although not quite as well as his lord and then the soldier gave us pointers he spoke to me at length about the weight of the bow i understood from this that my new master needed a lighter bow heres the difference between a slave and a companion slaves avoid work to be a successful companion you have to work hard you have to anticipate your masters needs and fulfil them no one had to tell me this i saw it in the way they all behaved the truth is that i liked him the moment i met him and so i wanted to please him that night while the persian lord flirted with mistress i went to master and asked him for the money to buy the boy a lighter bow he nodded come with me he said and took me to darkar the steward another lydian darkar is the man who controls this house master said im lucky he allows me to live here darkar this young man is to be my sons companion i bowed to the steward he nodded he was a slave he will need money master said darkar nodded went into a storeroom and emerged with a purse he handed it to me fifty gold darics and some change he said you will only be told once if you steal youll be sold if you dont steal youll receive a bonus to put away towards your freedom understand i nodded fifty darics was the price of a hundred slaves or a ship and he said eleutheria freedom as if it was a certain thing master why do i need so much money i asked the steward never call me master boy this is your companions money you but carry it for him and watch it and count it treat it carefully for they never will give me a good accounting and ill speak well of you my word caries weight when it comes time for freedom freedom of course in my head i wasnt really a slave so i looked at the purse and considered running for a ship ionians too much money at any rate the moment i had the purse in my hand i ran off to the market and bought a good lightweight bow i paid well almost half a daric and i pocketed the change what do you think i knew that they couldnt catch me i put the change in a jar in the garden and i had the bow on archilogoss bed when he awoke in the morning and fortynine golden darics left to show on my accounts the whole time that artaphernes was with us we shot until my fingers bled thats an expression you hear but in our case it was true first you shoot until your fingertips swell and after a while they hurt as if stung by ants and they turn bright red but a pair of boys each eager for praise and fearing the catcalls of the other will go right on until the fingers turn a darker colour and then the abrasion of the bowstring will break the swollen flesh and they bleed and later if you go back to shooting before the calluses grow the scabs break and they bleed again the bowstring of our bow had a brown spot at the draw point from our blood archilogos never tired and never gave up his whipcord body was proof against fatigue and he would run and shoot do lessons and shoot go to the theatre and shoot anything to impress his hero hed learned a few lines of persian poetry and hed declaim them hoping that the persian would overhear the persian had troubles enough without the adoration of the boy first it was obvious to me after the sexual politics of the farm that the persian was deeply in love with mistress and that she toyed with him but even that was of little moment next to the greater matters that surrounded us it was the years of the seventieth olympiad in greece the last of the great tyrants had gone and peace began to emerge from her nest but in ionia the tyrants still held sway not lawgivers men who make good laws and then relinquish control i speak here of strong warlords and aristocrats who aped persian manners and ruled ionia for their own benefit not that of their cities hippias the tyrant of athens had been overthrown in my childhood he had retreated to sigeum in asia a city that his family the pisistratidae ruled in much the same way as miltiades ruled the chersonese hippias was in ephesus with his own train of soldiers and courtiers making noise in the lower city and spending money my second night in the household i heard the satrap at dinner he was complaining to hipponax about the greek lords on their islands and how their bad rulership reflected poorly on the great king and would if left unchecked lead to revolt and men blame me he complained i dont have enough soldiers to punish mytilene or miletus and what good would it do me to take them i would only punish the very men of the city who are treated so ruthlessly by the tyrants i wish to be rid of he looked at his host why are you greeks so rapacious hipponax laughed i suspect that the tyrants merely do as they think a persian would do lord the satrap frowned i hope that this is humour my friend no persian lord would behave this way this is weakness these are rulers who do not trust themselves nor do they tell the truth to their people or their king hipponax shrugged and looked at his wife is it really so bad he asked the satrap raised a cup of wine it is and hippias this former tyrant has been at me again and again to take athens back for him what does the great king want with these yokels his eyes crossed mine i lowered my eyes as slaves do but i couldnt help bridling at the term yokel from a barbarian even if he was handsome as a god hipponax nodded at me that young man has been a warrior in the west havent you lad thats a spear scar on your thigh go ahead you may speak i was behind archilogoss couch and i was caught with a pitcher of water in my hands hardly the most warlike pose yes master i said artaphernes smiled at me you fought for athens he asked i am a plataean i answered we are allies of athens hipponax laughed he meant no harm i think but his laugh hurt me see how the westerners are thats a town smaller than our templecomplex claiming to be the ally of athens a town so small we could fit five of them inside ephesus artaphernes dismissed me with a flick of his fingers i have never heard of your plataea he said i dont think he meant it unkindly but the gods were listening i wish i could say i replied with something witty or strong ha instead i stood like a statue as he went on however provincial athens is men here in the islands and on the coast look at the tyrants and talk of rebellion they have never seen the wrath of the great king or how he disciplines rebellion they are like children he drank you know aristagoras as well as i do he has taken an embassy to sparta and athens asking for fleets and soldiers to raise rebellion against us and farther from home men like miltiades of athens foment war i leaned forward at the mention of my hero i hadnt heard his name in a year it was as if i had been asleep that warlord what do we care for him hes just a petty brigand mistress was amused a handsome brigand ill allow a far better man than aristagoras the windbag miltiades has most of the chersonese in his hand the persian said the lydian chersonese mistress asked alarmed master laughed at her not mocking but honest laughter nothing to be worried about my sweet miltiades has his lair in the chersonese of the bosporus over by byzantium north of troy he has more men and more ships each year the satrap continued nodding and he preys on us soon i will need to mount an expedition to evict him from the chersonese i have so many complaints but when i go against him he will counter by pushing samos or some other island into revolt he spends silver like water and these fool tyrants play into his hands he drank again and yet bah why do i bore you with these matters of governance all of that sounded like my miltiades a thumb in every wine bowl and lots of silver mistress smiled because we are your friends and because friends ease each others burdens surely lord you can just buy miltiades he worships money or so i understand the satrap shook his head and rolled over on his couch i thought that his trousers looked ridiculous greek men even ionians display their legs to show how hard they exercise a man in trousers looked like some sort of effeminate clown but otherwise i thought him the best figure of a warrior i had ever seen i understood why archilogos was so eager to impress him he held out his hand for wine i cut off another house slave and filled it for him and he flashed me a smile it is not miltiades who really worries me he admitted it is your windbag aristagoras of miletus my spies tell me he is to speak to the assembly in athens hipponax yawned ephesus can defeat athens without help from any of the other cities if it comes to that he said artaphernes shook his head dont be too sure he said their power is growing their confidence is growing i do not want the westerners involved if there is to be trouble in the islands there was more of the same indeed an old mans memory being what it is im not sure that i even have what they said in the right order but hipponax and euthalia took the parts i have given them they were supportive loyal subjects of the great king as the companion to archilogos i was excused a great many duties in the house but i was smart enough to know that it was by willingness to work and not by arrogance that i would gain the alliance of the other slaves and the steward so i put my master to bed and then returned to the andron to help tidy up it wasnt bad work there was plenty of wine going around among the slaves and as long as we didnt chip the ceramics or dent the metalware master didnt seem to care much what we did i took tray after tray down to the kitchens and then i helped the girls wash the cups in hot water which was what cook liked to see my young master had a sister i hadnt met yet named briseis after achilles companion people choose the oddest names for children eh honey greece is full of cassandras what kind of name is that for a girl anyway her companion was penelope the same as my sister and i met her that night penelope was just my age had red hair like miltiades and was of the same mind as me to do some extra work and be seen as a help so we washed cups and drank wine together and we talked of our lives she wasnt born a slave either her father sold her when her family lost their farm he still came and saw her though i listened as well as talking it was a new experience for me and she commented on it emboldened i tried to kiss her and i put a hand on her breast but she slapped my ear hard enough to make me see the stars then she flashed me a smile no she said and slipped away i liked her i even liked the slap and ill jump ahead of my story to say that i started to make excuses to see her the house was big but it wasnt that big its just that while mistress came and went from the womens quarters as she wished we men werent allowed there i went to bed late and with much to think about and in the morning we went for our lessons to the great temple of artemis it was my first time inside the precinct i climbed the steps with a certain awe because they were so high and so much of the precinct was stone in boeotia we put down a couple of courses of stone to raise the building clear of the damp and then we build the rest in mud brick but the ephesian temple was all stone with marble steps and marble pediments and lintels and painted statues of artemis and nemesis and heracles i think i spoke aloud in wonder to see my ancestor so nobly arrayed in a foreign land wearing a helmet like a lions head and holding a club i touched the statue for luck when we reached the top we passed beneath the magnificent portico into the blinding sunlight of the courtyard which was paved in pale golden stone gold and bronze statues caught the light reflected by the brightly coloured marbles archilogos didnt give it so much as a glance dont gawp like a peasant he said come he marched me to the steps of the great temple itself there were dozens of young men there and in the cool space under the columns most sat around tutors but the biggest crowd gathered around a whitehaired man who was so thin that his bones threatened to burst from his skin he wore a chlamys without a chiton like the young men but he had an ugly bony body except that his muscles stood out like a boeotian farmers he seemed very old to me he watched us come although there were a dozen boys around him on the steps you are late he said to my new master archilogos smiled pardon master he said i should not have waited so long to dip my toe this comment made the other boys giggle i had no idea why the teacher glared at him if you understood what i said he commented you would know how foolish that last sally sounded why do i teach the young we pay well another wag said boys began to laugh but he old man had a stick and it smacked into the jokesters shins before he could move i neither accept pay nor do i ask for it the teacher said who are you boy that last was directed at me i was not the only companion present i belong to archilogos i said meekly he grunted not in my class boy here you are your own man your own mind for me to mould as i see fit he coughed into his hand what do you know anything no i said nothing he smiled you have a nice combination of humility and arrogance young man sit down right here we are talking about the logos do you know of the logos young man no teacher i answered and so i met heraclitus my true master the teacher of my soul but for him i would be nothing but a hollow vessel filled with rage and blood at the time i was enraptured to find another thinker like the priest of hephaestus from thebes this one was even deeper i thought and i sat in the shade my back against a warm marble pillar and let him fill me with wisdom in fact much of it sounded like gibberish and it was up to every boy to take what he could from the well or so heraclitus told us on that first day though he turned to me of all those boys so you know nothing are you a hollow vessel may i fill you i remember nodding and blushing because other boys giggled and too late i saw the double entendre bah heraclitus said and his stick struck a shin the owner squeaked sex is for animals boy talking about sex is for miserable ephebes he prodded me with the bronzeshot tip of his staff so ready to learn yes master i said he nodded here is all the wisdom i have boy there is a formula a binding and a loosing a single coherent thought that makes the universe as it is and we who sit on these steps call it the logos he prodded me again understand i looked at him his eyes were dark and full of mischief like a boys no i admitted brilliant heraclitus laughed you may yet be a sage boy he looked around and then back at me have you heard the phrase common sense he asked yes i answered is it in fact common i laughed no i said superb the old man said by all the gods you are the pupil ive dreamed about he leaned close and poked me with his stick again which has the truer understanding lad your ears and nose or your soul i looked around but all the boys were watching me whats a soul i asked i had heard the word but seldom as something that could sense he stopped poking me he turned to archilogos young logos he said and suddenly i knew where my young master had got his name how much did your father pay for this slave archilogos raised his hands no idea master but not much heraclitus laughed now i know that wisdom can indeed be purchased he turned back to me and the stick pushed into my ribs listen boy he said the soul is the truest form of you it can sense the logos in the same way it can sense when another man lies if you allow it i considered this what does it sense if my eyes sense light and my ears sense noise what does my soul sense heraclitus stepped back excellent question he walked away a few steps and came back work on it and you will be a philosopher now we will examine some mathematics whats your name boy i am doru i said the spear that cuts to the truth i see very well on the feast of artemis have prepared an oration on what the soul senses and how you may present it to the other boys then he turned away now this is a triangle that was our first encounter he was always a challenge if you said nothing he would hit you if you spoke up he would sometimes praise and sometimes deride and always force you to compose an oration to defend your views i came to know that most classes began with one poor boy or another rising like a politician in the assembly to deliver a quavering oration in defence of some indefensible subject i liked the mathematics i came from a family of craftsmen and i already knew how to make a triangle with a compass how to divide it exactly in two parts and a hundred other tricks that any draughtsman needs to know to copy figures or even just to make a nice circle on a cup i lacked the language to be comfortable they were ionians and they spoke a different dialect but from the first heraclitus put me at ease when i sat on the steps of the temple of artemis i was the equal of every other boy that made me love the lessons more than anything but i soon learned the language and i drank in the ideas and words of rhetoric and philosophy the way a thirsty man drinks water i learned to stand properly and to speak from low in the chest so that other men could hear me i learned some tricks with words phrases that would draw a laugh and other phrases that were serious i learned that the repetition of any line from homer would make men take an argument more seriously we learned to sing from another teacher and to play the lyre calchas had played the instrument well and i was determined to emulate him you may judge the results yourself when i play some sappho later it was a game but a great game a complex game as was the game of how to craft an argument heraclitus was severe on the difference between disputation and assertion you know it young man they teach that in halicarnassus do they hmm honey it is like this when i say that the moon is made of cheese that is an assertion if i say it louder does that make it more true if i quote homer that the moon is made of cheese does that make it more true what if i threaten to beat you if you dont agree does that make it true no all mere assertion yes but if i bring you a piece of cheese better if i take you to the moon and show you it is cheese then i have offered proof if i cannot prove it perhaps i can offer theories as to why it must be cheese offering testimonies from other men who have been to the moon or scientific evidence based on experiment you see and you can offer me the same sort of evidence to prove that the moon is in fact not made of cheese at all if you laugh so hard you will certainly spoil your looks hah that was an assertion theres no proof whatsoever that laughter hurts your looks where was i i must have been speaking of heraclitus yes he made us learn the difference and if you rose to speak and he was displeased that ash staff with the bronze ferrule would whistle through the air and crack you in the side or prod you in the ribs very conducive to learning in the young weeks passed it was a glorious time i was learning things every day i was exercised like a healthy young animal i was in something like love for the first time with penelope and archilogos was a fine companion in every way we read together ran together fought with staves wrestled boxed and disputed artaphernes stayed with us for all that summer and autumn while he kept watch over his tyrants and his lords he was building half a dozen triremes to the latest design down in the harbour and we would run all the way there to watch the ships and then run back twenty stades or so i havent mentioned that hipponaxs household ran on the profits from his ships not his poetry indeed everyone called him the poet and we still sing his songs in this house but he was a captain and an investor running cargoes all the way to phoenicia and africa when the mood was on him and buying and selling other mens cargoes too archilogos and i went on short trips once across the water to mytilene a pretty town on lesbos and once to troy to walk the mound and camp where the greeks had camped a perfect trip in early autumn when the sea is the friend of every man and dolphins dance by the bow of your ship it was odd looking across the water at the chersonese where miltiades held sway if i swam the hellespont id have been able to get home later we went on longer voyages to syracuse and the spartan colony at taras in southern italy but we went far south along the coast of africa not along the greek coast where i would have been close to home i didnt want to go home home had mater and poverty and death i was in ephesus with lovely people a friend a teacher and a woman how deaf i must have been to the wingbeats of the furies later we made the run to lesbos many times hipponax owned property in eresus where sappho came from and we would beach our ship there under the great rock or inside the mole that the old people built before the siege of troy and hipponax would climb to the citadel and pay his respects to sapphos daughter who was very old but still kept her school briseis had gone to that school for three years and had all sapphos nine books by heart they had a warehouse in methymna too another city of lesbos and a rival to eresus and mytilene lesbos is the richest of the islands honey we have a house in eresus though youve never been there i fell in love with the sea archilogos did too he knew that someday he would be a captain in war and peace and he stood with the helmsman learning the ropes and so did i we made these trips in the first year and then there were others it was part of our studies and never the worst part either but i will return to the sea where horses merely annoyed me the sea charmed terrified roused me like a mans first sight of a woman taking off her clothes for him i never lost that arousal still have it hah ive made you blush in the evenings when we were at home in ephesus i would finish my work put archi to bed he was archi to his friends and to his companion grab a quick opson in the kitchens and go out into the night air to explore i had adventures such adventures lass oh it makes me smile one night a pair of mercenaries sat and told me stories because they knew me from the shrine at plataea and they promised to take news of my plight home that night i dreamed of ravens and after that i really began to think of leaving and of home until they came well it wasnt real another time i was nearly kidnapped and sold but i put my stick in the bastards groin and ran like hell most nights though i went out of masters door and just down our cobbled street to the fountain of pollio where i would meet my penelope i call her mine but she was never quite mine although we were as far around the rim of loves cup as to kiss i remember the night that hippias came to our house because penelope and i had been sent together to the market earlier in the day she to buy coloured yarn for tapestry and me to watch that she wasnt molested my name doru had started to have some meaning in the slave quarters i could make most men eat my fist if i had to but i was no bloody tyrant in any case penelope and i had a good afternoon i was able to show off my knowledge of the agora and she showed off her practicality in bargaining then we agreed to meet that night something in the touch of her fingers oh i couldnt wait hippias the former tyrant of athens was coming for dinner with artaphernes it was an odd arrangement because master and mistress didnt attend in fact they were at the temple sacrificing i think that they were away on purpose so that they could avoid hippias archilogos ended up playing the host despite his youth and i waited on tables this must have been towards the end of the summer because darkar and i were now allies i did his bidding without hesitation and he didnt question my expenses darkar knew that artaphernes liked me so he had me pouring wine as the ganymedes laugh if you like thugater i was a good slave hippias tried to fondle me from the first time my hip was close enough to touch it was odd because i had grown past the stage when spartans liked their boys smooth i had hair and muscles at any rate hippias couldnt keep his hands off me and so i served him from farther and farther away and bless them the other slaves got in his way as well slaves in a wellrun house will protect each other up to a point if his hands were eager for me his voice gave nothing away he harangued poor artaphernes ceaselessly from the first libation to the last skewer of deer meat on how he needed to storm athens to lance the boil that would otherwise fester let me just say that hippias was in fact correct dont be blinded by his enmity girl he was a wise man athens must have her government changed he argued artaphernes shook his head athens is so far west that she could never be part of my province he said some other man would be satrap of the west and then athens is part of another world another continent perhaps am i to conquer the world to restore you hippias hippias drank wine his eye had gone from me to kylix a smaller boy who carried water and was now serving him kylix slipped away from his fingertips with graceful experience and i passed between them helping kylix as he helped me young archilogos all your slaves are beautiful he said and raised his cup archilogos tried to be polite thank you he said into his cup hippias ignored him anyway artaphernes if you refuse me ill be forced to go to the great king this is not a distant threat i have friends in athens aristagoras will speak before the assembly and they will give him ships this war is coming athens will drive it if you do not you will not do your duty to the king if you do not launch a preemptive attack on athens assertion i thought i disliked hippias because he was a pudgy ugly man with greasy fingers who wanted to fondle me yech but he was correct of course artaphernes was an honourable man who didnt want a war but he was in this case wrong war will hurt trade and every man in this city will pay aye and in your city and in miletus and the cost of a war with athens a real war not just a raid could force taxes that would drive men to open rebellion especially if men like aristagoras and miltiades bribe their way into mens hearts artaphernes took a skewer of meat from the stand beside his couch and ate carefully fastidiously like a cat we do not want a war like that why dont you take care of it for me my friend if you have so many friends in athens why not take a few ships and restore yourself i could lend you the money from tax revenue would a thousand darics of gold finance your restoration hippias grew red in the face i dont need a thousand darics he spluttered i need an army and the power of your name and you know that you mock me you are a friend of the great king i never mock the king nor his friends if you feel that you must go to great darius and speak this way be my guest but i have neither the ships nor the soldiers to storm athens for you nor is it my duty artaphernes stretched on his couch hippias left soon after when he found that none of his advances political or sexual were going to lead anywhere when he was gone archilogos lay on his couch and chatted with his hero i served both of them archi had no head for wine and i was already pouring pure water into his cup why do you even entertain a man like that he asked the satrap artaphernes shrugged he is a powerful man if he goes to darius i will not look well archi shook his head he is a petty prince from a foreign power surely he can be ignored he provides me with excellent intelligence artaphernes said and in his way he is wise he drank and then said even though he plays both sides like a treacherous greek that last was not his happiest statement he is on the other side archi asked cant you have him arrested artaphernes laughed you are young and idealistic ruling a greek is like riding a wild horse like herding cats every lordling in these waters is his own master and has his own side i have many roles i am the oppressive foreign master i am the ally of convenience i am the source of gold and patronage i am the lord who serves the great king i slip from mask to mask like one of your actors never was an image more apt archilogos because i need to be many men to keep all you greeks loyal to my master he looked at us i think he was speaking to himself suddenly he smiled and shook his head i am dull company he said no archi protested this was a dream having his hero all to himself does hippias plot against you i asked this was daring from a slave but there were just the three of us and he had spoken to me before he looked at me and nodded approvingly archilogos your slave has a head on his shoulders and when you are an officer of the great king this one will make a good steward he nodded to me he plots against me only to win me over he said it is not a persian way of behaving indeed it still mystifies me he smiled at archi this is why i ask your mother and father so many questions young man because they can explain this behaviour to me hippias bribes the tyrants of the islands to revolt so that there will be a war he will then be at my side for the war hoping that athens comes in with the tyrants then he will use me to reconquer athens does that sound possible i smiled oh yes brilliant i clapped my hands hippias may have been a lecherous fat man but he could think like heracles if that was his plan artaphernes shook his head i need to go back to persepolis where men kill each other over women and illchosen words but never ever lie he frowned at me you understand this way of planning then i grinned i do lord women archi asked breaking in persians kill each other over women adultery is our national sport artaphernes said his voice heavy with some adult emotion that neither archi nor i could interpret and we glanced at each other he had had too much to drink every persian gentleman covets his friends wife it is like a disease or the curse of the gods he looked at his cup and i moved to fill it but he covered it i grow maudlin let us forget that last exchange young friends never speak ill of your homeland when among strangers we are not strangers i hope archi said i have drunk too much you see i offend my host i am off to bed the mede got to his feet without his usual grace and headed off under the portico i went and helped him into bed he mumbled things that i ignored because when you are a slave people say the most amazing things then i went to deal with archi who had no head for wine and was puking in a basin at last when archi was on his couch with a rug over him i went to find penelope it was rare for us to have a scheduled tryst and i was afire i barely did my duty in clearing the andron of the refuse of a dinner party and i took only a cupful of stew from the kitchen and drank no wine i neednt have hurried the fountain of pollio was old then it has since been restored but at that time it was the meeting place of slumming aristocrats and slaves the roof of the fountain had fallen in and been replaced with wood and the carpenter had done a poor job doubtless a slave the ephesians used slaves for everything and had few free craftsmen there were seats benches really all along the outer edge of the round building but they were rickety and only the strongest had a secure place to sit yet it was cool and pleasant to sit at night and the view was spectacular out over the river and down the bay all the way to the sea the smoke of ten thousand cooking fires rose with the incense of the temples and the pinpoints of ten thousand household lights coloured the landscape at our feet like the gold embroidery on a rich mans purple cloak i could look at ephesus by night for hours which was as well because penelope was late i knew that she might not come at all we were after all slaves i have probably forgotten all the truly dull and onerous days honey but dont forget as i tell this story that we were property like a pot or a sandal and our master and mistress could without the least ill will ruin our plans our hopes even our dreams i knew that penelope might be working or commanded to sleep in her ladys bed it was past full dark when she came and she surprised me coming up behind me where i dozed and cupping her hands over my eyes of course i grabbed her hands and of course she squealed and one thing was leading very pleasantly to another and dont by aphrodites lovely ankles imagine we were alone there were probably twenty courting couples in that dim room and more outside leaning against the wall and then there were men playing polis thats our greek game of cities played with black and white counters and women actually using the fountain quite a crowd when you are a slave honey theres no privacy and no secrets at any rate id got myself a solid seat and soon i had penelope across my lap and one hand well placed under her chiton and she was searching the inside of my mouth with her tongue i shouldnt tell you these things honey but youll know aphrodite well enough yourself soon whether i tell you or not and kissing her was like war like hunting my heart pounded and my head was full of her and then she was off my lap and across the room what are you doing here she said her voice more full of anger than fear i had no idea what she had seen but i was on my feet ready to attack or defend the fountain was not a safe place exactly there were some bad men in the shadows i saw the slim figure vanish even as penelope called after him a boy wrapped in a chlamys ill run him down i said i was instantly jealous no my faithless lover protested but i was off the chlamys was an expensive garment striped with purple and the wearer had long legs i ran the rich boy down in twenty steps tripped him and landed on top of him with all my weight on his hips then i pulled the chlamys away from his head my heart was beating and i was ready to kill even then honey i was a killer i had already done it often enough that killing was like kissing an old flame i knew the dance and my fingers were going for the finish eyeballs this was no rival and my murderous fingers stilled she was a rich girl she had pearls in her hair and her face even in pain was flawless a word poets use too often she was probably fourteen her hair was black and her lips red and in the light of the house lanterns her skin was as smooth as marble she had muscles like an athlete and high eyebrows i was off her as fast as id taken her down penelope appeared and stood between us you fool she hissed and i had no idea which of us she was speaking to i had to see where you went every night pen the girl said ares you broke my hip you barbarian she looked at penelope you have a lover penelope looked at me a moment id unpinned one side of her chiton the better to reach her breasts and it was hard for her to deny what wed been doing she shrugged whats it to you rich girl i asked she looked at me and her eyes twinkled it hurts me to say this but next to her penelope looked like a slave girl like a mortal next to a goddess a few thousand darics a few hundred medimnoi of grain and a dozen slaves at your command give you poise confidence perfect skin and lustrous hair that no slave girl can match look at yourself girl now look at blondie your thracian shes handsome but shes invisible next to you see exactly so when this rich girl twinkled her eyes at me i reacted and she smiled i own her the rich girl said she shrugged i suspect that you are the famous spearboy doru of the barbarous west yes she laughed my brothers companion making love to my companion oh i will have such fun she clapped her hands together and thats how i met briseis yes you know that name shes as much a part of this story as miltiades or artaphernes i bowed i apologize for hurting you mistress she raised an eyebrow what will you do for me if i dont report you boy she called me pais like a small boy who runs errands she meant to cut me and she succeeded nothing kore i returned a kore was a little girl of good family doru penelope cautioned nothing report us to darkar better yet to your parents i smiled i will be punished for hurting you i shrugged but i knew a few things i was not a new slave i knew that allowing someone to blackmail you was deadly masters loved to play this game get someone elses slave in your debt and then use them as a spy oh yes darkar was on top of all those tricks he was steward and spymaster too he knew how to put oil on bread i can tell you she looked at me for a long time really she said very well dont forget to explain what you were doing outside the house after dark naked under a chlamys that was the free man in me unable to shut up somehow she was like my sister and i knew what id say to my sister if she tried to blackmail me which come to think of it she had done a hundred times she whirled you wouldnt dare she shot at me i shrugged despoina i am a slave and slaves are notorious for protecting themselves and you are naked under that chlamys she turned red blushed so hard that you could see it under the fretful light of a house lamp she pursed her lips and got up carefully clutching her boys cloak around her figure and ran back into her fathers house by the slaves door penelope paused only long enough to push two fingers rather painfully into the spot where my hips muscles stopped you idiot she hissed she meant to scare you for fun why did you have to challenge her i thought that i had behaved like a hero on the other hand i also realized that i had forgotten penelopes existence for three minutes i went inside shaking my head i didnt lose any sleep worrying about briseis morning presented me with new troubles i was summoned with archi to face hipponax as soon as archi had breakfasted briseis was standing behind her father dressed in an embroidered ionic chiton of linen and a pair of golden slippers my daughter says that your companion was caught last night kissing her companion hipponax said his eyes were on his son not on me archi shrugged as young men will do a reaction that always infuriates a parent i can tell you he kissed penelope archi asked looking at me why then he grinned or rather why not hipponax had a javelin on the table a light spear with a shaft of cornel wood he slapped it on the table it made a noise like the whip of a muleteer i jumped archi blanched briseis smiled only then did hipponax look at me well he asked me yes lord i said i kissed her hipponax glanced back at his daughter and then at me i do not encourage flirtation among my people young man but i am angered by your casual use of my andron as a place to debauch my daughters companion i flicked my eyes to that lying little fox briseis so i had kissed her companion in the andron had i but when my eyes met hers a curious spark passed eyes can pass many messages and faces give so much away honey especially young faces even as her father spoke she realized i think that her prank was going to cost me and that her dare she was daring me to tell her father where the incident had happened was foolish no slave would accept punishment under such circumstances and who knows what she had thought inside that goddesslike head that i would protect her because i was a foolish boy all this in one heartbeat with a plea not to betray her now that she had lied and put me in danger i am disappointed in you boy you have a good life here this sort of behaviour is emblematic of arrogance i must punish it harshly so that you will understand do you have anything to say for yourself i let it hang here for ten heartbeats i was calm and i already knew what i would do so i flicked my eyes over her and she flinched archi spoke up if he was half as drunk as i pater it is scarcely his fault he had to spend the evening avoiding the unsubtle grasping of hippias of athens bless archi he stood up for me like a man hipponax glanced at his son and then at me is this true he asked yes lord i said i did it i meant no arrogance lord i broke nothing and only one hip of mine ever touched a couch i was drunk and i will take my punishment hipponax raised an eyebrow and there was humour in it for a moment well said boy ten lashes instead of twenty let it be done now before your mistress is up darkar he called and the steward came forward with a pair of porters they took me into the courtyard they already knew what had passed and what had really happened darkar tied my wrists to the flogging pole hard and poked me in the side you are a fool and you deserve all twenty blows he said you are playing a dangerous game slave she will do this to you again now that she knows she has the power i took the ten blows with gritted teeth they werent kisses the whole weight of the javelin haft on my buttocks ten times by the tenth it took all my strength not to call out it hurts that much better your arse than your feet though i cried a little afterwards but in the amphora cellar where no one could see me darkar took me there he wasnt a bad man he left me until i was done sobbing and then gave me a bowl of cold water and my chiton you are a fool he told me oh aye i was a fool those ten blows had a profound effect because they reminded me that i was a slave it is one thing to offer to accept punishment to protect a beautiful woman and that was my intention very heroic but it is another thing to take the blows humiliating and painful and the humiliation had only just begun because it was two weeks before i was healed and because archi told every one of his friends and heraclitus exactly what i had done and how i had been punished he began by being indignant on my behalf and ended being pleased to have such an adult story to tell of his slave and that had an effect on our relationship i was a slave penelope avoided me one evening i found her in the water stores and we kissed i thought that all was well but she never came to the fountain i couldnt figure her out kissing me like a hetaira and then pretending she didnt know me when she passed me in the market and neither master nor mistress allowed us out together any more there were other girls there was a redhaired thracian girl who was happy to play at the fountain and i never even knew what house she came from sometimes she would come wrapped in a peplos like a matron but with nothing underneath and that was fascinating too but when i played with her i thought of briseis briseiss face made other women ugly her colours made other women dull her figure this is a disease that i still have honey hah the little archer put his shaft deep in me i doubt that id even want the shaft to be drawn thats how bad i am but time passed and there were other pursuits archi began to practise at the gymnasium he was fast and strong for his age and we sparred constantly every day i think we had oak swords that hurt like blazes when we swung them too hard and we had shields a round aspis for him and a big boeotian shield for me like an egg shape with two round cutouts it was a joke to master he knew i was from boeotia and the shield was the only boeotian thing hed ever heard of we threw spears shot bows and carved each other up with wooden swords at the gymnasium he was paired against other boys his own age and i watched slaves were not welcome to compete in the gymnasium another reminder but in the temple of artemis slaves were welcome to compete by the time a year had passed i had begun to understand heraclituss theory of the logos and to share his suspicion that most men are fools i could never understand why the other boys were so slow to understand his principles so slow to learn the rules of rational argument and so utterly painfully slow in learning the fundamentals of geometry hmm what a pleasure i must have been to have around diomedes was one of the young men of ephesus he was a year older than archi so just about my age and one day hed had enough of being called a dolt by heraclitus after class when we were all pushing down the steps he jostled me i stepped closer he laughed what are you going to do slave hit me he slapped me with his hand open slave go suck archis dick theres a good slave is his mouth good for you archi dear is that why heraclitus loves the boy so much i shook with rage archi laughed youre a bad loser diomedes and if you had fewer pimples i imagine you could arrange to suck a few dicks yourself instead of talking about it archi had that knack as his sister had of biting worse than he was bitten diomedes lunged at archi and i tripped him he fell down the steps in a tangle of chlamys and limbs and was hurt he screamed with pain and his slave a silent boy named arete had to carry him home archi laughed and we went home but two days later a big man with a beard asked after me at the fountain one of the older slaves sent him to me where i was holding court for the younger slaves by that time i was quite the young cock among the little ones no man can be a slave all the time the big man came up out of the dark with a companion of his own size and i knew they were trouble doru slave of archilogos the big man asked who wants to know i asked he went for me he had some training and he had a palms width of reach on me and his companion was already brushing the smaller boys out of his way to get behind me get darkar i shouted at kylix he ran for the house and i took a punch i got away from most of it but the part i took staggered me and the second blow caught my forehead i ducked and ran into the fountain house but they were on me and the slaves inside were as much an impediment to me as they were to the two thugs one had a leather strap and he kept hitting me with it it stung but it was a weapon for terrifying a cringing slave not a weapon for hurting a warrior i took the strap across my kidneys and got my hand on one of the bad planks in the seats and ripped it free now mortal combat is an interesting experience honey i dont think i ever planned to get that plank i ran inside the fountain house from instinct and terror and only terror got that plank off its supports amazing what you can do when terror aids your muscles but once it was in my hands my daimon entered me and i went from terror to attack in the blink of an eye i ripped it clear and hit one of the thugs right in the side of the head and he went down his head made an ugly sound hitting the stone floor too music to my ears and the killer was loose the other man grunted and hit me a light glancing blow on my arm muscles but perhaps the twentieth blow i had taken he was wearing me down i feinted and swung my unhandy club but he was under it and he got an elbow in my gut i stamped a foot on his instep and we were down in the muck that lay over the stones i hit my elbow so badly going down that my left arm was numb then he got my head under his arm and hit me two or three times hard enough to break my nose again and the next shot almost put me out but i was a killer not a victim i grabbed his balls and tried to rip them off and he screamed he thought that he had me with that headlock i got his balls and i dug my thumb in while i ripped and he screamed like a woman in childbirth he lay writhing on the floor and i knelt on his back got my hand under his head and snapped his neck then i went back to the one whose head id hit and i snapped his neck too i swore id tell you the truth honey im a killer when the daimon comes on me i kill and remember the lesson that dead men tell no tales then darkar came demeter boy the steward said he held me at arms length because i tried to hurt him im like that when the spirit of heracles comes on me ares boy youve killed this one i was losing the daimon of combat and i shook my head and my nose hurt he was hurting me i said kylix poured water over my head you killed them both he said and there was awe in his voice darkar looked at the shambles he looked for some time and then he shook his head im sorry boy he said i have to tell master this is more than i can cover i dont know how long it was after my meeting with briseis in the dark but it must have been six months wed just had a trip to lesbos and i was wellliked for a slave hipponax didnt view me as a troublemaker but this time it was dark i was covered in blood and master was standing over me in his own courtyard men attacked him darkar said he sent kylix for me hipponax loomed over me and his cool hands which smelled of beeswax touched my cheek gods get him a doctor darkar was silent what is it darkar he killed them darkar said both of them free men i think their bodies are in the fountain house hipponax knelt beside me they attacked you boy i nodded i could barely breathe i had a broken nose and at least two broken ribs too hipponax rose take him to the temple of asclepius then and dispose of the dead men pay the other slaves for their silence i take it these are not men of property darkar spat scum lord thugs archi came at a run he looked at me and he took my hand artemis doru what happened i was silent but archi figured it out diomedes he said hipponax ignored his son and turned to his steward the fountain is now offlimits to our people dispose of the bodies you may use a cart and a mule thank you lord i said hipponax ignored me to his son he said diomedes will soon be a son of this house are you accusing him of attacking your slave archi shrugged which as i have mentioned is not the way to placate a parent you might take note of that yourself thugater my mind whirled son of this house that meant that diomedes was to marry briseis i vomited on the flagstones after that i was in debt to every slave in the house it took a conspiracy of the whole neighbourhood to keep me safe yes slaves are never friends or perhaps i should say that desperate slaves are never friends happy prosperous slaves in a good house have the time and safety to be friends selfish backbiting friends but friends nonetheless but they hate the masters in their own way someone might have blabbed if anyone had made it worth their while but those two men slave or free they were scum no one came looking for them i began to live with fear in fact i began to think like a slave really think like a slave i began to be very careful about what i said i began to swallow insults those two killings taught me another lesson and i was lucky to get off so cheaply a week in the temple and a year of carrying water and emptying chamber pots and fetching yarn and running errands and minding my words and a twinge in my chest when the rain is coming every time those broken ribs are still with me honey a month later i was back at my lessons diomedes caught me on the steps your nose looks bad he said how could that have happened i didnt even meet his eye i consoled myself that i had killed his thugs i told myself that i would have my revenge but i crawled like a slave and didnt meet his eyes and that hurt more than the beating heraclitus understood something of what had passed he became more careful of his praise for me and at the same time more acerbic in his dealings with diomedes i kept my head down until one day as we rose to leave the steps i found his bronzeshot staff resting against my sternum stay he said he nodded to archi you too when the other boys were gone he looked around whats going on he asked we were both silent as young men ever are in the face of authority his staff pointed at my nose who did that i shrugged heraclitus nodded strife makes change and change is the way of the logos he said a statement id heard a hundred times actually except there and then i think that i understood change is not always good i said rubbing my nose change merely is the philosopher said why are you so good at geometry boy i bowed my head at his praise my father was a bronzesmith i said we use a compass a straight edge and a scribe to lay out our work i knew how to make a rightangled triangle before i came here i shrugged any potter or leatherworker could do as well i expect he shook his head somehow i doubt it so you know how to work bronze i nodded im no master i said but i could make a cup he shrugged hmm he said i am more interested in the properties of fire than in having a cup made i have to say that at some point i had learned that far from being the penniless beggar he seemed heraclitus had been offered the tyranny of the city and his father and brother were lords he was a very rich man he went on fire hardens and softens isnt that true bronzesmith i nodded fire and water to anneal make bronze soft i said but iron hard he nodded so with all strife and all change he said strife is the fire the very heart of the logos some men are made free and others are made slaves i am a slave i said bitterly archi turned and looked at me i never treat you as a slave he said what could i say he treated me as an object every day but i knew that he treated me better than other slaves and a hundred times better than men like hippias treated their slaves but heraclitus was looking out to sea or into the heart of the logos or nowhere most men are slaves he said slaves to fear slaves to greed slaves to the walls of their cities or the possession of a lover most men seek to ignore the truth and the truth is that everything is in flux and there is no constant except change he looked at me it is ironic is it not that you understand my words and you are free inside your head while standing here as a chattel property of this other boy who cannot fathom what we are talking about archilogos frowned im not as stupid as you claim he said hotly heraclitus shrugged what is the logos he asked and archi shook his head change he asked he looked at me heraclitus swatted him best be going home i thought that i understood his message you think that i should not give up hope i said now the master looked mystified what have i to do with hope he asked but he had a twinkle in his eye another winter passed i could calculate inside my head without using my fingers and i could draw a man with charcoal i could put my spear into a target ten horselengths distant no more than a fingers width from the instructors cane pointing where he wanted to see the throw and i was growing to be the swordsman i wanted to be i was strong after all i was getting the exercise of a rich man and for nothing every day i could lift a larger weight stone i could raise it behind my head and over my chest i could lift my body off the floor of the temple with my hands alone i was tall and taller every day and my chest began to grow broad i was strong archi grew too he grew as quickly as i did or perhaps faster suddenly he was as tall and as wide and when we wrestled we could hurt each other and we no longer dared to use oak swords to fight because we could break bones instead we fought as the ephebes fought a spears length apart as if dancing so that each blow was parried without sword and shield ever coming together archilogos loved competition and he never liked to lose so he began to apply himself to his studies and he could suddenly do the geometry i could do and he could solve sums in his head too i hated being a slave but all the same it was a good time adolescents are good at these divisions and indeed heraclitus was full of such pairs of striferiven opposites so at ephesus i was a slave but in many ways i was freer than i ever was again i was poor and had nothing but my coins in the jar in the garden although they were beginning to pile up and yet in just the way heraclitus described i was rich beyond imagining with a young strong body and an agile mind and the company of others like me what young man or woman wants more yes so it was and so another year passed and we worked and played i thought less and less of briseis although every time i saw her and that was seldom my heart beat as if i was in a fight diomedes came to our house to woo her hipponax took care that i should be on errands when this happened not because he knew or would have tolerated my hidden passion but because he suspected who had sent the thugs although i still pursued penelope i understood that she had chosen to put space between us i had other lovers girls who were easier freer and never as much fun and then came the events that broke the pot that held us and smashed the futures we had imagined in our ignorance strife came and with it change it was spring i remember that well because the end of the world began with a day of roses and jasmine and sun and beauty i was seventeen by my reckoning and when i walked through the agora women watched me dont laugh thugater i was once one of those and men watched me as well what cared i if i had been free men would have put my name on pots even as a slave i was kalos kagathos i was beautiful and smart and strong oh the arrogance of youth archi and i were boxing in the garden euthalia watching us from her couch and hipponax lay next to her stroking her as she watched us fight wed been at it for enough time for the waterclock to run out and be refilled we were covered in sweat and euphoric with the daimon of it and then briseis came she seldom entered the centre of the house as an unmarried virgin she kept very much to the womens quarters but that was the week that hipponax had put his seal to her wedding contract with diomedes and she was gathering her trousseau and acting like an adult so she was allowed out she looked like a goddess i say that too often but she was flawless i know now that she must have done it on purpose but she was arrayed in linen and wool worth the value of my fathers farm and the smithy too the smell of mint and jasmine came off her as light as a feather on the air i caught all of this in the same glance that showed me penelope at her heels and earned me a blow to my upper chest archi wasnt distracted by his sister far from it he bore down his blows came thick and fast but he had not had calchas and he had never killed later he became a great warrior a name that was spoken throughout hellas but when i was seventeen he was never my match so i took a few blows and then my right shot out a stopattack into his flurry straight through his guard on to the point of his chin and he staggered briseis clapped mockingly oh archi show me that again she called he held up a hand to me and i bowed then he picked up a pitcher of cold water drank half and tossed the rest over his sister and all her finery she screamed and her right fist shot out as fast as mine and she clipped his head with her blow yet for all that they loved each other and suddenly they were laughing he naked and she with the purple dye leaking off a garment that had cost more than i imagined my father made in his best year now ruined how rich they were she stripped the two garments over her head ionians dont worry about the nudity of women the way westerners do and took a simple linen shift from penelope who blushed when she took it off and gave it to her mistress and ran for something to wear herself no one in the garden was looking at me so i drank in the beauty of briseiss body her high pointed breasts and the lush growth of black hair between her legs i tore my eyes away and glanced around hipponax was spluttering wine at his daughters behaviour and archi was staring after penelope with the same lust with which i was watching his sister and euthalia was watching me her face set in cool appraisal i flinched and dropped my eyes there were rumours in the slave quarters that euthalia was anything but a loyal wife and that hipponax cared little but no one had suggested that her games extended to slaves i was old enough however to know what that cool appraisal meant in an older woman cook looked at me just the same way whether she meant to slap my hand for stealing bread or to get me in her bed my theory is that women who have borne a child learn the same lesson men learn when they face the enemy on the battlefield and that after that they look at you with the same look thats my theory learn what you ask im old and my cup is empty dont read into that honey just pour some wine learn the lesson yourself penelope came back decently covered and briseis stayed enjoying the trouble she had caused when is diomedes coming she asked for the fourth time their betrothal having been signed they would shortly have a ceremony at her hearth and then a party she was an old woman of fifteen and wanted to get on with life hipponax made a face girl we have enough on our plates without you going wombmad to your betrothal party euthalia slapped her husband lightly we have a small problem briseis she said artaphernes has chosen to honour us with a visit in fact he has summoned many of the leaders of ionia great men and famous names to meet here in our city and have a synod she didnt mention that diomedes father was a member of the other faction the independence faction and thus not a man to be delighted to find artaphernes at his sons betrothal party only their mercantile links kept them friends the betrothal had been planned since briseis was born all this went by in the beat of a heart briseis shrugged my betrothal is more important than the bickering of old men she said with a toss of her head her mother shook her head no my dear your betrothal can happen whenever we ordain it these men gather to prevent a war you have no idea what war is dear none of you do she seldom spoke seriously but when she did we listened but inside i thought i have seen war i am from lesbos and throughout my youth the men of mytilene made war on my city farms burned and women raped and families sold as slaves good families if athens storms this city briseis you will be sold in the market to a soldier do you understand briseis couldnt have been more shocked if her mother had hit her athens is a town of barbarians she spat you and pater both say so barbarians with a fleet and an army hipponax said listen dear let us have the conference and then well have the party you will only have to wait a month briseis flicked her eyes around the garden and she found me and blushed then she sat in the chair that dorcus one of the house slaves brought for her and she leaned out over the table to take her fathers wine cup exposing her bare side and causing my whole body to twitch all quite intentional very well pater she said calmly this was so far from her parents expected reaction that her father was literally openmouthed with astonishment the good of ionia is more important than my wedding she said sweetly if we had been on a stage the audience would have seen the furies gathering artaphernes came with a whole regiment of cavalry lydians and persians in separate squadrons the lydians armed with lances and the persians with bows and spears in the agora men complained that he had brought all the soldiers to overawe them and the soldiers were arrogant thrusting out their chests pushing men and flirting with women in every square in the town i watched them curiously they were very different from the hoplites of boeotia for one thing they were the most aggressive womanhunters id ever seen especially the persians and if there was a boylover among them i never met him second they were lazy not at their soldierwork when i visited their camps i saw swordplay and archery of a high calibre but if they were not drilling or shooting they did nothing but swear fight and fuck sorry dear in my day in the west we had no professional soldiers except the spartan nobles and even the spartans occupied themselves with ceaseless athletics and hunting id never seen fulltime soldiers who sat in wine shops drinking spitting and grabbing girls they were tough they were rich too the average persian cavalryman had a groom for his horse and a slave for his kit he had his own tent and perhaps another felt shelter for his slaves and his gear every one of them had bronze and silver cups water pitchers plates id never seen a soldier with so much stuff and they had women in their camps some were wives and some were prostitutes and many seemed to fall in some mysterious only to me gap between the two defined roles they worked hard too harder than the men washing cooking sewing and minding children a persian cavalry regiment was like a travelling town where all the citizens were lords i liked them quite a bit they liked me too most of them had never seen a western greek they were contemptuous of ionians as poor warriors but theyd heard that we boeotians were fighters and i told my war stories to the four men i liked best a pair of brothers and their two friends all from the same small town near persepolis they were lords or they called themselves noblemen and you might well ask why they talked to greek slaves i was in camp on an errand to artaphernes carrying a heralds staff for my master artaphernes had a tent in camp and a lavish establishment and he was sometimes there and sometimes at our house for reasons that were beyond me when he was in camp i was the herald mostly because he liked me and i could get to him faster than other messengers i was picking up a little persian camp persian hardly what anyone speaks at court but i was there every day or two and the delivery of a message to a satrap of persia is never a simple or quick task especially if there is an answer one time i remember cooling my heels all day only to discover that the satrap was already at our house at any rate one day my four persians were on duty outside the satraps tentpalace and after i showed them my staff i entertained them by pretending it was a sword and doing my exercises since i was missing lessons by running errands and darius in those days it seemed that all persians were called darius called out and asked my name im doru i said companion to archilogos son of hipponax i shrugged you have the wrist of a real swordsman darius said he took my heralds staff a pair of solid bronze rods and hefted it id be hard put to do my cuts with this cyrus try your sword arm on this toy he tossed my staff to his brother who caught it they were as alike as statues in a temple portico skin the colour of old wood jetblack hair and clear brown eyes handsome as gods cyrus whirled my staff through some exercises not my exercises so i watched with fascination he tossed it to me lets see you do that boy he said so i did i copied his moves interested in the differences and all four persians applauded and after that we were all friends they were easy men to like and we fenced sometimes they never used shields which made them very different men to face cyrus also taught me a trick that has saved my life fifty times how to kill a man with his own shield have you seen it here you scribe take that shield off the wall i wont eat you and put it on your arm so you do know how to hold a shield good for you my opinion of you just went up now face off against me damn this hip pretend you have a sword now watch honey just like that and ive broken his arm and killed him sorry lad you can get up now useful trick eh all i do is grab the rim of the shield and rotate it theres no man born no matter how strong who can hold the centre of a wheel while i rotate the rim yes this is based on a mathematical principle that i could explain if i was given enough wine but for the moment it suffices that it is true and see how our penpushers arm is in the porpax that bronze strap across his upper forearm so he cant escape his shield once i start to rotate the rim and i break his arm if he was a killer he might gut me with his blade while i break his arm if he isnt and few men are killers thank the gods then i push his now helpless arm and shield rim into his face smash his nose and hes dead see cyrus taught me that bless him they were freegiving harddrinking men and i grew to love them in two weeks they seemed more alive than other men more real they fought duels all the time cutting other persians over fancied or real slights over a misspoken word or a cold shoulder they were dangerous dogs and they bit hard my status as a slave meant nothing to them of course to them all greeks were their slaves which rankled but they were so far above me that i couldnt be offended at their attitude to the ionians an attitude i shared at any rate the summer passed with lessons and struggles i was seeing an aethiopian girl from a house as lavish as ours the lekthantae hereditary priests and priestesses of artemis one of the noblest and richest families of the city salwe was tall and thin and dark like night and while we never loved each other she had a sharp mind and a vicious tongue and we entertained each other in and out of bed i loved going out to the persian camp i loved working through the ever more complex problems of geometry that heraclitus gave me i would sit in the fountain house after master lifted the ban and sing on my lyre and salwe would sing with me her voice capable of curious harmony that she said her people in africa always sang it was a good summer the tyrants of ionia were gathering in the houses of the upper town and so we had dinner with hippias again and dinner with anaximenes of miletus who had replaced the traitor aristagoras as tyrant of miletus aristagoras was reputed to have spoken that summer to the assembly of athens just as hippias predicted and to have been granted a fleet of athenian ships to come and make war on the great king in the name of the rebellion there was no rebellion all the leaders of ionia were in and out of our house and the great cities miletus ephesus mytilene were if not solid in loyalty to the great king at least uninterested in revolt some men wanted war but most of them were penniless exiles it was odd but as a slave i probably knew more about what was happening than the satrap i knew that on the dockside where young men gathered when the ships came in from all over the ionian men spoke of aristagoras as a hero and of athens as a liberator gentlemen and rowers seamen small merchants they were all fired by the idea of independence but the nobles and the rich in the upper town were insulated from this talk just as they were insulated from the gossip of their slaves as the number of incidents between the persian soldiers and the townspeople and the sailors mounted artaphernes was forced to confront the reality that there were people in ephesus many people who viewed any persian as a foe and his soldiers didnt help darius and cyrus thought nothing more comical than to separate a pretty greek girl from her ionian boyfriend by a mixture of force and persuasion that lets be honest young women enjoy some young women at any rate multiply their efforts by a hundred and there wasnt a greek virgin left in the lower town to marry her behorned and already cuckolded man and that is the fastest way to violence the persians were fastidious they didnt rape and they didnt pick on slaves the way greek soldiers will so the slaves didnt mind them but the greeks the smallholders of the lower town killed a few in ambushes and then the swords were out all over town and artaphernes troubles began in earnest it wore him out i saw him every day and ran messages for mistress to him offering him a remedy for headache or sometimes just carrying a verse or a flower i liked running errands for my mistress because she was kind to me gave me money and it was an excuse to be in the womens wing she favoured me and she must have said something because suddenly after a year of forced parting penelope warmed to me again and we were allowed to go out together on errands to the agora and to be together in private this is what i mean my honey when i say that masters have effects on their slaves that they never intend i dont think hipponax ever intended that i never see penelope again nor i think did mistress understand how far penelope and i might go or perhaps she knew exactly what was happening in fact even as i tell this i wonder if she sought to end another liaison one whose discovery hurt me more than anything anyway it was on one of our errands together that i contributed unwittingly to the problems of the town i was in the agora with penelope hand in hand when a man clouted me in the head and sent me tumbling into the muck beneath the tanners stalls penelope screamed once again there were two attackers but this time i was badly hurt if my attackers hadnt been fools id have died one started kicking me and the other grabbed penelope in a crowded agora that was a foolish move she had a healthy scream and she bit him hard unlike a freeborn girl slave girls know just how to deal with attack but i didnt see any of it because my initial attacker had put his foot into my guts and i puked he grabbed my hair and then i was covered in blood cyrus killed both my attackers it was the will of the gods that cyrus and pharnakes his particular friend were in the market looking for trouble and i provided it they killed my assailants with the joy with which men do such things but because there was a greek lying on the ground and a screaming woman many others in the agora jumped to the wrong conclusions as i began to return to my senses an ugly crowd was forming and penelope was still screaming shed never seen a mans intestines before not her fault i got to my feet and had the sense to offer my hand to cyrus and he had the sense to take it mud and blood and all then i embraced penelope and she let me lead her away best come with me lord i said to cyrus and he and pharnakes did as i suggested like good soldiers i led them up the hill and the crowd followed us for a few streets but soon enough we got free after that i was much more careful when i was out of the house diomedes wanted me dead i had forgotten him the very best revenge his betrothal had been put off all summer and i suppose he thought to take it out on me i told hipponax before he went off to byzantium on a short cruise and he told me that he would see to it cyrus told me that it was i who had saved his life by leading them out of the agora and not the other way around and he treated me with courtesy and gave me more lessons as the summer passed my persian got better and by the time hipponax returned from his ship no one else had tried to kill me the conference went on and on the tyrants were not willing to raise men for artaphernes or to give the assurances he wanted nor were they awed by his soldiers most of them were islanders and they had a hard time imagining the great kings cavalry coming to their shores ofttimes when the guards admitted me to the satraps presence i would find him sitting with his head in his hands staring at his work table thats how bad the summer had grown towards the end not that he was ever less than courteous to me and he always paid me a compliment and gave me a tip even when he became my mortal foe i never forgot his basic goodness artaphernes was a man some men are noble by nature honey he was one heraclitus once told us that the value of a man could be measured in the worth of his enemies well if thats true i was doing well one day in late summer i brought artaphernes an invitation from my mistress for dinner we walked back together he usually rode but this time he left his escort in camp and all he had was my four friends in a loose knot about him twice he stopped to speak to common people with petitions he was that kind of man i waited on him at table and archi who was suddenly tall and handsome shared his couch and they talked together like old friends while euthalia plied them both with fine food and too much wine kylix was mixing the wine as thin as he dared but still all three were drunk in fairly short order my four friends were in the kitchen with cook and darkar waiting on them they were lords but they were simple soldiers and they werent offended we were having a fine evening i went back and forth from kitchen to andron and sometimes id carry a joke from the high to the low or even back late in the meal hipponax came in hed taken a new ship to sea that morning to try her and he was back early and none too happy with what hed just seen there was a riot in the lower town he said this was old news to me and shows how little they knew really two of your men dead and five lowerclass people but citizens damn it hipponax shook his head artaphernes you must send those soldiers away before you create the very climate you seek to avoid artaphernes sat up on his couch no man tells me what i must do he said quietly except the great king whose servant i am hipponax smiled its like that is it very well be the satrap lord but those soldiers are doing more harm than good he wasnt drunk thank the gods or we might have had trouble artaphernes shook himself bah im drunk he admitted i need to get out of this cesspool before i do something ill regret his frustration showed and something about hipponaxs arrival set him off he frowned this stinking cesspool hipponax refused to take offence ive never heard sacred ephesus described as a stinking cesspool before he said i must say that it wont make it as a poetical contribution his wife laughed she brought wine to the satrap with her own hands i could smell her perfume from my station heady musky stuff perhaps i will smell less like a cesspool lord she purred you are the only thing worth having in this town artaphernes said hipponaxs eyes met mine i bowed and fetched two slaves to help me move a kline for him and we set him up with a wine cup and some food darkar came up from the kitchen and caught my eye i slipped out you have this under control he asked i shook my head theres something here i dont get i admitted the satrap is angry and hes taking it out on master darkar looked at me with something very like pity i will take your place you go and wait on your young master only and get him to bed as quickly as you can convince him or just feed him wine what of cyrus and the others in the kitchen i asked he shook his head theyre no trouble off to your duty now so i tried to put wine into archi i neednt have bothered he had a head for wine by then and he could probably have gone bowl for bowl with his father but suddenly he smiled at me and shook his head pushing away his bowl im for bed he said darkar shot me a glance but it was none of my doing i escorted my master to bed but he was impatient with me and after a few attempts at conversation i was dismissed i went back to the kitchen to visit my friends i was off duty unless cook or darkar the two senior slaves chose to order me about in fact as i waited on the persians while i chatted to them we were all at our ease i served them wine and they laughed and joked and flirted with penelope when she came through i assumed on an errand for briseis bored in the womens wing and not invited to the party id seldom seen penelope in the kitchen she didnt linger after an hour darkar leaned in and shot me a look i drank off the wine id poured and followed him into the hall he looked flustered and somehow apologetic master is going back to his ship he said i need you to be a porter well thats the life of a slave it wasnt my job but by this time all our porters were asleep or drunk it was a feast day i think i cant even remember where they all were so i went to the portico and hoisted masters bags and followed him through the dark town he didnt say a word the pole star was high by the time we made his ship he exchanged a few terse words with his boatkeeper and walked along the waterside then he whirled on me ill be damned if im to be thrown out of my own house he said as if i had ordained this strange fate i fell back a step oh sorry lad not your fault come on he started back up the hill it was a hard walk but we were healthy men and anything i had on him in youth was balanced by the weight of his sea bags at the portico he put a hand on my shoulder heres a daric he said a fortune a gold daric then suddenly i knew that something was wrong masters dont give slaves a daric for carrying their bags not on purpose anyway go somewhere doru go go and check on archilogos whatever was happening he wanted me gone i bowed took the coin and walked into the house heading into the mens quarters i walked across the hallway that separated the servants and slaves from the family and something automatic obedience i suppose caused me to walk into archis room instead of going straight to my bed he had lamps lit and he was riding penelope she saw me instantly over his back his buttocks pinned between her thighs her mouth slightly open she wasnt unwilling to say the least he didnt see me i flattened against the wall my heart beating as if a horse race was crossing my chest let me say it i had never ridden the girl myself she had been very careful with me and i got a blow to the ear if my fingers strayed but i didnt see red either ive said it before when you are a slave you know that you dont have control of some things such as your body if archi had ever had a mind to have me id have had no choice he took penelope instead and im no hypocrite id been with a girl or two that summer penelope owed me nothing i walked around the corner then stopped and took some deep breaths i dont know how long i stood there longer than i realized because suddenly she was there a shawl over her slipping along the wall of the portico towards the womens side i knew her movements i followed her and called her name she looked back and ran i ran after her i ran right into the womens quarters then everything began to happen in slow motion i was running like a fool and suddenly she stopped in the light of a single hall lamp i saw that there was a man in the hall and that penelope had run into him full tilt he had a sword penelope screamed but i knew him immediately it was master with a sword in my state i took it in without understanding somehow i thought he was there to punish me for entering the womens quarters penelope must have recognized him because she was silent after that first scream and then artaphernes stepped out of the room behind me mistresss room and i understood youve always told me that you never lie master said to artaphernes he had the sword loosely in his hand he was no swordsman and he was calm murderously calm i think he had already dismissed penelope and me as superfluous to the scene penelope backed away from him and into my arms i put a hand over her mouth artaphernes was naked and it was no secret what hed been doing i do not lie he said he was afraid but covering it well why did you have to fuck my wife hipponax asked artaphernes met hipponaxs eyes he shrugged i love her he said and if you kill me ionia will burn hipponax laughed grimly and i knew what he intended let her burn then he said i had spent the last heartbeats with my hand over penelopes mouth and now i pushed her hard into hipponax remember id walked with him i knew he was sober but it was a risk that he would spit her perhaps i did blame her for her little ride shed looked well pleased under archis cock damn her at any rate she was not spitted on masters sword he lifted the blade to keep her safe and i stepped in and stripped it from his hands and then fell to the ground as if i too had stumbled all three of us went down in a tangle artaphernes was no fool he ran everything might yet have been well or well enough but pharnakes came into the corridor with his three friends at his heels they had blades in their hands and as soon as they had their satrap clear they charged us who knows what they thought i had the sword i got to my feet and stopped their rush with a parry and then pharnakes and i exchanged a flurry four or five cuts and parries thats a lot in real combat a man can only take so much and then he falls back the tension is too high we both backed a step and cyrus said its the slave boy hold hard brother in persian i didnt have the daimon in me yet i hadnt been injured our lord is safe darius said lets get out of here pharnakes shook his head we should kill the husband this isnt persia you fool cyrus said greeks dont care and murder is not what our lord needs right now come and try i said in persian aye im a fool pharnakes shot me a look such a look even in torchlight i knew that look but cyrus laughed quite the bark for a pup he said all that was in persian and then they were gone pharnakes was right though they should have killed the husband because that night ephesus changed sides and the ionian revolt began in a corridor in the womens quarters the long war and like the trojan war it started over a woman part iii freedom it is hard to fight with anger for what it wants it buys at the cost of the soul heraclitus fr you bring more of these handsome boys into my hall every day thugater is the tale so good or the opposite so dull that you need supporters to get you through it you are not the first young woman i have known honey dont let the power of your sex go to your head or youll be one of those ambitious harridans who haunt our tragedies dont give your love to every comer either or youll be a priestess of aphrodite and no wife hah im a crude old man do as you will thugater of my old age it is the irony of my life that you grow up to look like briseis what fury what fate put those looks in your mothers womb will we have games to settle your suitors perhaps i can meet them in single combat one at a time until one of them bests me even at my age i think you would be a maiden for some time you blush ah honey when you blush you most resemble my briseis but when she blushed she was dangerous you might think otherwise but my status in the house didnt change at all that day in the morning master called me to him he embraced me and thanked me he never asked me what i was doing in the womens quarters that was all until the next blow fell that was all but in every other way our lives changed because master barred the house to the satrap and artaphernes peace conference collapsed in an evening because every house in the city was closed against him your eyes shine honey do you understand indeed let me explain artaphernes was a guest and a guestfriend persians and greeks are not so different and when a man or a woman becomes a frequent visitor he and the household he visits swear oaths to the gods to support oikia adultery is the ultimate betrayal of the guest oath pshaw happens all the time dont think i havent seen it men are men and women are women but artaphernes was a fool to risk a war on getting his dick wet hah i am a crude old man pour me some wine hipponax did a rare thing he told the city what had happened that was the only punishment he inflicted on his wife he branded her faithless in the assembly from then on artaphernes was a breaker of the guest oath no citizen would receive him he tried for two days to make amends and he offered various reparations hipponax ignored his messenger and finally sent me with a heralds wand to tell artaphernes that the next messenger would be killed indeed there were armed men in every square of the city archi was being fitted for his panoply the full hoplite armour even as i went on my errand those were bad days in the household mistress didnt leave her rooms penelope wouldnt speak to me i admit that i called her a whore perhaps not my best course of action and archi i couldnt fathom whether he knew he had wronged me or not at that age the age you are now honey it is often hard enough to know which way the wind blows eh and any betrayal is magnified by the heat of your blood tenfold yes you know whereof i speak so my head was spinning when i went to the persian camp i was worried that darius would spit me on sight i had dared to cross blades with them i was worried that my harsh message would result in my own execution i was angry that my brave deed and it was brave honey facing four of the great kings men in a dark corridor had received no reward but curt thanks because i loved my master and wanted his approval with all the passion of the young who want to be loved i was desolate that penelope was archis even though i knew inside my head that she had never really been mine i ran up to the persian camp wearing only the green chlamys of a herald and a pair of boeotian boots id never seen anything like them in boeotia but in ionia they were called boeotian they were magnificent they made me feel taller i thought that if i was going to die i should look good the gate guards sent me straight to the satraps tent with an escort the escort halted before the tentpalace and while their officer fetched the palace guards one of the soldiers whispered cyrus wants to see you i am at his service as soon as i have seen the satrap i said if i am alive i added a keen sense of drama is essential to the young artaphernes was writing i couldnt read persian then i waited as his stylus scratched the wax there was an army of scribes with him some persians mostly greek slaves finally he looked up he smiled grimly when he saw me i had hoped hipponax would send you he said i stood straighter you saved my life sweet words to hear from the satrap of lydia i did lord it is true i grinned in sudden relief he leaned forward name your reward free me i said free me and i will hold the deed well done abruptly he sat back and shook his head i have tried to buy you for three days and now hipponax sends you to my camp what am i to think that you are a guest a gift the satrap had tried to buy me that explained much that had passed in the last three days but i was an honest young man mostly he tests you lord artaphernes nodded yes i must be getting to know the greeks i too see it as a test i must send you back or break my masters law and help cause the war i came to prevent name something else i shrugged the only thing i wanted was my freedom i had rich clothes and money but some god whispered to me perhaps like heracles my ancestor athena came and whispered in my ear you owe me a life then lord i said artaphernes sat on his stool playing with his personal signet ring he looked me over carefully as if he was indeed going to purchase me if you are ever free you will be quite the young man he said he took his ring from his finger here a life for a life if you are ever free come and return this to me and i will make you great or at least start you on that road see it i still wear it it is a beautiful ring the very best of its kind carved by the old people from carnelian and set in that red red gold from the highlands see the image of heracles the oldest i have ever seen i fell to my knees and accepted his ring i have a message i said speak herald this was official business and now i was a herald before a king the assembly of ephesus decrees that your next messenger will be executed in the agora i held my bronze wand over my head in the official pose of a herald i waited a look of pain passed over his features he looked older he looked like a man who had taken a wound very well he said go with the gods doru thank you lord i said and walked out of his tent slaves do not offer blessings to masters the four persians were waiting for me cyrus darius pharnakes and silent dour arynam who was always i thought a little drunk i was hesitant about approaching them but pharnakes came and embraced me me a foreign slave and even arynam who had never been my friend like darius or cyrus came and clasped hands as if i was a peer cyrus was right about you he said you saved our lords life you are a man well that was good to hear they all embraced me and pressed me with gifts come with us cyrus said youll be free as soon as we cross the river you can ride ill see to it that the lydians take you as a trooper i was tempted honey id like to say that i was a greek and they were medes and i wasnt going anywhere with their army but when you are a slave freedom is the prize for which you will trade anything to be free and a soldier but i knew that artaphernes wouldnt allow it he wanted any scrap of credit with hipponax and sending me back offered him the hope of reconciliation or so he thought and so i found myself running back down the road to ephesus i had no message except my own return which marked the subtlety of the satrap very well i thought i did have a leather bag full of gifts from the persians i came home to a silent house i stopped in the courtyard amazed by the silence and my first thought was that hipponax had murdered his family men do that when they catch their wives in adultery but they had merely gone all of them slaves and free to the temple of artemis the priestess had asked that all the people gather i ran up the steps with a dozen other latecomers to find the whole of the people crammed like ants inside the temple precinct teams of priests and priestesses were going through the crowd with purifying smoke and water cleansing us no one said right out that euthalia had made us all unclean by having a persian between her legs but she was there standing with hipponax in a dark mantle and she was surrounded by the smoke of a dozen braziers when the ceremony was over she smiled i still wonder at that smile what did she mean by it had she meant all along to be caught at any rate i saw heraclitus and he motioned to me it was odd to see him in public without my young master nearby but i approached still in my heralds cloak the satrap received you he asked yes teacher i said he nodded you have seen war i think i inclined my head i have served as a hoplite i said heraclitus looked around your master is about to go to a different school from mine lad a harsher school where the punishment for failure is death will you take an oath to protect him heraclitus had no idea what my young master had done to me no idea i suspect what had transpired on that night except that he would have known that mistress had been with the persian or perhaps he knew everything young men told him all their secrets in any case he didnt order me to swear i want to be free i said i was suddenly bitter i had done great things for these people and i was still a slave perhaps im a slow learner but for the first time i began to consider that the greater my services were the more valuable i made myself heraclitus looked into the purification smoke do you believe that i can read the logos he asked me i nodded i would have nodded if he had asked me if i thought he was zeus come to earth he smiled doru if you swear this oath and abide by it you will be free i frowned death is a form of freedom i said yes he said listen lad war is not the only thing that faces you and archi this will be a testing time stay and help him pass the test it will help you too will you swear i sighed i had been toying with running to the docks it must have shown i thought that perhaps i could work an oar to athens or find miltiades in thrace but it was a dream and besides besides just at that moment i caught sight of briseis an eddy of smoke revealed her talking to her betrothed my enemy diomedes yes i said i will swear good man we swore together he was a priest of artemis holding one of the hereditary roles he led me into the inner sanctum and showed me the statues and gave me a branch from the sacred tree just a pair of leaves but a sign to show my master where i had been then i went home home was not normal days had passed and all our rhythms had changed mistress never left her room master drank archi took no exercise and that night he pulled me close and burst into tears why has mater done this to us he asked me through his tears no one will speak to me it was true i had seen it in action archi was effectively in exile in his own city none of his classmates would meet his eye and no one invited him to a symposium or a ramble or even a troll through the stews it will pass i said i thought of heraclitus listen master our teacher made me swear an oath to support you these will be tough times im here archi was holding me tight and suddenly he sobbed i betrayed you as surely as mater betrayed pater he said i knew she was yours i wanted her oh doru forgive me i sat on his couch and held him i did not want to forgive him in fact now that hed confessed that he knew what he was doing i wanted to knock his head off but penelopes face had not been the face of a slave being taken against her will i had some experience with women by then women can pretend many things but few of them pretend when they think no one can see them all this went through my mind penelope is a slave but she is her own woman she wanted you not me why not i said bitterly i am just a slave pitying ourselves we wept foolish boys we were about to learn what tears are really for but when our eyes were dry we were better friends and the next day archi called penelope to him while i was in his room he did it without warning and when she came he shrugged and left the room she looked like a trapped animal like a doe run down by dogs on the flanks of cithaeron her eyes followed archi as he walked out of the door and that gave her away she really liked him perhaps she loved him or just saw him as a chance for liberty im sorry i almost got you killed i said i was stiff and formal i understand that you prefer my master i wont bother you again she turned her head away then she looked back you arent even really a slave she said youre like a man who plays at being a slave you will die for it and i will weep for you but i wont be your lover archi is kind and i think hell free me when im pregnant none of that made much sense to me although it does now i said she was smart she saw things i didnt see for all my reading and training so i shrugged and she bowed her head and left the room without speaking we should have embraced but we were too young to forgive and forget i was still standing there when i heard a scream from the courtyard i ran i thought we were being attacked remember that apart from my life as a house slave and companion i was already a man of violence and that diomedes seemed to have a bottomless purse when it came to sending men after me when i reached the courtyard hipponax was standing stonyfaced staring at a man dressed in the same green chlamys id worn a few days previously briseis was screaming her face contorted all her beauty gone penelope was trying to drag her away the herald backed out of the gate penelope looked terrified briseiss face was the face of a fury deep lines carved across her smooth brows as she wailed with screams of pain her father glanced at her and turned away poor man he had nothing to offer her gods send that i never be in his place archi tried to hold her and she began to fight him and she landed a blow a foul blow she was a good fighter that girl down he went and then she spat like a wild cat and raked her nails across penelopes chest i thought they were her nails and blood flowed she screamed again i thought she was having a fit i took her down i wasnt her brother and much as i thought i was in love with her she was a danger to everyone in the yard i swept her feet and held her arms and put her down on the ground hard enough to drive all the breath from her she had the strength of a goddess but no palaestra skills and on her way to the ground i rolled her in the end of her own peplos to pin her arms she ripped her left arm free and her nails drew blood from my cheek and neck but when she wrenched her head back with superhuman strength a hand shot out and smacked her across the face once and then again silence girl her mother said i had not seen euthalia in days she was neatly dressed in sombre colours and she did not look as if her life had ended briseis sat back on her haunches and the daimon left her i saw it leave her eyes it takes one to know one but then the bitterness exploded its your fault you faithless bitch she said to her mother he called me a whore diomedes called me a whore in public now ill die barren hes broken the marriage contract she didnt cry crying would have been better than her imperious selfpity if you hadnt been so busy riding the persians cockbird i might be a matron euthalias hand shot out and snapped her daughters head back again be civil or take the consequences she said i cant even blame him briseis cried and for the first time her voice cracked and she began to sob instead of scream my mothers a whore ill be a whore too i should kill myself penelope was cowering she had a bad scratch across her breast and her doric chiton was filling with blood she was sitting on a step crying i saw now that briseis had a pin in her hand she had ripped penelope with it and me too i realized euthalia reached into her bosom and her right hand came out with a knife in it here she said get on with it this was the family that i had so envied when i joined them briseis picked up the knife and ran her thumb across it like a man getting ready for sacrifice then she stepped towards her mother and i felt that her intentions were plain i stepped in on her and raised my left hand as cyrus had taught me she tracked the hand with the knife and not the body and i caught her wrist and disarmed her she got the pin into my chest but the gold bent and i only took a fingers breadth it was cold in my chest and the pain made me want to kill her just for a moment the pain and the urge to kill balanced against the knowledge that this was briseis she saw the daimon come into my eyes and her own widened as i have said it takes one to know one but those eyes saved her and i took control of my body with my left hand closed around her throat her mother was shaken close up i could see that her hair was not dressed and she was not herself but she would not relent take the knife and finish it she mocked you think your life is ruined little princess perhaps it is time a dose of reality came into your life you despised diomedes when you had him you are acting there is a world bigger than that inside your head wake up archi stepped in between them i still had briseis and she had dropped her gold pin of her own volition take her to her room he said he nodded to me suddenly we were allies i obeyed lifting briseis and carrying her penelope came after us she was holding her side she got ahead of me and led the way which was as well as i had no idea where briseiss room was briseis put her arms around my neck and let me carry her without struggle she smelled of jasmine and mint it was hard to imagine while carrying her that she had just intended to kill her mother with a knife we pushed though a curtain of glass beads into a room painted in scenes of gods and goddesses fine work archis room was plain white with a border of heras eyes painted around the cornice briseiss room had all the gods done as vignettes hera stood with mighty zeus a loving couple painted as her mother and father her brother was apollo with a lyre and she was artemis with a bow penelope was aphrodite and darkar was a mighty pluton diomedes was painted as a young and rather ambiguous ares and then i saw that i too was in the pantheon as heracles a club on my shoulder and a lion skin draped over me i didnt know the rest of the figures but it was good work excellent work the figure of aphroditepenelope was unfinished and the paints were there along one wall the room smelled of marble dust and oxblood despite everything adultery betrayal drama i stopped and looked at the paintings on the wall i took in the paint pots and the smell your work i asked penelope amazed hers penelope said i need a bandage she said and fled i laid briseis on her bed she was crying i knew that sound that was despair the sound new slaves make when they are taken the sound you make when your life is taken away from you i actually pitied her so i put a hand on her back it will get better i said she rolled over and her eyes held anger not sorrow kill him for me she said kill diomedes you have no idea what it is like to be alone with briseis i didnt slap her or run from the room but neither did i agree i cannot kill him for you despoina i said i remember smiling but i could hurt him for you she brightened immediately you could she asked really hurt him she reached out and took my hand and a flame licked me from my palm to my groin and up to my head if i hurt him will you stop this foolishness of hating your mother i asked diomedes is a piece or horse shit you lost nothing in losing him your mother did you a favour her eyes widened i had never thought of that she said her hand was still stroking mine i know archi hates him and he tried to hurt you didnt he he bragged of it to me and penelope said you were too tough to be hurt by a thug she smiled at me oh the flattery of a beautiful woman lets look at this as adults thugater she never wanted diomedes but she was dutiful enough she certainly wanted to be an adult and she liked the attention but being jilted was turning out to be better more drama who wants to play the dutiful wife when you can be medea and i played into her hands all reasonable knowing and male zeus soter honey she played me like a kithara i pulled my hand out of hers and left the room then i went to find archi he was making love to penelope i found darkar instead see to briseis i said and then i understood you knew archi was doing penelope i said he nodded and shrugged i shrugged back thanks for trying to keep it from me anyway i said i suppose but i know darkar looked at me for a moment come into my office he said and when i was in he closed the door his office was a tiny room under the cellar stairs where he did the household accounts you seem to know everything he paused listen boy you have a level head if we arent careful this household will fall apart and if it does if master kills mistress if briseis kills herself we will all be sold understand me it is not just our duty to keep them all apart until things get better its for our own skins too ares i said is it that bad i drugged masters wine the night the night it happened and every night since darkar had hollows under his eyes hes going to kill her we should give him something else to think about i said like war with persia darkar shook his head i thought that would happen but its worse not better i shrugged i was seventeen and i didnt want to be responsible for the happiness of a household i have a task to do i said darkar nodded can i count on you he asked i swore an oath to artemis to support them i said he smiled good man go on your errand what did she tell you to do she told me to kill diomedes i said he stroked his beard you cant kill him but i can hurt him i said his father would have you killed he said not if archi comes with me i said im waiting for him to finish consoling penelope darkar was a hard man his eyes glinted in the lamplight that would help the household he said people will know we are still standing i approve he looked at me you could still end up dead though i laughed even then i had begun to feel the power i was not going to die in some night squabble in ephesus an hour later archi was done with penelope and i walked in on them with a clean chiton for her and clothes for him it may have been the most courageous moment of my life it was hard to meet her eyes she was naked entwined breast to breast with him and all but purring she had wept and been comforted and they smelled of sex master i need you now i tossed clothes and a towel at penelope i am sorry to intrude i raised a hand something a slave never does and silenced my master i have consulted with darkar we need to strike diomedes we need to show the city that we are not dead as a household he insulted your sister he might have broken the match in a dignified manner but he called her a whore lets punish him archi met my eye and smiled bless him he understood immediately this is for my sister he said for all of us i said for your mother too penelope looked at us you are a slave she said you cannot punish a free man i ignored her archi nodded lets get him how do you propose we do it hell be in the agora or the gymnasium bragging shaming her and excusing himself you know him you know what hell do on and on to everyone he meets we take kylix as a spy hell watch the fucker we follow him when he leaves for his dinner catch him in a street and beat the shit out of him pardon my language honey thats how men speak when they are ready for violence archi pulled a chiton over his head and i pinned it for him penelope was wiping herself with the towel i watched her she turned her back and blushed archi took his new sword from a peg on the wall i shook my head in those days i assumed that every man had the same daimon i had we arent going to kill him master i said he has thugs archi said of course id been going back and forth to the persian camp for weeks id missed a change diomedes father agasides had hired him a pair of thracians as guards in fact like most of the gentlemen of the city he was hiring bodyguards to increase his fighting strength if persia came but diomedes flaunted his pair of thracians everywhere i rubbed my chin we cant just kill his thugs i asked your father archi shook this off you have the right of it doru we need to strike back just killing his thugs might be enough but we have to get them or theyll keep us off him right youth has its own logic it isnt like the logic of the assembly or even the phalanx archi was angry and penelope had made him brave and she was right there bolstering his desire to be strong in youth logic we had to put those men down poor bastards a pair of thracian slaves with clubs it was three hours later and diomedes was heading home hed bragged so long and so loud about the insult hed given us that wed heard him in the agora ranting like an orator kylix tracked him for us and we were waiting when he turned off the broad avenue of the artemision and cut up the hill through an alley that ran between the looming walls of rich mens yards diomedes saw me first i was lounging against a wall cleaning my nails with a knife that cyrus had given me in my bag of gifts look who it is he said the cocklicker get him boys sometimes the gods are kind and hubris is the worst of sins diomedes had in a single day spurned a guestfriendship broken a solemn vow and bragged of it in the public places the two thracians were big men and tattooed like warriors although slavers often tattoo a peasant to get a better price they split up and came at me quickly no nonsense one on either side i backed past the gatehouse of the next house and then turned and attacked going for the thracian on the left the thug on the right tried to take me in the flank and archi emerged from the shadow of the gatehouse and gutted him it was archis first kill and it took him out of the fight he just stood there blood dripping from his blade as the man writhed and screamed from the thrust into his kidneys the other man swung his club and i backed away a step as they taught in persia and greece both and then i swayed in and cut his wrist with the knife and he dropped the club but i was still moving right foot past left foot down cut and suddenly he was sitting in the street with his guts around him i dont think they had earned their tattoos i fought thracians later real thracians and they were and are scary bastards who will swing at you when their lungs are full of blood diomedes turned to run but kylix tripped him before he could get to his feet i was on him archi was recovering although he was white as athenian leather i killed him he said and then i killed him if you so much as touch me my father will have you ripped apart by dogs diomedes said dont touch me i might be polluted by a family of prostitutes he was a fool we really should have killed him i grabbed his nose between my thumb and forefinger and broke it with a vicious twist id seen a slave do it to another slave in the pits bring your dogs i said archi kicked him in the groin while he writhed in the muck his nose pouring blood he kicked him quite a few times in fact it was then i discovered that my master wasnt any nicer than i was we beat him pretty badly ill save you the details except that when we were finished we took a jar of briseiss paint and tied him to a pillar in the portico of aphrodite and painted i suck dicks for free on his back while he wept why the portico of aphrodite thats where men sold their bodies in ephesus the boys cleared out while we did our work they knew a revenge beating when they saw one we sneaked back into the house by the slaves entrance we thought i think that if we werent caught coming in hipponax would swear to our innocence or some such adolescent foolishness the whole house was dark it was late dinner had been served and wed no doubt been missed so much for our socalled plan and we were both covered in mud and blood and worse i got archi past the kitchen where darkar was talking in a low voice and to his room ill get you water i said bathhouse he said i need to wash my soul but then he smiled it wasnt a boys smile or a nice smile but it was a brothers smile not a masters you need to be clean if youre caught theyll kill you me i can take the weight frankly i agreed ill bathe first then i said i slipped out of the door and down the hall into the kitchen cook was leaning on the counter talking to darkar darkar understood everything as soon as he saw me burn it he said pointing at my chlamys i dropped it in the kitchen fire and cook piled wood on top squandering shavings and bark prepared for firestarting to make the bloodsodden thing burn all my extra work and helpfulness and popularity had come to this darkar and cook conspiring to keep me alive i need a bath and then archi needs one i said darkar squinted at my use of the young masters name he says its death if im caught but mere annoyance for him so i bathe first i pulled my chiton over my head a work chiton of raw wool and no loss to anyone kylix was in the kitchen by then and i handed it to him go and give this to the ragman i said better yet just throw it on his pile darkar nodded bath is hot cook put in you got the bastard this is the ultimate sign of a good house the slaves are loyal to the masters revenge like the odyssey i told them where he was they wont find him until morning i said maybe some spartan visitor will come and bugger him that got a nervous laugh the kitchen was filling up with slaves i hadnt told kylix not to spill to his friends he was already spreading the whole tale he told it to the slaves at the fountain when he took the cloak to the ragmans pile too thats the world of slaves word gets around we hadnt considered that darkar shut them up and pushed me out of the door you what he asked as he pushed me towards the bathhouse you what i told you i said darkar was alone with me in total darkness the bath was like that no windows he smacked me hard in the head i thought youd have the master beat him not you boy ouch lo the mighty warrior the steward hurt me more than the thracians had you will be killed do i have to remind you that you are a slave you scout for him you take a blow for him but you do not strike a free man darkar slapped me again this time at random because he couldnt see any better than i could then after a pause in the dark i think youll have to run or die with that he left me to the bath it was a big oak tub the kind where men crush the grapes at harvest time when they dont have stone basins it leaked slowly but it held enough water for two to bathe together archi and i had shared it many times but covered in blood a man doesnt really want to touch anything much different from a feastday bath there was pumice and oil and i worked hard i knew i had blood under my nails and in my hair even then even as a slave i had long hair i was washing my hair when the door opened the bath was in a low shed and that door let a little light in from the kitchen windows so i saw penelopes robe fall to the floor then she was in the bath with me and water sloshed over the sides and on to the floor if you imagine that i was going to take this moment to protest about her faithlessness while her naked skin was under my hand you dont know what it is to be young i put my mouth on hers before she could speak and she laughed into my mouth not something she had done before perhaps i should have cared that she was unfaithful to my master and now i think my friend archi instead i half stood and half sat with her astride me and we kissed and kissed her breasts against my chest and the hot water up to our hair her kisses were clumsy at first and then warmer and deeper my hands roved her and then she planted herself on me her choice and perhaps i had a qualm or a suspicion that this was wrong because i remember that i hadnt pushed into her it makes me smile though hah the gods are often kind and aphrodite chose to send me to tartarus with a glimpse of heaven when we were finished we kissed and kissed and kissed darkar called my name from the back door penelope slipped out of the tub picked up her robe and vanished not a difficult trick in the dark i was sore and happy and suddenly clearheaded and i had the taste of cloves in my mouth i got over the side of the tub and thought that on a normal night thered be trouble from cook for making such a mess of the bathhouse then i grabbed the olive oil doused myself and strigiled as fast as i could i went through the kitchen as clean as a newborn darkar tried to slow me down but i passed him and went into the hall penelope was crying in archis arms archi was still covered in blood and crap and so was penelope and her hair wasnt wet a chill went through me like a rainy wind in winter blowing across my soul in my nose i discovered the scent of mint and jasmine the hair began to stand up on the back of my neck archi let go of penelope you look worse not better penelope looked at me youll both be killed she said oh aphrodite oh mistress of animals who had i just been with in the bath i am afraid i admitted to archi i just didnt tell him why you must go and bathe stay where you are hipponax said from behind me i assume that darkar told him we were young and stupid we had not thought through the consequences and the game of revenge has no rules hipponax looked at his son archilogos met his eyes they were the same height by then what have you done he asked archi shrugged ive mentioned what i think of this as a gesture from child to parent eh what have you done he shouted archi smiled what needed doing he said diomedes called my sister a whore and we made him one well not precisely but it made a good line and then hipponax surprised me i should have known he was always a good man and a poet he understood rage and lust and the human and the divine he stood back from the doorway so that darkar could enter you must go away he said tonight now i will have a ship manned then there was a flurry of packing and crying archi took his panoply and his sea bag and i took mine he went for a bath and hipponax took me aside heraclitus tells me you swore an oath to protect my son he said i nodded i raised my eyes to his here is your freedom i expect you to keep that oath as does heraclitus until the end of the war you stand by him but as a free man diomedes will have to try you at least i wrote out your manumission for yesterday a friend will witness it in the morning as if it had been done yesterday he shook his head i should have freed you for what you did with the persian he said is all my family cursed i stood silent awed by his generosity and conscious of what i had just done in the bath the furies were laughing and sharpening their nails but i was free it was worse when archi went to say goodbye to his sister worse because she wept real tears without anger she loved her brother better than the rest of us i think and worse because her hair was wet she looked at me several times and her look was one of calm triumph she was beautiful thugater i have never doubted the presence of the gods in that moment in that look from that damphaired girl the long dark shaft and the barbed point of the arrow that comes from aphrodites bow went through me and the pain was never sweeter even when hipponax announced to the whole oikia that i had been freed even when all the slaves crowded around me and penelope took my hand and gave it a tentative squeeze all i could see were her eyes that glance i see it still im an old fool forget me imagine what it was like for poor penelope honey her free lover was leaving her her chance of freedom was walking away and archi said nothing i think hipponax might have freed her had archi asked but he didnt he wasnt bad my master just a selfcentred ephebe who thought hed just made himself a hero the pole star was high and the oarsmen grumpy and drunken had been roused from their brothels to their oars but by luck the trade trireme thetis was supposed to leave the north beach with the sun anyway bound for lesbos with a cargo of cyprian copper and some finished armour for the gentlemen of methymna we walked down through the town in the first light and boarded kylix carrying our gear for all we knew diomedes was still tied to his pillar i wondered if by putting him there i had made sacrifice to aphrodite so that she granted me briseis as the sea wind blew my hair i let myself think that i had kissed briseis in the bath and what word suffices did i possess her never if anyone was the owner it was she did i take her no mens words for sex are often foolish youll find honey briseis was more like a goddess than a woman and then as the good salt wind blew over me and the rain squalls danced to the north towards where miltiades might be rising from his bed it suddenly struck me i was free archi was next to me at the bowrail over the box where marines might ride in a fight today it was full of bull hides for aspides every item between our benches had to do with war the world was going to war and i was free im free i said archi punched me in the back you are he said will you leave me at methymna it is odd looking back across the years at that boy oh aye id have put my fist in a mans face for calling me a boy then but i was and my actions shout it but in that moment i knew that i was free and i had no idea who i was or what i wanted no thats not right either what i wanted was briseis hah more wine thats all i wanted and all i could keep in front of my eyes and then there was the little matter of my oath to artemis to defend hipponax and archilogos for all that home plataea had begun to seem sweeter the sudden heady unwatered wine of freedom washed that dream away i shook my head i couldnt tell archi that i loved his sister no i said i promised your father id watch you for a while archi smiled well thats not so bad i guess he said but his smile said it was anything but bad i bent and started to look at the armour we were carrying the breastplates were bronze and they were unfinished but they had fancy decoration worked in the waist and closure left undone so that the final fitting could be made by a local smith i shook my head mediocre work i said i want better i want a panoply i assume were going to fight the persians archi grinned we embraced it sounded like fun we were young ive already said that i think lesbos is the prettiest island in ionia and i still think methymna is the handsomest town in hellas i always swore that if plataea sent me into exile id go and be a citizen in methymna shes no ephesus methymna sits high above the sea yet the sea is at her doorstep methymna is where achilles landed and took the first briseis as his war bride the beach is black and the town rises to a high citadel on the acropolis that has foundation stones laid by the old people or giants the town itself climbs the hills and sits below the fortress where the lord lives that fortress is the only reason the men of methymna are not serfs of mytilene it is almost impregnable indeed only achilles has ever taken it we beached on the black gravel and kissed the first good ground the beach was full of hulls twenty stretching along to the east each black ship with its own fire and two hundred men so that the beach itself was like a city i went to a shrine to aphrodite and said a prayer that briseis would not quicken archi found the customers who had ordered his goods and began putting things ashore it was early afternoon before we had the benches clear we sold every hide we brought and every ingot of copper that hadnt been ordered i saw that archi had kept a full ingot back i raised an eyebrow and pointed your armour he said you can pay an armourer and have your metal too i clasped his hand thanks i said i couldnt think of a jibe worth giving then we climbed into the town up the steep streets some with more steps than a temple and explored leaving flowers at the shrines later we went back to the beach to meet the other shipowners the men on the beach were athenian when they learned we were from ephesus one of their helmsmen came up to us and joined us where wed started a fire to feed our rowers heraklides was a short powerful man with sandy blond hair and a nononsense manner he looked at our helmsman and spoke to him and our man sent him to archi they clasped hands and archi had me fetch a cup of wine slavery doesnt just fall away from you by the time id returned theyd exchanged all the formulas of guestfriendship captains were always careful that way when you meet a man on a beach you want to be sure of him i handed them both wine and then defiantly poured my own archi smiled doru this is heraklides of athens senior helmsman of aristides or athens he commands three ships archi was excited arimnestos of plataea i said son of technes technes the warcaptain of plataea the older man asked his clasp tightened aye you have the look lad every man who stood his ground against the fucking euboeans knows your father i wept on the spot without preamble as if id been struck i was free and on the first beach i landed as a free man i met men who knew my home and honoured my father heracles was with me even in the name of our new friend i was there i said perhaps more coldly than was warranted i saw him fall suddenly i was chilled on the beach and afraid as if it was all happening again archi looked at me as if hed never seen me before you were there heraklides asked he wasnt exactly suspicious but he gave me a queer look he died there was a fight over his body aye he said peering at me i remember you you took a blow eh we sent you home in a wagon my uncle miltiades said you were to get special treatment we sent you home with your cousin cimon simon simonalkes i said and a terrible suspicion came to me i fell at the bridge when they tried to strip paters armour i said when i awoke i was a slave in a pit that took him aback he looked at archi archi shook his head ive never even heard this story he said we just freed him the day before yesterday he looked at me why didnt you tell me i drank some wine i knew pater was dead but there is knowing and knowing heraklides shrugged aye i too was a slave for a year when pirates took my ship whats to tell masters dont give a rats shit eh he nodded at me thing is youre free now miltiades will want to know he was an admirer of your father eh ive met lord miltiades i said but i had to sit my knees grew weak and down i sat on the sand unmanned its all very well to say i never mourned pater in a way thats all crap cold bastard that he was he was my father and the next thought that came unbidden unworthy was that the farm was mine and the forge mine not anyone elses i needed to get my arse home and see what was what because if theyd sent me home with cousin simonalkes why then what if the bastard had sold me into slavery himself that thought came to me from a dark fog as if the furies were signalling my duty through a cloud of raven feathers what if he was sitting on my farm eating my barley i stood up so quickly that i bumped my head against archis chin where hed leaned down to comfort me i think id have gone for home that very night that hour if i could have walked or and the gods were there if there hadnt been war but war was all around me and ares was king and lord of events i took to heraklides very quickly most men whove been slaves never admit to it you flinch every time i mention it honey he had it worse than me pirates and a lot of ill treatment but it never broke him and youll get to know him as the story goes on he was a few years older than me but young to be a helmsman already and getting a name as one of the best he wasnt really any relation of miltiades at all but his fathers brother had died in the family service and that made them like family athenians are like that the athenians were on their way to miletus because aristagoras had convinced them that the town was ready to revolt that evening over roast pig i met aristagoras for the first time a few weeks ago wed called him the traitor of the ionians running off to athens revolting against the king of kings and now i was standing behind him on a beach of black sand and toasting the success of the war he was not the leader i would have chosen he was handsome enough and he pretended to be a solid man a leader of men bluff and honest but there was something hollow about him i saw it that night on the beach even with everything at the high tide of success he looked like a stoat peering around for a bolthole he promised them all the moon greeks can be fools when they hear a good dream and ionian independence was like that what did ionians need with independence they were hardly oppressed by the medes and the persians the taxes laid by the king of kings were nothing nothing next to the taxes that the delian league lays on them now honey more wine youd have thought that persians had come to methymna and raped every virgin the men on the beach were ready for war they had their own ships and theyd already met with their tyrant and held an assembly methymna manned only three ships but they were all joining the athenians and so were the eight ships from mytilene and you knew back then that if the men of methymna and mytilene were on the same side something was in the wind but what really excited the athenians was that ephesus mighty ephesus had sent the satrap packing we could have this war over in a month the athenian leader said he too was no miltiades in fact at the ripe old age of seventeen i looked at the athenians good men every one and the rest and thought that we were forming a mighty fleet but we didnt have a man as good as hipponax or artaphernes or cyrus for that matter to lead even a seventeenyearold is right from time to time i never did get that panoply made and that ingot of copper sat in our hull as ballast well youll hear soon enough until she went to the bottom none of the smiths in methymna were armourmakers they made good things their bowls are still famous but none had ever shaped the eyeholes on a corinthian i did buy an aspis though not a great one but a decent one we took on a cargo of men men of methymna we took the hoplites who hadnt made the grade to go on the towns three ships archi counted as a lord of the town he was a property owner there and his mothers people were citizens so they treated us as relatives a trireme can take about ten marines more if you dont plan to do a lot of rowing fewer if you plan to stay at sea for days and days when you fit a fleet you pick and choose your marines at least in ionia its different in athens as i may have cause to explain later if i live to tell that part even little methymna had three hundred hoplites her ships rowed away with thirty of them we took another ten and left good men on the beach then we cruised south weathered the long point by the hot springs and beached at mytilene we picked up ships there and drank wine it was more like a party than a war the next night we were on chios i had rowed all day and felt like a god the rowers were all paid men but one was sick with a flux and i wasnt proud i was free heraklides approved and offered me a place on his ship hard to be a free man with your former master he said he made a motion that suggested that he assumed we were lovers no i wont show you i laughed i swore an oath i said one thing all greeks respect from sparta to thebes and all the way to miletus is an oath will miltiades join us i asked he rubbed his beard heh he said good question miltiades is fighting his own war in the chersonese you might say hes been fighting the persians for five years in ephesus heraklides we called him a bandit i said heraklides grinned aye well one mans pirate is another mans freedomfighter right enough he laughed and you can drop the formality and call me herk everyone does that gave me something to think about miltiades was a soldier a real soldier and he wasnt coming and herks friendship was worth something the next night we were on another chian beach the chians had a lot of ships and a lot of men and they were powerful and had never been conquered they were going to have seventy or eighty hulls to put in the water the athenians were delighted and decided to wait the local lord pelagius declared a day of games on the beach and offered prizes really good prizes so that even archi wanted them there was a full panoply for the winner spectacular stuff a scale shirt the smiths nightmare six months to make the aspis was fair nothing spectacular but with a worked bronze face to it and the helmet was fine although not as good as the shirt and nothing on my fathers work there was a race in armour just becoming the fashion then as well as a fight with swords wrestling and javelinthrowing i was a free man and archi encouraged me so we walked down the beach to where lord pelagius had his ship pulled in by the stern we wrote our names on potsherds while his steward watched us and the lord himself came up an old man as old as i am now but sound now theres a pair of handsome boys that the gods love to watch compete youll race he asked archi archi had the best body of anyone our age he had surpassed me in size by a fingers breadth and his muscles had a sharp edge that mine never had we both blushed at such praise well enter all the contests archi said the old nobleman smiled but he shook his head not the swordplay lads thats for men archi nodded but that was my best event i thought in my youthful arrogance i spluttered fancy yourself a swordsman do you the old man asked he peered at me well you look old enough to take a cut if theres a place left ill put you in but we dont fight past the first cut and if you die or kill a man its your fault we expect careful men not wild boys i blushed again and nodded ive trained since i was ten lord i said he looked at me again really he said and smiled that might be worth seeing archi put an elbow in my ribs as we turned away trained since you were ten the gods will curse you for a liar my friend even though you are the best sword i know archi was a typical master hed never asked where i came from or what id done never i loved him like a second older brother but he never knew me well we walked back along the beach and i was pleased to see men looking at us and i think taking our measure games are good competition is good thats how men measure themselves and others the games were still a few days away though so i walked around the promontory to exercise alone i had a sword of my own although nothing like what i wanted it was short and heavy a meat cleaver i wanted a longer thrusting blade because thats what id learned with but ares had not seen fit to help me when id worked up a healthy sweat and swum it off in the ocean i walked back slaves cooked for us and that made me think every time i took bread from a boy that i was lucky and free honey once youre a slave you never forget it anyway heraklides came and sat with me how many ships does athens have i asked my new friend mmm he said a hundred he answered before spotting a pretty chian girl up the beach i let him go athens had a hundred ships and miltiades alone or with his father had another twenty then there were other athenian noble families with ten or fifteen ships of their own athens was halfcommitted to the ionians not even half they sent a tithe of their strength i had spent enough evenings listening to artaphernes to believe him when he said that the weight of persia would crush the greeks like so many lice between his fingers he always said this in sadness never in boastfulness i looked at our fleet and it seemed very great to me we filled the beach at chios and by the time the levy came in and all the chian nobles and traders brought their warships we had a hundred hulls i counted them myself that night while men sang ionian songs around the fires and chased chian girls up the sand i sat on my new aspis with archi i think athens is using us i said archi laughed stop being a slave he said which made me angry these men have great souls i have talked to a dozen of the athenian captains and they are gentlemen why one or two of them are rich enough to be ephesians i shook my head stung by his slave comment and sure that he was wrong athenians are the most grasping bastards in the world i said i had watched the slow seduction of plataea i had been there as miltiades brought the men of plataea to his way of thinking i could imagine him doing the same from island to island across the aegean archi sat back took a long drink of wine from a skin and laughed were going to go home heroes he said has it occurred to you that were going home just weeks after we left diomedes wont be over his injuries yet his father will be panting for revenge niobes children will be nothing on us archi i was growing louder and angrier because his good humour and cheerfulness were like the feathers on a herons back and my words rolled off him archi laughed i understand that you are a good companion warning me of dangers ahead but im the hero i wont be worried you can whisper good advice in my ear and ill use my spear to cut my way to glory he looked very much the hero on that beach by firelight hed been homesick for the first few days but he loved the sea life camping on beaches and drinking wine by the fire every night soon well be home he said watching a pair of chian girls run by their oiled hair swinging and their linen chitons plastered to their bodies one looked back over her shoulder she knew just how to play the game archi shot me a look then he rose to his feet and chased her her companion flicked me a glance and then came nearer she was younger and seemed too shy for her business not interested i said gruffly she stood there i drank wine and saw in my minds eye the persian fleet crushing us against the coast i must have been the only seventeenyearold on that beach who wasnt chasing a girl im a killer and i lie sometimes and my stories go on and on but i have never been called inhospitable so when a hundred heartbeats had passed and she squatted by our fire and began to play with the embers i poured my bronze cup full of wine and handed it to her she was sitting on her haunches a very unladylike posture id never even seen a slave do it careful i said no water i sat back on my shield curious about the chian girls are you a porne she spat my wine in the sand put down my cup and jumped up no she said and fuck you sorry i said i stood up stay and drink the wine i thought that you and your sister were prostitutes thats an apology she asked some alien stranger calling me a prostitute but she squatted down again and picked up the cup id slap you but your wines too good i sat back down theres bread olive oil and fish i waved around the fire we were messy and our baskets were spread over three or four oxhides of beach men only learn from long campaigns to be tidy when they camp and we were as raw as an ingot of copper she wandered from basket to basket picking a dinner it was getting dark but i could see that her chiton showed the signs of hundreds of washings with that patina of old dirt and hard work that a garment gets when it is worn and worn i remembered my own chiton at home in plataea she wasnt beautiful she wasnt exactly pretty but her legs were long and muscular and the angle of her hip pushed against her chiton her face was too pointy and her eyes were a little too close together but she was quickwitted and bold without being rude a good thing in a woman if i told my brother you thought i was a prostitute hed kill you she said were fishermen my father and my brother will pull oars for lord pelagius she smiled under her hair which was long black and heavily oiled hes big she rolled some of our fish in bread poured a little oil on top and went back to her odd squat by the fire eating her meal with satisfaction she licked her fingers when she was done i thought that she was like a cat a kitten actually lesbos and chios are full of cats hungry ones so i said curious but seeking to avoid offence what are you doing wandering among men galay galay is the local word for a cat or a ferret and i used it with affection she was like a ferret a pretty ferret youre a westerner arent you you keep your women in houses and screw each other right she laughed she was maybe fourteen everything from the motion of her hips to her language made penelope the slave look like a lady of quality anyway i remember how she laughed as if she pitied me chian girls have their own lives at least until some man fills us with a baby she shrugged ive killed a deer she said with a childlike change of topic i laughed and leaned back me too she stuck out her tongue at me we both laughed and that was the end of the coldness an hour later she was sitting with her back against me it was a chill evening and i had put my cloak around her i told her stories of hunting on cithaeron and about my sister and pater until i cried a little she was kind and said nothing she told me about riding her fathers boat in a storm and i told her about the storm wed ridden up by troy and then we talked of the gods and we sang some hymns together people passed us constantly dont imagine we were alone on that beach while we were singing heraklides came to the fire with a girl called olympias the grandest name for the broadesthipped peasant in all hellas but she and the girl in front of me were from the same village and they chatted in their rapid ionian that i could just barely follow herk was older than me but he was a good companion he drank some wine and made jokes good jokes and then we were all silent together oh honey i remember that evening as one of pure happiness the happiness of good fellowship it raised my mood so that i didnt feel so doomed which was wrong of course id have been better to be wary and afraid but really and i ask you sir to agree with me if we worry all our lives when will we drink wine and enjoy ourselves eh exactly hours passed we sang again and now i noticed that the girl leaning against me i still didnt know her name although i knew her sisters and her fathers and how old she was when her first blood came and which goddess she followed i noticed that she had a beautiful voice i had heard the choir at the ephesian temple of artemis mind you i knew a good voice when i heard one i was just pondering how a village girl got such a voice when a trio of big men came to our fire thats my sister lad the biggest said he said it with a smile that robbed his words of malice he was too damned big to have to worry about any man on that beach i had come to my full growth minus a fingers width or so and i was not a small man but this chian stood a head bigger and a hands span broader stephanos my girl said and she leaped up taking my spare chlamys with her and embraced her brother i got up too in the complex welter of thoughts that affects a man when hes confronted by the brother of a girl that he has not debauched i didnt want to seem afraid but he was big he didnt seem angry but id seen men like him launch a blow without a sign of it crossing their faces he had that look im called doru i said your sisters my guestfriend sit at the fire and drink some wine if it pleases you pretty good eh you know honey sometimes we make up these speeches later to sound better to bards like your friend but id had the right amount of wine that night enough to loosen my tongue and not enough to clog it up eh stephanos grinned guestfriend eh he said he laughed you must be a gentleman sir no chian fisherman would ever have a guest friend he grunted when he tasted the wine good stuff sorry lord i guess you are a gent and im making an ass of myself no one had ever called me lord in all my life stephanos i was born a farmer in faroff boeotia and ive been a slave for years just freed no lords here unless my master archi comes back then he slapped my back and laughed he laughed quite a bit a deep throaty laugh that made everyone else want to laugh too ares he was big and he introduced his two friends oar friends the men who sat below him in his spot in his lords ship i dont remember their names i know where they died and ill tell that part when i get to it but they were good men and good companions and im sorry ive forgotten them heres a sip of wine to their shades i hate it when i forget names honey the names are all we have and all that ever gets remembered now im a lord and while i live every son of a bitch in the chersonese will fear me and know my name but when i die who will remember me who will know the name of arimnestos by the ravens of apollo pay me no attention fucking maudlin old man too much wine what was i saying aye it was a good evening the night i met stephanos we ended up all curled together around the fire archi never came back that night but there were a dozen or so of us and one of the local girls ran off and came back with a bundle of straw shed been selling it all day she said and we lay on the straw like chicks in a nest and slept woke and talked and slept melaina was her name i learned from hearing stephanos chide her for sleeping next to me youll wake up with his dick in your arse he said and laughed thats what passed for a sense of humour on chios they thought we all loved boys or pretended to think that i woke with the dawn melainas hair smelled like fish she snuggled her hips against me and whispered that i was not allowed to move but i had to get up and i was embarrassed by the mmm projection i had grown but she just laughed not even awake and told me that if i had to piss i should piss for her too so she could go on sleeping only when i was well away from our fire pissing in the sand did i realize that the games were to start in a matter of hours perhaps less as games always began with the sun and i had been awake most of night i blessed lord apollo that good company had kept me from drinking a foolish amount i went back to the fire and warmed up while i built it up all the slaves were asleep then i oiled myself archi was nowhere to be seen i was pretty sure stephanos had mentioned wrestling so i woke him are you in the games i asked mother fuck he said or words to that effect and rolled out of his cloak you are a good man he said can you spare some oil i cant run home and get back in time the foot race is first so i oiled him and we went up the beach together in those days men didnt compete naked like fools we wore loincloths and i had to give him my spare then we ran he had long legs but no training we got to the crowd just in time to catch the second heat of the twostade race i won not easily but i had his measure from the run up the beach and all the other competitors were local boys who were no match for him you run the foot race honey and you sir good easier to tell this to people who know how games go but in those days it was all informal the lord had put up cairns and we started by one turned at the other and elbows flew in the turns if i wanted to beat a man as big as stephanos i needed to be well clear of him at the turn eh heh heh otherwise i would have kissed the sand then we watched another heat this time mostly gentlemen hoplites especially athenians they were all trained men and they didnt even trouble to jostle each other it was like watching a different sport and most of them ran naked which i found imposing and odd a final heat of local gentry and a big youth won by knocking most of his competitors flat stephanos stood by my shoulder watching as first and second in our heat wed be running in the final he pointed at the winner cleisthenes he said hes a right bastard i can tell i said kylix came up then and archi archi shook his head my own damned fault he said hard to be a hero in the night and morning too he quoted from heraclitus who was full of such sayings for the young archilogos this is my new friend stephanos i said with ephesian formality they eyed each other as potential rivals and i was annoyed that they couldnt be friends but neither saw in the other what i saw in both and they stood apart i sent kylix back for my armour i looked at archi but he shook his head you have to be the hero today doru he said the only muscles i have that are hard are in my head and my dick that got a laugh from all the men indeed archi was not alone and half the men there more than half were showing signs of a good night of feasting i heard later that the man they called kalos the beautiful the best of the athenian athletes was hungover from the beginning to the end so we lined up in the sand for the twostade final i was next to the big chian lordling with stephanos on my other side luck of the draw id watched the lordling in his first race and i knew id get an elbow in the ribs off the starting line so when lord pelagius dropped his arm i shot off from a low crouch just as the trainers in ephesus taught bless them then i cut diagonally across the field the tall pretty athenian kalos was on the inside and i let him lead me from the first we were alone there was a roar behind me and some shouting but i just kept pounding up the beach and the naked athenian was a stride ahead damn he was fast and he was better trained id say hangover or not he was the better man and he wasnt running full out either he was saving himself measuring me i decided on my tactics well before the turn as we closed on the cairn i poured it on everything i had and i passed him in one burst before he was on to my tactic i was ahead of him at the cairn by a stride and i angled sharply across him so that he had to lose a stride or risk crashing into the cairn not the most genteel manoeuvre illegal in the olympian games but thats youth and then i hammered my feet on the sand my trick done and all there was left was to run the stade back theres a point in the race where it is no longer muscle and training its all in your head eh i was ahead he would put everything into catching me but my burst of speed must have made him wonder and i thought fuck it if i can burst like that i can run like that all the way home if i have the guts so i did i might have been the depth of an aspis ahead of him when i crossed the line but by ares i took him and after he vomited in the sand he came and wrapped his arms around me good run he said i grinned i knew he was the better man and i liked him for his good humour in those days all the games counted and there was no resting so while i was still breathing hard kylix brought my armour for the next race the hoplitodromos thats a laugh my armour was an old leather spolas that i bought on the beach from a mercenary recut by a leatherworker to fit me i had an outdated boeotian shield that hipponax had bought and a pair of greaves without them i wouldnt have been allowed to compete in the race on chios they carried an aspis and wore greaves that was all in plataea we ran in full panoply so i snapped on my greaves which fitted well enough and lined up lord pelagius played no favourites although by the time i had my armour on i knew that the big lordling was his grandson he could have made me run in the first heat but he didnt and he ran the pulls the removal of names from a pot fairly he was in fact a good lord and a fair judge a rarer bird than you might think friends cleisthenes and stephanos hadnt finished the twostade final as theyd ended up fighting on the sand stephanos said that the big aristocrat tripped him and the lordling claimed the same but they were still in the contest they ran in the third heat i think the judges felt that they hadnt squandered the energy that kalos and i had used up in the run we ran together in the fourth heat with another pair of athenians and one of the lesbian hoplites from our own ship he ran well too he and kalos and i led our pack and kalos was well ahead until the cairn and then he dropped back his wine head stealing his chance for glory while the lesbian nipped me for the victory epaphroditos was his name and he couldnt believe hed won i worked to be as gracious as the athenian boy had been with me it wasnt easy i hate to lose but i was still in the finals they took place right away and i was tired there was quite a bit of jostling on the line and i thought ares there are four events to go and i made the finals i dont need to win all i need is to finish the lordling was in the race but he wasnt next to me thank the gods to start with i ran easily without any attempt at real speed i was the last man off the line except for another chian who cleisthenes tripped as we started that boy was vicious i ran at a good lope to the cairn and made the turn still last but in touch with the pack everyone was tired it was my first games and i had no idea how a real athlete hoards his strength i knew my body but i knew nothing of how to read the others we were halfway to the finish the hoplitodromos is two stades and good men sprint the whole way when i realized that i had plenty of strength left in my legs and i had just passed one of the athenians so i grinned and put my helmeted head down and ran i didnt bother to look around or back until there was a blow to my shield and i realized i was running alongside cleisthenes we were running shield to shield and the lesbian was a stride ahead the horsehair on his helmet within easy reach cleisthenes punched at my shield again and grinned he was a mean bastard me too i put my shield rim into his hips and he screamed and fell and then it was just me and the lesbian with fifty strides to go we ran our guts out he was faster i hugged him anyway he had a great heart that man there arent many men who can say they beat me but epaphroditos was so happy that i couldnt be angry this is the best day of my life he said then cleisthenes came up and swung his shield at my head there was no warning but a year of ducking diomedes thugs had finally had its effect and stephanos shouted and i ducked the shield missed men rushed to pull us apart when we wrestle ill dislocate your shoulder he shouted and break your pelvis by mistake every man on the beach heard him people like him have always raised the daimon in me i said nothing but i let him look me in the eye and he didnt like what he saw then the lord was there he slapped his grandson and he ordered the big man to apologize to me cleisthenes refused now that i had the attention of the whole beach i leaned in towards cleisthenes ive been a slave half my life i said so that every man heard me and my manners are better than yours what does that make you the daimon spoke had it been me it would have been young mans bravado but when the daimon had me i was as calm as a summer sea my words fell like harp notes in a quiet hall and he flushed the next contest was wrestling although as the chians practised it it was more like pankration since everything was legal blows tripping punches everything but eyegouging and grabbing the testicles i drew an early opponent but by the will of the gods i drew a beardless athenian boy who was in his first contest as i was we grinned at each other and grappled and i had his measure by so much that i could give him a throw in fact i dragged it out because i was resting and i made him look good his father was there and he slapped my back at the end and said i was kind the boy grinned at me then i went to my second bout against a bigarsed oarsman from lesbos he was tall and untrained and i was smaller and welltrained there are men out there wholl tell you that size doesnt matter in combat and what they are full of honey smells bad eh big men have all the advantages im not big but you can see that i have long arms like an ape an aegyptian once told me and those arms have saved my life a hundred times ive put a hundred big men down in the dirt but they always scare me and i always thank the gods when i walk away from a contest with one this one saved me by being afraid of me i could see it i was a man whod won the stadion and come in second in the run in armour and my muscles gleamed in the sun and he flinched i still had to wear him out and it sucked the energy out of me my ankles hurt where my secondhand greaves had bit them during the run and those little things start to add up when its high noon on a hot beach in the third competition of the day i played him and he put me down once and his morale improved but by then i had him tired and the next time he came in at me i broke his nose with my fist and then i had him i got him a cloth for his nose and on the way back i met melaina who was pouring water over her brother she kissed me you go and win now she said then i can tell all the girls i slept with a great athlete she giggled stephanos frowned you all right i asked i drew that bastard cleisthenes stephanos said his sister didnt worry him i could tell you can take him i said melaina spat in the sand his fathers our lord she said there was quite a lot of information in that short sentence i stepped close to stephanos you know how to break a finger i asked of course he didnt only trainers and professionals know tricks like that i smiled to think that i could have been the best wrestler on chios so i bent close and told stephanos how to break a mans finger in the grapple he looked at me and i think he was shocked i shrugged youre a bastard he said hes going to knee you in the balls i said id wager a gold daric on it aye stephanos said get his hands at the first engagement go for a leg sweep and go down with him break his finger in the tangle and apologize a lot after youre declared the winner and it is absolutely legal i shrugged stephanos nodded i can take him not wheezing from a groin kick i said and then i was called for my third bout it was another big man bigger than the last in fact i remember him as being bigger than heracles but that cant be true but my good fortune was that hed pulled a muscle in his groin in his last bout and i took him i took him so fast that he apologized afterwards i told him that i thought he was probably the better man and he liked that and we clasped hands stephanos broke cleisthenes hand if wed all been lucky hed have broken the lordlings right hand but he broke the bastards left and he apologized and lord pelagius himself said it was an accident so it was me and stephanos in the final we were already breathing hard and archi strigiled me as if he was my slave he said and i loved him for it and put fresh oil on me melaina proclaimed that this was the best bout because she liked both the contestants and was sure to be pleased and lord pelagius looked at her fondly and then told the circle of men and women to keep quiet its odd at olympia and delphi they forbid matrons to watch men compete but allow maidens in ionia women had their own foot races and they all watched stephanos came at me with a grin and tried to break my left hand at our first engagement the bastard i didnt fight back the same way my blood wasnt up and i knew he had to pull an oar im not always a bad man so i punched him even when we were grappling and i got his shoulders down for a count and had a fall the second fall he roared like a bull and came in at me going for a throw i stayed away avoiding his hands and just barely kept him from pinning me against the crowd but by my third retreat the crowd was hissing at my apparent cowardice especially as i was up by a fall and like a foolish boy i let the crowd noise sway me i saw my opening went over the attack and found myself face down in the sand then i was angry angry at myself and i tried to stand toe to toe with him i got a leg behind him and i went for a throw and missed we all miss sometimes honey and he got hold of me and then i was grappling a bigger man he got me although we put on a long grapple and a good contest and we were both covered in sand and sweat and when we rose stephanos looked at me with a certain wariness down two throws to one i was a sober fighter i was bone weary but still unhurt stephanos made a mistake or was unlucky seconds into the fourth round as i circled him he crossed his legs a foolish thing to do and something even chians must have trained against i was on him in a flash and he was down and although he was strong i got my legs around his hips and i had a control hold on one arm i knew i had him and after some long minutes of struggle and some grunting he knew it too they applauded us like heroes after that round we looked good and i had him hed squandered energy trying to match my hold with sheer strength and now he was beaten so i stepped in to finish it grappled him and got dropped on my head for my pains never believe all those stupid countryyokel stories that chian played me like the city boy i had become he let me think him exhausted he let me believe it with everything from posture to his weary youve got me beaten smile as we stretched our arms out and started the last engagement i dont think i ever made that mistake again i came to with fifty men around me and stephanos all but weeping on my chest hed dropped me just wrong but thank the gods he hadnt snapped my neck although it hurt like blazes a line of cold that was worse than fiery pain running up my spine heraklides was there too he had a reputation as a healer and he had my spine under his palms can you move lad he asked me yes i said and swore ares i hurt my fingertips hurt but i was on my feet swaying but up they gave me a lot of applause and some backslaps and somebody one of the athenians probably groped me so much for heroism sorry mate stephanos said i laughed and we clasped hands last time i teach you anything i said he grinned i like to wrestle he said then we had a break before the next event until the sun was past a certain point in the sky no waterclocks on a beach on chios i slept and when i awoke stephanos came and massaged me himself i cant throw a javelin and ive never touched a sword he said so youre my man to win youre ahead you know i lay like a corpse under his hands he knew how to get his thumbs deep in the muscle he said his father taught him melaina had the trick too she came and did my lower legs and feet bless her when they were finished i felt like quitting once and for all and i felt like sex melaina suddenly appealed to me the touch of her hands hard to explain instead i got up and took javelins from archi i didnt even have my own they were back in ephesus archi slapped my back youre in first place you dog he said thatll teach me to drink too hard not just sour grapes archi and i were always a dead match except as swordsmen if i was winning hed have been with me except that the luck had been going my way in every encounter it takes luck to be a winner ive seen the best man trip on a stone or lose his footing in a match read the chariot race in the iliad honey thats the way of it the best man does not always win or maybe it is the will of the gods as some men say or the logos seeking change so that one man does not dominate others or to effect some other change i was never a great man with a javelin ive killed my share of men with spears thrown and pushed as they say but thats because the daimon in me doesnt lose its skills in the press of bronze in a contest i cant throw as well as other men and thats a fact but that day i threw the best spears of my life my first throw did it which god stood at my shoulder i dont know but i smelled jasmine and mint and i swear that it was athena putting her hand under mine and lifting my spear other men matched my throw and cleisthenes beat it the bastard i threw twice more and never came within a stride of my first throw i placed seventh cleisthenes won but i placed in the top eight and by the chian rules i had won or placed in every contest and no other man had done that cleisthenes argued that he had but his grandfather overruled him saying that he had failed to finish the twostade run i had won i couldnt believe it i think my slavery really ended there on that beach just before the sun started to swoop for the sparkling blue sea i wasnt just free i was a man who could win a contest with hundreds of other free men we greeks love a contest and we love a winner they mobbed me and i was kissed a little more than i liked and patted a little too much but i didnt care they put a crown of olive leaves in my hair and then lord pelagius took me aside listen lad he said youre the winner clear winner no judge even needs to count there was a goddess at my shoulder sir i said he nodded what a very proper thing to say who was your father technes of green plataea lord i bowed i gather you were a slave i was taken i said the family that had me freed me he nodded again a fine story damned fine the way good people should act he was an old aristocrat and he had the best notions of how his class ought to behave a few of them do the rest are rapists and taxtakers with pretty names and better armour at any rate he put his arm around my shoulders listen lad you asked to fight with the sword youre welcome to do it we can all see youre a trained man but after winning today no one and i mean no one will think youre a shirker if you want to step aside but ignoring the hubris of it and the sound of wings i might have heard i shook my head i want to fight lord he smiled well he said i cant give you your prize yet so go and armour up he meant that all the prizes were given at sunset so i put on my old leather spolas not a tenth as glorious or protecting as the scale shirt i was so soon to own i put my aspis on my arm and my crude cheap and cheerful helmet on my head picked up my meatcleaver sword and went down to the lists in those days we took wands willow or linden usually and planted them at the four corners of the lists and then we fought to the first cut men died from time to time but most men were careful and few fought all out in the lists calchas had told me about such fighting back on cithaeron by the shrine of the hero and i had thought that it sounded like the trojan war here i was five years later standing by a row of black ships on a beach with a blade in my hand and the weight of my bronze helmet pressing down on my nose while i listened to the judges caution us against using our full strength my heart sang inside me freedom and victory in games are a heady mix like wine and poppy juice the stars were out although the sun hadnt set there were only eight of us to fight which had i thought of it might have made me wonder about our army yet i tell this badly i wanted to talk to the past i wanted to tell the boy in the olive grove and the slave boy in the pit that there was this at the end of the road that someday id stand on the sand a hero who knows heraclitus says that time is a river and you only dip your toe once but maybe you can skip a stone too i only know that the boy in the olive grove and the boy in the slave pit made it to be the victor on the beach you dont understand perhaps just as well and just as well that the victor on the beach didnt know what was to come either count no man happy until he is dead we paired off and i was up against a chian we exchanged names but ive forgotten his i was too inexperienced to be afraid and too eager to show my skill we circled for a while no man with steel in his hand lurches into a fight without feeling his opponent its like foreplay with a beautiful woman well its not actually but there are a few things in common and i like making your friend blush young lady if you turn that colour every time i mention sex well be good friends whats your name ligeia how fitting at any rate we circled and then we started to make jabs at each others shields it is hard to hit a man who has an aspis when all you have is a short sword the only targets are his thighs his ankles and his sword arm in a contest his head is out of the question bad form which is funny because in a real combat thats what you go for i became bored with circling and tapping shields i shuffled forward shield foot first and then i cut at his shield stepped in hard with my back foot and cut back the harmodius blow they call it in athens and caught him just above the greave a nice cut and no real harm i think i made him happy he was out with honour men are fools combat is not for honour i hadnt learned that lesson yet but i almost knew it and i was annoyed with him that hed wasted my time and energy i was the first to finish and i watched the others fight cleisthenes had his broken hand inside his aspis and he was hammering his opponent an older athenian who was angered and afraid of cleisthenes bullying hammering attacks that were well beyond the spirit of the contest cleisthenes was swinging as hard as he could chopping his opponents shield with his heavy sword a curved kopis or falcata depending where youre from a weapon like an axe with a sword blade attached another athenian effortlessly dispatched his man after a long shuffle in a circle i saw him do it he faked a cut to the mans head and tagged his thigh under the rim of his shield perfect coordination perfect control he was one of their noblemen he was fast and elegant and had better armour than anyone else including bronze on his thighs and upper arms it was good that i saw him because he was my next opponent the light was starting to go and we fought between two bonfires he smiled at me he had an attic helmet with springloaded cheekpieces and as soon as i saw it i knew my father had made it i held up my hand to him my father made that sir i said pointing at the helmet he took it off youre a son of technes the smith of plataea who fell in euboea he asked i am sir i bowed he returned my bow although he was a child of the gods the son of the greatest family in athens i am aristides he said of the antiochae i nodded i am arimnestos of the corvaxae i said of green plataea where leitos has his shrine he grinned he liked that i could play the game then he put his helmet back on and i pulled mine down and we faced off the chians cheered us because we were both foreigners aristides was probably the bestknown man in the fleet while i had just won the athletics and that made it a goodnatured match with lots of cheering i could hear melainas clear soprano and her brothers bass and then they all went away and i was alone on the sand with a deadly opponent he moved the way a woman dances and i admired him even as i tracked his motion as far as i was concerned he was beautiful but he put too much energy into it that is he looked wonderful and he was good very good a true killer but he also played to the crowd he had not on the other hand run several stades and wrestled early on he came at me with his kill shot all swordsmen have one a simple combination they have mastered that can get the fight over in a hurry listen if you live past a mans kill shot its a whole different fight but most men go down in sport or play or on a bloodspattered deck calchas taught me that and every swordfighter in ephesus said the same i didnt buy the feint to my head and my shield caught his blow to my thigh then i cut back at his arm and my blade ticked against his arm guard he nodded at me as we drew apart acknowledgement that id hit him then we circled for a long long time until the crowd was silent i wasnt going after him he was better than me and he wasnt in a hurry and frankly i knew he was the best man id ever faced better than cyrus or pharnakes even twice we went in the first time he came forward gracefully and fooled me his swaying approach a trick as he darted to the right and his blade shot out in a cut to my right hip of all unlikely targets i parried the blow on my blade and hammered my aspis into his i cleared my weapon and tried to reach under his shield but he didnt allow it and we were kneeling in the sand shield to shield pushing the crowd roared but the judges separated us the second time i saw him stumble it was dark now the fires gave unsteady light and the helmets didnt help but before my attack was even fully developed he had his feet under him he cut low and then high and our blades rang together and we both punched with our shields leaning our shoulders into the push and our blades licked out and we both rolled left and broke apart the ocean cold of his blade had passed across my sword arm and my blade had ticked against his thigh armour i raised my blade for a halt he touched me i said i can be an honourable man but his blade had been flat on and athena was by me and when the judges looked there was no blood stephanos gave me a drink of wine while the judges looked at my opponent archi pointed at him back of his knees brother he said hed never called me brother before and it was the warmest praise of the day cleisthenes hurt his last man stephanos said hell face the winner here but his grandfather is mad as fury the man he cut is bad cleisthenes came and started to catcall he was a rude fuck and while other men cheered he jeered my blood started to rise i decided to go for the athenians knee archi was dead right when youre in the fight you dont always see he was a tall man and the back of his knee was the best unarmoured target on him he went for his kill shot again i think he felt that he hadnt got it off perfectly the first time but as soon as he started i knew the combination i knelt ignoring the head feint and snapped my wrist in a long cut against the back of his left knee while his sword cracked on to my shield and bounced up on to my helmet id knelt too low the blow was hard not as well pulled as his first and i fell sideways with a bump on my scalp where my helmet turned the blow but not all of it he gave me a hand up and apologized i pointed my heavy blade at the black line of blood running down the back of his greaves by athena he said well cut plataean men cheered but cleisthenes jeered again calling us pansies and then he insisted on fighting right there i want this he said unless youre afraid and closer up im going to hurt you his grandfather tried to stop it but the other judges said there was enough light and i was an arse and simply insisted id fight youre a fucking slave he said and he grinned i own you already slaves always fear men like me real men do you feel the fear boy the thing i hated was that of course i did feel the fear i did fear men like him big brutal men who wanted to inflict pain and my fear made me hate him and the daimon came suddenly i was as cool as if i had bathed in the sea when we came together i already knew how i would fight and what i would do the daimon was in me and i give no quarter then and truly i have done shameful things but this was hardly one of them he was an evil bastard and he earned his way to tartarus all the way but i regret some of it as soon as his grandfather gave the word he came at me his sword high and smashed it into my shield he cut at the top his tactic simple he would cut the bronze band that held the rim in five or ten strokes and then start chopping the shield until he broke my arm or cut my shield arm it was a brutal technique and he was a brutal man i ducked and dodged i wanted him contemptuous and hurried he was easy he laughed and spat and chased me landing a blow or two on the shield face he finally stopped fucking coward stand and fight he yelled i laughed come and catch me arse cunt some men heard me others didnt he heard me and he should have paused to consider that if i had the breath to insult him i wasnt afraid but he was a fool but his grandfather had heard him and threw down his staff stop he roared he picked up his staff and prodded his grandson in the stomach boys talk like that he said men respect their opponents one more jibe and i will throw you from the lists cleisthenes didnt even pretend to obey he did not fear the gods and they knew him for what he was before lord pelagius gave the word he came at me again and he almost caught me because in fact he cheated his sword hammered my shield and we were shield to shield the sword went back and he cut at my head his blow clipped the rim of my shield and then my helmet and it hurt im going to kill you he crowed i could tell you that the pain of his blow made me do what i did but i promised not to lie much when i told these tales i knew from the moment we crossed swords i always meant to kill him honey im a killer a little more wine your friend is blushing i danced away and he came after me sure that he had me and i let him come he came in to hammer my shield and i cut his sword hand off his arm as easy as making your friend blush see hed overextended a little more with each cut trying to get the biggest part of his blade into my shield rim i just led him by the nose until i had his arm where i wanted it and i could have simply given him a cut to remember he fell to his knees he couldnt get the shield off his shield arm and he couldnt get a hand on his wrist to staunch the blood and it was pumping out almost like a neck wound if hed had a friend in that circle perhaps that man would have stepped up and stopped the blood or maybe not whats a man worth with no right hand like a criminal his grandfather stepped forward and then paused that was the awful part his own grandfather let him bleed out and the other men in the circle a conspiracy of two hundred he was gone quickly but his eyes went to mine near the end and suddenly he wasnt a bad man a rapist a taxtaker a bully he was a deer under my spear and he didnt understand the darkness that was coming or why it had to come to him and in his eyes i saw the reflection of that god who comes to every man and every woman and i also saw myself the killer i didnt look away i held his eye until he fell forward and everything was gone but as his soul left his body i think something of me went with it i killed him because i didnt like him and when my eyes met aristides i could see that other men knew it as well as i did i wont go on and on about this friends but before i killed cleisthenes i was one man briefly i was a victor a man men admired that might have been my life however brief but the fates the gods and my own daimon said otherwise and when cleisthenes fell face forward into the sand black with his own blood i was another man some men admired me but aside from a few the rest feared me i was wearing my new armour the next morning as we began to load the ships armour is a silly thing to wear for work but by the gods it was good to look like a nobleman and i was young and arrogant my shoulder still hurt from the pounding of my shield against it in the fight and the race i noted that men were careful how they spoke to me stephanos was closer if anything he wasnt afraid of me and he was overjoyed that cleisthenes was dead in fact i earned his friendship with that blow and when i was maudlin that first night melaina told me stories of cleisthenes and the local girls until i felt like a public benefactor i felt like less of a benefactor as the ships were loaded there i stood sparkling in a scale corslet worth a farm a good helmet and a fine aspis other men were loading the ships we had no discipline and so every ship loaded at its own speed and we were so late leaving the beach that we saw lord pelagius and the women of his household with the body building a pyre and the older woman whose tears seemed pulled from her as youd pull the guts from a dead boar she must have been his mother only then did i find fully what it is to be a killer of men when you kill you take a mans life you take it he can never have it back when the darkness comes to his eyes and he clutches his guts he is done and you dont rob just him but his parents and his family his sisters and brothers his wife and children his lovers his debtors his master and his slave all robbed cleisthenes was a bad man i have no doubt but all his people were on that beach and it was like a scene in a play in athens not that they came at me like furies just that they were all there his horses and hounds his women his slaves his son all there in one place for me to see i killed him because i didnt like him lets not lie so i stood there coming to terms with the consequences most killers are dull men i truly think they never see the funeral pyre they never think i walked down the beach and every one of them saw me and they looked at me as if i was some kind of beast i think too much so i drink here you blush for me and make me happy there ahh my world is brighter for your presence lady i never promised you a happy story we landed in ephesus and all the lords of the fleet met with the lords of the city but i stayed on our ship i was afraid of being taken afraid of being a slave again afraid of what id done with briseis afraid that she had already forgotten me and i dreamed of cleisthenes and his funeral pyre i still do hes the only one ive killed enough men to make a phalanx and hes the only one who haunts me archi was distant when he went ashore but he came straight back to the ship with word that diomedes father had sent his son to a farm in the country to recover and nothing had been said typical the things you most fear never come to pass diomedes and his father might seek revenge but they had not gone to law i left the ship and entered the house as a free man wearing armour i felt odd everything was odd food tasted wrong and i longed to go and eat in the kitchen but i didnt just as i wanted one of the slaves to tell me how bold i looked in my magnificent shirt of scale armour but none of them even met my eye not even penelope who threw her arms around archi when we returned and didnt even look at me briseis looked at me an enigmatic halfsmile at the corner of her mouth i found that i couldnt really breathe i felt as if id been gone ten years and i found that id forgotten what she looked like she stood in the courtyard to welcome us because her mother never left her room any more and briseis was in effect the lady of the house well she said that was all i didnt see her again for days i took baths and thought guiltily of our lovemaking if thats what it was and i found that i thought of melaina which seemed like treason except that she was more my speed if you take my meaning i wondered why i hadnt even tried to kiss her archi went to the conferences and met with men like aristides and aristagoras plotting a campaign against the medes for the freedom of ionia i found myself a lonely man in a city that had been my playground i couldnt exactly go and sit by the fountain of pollio could i i met my thracian girl in the back alley almost by accident and tried to get her to go for a walk with me but she ran that hurt so after two days of failing to be the returning hero i went up the hill to the temple of artemis and there i found boys sitting in front of heraclitus i wasnt a boy but i sat at his feet he nodded to me he was laying out the rules of triangles there were three new boys i had been gone just two months and even that world had changed but i listened and my mind went down the paths of numbers and figures in the sand instead of death and war and sex and i took a little healing as i always have from the wise when he was done with the other boys he came and sat next to me what you did to diomedes was cruel he said the logos speaks through strife i said quoting him dont give me that shit he said his gaze met mine and ground mine down like stone against iron you hurt that boy i shrugged he had it coming heraclitus sat and leaned on his staff i cant remember another time that he sat with me finally he looked at me i have so many things i want to say to you you can all but see the logos and yet you are so far from true understanding arent you you understand me when i talk and yet you can hurt a boy like that for a childs reasons i blinked tears i had been blinking tears since he sat with me hah i feel them in my eyes even now no one else had cared except stephanos and archi he sat there and listened i did it because he broke his engagement with briseis i said he hurt her i did the right thing heraclituss eyes rested on me and you could almost see the sparks as his gaze ground away at mine finally i hung my head no i did not no he said tell the truth at least to yourself i knew the truth as soon as i heard that the boy had been hurt you hurt him cruelly is that who you are a man who hurts for his own satisfaction i couldnt meet his eyes and i began to weep i sat on the steps and told him the tale of cleisthenes he shuddered when i cut off the hand but he smiled when i told him through my own tears of the funeral pyre it is the pity of the world that we must come to wisdom through fire he said why can no man learn wisdom from another i couldnt answer him perhaps no one can after a while he went on you have discovered one of the secrets of the world of men whats that i asked those boys most of them knew me were wondering why the teacher was sitting with me and why i was pouring tears the way a mended pot leaks water the secret is that men are easy to kill that if you are brave and have a steady hand and a cold heart you can have whatever you desire he looked away this city is about to go to war with persia and then it will learn a lesson that i think you already know war is the king and father of all my son some men it makes lords and others it makes slaves do you understand no i said ah he said and laughed at himself the strife i preach some men master it without knowing why and use it for themselves without a thought to consequence war makes them lords and kings but they are not good men the killer lies in every man closer to the surface in some than others i think i saw the killer in your eyes when first your master led you up the steps he nodded if you would master the killer in you you must accept that you are not truly free you must submit to the mastery of the laws of men and gods men fight wars i protested and men return from them confused as to what the laws of men and gods ask of them he looked at a raptor climbing in the distance over the mountains that bird can kill twenty times a day and never be the agent of evil merely change but men are not animals what they mate and what they kill becomes who they are he looked at me you are a warrior you must find yourself a path that keeps you among men and not among animals avoid the confusion law is better than chaos it doesnt sound like a helpful speech although i think i can remember every word and yes that line about strife and war he said it all the time and its in his book dont think i was the first to hear it either but it stuck listen all of you there are men and women youre old enough to know who discover what their nether parts are for and go mad with it it is the same with killing turns out that killing is easy inflicting pain is easy cleisthenes learned that and when i gave him the other half of the lesson he never got to benefit from it perhaps if hed had a teacher like my teacher for weeks the ships came up the river and dropped soldiers greeks on our shores and we gathered a mighty army at least we thought it was an army aristagoras promised us an easy fight he said that the persians had short spears and no shields and that their riches were there for us to take it is the dark comedy of men that every ionian knew that he was full of shit many of them had faced persians or run from them and they knew how good they were and yet this disease this mania swept them as if the deadly archer had shot them with arrows of inflammation and disease failure to fear the persians theres a name for this disease in all the tragedies we call it hubris and all men and all women are subject to it so they debated and planned no one drilled though and no one appointed a commander although all but the athenians took orders or at least suggestions from aristagoras he went to dinner at the house i wasnt excluded but i wasnt comfortable attending formal dinners oh my manners were up to it i had learned the manners of aristocrats but to lie on a couch and be served by kylix i went and ate in taverns by the water which proved to be a good choice because i found epaphroditos in one and stephanos in another and learned to play knucklebones like an islander stephanoss victory as a wrestler had promoted him off the oar bench and into the ranks of his lords retinue and now he was a hoplite he and epaphroditos and i had the games in common and that was enough and when we found heraklides we were four which is a good number for men four weeks of dicing in taverns and drinking cheap wine exercising in the gymnasium all the allied soldiers were welcome there and no one knew me and four weeks of sitting at heraclituss feet indeed i took my friends to hear him speak they were pleased but mystified and all three agreed that he was a great man but they never went with me again heraklides spoke for the other two he was in the agora fingering a plain bronze camp knife the vendor was a slave for the smith who made it it was mediocre work ill pay you in obols what you ask in owls heraklides said to the slave i had just asked him to come with me a second time to hear heraclitus by the gods man three obols then he turned to me with a grin yon philosopher is a little above the likes of me doru i could see he was a great man it was a pleasure to hear him but i scarcely understood a word he said he whirled back on the slave four obols take it or leave it heraclitus sat with me every day after the other boys walked away and we talked about laws laws of men and laws of gods youve heard it all from your tutors im sure aye ill have his head if you havent heard it honey that most laws are mens laws for mens reasons in sparta every man takes a boy as a lover and in chios it is death for a man to lie with a boy these are the laws of men but the gods hate hypocrisy and hubris as any history that is true will show and murder and incest these are the laws of the gods and there are laws we can only guess at laws of hospitality for example they seem like godgiven laws but when we meet men who have different guestlaws we have to wonder bah i talk too much i should have been a philosopher as the priest of hephaestus said and then there was briseis i cant remember how long i had been in that house before i saw her again i was in her fathers room with her fathers permission he was formal and polite to me but a little cold reading his scrolls he had the words of pythagoras and some of heraclitus and anaxagoras too and i was reading them i was also helping him and darkar do sums i would have carried water to the well at this point i was so bored and felt so underused archi didnt want me when he went to the daily conference and so i seemed to have no duties at all except to match him in the gymnasium at the palaestra and on the track i was reading as i say when briseis came in she smiled at me quite a happy smile and took a scroll from my basket have you read thales she asked for all that he sounds like a soothsayer he seems the wisest of the lot or perhaps he just hated women less heraclitus doesnt hate women i answered hotly oh she said and her eyes flashed wonderful ill ask him to accept me as a student straight away i had to smile i raised my hand the way a swordsman does at practice when he acknowledges a hit well struck i said i was happy at sapphos school she said i wish i could go back but im too old old at sixteen her father glared at us im working he growled may we read in the garden briseis asked sweetly and he kissed her hand absently his eyes on his work we picked up the scroll baskets and walked into the garden together why dont you read to me she said there was very little question to it and that was that i read to her every day we read thales book on nature really just an accumulation of his sayings we read our way through pythagoras and laughed over what we didnt understand and briseis asked questions and i taught her what i knew of the geometry which was not inconsiderable and i took her questions to heraclitus and he answered them he was contemptuous of women as a sex but friendly to them as individuals which briseis said was a vast improvement on the reverse if i thought that i loved her when i was a slave that was merely the lust for the unattainable every boy loves someone unattainable and no few attain the one they want anyway to their own confusion but when we sat together day after day then i saw her another way i am an intelligent man all my life my wits have cut other men like my sword she was my better i saw it with the geometry in three weeks she had everything i could teach by the gods if i could have taught her to smith shed have made a corinthian helmet in three weeks once her mind bit into a thing she would never let it go like a boar with his tusks in his prey have you ever seen an eagle kill close to you she turns and you catch your breath and she hits her prey and if you are close you can see the blood a brief red cloud a mist of blood and your heart stops with the beauty of it even as you think that this is an animal killing another animal why is it so beautiful and so with the mind of briseis after two weeks she leaned close while i showed her a bronze pyxis i had made for her we had a small forge and she leaned close and ran a finger down my jaw come to my room tonight she said i leaned back her touch like a burn on my jaw if im caught i said and like a coward my eyes darted around for the slaves she shrugged i wasnt caught or am i braver than you my hero she said nothing more nothing not a glance did she give me nor a touch of her hand i went to her room wondering with every heartpounding step if i had in fact created the whole thing in my head had she really asked me really i stopped in the hall outside her room although there was no cover there i took a breath and my knees were weak and i shuddered i had done none of these things before i killed cleisthenes every man is brave for some things and a coward for others i stood there for a long time and ill tell you in honesty that i could feel the shit at the base of my intestines i was so afraid aphrodite not ares is the deadliest on olympus then i made myself push through her curtain she laughed when her skin was against mine you werent this cold in the bath she said i thought that you were penelope i said with foolish honesty there are women who might be offended by that sort of revelation briseis bit my ear rolled off the couch and lit a lamp from her fire jar aphrodite i said probably squeaked she got on top of me i want you to see me she said so that next time you wont mistake me for my maid when we were done and the moment we were done she laughed and bounced to her feet i asked why i reached out and touched her flank why did you come to me in the bath she laughed and her eyes flashed in the lamplight i decided that you should have what diomedes gave away she said promise me that if you ever have the chance youll kill him for me i shrugged later i swore im a man not a god i took to spending my days in the little forge shed in the work yard it was a tiny shop with one small bench and hipponax only had it so that his pots could be mended without being taken to market but darkar once told me that they had had a slave who had some skill with iron i made instruments at first a compass for briseis and then a ruler marked out in daktyloi i made a fine compass for heraclitus as well it was simple work but good briseis was pleased by her geometry tools as she called them and heraclitus was delighted embracing me i think that he had no use for such things as he once told me that he could see the logos and all its shapes in his head but the long bronze dividers were comfortable in the hand and excellent for showing a student and their points were sharp and probably used to prick a generation of dullards which gives me some satisfaction when i had my eye back i bought some scrap bronze and poured myself a plate pouring directly on to a piece of slate then i forged the pour into a sheet which made me feel better making sheet is long work and finicky i did an adequate job although my heart told me that i stopped planishing too early oh lass youll never be a bronzesmiths daughter planishing endless tiny hammer strokes to smooth the forgework when you change somethings shape you use the curved surface of the big hammers pulling the metal or pushing it this way and that but that leaves big lumpy marks see this cauldron look at these marks see but a good smith a master never lets an item out of his shop with these divots he uses eversmaller hammers working the surface a blow at a time until it is one continuous surface like my helmet see making sheet is about getting the surface to a single thickness and a flat shape two things that seem like enemies when you are new to the process more than you wanted to know eh but something had changed since i killed cleisthenes and i wanted to go back i think back to a world where i could do good work i had begun to have dreams about home i had the first in briseiss bed the first night i went to her i dreamed that ravens came and stripped my armour from me and took me to their nest i dreamed of ravens and their green nest of willows night after night until i realized that the ravens were apollos and the green nest was plataea was home and then for the first time in years i was homesick i began to dream more fully about the farm on the hill and about the tomb of the hero on the slopes of cithaeron and about hunting with calchas the dreams were powerful but they could never compete with the reality of briseis or the coming war i told myself that it was time to go home soon anyway i tell this story awry i gambled on the waterfront and made love to briseis i listened to heraclitus and read philosophy in the garden i worked and played on the palaestra and in the gymnasium with archi it sounds like a good life in fact it was a bad time but i could not tell you why except that i could feel the doom over me when i had my bronze sheet forged i cut some scrap from the edges and began to work them chasing figures into them as practice i did olives and circles and leaves and laurels and then i tried a stag but my stag became a raven early in the process i made six or seven ravens until i had done one well i remember that raven because while i admired my work darkar came in and asked me to wait on archi at dinner that was the third time that hipponax hosted aristagoras this time briseis was the hostess with most of the great men of the army as guests the house was busy and in those days it was perfectly acceptable for a free man to wait on his lord and i did it willingly enough i should have refused first aristides was confused to find me at his elbow he smiled at me i had to look at him for a long time to see the cool swordsman my toughest opponent from the beach so he gave his slight smile you have come to take your place among the captains i grinned and walked off to pour wine for archi and then i caught the athenians look and it was one of anger none of the men at the party knew how to talk to me was i a cupbearer or a champion it made them uneasy which in turn made me uneasy then there was briseis she moved among them dressed in a doric chiton of pure new linen shining white and transparent and they watched her the way dogs watch the slave with the food i had to watch the interplay among the captains and i didnt like it aristides was not the chief of the athenians that was melanthius an older man and an astute politician but not i think much of a fighter melanthius shared a couch with aristagoras and they drank together like friends but i could see that aristides thought little of either of them aristagoras was belligerent and fawning by turns a depressing sight diomedes father agasides was there and briseis treated him as if he were made of dung which he reciprocated and yet hipponax supported him as the war leader of the ephesians there was a captain named eualcidas from eretria in euboea a famous athlete who had been praised by simonides the poet and another eretrian dikaios who made clear that he loathed all the athenians more than he hated the persians i stared at them for every one must have been at the fight by the bridge where my father died and i was made a slave the eretrians had come with five ships because of their ancient alliance with the men of miletus of which aristagoras was once again ruler although he disdained the title of tyrant now that he had returned to them and claimed that he would liberate all the greeks of asia and give them democracies the milesians and eretrians had sailed up the river together fifty ships or more and landed their men in the precinct of koressos aristagoras was now the accepted commander of the war and the whole purpose of the war had changed because all the greek cities had declared now it was the trojan war now all the greeks were going to make war on persia they planned to seize sardis expel the satrap artaphernes and then perhaps march on persepolis and that night was the first i had heard of any of these things none of them noticed me but they bickered among themselves aplenty thugater if i had been half the veteran i thought myself id have smelled the trouble the way aristides did aristides watched them with contempt and archi worried and fidgeted hipponax watched them looking at his daughter and briseis rode the wave of their lust like a skilled helmsman it was not a pretty party and i should not have been there they drank and quarrelled and each of them thought he was agamemnon or achilles on the sixth bowl of wine dikaios the eretrian raised the cup your daughter moves like a dancer can her lips do what flute girls do he asked men hooted and then fell silent hipponax rose from his kline and he looked ready to kill leave my house he said dikaios laughed you dress her like a whore and put her at a party and then youre offended when i speak what every man thinks you easterners are soft and your women are whores he drank the wine the cup rang like a gong when it hit the floor and his head hit only a moment later it rang hollow like a gourd he was out i had put him in that condition and now i lifted him i was strong then and carried him to the courtyard then threw him into the street in the dung oh it is easy to make enemies darkar stopped me from going back to the party so i went to my bed and later i went to briseis and she embraced me with a vigour that frightened me i loved how you hurt him she said what do flute girls do i explained with some blushes what they do she laughed not enough in it for me she said what pleasure does the girl get and we laughed together the next morning i ran six stades with archi and he beat all of us we threw javelins and fought with spears after we had clashed shields and bruised each other for an hour agasides came and ordered us down to the beach heralds were crying in the agora and on the steps of all the temples and the whole army was assembling for the first time the beach was a vision of chaos we stood together in a mob perhaps seven thousand men and aristagoras placed his contingents in the phalanx he put the athenians on the right of the line in the place of honour the ephesians were in the centre towards the left when agasides had his place in the battle line he chose men for the front rank he chose hipponax but he did not choose me or archi few men of ephesus knew me and despite my excellent armour and my victory in games the ephesians didnt see me as a citizen which i was not agasides of course knew me as one of the men who had injured his son and as a former slave so archilogos and i were placed together in the fifth rank we were without a doubt the two best athletes in the city and probably the best menatarms but ephesus had known three generations of peace and agasides placed men according to his likes and dislikes and with no eye towards the phalanx as a fighting machine hipponax had fought pirates several times and despite his reputation as a soft poet was a good choice but all the other frontrankers were agasides drinking companions business partners and political allies we were one of the last contingents to form and we looked bad other contingent commanders came and stared at us while we grumbled and switched places endlessly a man would make his claim to the front rank always couched in political terms and agasides would stand indecisively balancing one interest against another when at last we were in our places aristagoras came and addressed us and for all his faults he had lungs of brass we were told that the army would march upcountry to sardis over the passes in the mountains and that all the hoplites and their slaves should assemble in two days after the feast of heracles that is the feast that they celebrate in ephesus nothing like our boeotian feasts two days and we would march it was the first time most men had heard that wed be marching upcountry and there was much grumbling i talked to the men around me and realized that none of them had ever stood in a shield wall or fought with bronze or iron they were like a pack of virgins going to do the work of flute girls i was a mere seventeen but i had seen three pitched battles and i had killed archi took me aside after the muster youve got to stop talking so much he said youll take the spirit out of us sometimes i regret that you are free you cannot speak to the first men of the city as if they were simpletons i shrugged archi they are fools and men are going to die i have fought in a phalanx none of these men have i should be in the front rank aristides had his helmet perched on his brow he was leaning on his spears listening to us and then he came over he glanced at agasides and spat you were there when your father stopped the spartans he asked i nodded i was there i said i didnt mention that i had been a psilos throwing rocks he nodded you should be in command then these children and he nodded to archi will die like sacrificed goats if we face the medes archi blushed i will stand my ground he said aristides shrugged youll die alone then he said i went back to the house and spent hours putting a pair of ravens over the nasal of my helmet i softened the worked metal by annealing it and then i had to cut my punches shorter to use them from inside the bowl of the helmet but the work came along nicely enough sitting on a low stool at the anvil tapping away at my work alone in the shed i was safe from the anger that had followed me from the muster i had started putting a band of olive leaves at the brow when the light from the doorway was cut off im working i called without turning my head so i see heraclitus said he came in and i stood hurriedly stay where you are i thought i would find you here he looked around examined my practice pieces you seem infatuated with ravens he said with a smile my family calls itself the corvaxae i said the crows ah and why is that he asked i told him the story of the ravens and the daidala and then i told him about my sisters black hair and how my father had always put the raven on his work philosopher that he was he wanted to see the metal worked so i punched an olive leaf from inside the helmet and then made the work finer and neater by working it from the outside i showed him how the work made the bronze harder he watched me anneal the back of the crown and he reminded me of old empedocles the priest of hephaestus when he commented on the bronze tube that i used to raise the heat of the forge fire i have seen the fire and the metal together before he said i suppose that i already knew that fire softens and work hardens he smiled then he frowned with iron fire hardens i shook my head you are the wisest man i know but no smith fire softens iron to make it hard you quench it in vinegar when it is hot it is fire that is the agent he said the agent of change is always fire i could hardly argue with that he looked at the new leaves around the brow of the helmet you won the olive wreath at the games at chios he asked i smiled with pride yes i answered now i will wear them for ever he turned my work this way and that and i explained planishing to smooth and harden the metal and then i showed him how i melted the bronze and poured it on slate he played with the bronze tube just as empedocles had and blew through it making the fire leap and he laughed with joy all things are an equal exchange with fire and fire for all things he said look at how you use the charcoal to make the fire and the fire melts the bronze you merely trade the charcoal for the heat the way men at the docks change gold for a cargo i nodded because that made sense to me so it is with anger and with war he said anger is to men what fire is to your forge and if we eradicate that anger much might follow i shrugged he took me by the shoulder you are full of anger he said anger gives strength but it comes at the price of soul do you know what i am saying i said yes like a boy in fact i heard him but had no idea what he was saying that is how his words were meant for me he had come down from the temple just to say those words but i was young and foolish i embraced him and he left me and then i finished my work that night i went to sleep early intending to rise and go to briseis but i was tired and i slept through the night then the next day we had an assembly of arms and we drilled raising and lowering our shields and forming to the left so that we marched up the beach and formed a front on the athenians from a column into a deep line aristides said it was horrible i had no idea this kind of drill was outside my limited experience of war in the afternoon i read thales to briseis she smiled at me i was lonely last night she said and i started because she said it in front of penelope so that night i went through the bead curtain into her room we made love and it was good and then we began to talk of my going upcountry i wanted her to tell me that she loved me and that she would miss me but she was merely playful and when i searched for an endearment she grabbed my manhood and kissed me until i lay with her again i am making all of you blush but the blushing time is over and the hard part has come we were lying together on her kline after that second time she lay on top of me the weight of her not much of a weight ill allow pressing down on my hips she was idly licking the bruise on my shoulder when i heard heavy footfalls in the hallway i had time to roll her off me the beads parted and hipponax burst into the room he had a sword behind him was darkar and behind both of them was archi with penelope in tow her eyes wide with terror hipponax raised the sword he hesitated unsure i think which of us to kill first i took the sword from him as easily as you would take a spoon from a child then i stood between him and his daughter oh the furies must have been laughing what hurt most was the look of pain on archis face hipponax was weeping he hit me with his fist ignoring that i had a sword thats how angry he was i flung the sword away rather than kill him with it and he hit me again i fell when he turned on briseis she had the sword she looked at me with contempt stop this briseis said she was sixteen and yet her voice stopped all the war in the room you whore her brother cried he sounded as if he was in physical pain how could you her father started he sobbed what is the curse of the women of my house briseis stood there naked the sword in her fist she held it steady and when her father approached her she pricked his chest with the point no closer she said my virginity was never yours to barter what hipponax asked drop the sword she shook her head go to bed we will talk about this in the day hipponax took a shuddering breath and exploded you faithless bitch he roared and i allowed your brother and this piece of offal to beat diomedes he was right i will flog you in the streets i will sell you to a brothel i will sacrifice you she pricked him with the point no she said she looked at archi take pater to bed she said archi was shaking he flicked a glance at me he must die archi said so much for friendship she looked at me why she asked he is not anybody and he will never tell her words cut me as if the blade she held pricked my flesh so much for love she laughed you are all fools this body is mine i will use it as i wish if i wish to take my pleasure with a man or a dog so be it i learned that from mater and from diomedes and you two fools will need to learn the lesson men will not be my masters by artemis the virgin and by aphrodite i will be the master and not the slave they stepped back you will die a lonely old bitch her father said briseis laughed pater you are dear to me but you are a fool i will die the queen of lydia aristagoras has agreed to marry me she laughed something in me died what i spat it was good then that i had no weapon in my hand briseis smiled at me the smile matrons give to simple children in the agora you thought i was going to marry you because you have a fine suit of armour she pointed the sword at her father and brother as soon as sardis falls i am to wed him she turned to me and smiled you have served your turn doru take your armour and go from this house i dont think you should come back pater might hurt you and you love him she said the last as if it made me the greatest fool in the world but i obeyed her and my world filled with darkness i went to my bed with darkar at my heels he spoke and i have no idea what he said i took the wool bag with my armour and i took my sword and my spears i rolled my heavy cloak and my sleeping pad inside my aspis darkar was still talking at me when i got to the gate archi was there how could you he asked i love her i said he had a naked blade in his hand and i drew my blade loved her i spat never come back he said we faced each other with blades in our hands i found aristides on the beach in the morning will you take me as a hoplite i asked him straight away he looked around tell me why he said you served with archilogos of this city last i heard i serve him no longer i said aristides nodded more fool he he smiled will you stand in the seventh rank the lowest place an eighthranker was a filecloser a form of officer but a seventhranker was a man either too young or too small to fight im better than that i said with all the anger gathered in the last few hours aristides was only a couple of years older than me but he had a way about him and he gave me his famous halfsmile i know that you can kill he said i dont know you otherwise seventh rank or stay on the beach so when we marched on sardis i marched with the athenians the wings of betrayal beating about my head the furies at my back and all of persia before me in the seventh rank as it turned out i had herk as my fileleader of course as helmsman he was an officer i was unused to taking orders which may seem a foolish comment from a former slave but it was true still i did well enough and the men in my file were all veterans at least of some raids and a siege or two and i had plenty to learn about camping and eating and keeping clean i was amazed at how much time the athenians spent on their gear polishing and cleaning with pumice and tallow and scraps of tow every spare moment agios was my filecloser in the eighth rank he was a wellknown man and at sea he was a helmsman far too important to serve in the front rank and get killed or so i understood he and herk were peers and good friends later they were my friends but on the march to sardis agios had few good words for me even as i was amazed at how hard the athenians worked on their gear so agios was disgusted with how careless i was with mine it was there marching to sardis that i learned how much of the business of war was in maintenance my mood was black so black that i have no memory of marching upriver to sardis we crossed the mountains through the pass i assume but i dont remember it i had to carry my own gear because i had no slave i dont remember anything of that either although i must have sweated like a pig and been the laughing stock of the athenian taxeis i had a hard time with briseis in my head i hated her and yet even then i knew that i was lying to myself i didnt hate her i understood her but i also knew that my life had been smashed again as thoroughly as my enslavement had smashed it i was locked inside the prison of my head for the whole march it rained and i was wet and at the top of the pass it was cold i know that my friends talked to me stephanos and epaphroditos and heraklides because they all referred to it later but i remember nothing but a waking nightmare of the loss of hipponax and archi and briseis hipponax and archi were in the same army i was in there were only eight or nine thousand of us all in and i saw both of them every day at a distance they must have known that i was with the army marching just a stade or two from them i do remember wanting to go to them every day a yearning to face them to receive blows or embraces i think i believed that they would commiserate with me now i shake my head we were fifteen days marching on sardis and despite our long delay at ephesus we caught the city unawares which will give you an idea of how badly prepared the medes were for us i think that artaphernes never really believed that men he had counted as friends and guestfriends men like aristagoras and hipponax would actually march on him and so great was the name of darius king of kings that no man had ever dared to strike at him amongst the ionians they talked openly of conquering persia amongst the athenians they laughed and talked about increasing their trade with ionia no man so much as mentioned persia i remember that too at any rate the persians were unprepared when we came down the pass the scouts told us that the gates of the great city one of the richest in asia were open we lost all order the whole army broke into a mass of sprinting soldiers racing for the gates at least thats how it seemed to me and i was close to the front aristides roared like a bull to make us stand our ground and we ignored him and raced for the nearest gates i followed herk he was fast but nothing like me and i loped easily keeping pace the rest of our file fell behind herk wasnt the fastest but he had stamina other men caught us and a few passed us but the upshot was that a dozen of us came to the ephesus gate of sardis just around the hour men leave the agora and the gates were open even as we ran up the lydian gateguards finally decided that they were in peril and began to close the great wooden doors or perhaps they closed them every day in late afternoon herk threw himself at the nearest door and men joined him i flashed through the narrowing gap and my spear caught a lydian and killed him and the other guards broke and fled and the gates were ours and i was the first man in the city then i saw men behave as animals and men treated as animals and it was amidst the slaughter that i awoke from my nightmares of the loss of hipponax and family and briseis i found myself in the wreckage of the agora watching a trio of eretrians raping a girl while others looted the stalls in an orgy of destruction like animals let loose from cages oh you havent seen what men are until you see them let loose inside a city i did nothing to stop it it was happening all about me and my sword was red and blood dripped down my hand the storming of a city is the grimmest of mans acts and the one most likely to draw the wrath of the gods sardis was defenceless and the men and women of the city had never resisted us or done us any hurt greater than taking some of our money in their trades but we butchered them like lambs some fools set fire to the temple of cybele and that sacrilege was repaid a hundredfold later but worse was to come the initial assault took the city but we had no officers and no enemy to fight so we all became looters and rapists roving criminal bands the men of the town gathered first to fight the temple fire and then to resist us and as the flames spread they were driven towards the central agora because we had no leadership and no order we didnt storm the citadel i was no better than the rest i assumed that the city had fallen i stood in the agora watching the city burn refusing to rape and contemptuous of the looters and i watched the other side of the market fill with men panicked men i assumed and then artaphernes was there his armour glittered in the fires and he led the lydians of the town and his own picked men of the citadel straight at us and the greeks were scattered the way sheep are scattered by wolves i saw artaphernes coming greeks ran past me and some were already casting aside their shields thats how bad we were we must have outnumbered the lydians three or four to one and they scattered us when the attack came herk was stripping a goldsellers stall like a professional sea wolf which he was fuck he said i knew this was too easy he began to blow on his sea whistle and i fell in next to him he had his shield and i had mine and other men who were not utterly in the grip of chaos and panic joined us and in a few moments we were a hundred men i noted that the man on my right was the athlete from eretria eualcidas whose friend i had thrown from the symposium war makes strange shieldfellows agios was close on me standing behind herk the lydians stopped short of us that was their mistake because as soon as the other greeks saw the lydians halt they turned and became men so it is in any fight aristides was there then he ran across the front rank and praised us for standing a few quick words and more men joined us chians mostly our shield wall covered the agora and we were four or five men deep not a proper phalanx but a deep line of mixed men then the lydians came at us they werent big men or well armoured except artaphernes bodyguard in the centre where i was and the fates laughed because the man coming at me in the firelit afternoon light was cyrus with his three friends around him they halted ten paces from us to see if we would give way but we had aristides to give us some wood in our backbones and we shuffled but held artaphernes men began to shoot at us with powerful bows at close range eualcidas on my right took an arrow through his shield into his shield arm thats how strong their bows were close up i saw that heraklides slanted his and i did the same and then under cover of my shield i got the shaft out of eualcidass arm and two other eretrians dragged him to the rear the next man to stand beside me got cyruss arrow in his ankle i saw the shot and then aristides exposed himself to the fire and ran along the front ordering us to kneel behind our shields and we did he was magnificent he was only a couple of years older than me and i wanted to be him so i indulged in some bravado of my own i called cyruss name until he saw me and i stood up and took off my helmet arrows rattled on my shield and one pinked my naked thigh above my greaves scraping along the muscle without penetrating cyrus i roared he raised his axe over his head and waved it at me you fool he called and laughed the greeks around me wondered aloud how i knew a persian one of the elite and i laughed and then their line stopped shooting and charged us artaphernes led his men from the front never believe all that crap about the medes whipping their men forward thats the slaves they sometimes use as living shields the real persians and medes like cyrus and artaphernes are like lions eager for a fight all the time they only had ten paces to come at us i had a stranger behind me and another on my right but i had heraklides on my left i looked back at the man behind me he seemed steady when the medes charged i stood crouched shield on shoulder and as they came up i punched out with my first spear and caught cyrus in the leg my spear in his calf and down he went pharnakes was right with him and he had a heavy axe which he put in the face of my shield as i threw my second spear into the second rank where an unshielded man took it in the gut a persian and went down i pushed my shield in pharnakes face axe and all and the man behind me stabbed him while i got my sword out from under my arm and heraklides yelled back back up back you dogs i raised my shield and backed a pace our line was shattered lydians were butchering the men who ran i got back in the line id pushed forward into the medes but they werent fighting my partner or me they were flowing around us left and right towards easier pickings as men do when the melee becomes chaotic i got my shield under the front edge of heraklides and the man who had been at my back now stepped up to fit in next to me it was all going to shit and then he was gone an axe in his head and his brains showered me i grabbed a spear and fought with it until it broke we could hear aristides and we followed his voice back and back and back and the enemy seldom fought us because we kept together there were men behind us agios and two others and i never knew them but they stayed with us and more than once a spear from over my shoulder kept me alive until the four of us made it to an alley entrance where the athenian captain had another little knot of men he had waited for us i never forgot that either it probably only took us a minute to reach him but he might have been as safe as a house for that minute and he stood and waited well heraklides was his helmsman of course we got to the alley and then we ran we ran all the way to our ships eh well not quite we ran back across the bridges and made a better stand and artaphernes took a light wound as his advance was stopped i fought there and i was in the front rank and i probably put a man or two down but it was desperate stuff no ranks or files and the ionians were a pack of fools with no order mostly i was trying to keep heraklides on my left and my shield with his i dont know who hit artaphernes but that man saved our army because their attack petered out at the bridges and we managed to withdraw to tmolus across the hermus river and there was no pursuit half of the army had never been in the fight at all and they wanted to storm the city again those of us who had fought were angry and those who had run magnified the number and ferocity of the enemy and many angry words were said i was sitting bleeding from a few wounds and breathing like the bellows for a forge when a man came up he was an eretrian and he had a scorpion on his aspis and he looked like a hard man he came straight up to me you are the plataean he asked i was sitting on my shield so he couldnt quite see the device i nodded doru i said he nodded you saved my father hes telling everyone how you covered him against the arrows and drew the one from his shoulder he offered me his hand i took it im parmenides i clasped his hand and he offered more praise i shook my head but later he came back with his father and they brought a full skin of wine which i shared with my mess then stephanos came from the aeolians the men of chios and the coast of asia opposite and sat with my mess group he was a sixthranker and proud just to wear the panoply for him it was an enormous promotion as great as my step from slave to free man the aeolians take noble blood much more seriously than atticans or boeotians when stephanos went back to his own mess i lay down my head spinning from the wine heraklides lay down beside me and we missed the part where aristides accused the milesians of cowardice ive done poor aristides an injustice if ive failed to make him sound like a prig he was always right and some men hated him for it he never lied and seldom even shaded the truth indeed among the athenians some men mocked him as a man who saw only black and white not the colours of the rainbow but melanthius had taken a wound in the agora of sardis and aristides was in command of the athenians now and he took this very seriously we loved him for all his priggish ways he was better than other men he just couldnt keep his mouth shut a failing i understand honey anyway the milesians had indeed hung back from the city aristides apparently told them that their cowardice had cost us the city aristagoras as their chief resented the remark and the armys factional nature increased to near open enmity the next day my body ached i was filthy with blood under my nails and matted in my hair and there wasnt enough water because we were too far from the banks of the river and the persians would shoot any man who went down the bank for a helmet of water filthy water in any case later in the day parched angry and dirty we stumbled back to the pass and we heard that the lydians were rising behind us that the men of all caria were marching to the aid of their satrap in those days the carians were called the men of bronze because they wore so much armour and they were deadly later in the long war they were our allies but not that week we washed at the springs of the hermus and we filled our canteens and drank our fill and were braver but we were no longer an army we were an angry mob the athenians did nothing to hide their contempt for all the ionians as soldiers the ionians returned their contempt with angry rejection and it was muttered that the athenians were sacrificing the ionians for their own ends which was true of course aristides grew angrier and angrier his pale skin constantly flushed and he walked along in silence his slave trotting to keep up i stood around watching aristides watching the army disintegrate and i understood why soldiers were deserting we were doomed and the rush of bad omens that surrounded us including a live hare dropped on a sacrificing priest by an eagle only confirmed what every man knew in addition men who had murdered and raped in the city knew that they had brought their own doom upon them and they were sullen guilty or merely dejected the athenians did not suffer from these problems heraklides gave me a heavy necklace of gold and lapis that he had snatched from the stall in the agora you only saved my life ten times he said and i saved my loot i got the whole bag behind my shield he laughed showing his snaggle teeth he was only six years older than me but he seemed like the old man of the sea himself i put the necklace on drank wine from my canteen and marched with the athenians who were still a disciplined band we had come over the pass as the advance guard and we were going home as the rearguard with the eretrians just ahead at home theyre our worst enemies heraklides grunted at me but you know that eh you were in the fight at the bridge i was i said they held us a long time there heraklides said good fighters glad to have them out here aristides came up to us you can go into the front rank in place of melodites he said without preamble he didnt smile but i did he had his helmet on the back of his head all the athenians did because they marched ready to fight at all times as did the eretrians i grinned like a fool thanks lord i said he looked grim dont thank me when we face the medes again youll be the first to face them i shrugged i was in the front rank in the marketplace i said lets not stand around and let them shoot us next time he walked off and i thought that he hadnt heard me or more likely had chosen to ignore me i was young very young to be in the front rank i took the dead mans place and was a fileleader and the other men of my file thought well enough of me to help me make a plumeholder and a plume to mark my new rank i no longer thought of briseis i was in the grip of ares when aristides saw me with my horsehair plume he came up and slapped my shoulder he didnt say anything but it was one of the proudest moments of my life from the top of the pass we could see the river in the distance and the ephesians cheered as if wed been gone a month and marched a thousand stades we were the last ones down the pass and we knew from the scouts that there were lydians and carians right behind us aristides wanted to hold the pass and we halted at the narrowest part of the down slope he picked his ground brilliantly a gentle curve in the pass so that the longest bowshot was about one hundred paces and the sides of the pass as steep as walls on either side we made camp a cold cheerless camp with no water aristides sent me as a runner to aristagoras i was to ask him to send relays of slaves with water for us tell him well hold the pass a day he said to give the milesians time to recover but aristagoras had no nobility and he was more interested in scoring points than in beating persia the pompous fuck he laughed at the message tell your chief he said that we will do nothing for the convenience of athens he said the words loudly so that all his milesians heard him and joined his laugh i ran the message back no man had so much as offered me a canteen i ran straight to aristides he was sitting on a rock and i crouched at his feet and pulled my chlamys around me against the chill air and tried to spit my mouth was so dry that my tongue wouldnt move so i just shook my head mutely aristides took his canteen over his head and handed it to me i drank a mouthful and bowed thanks i said he looked away they said no he asked they said no aristagoras said that he would do nothing for the convenience of athens i shrugged while i spoke eualcidas came up he pulled off his helmet he wore a great winged cretan helmet and he was grey with fatigue his arm hurt him but famous men cant show pain you planning to hold the pass he asked he was ten years older than aristides and although he commanded many fewer men he was a much more famous warrior he looked up the pass where we could see a handful of lydian slingers prowling around you bastards stood by us in the city he said and spat by way of explanation aristides shrugged i asked them to send us water aristagoras refused and youre surprised you called them cowardly fools lad eualcidas laughed which they are but theyll never forgive you he looked around fucking ionians eh he smiled at me youre a handsome man and thanks for my life not many men can say they saved eualcidas i blushed and he laughed he winked at aristides you do have some handsome men listen well stand here with you better than trying to face the medes down on the plains any day now theyll get their cavalry together then well be doomed better fight them up here aristides shook his head we cant camp here without water eualcidas shrugged he had a boyish grin he was a hard man to dislike thats why we have slaves he said send them down the pass tell them to bring wine too if im going to die tomorrow i think i want a feast he turned away with a salute and put his hand on my hip a feast he said into my eyes hah ive made you blush again listen honey he was a famous athlete and a man who had grown up at a trading station on crete all cretans are boylovers its their way it is in their laws superb soldiers and athletes not much for the crafts not always the smartest oh he was beautiful the most famous warrior in our army what he wanted was obvious so we sent all our slaves down the hill for water and the medes pushed some skirmishers around the pass a handful of our men with a few dozen slaves chased them off with rocks and spears and we settled to our cold rocks i remember that night because my body hurt its something that the bards never talk about eh the bruises you take in a fight gods the bruises you take in the gymnasium split knuckles broken fingers a rib bruised here the black burn on your shoulder where your shield rim rides your shoulder bone the cuts on your legs ares knows the toll it is worst for the men in the front rank and i had stood my ground in the agora of sardis and now three days later i still hurt my wound was slight but it ached when i rolled on it and i was lying on the ground on sand and gravel and we had few fires because we were high in the pass and there were no trees the word was we were going to die i was too inexperienced to do anything about such talk eualcidas came out of the dark with aristides and heraklides and a euboean i did not know my file was not asleep we were huddled together in the dark whispering afraid of the morrow and trying not to show it as soldiers always do aristides had a little bronze lantern and he put it on the ground and i swear that bit of light did more for our morale than all his talk aristides was a serious man and he spoke seriously he explained that we were going to do a deed of arms that men would never forget our actions to save the rest of the greeks and then he explained that as long as we held our ground we were safe he was a good man and my file was better just seeing his face and hearing his voice eualcidas waited until he was finished and then he smiled his infectious smile well kill us a load of medes tomorrow he said and then well slip away tomorrow night while they get ready for a big assault he looked around in the dim lamplight ive faced the medes before boys thing to remember is that they all wear gold so when we push forward over their dead our backrankers need to get their rings and brooches and then everyone shares together thats how you inspire troops dying for all of greece may appeal to a handful of noble young men but everyone likes the sound of a gold ring we were the junior file just left of the centre of the athenians and we must have been the last group they needed to visit aristides slapped a back or two gave my hand a squeeze and walked off into the darkness he left his lamp at the time i thought that it was a tribute to how rich the man was that a bronze lantern with a fancy bronze oil lamp inside could just be abandoned on a rock i remember picking it up and looking at it carefully pater never made anything like it it wasnt good work i could do better but the construction was crisp eualcidas hadnt left he was watching me look at the lamp i was young i felt that his gaze held some censure and i put the lamp down and shrugged my father was a bronzesmith i said he nodded and lay back stretching his legs youre not athenian i can tell i shook my head i have to put in here that i was the only noncitizen among the athenians and they never held it against me because while i had been a slave the friendship between plataea and athens had hardened into something like love or maybe it was forged in those three battles and somehow theyd managed not to fuck it up but some of the older men would actually touch me for luck because plataea had brought athens luck or so they said so i shrugged im from plataea i said but ive been a slave for a few years he laughed easily and the muscles in his throat were strong and golden like bronze it was for me like talking to achilles he was that famous how did a man like you end up a slave he asked i didnt end up a slave i retorted i ended up in the front rank yesterday he nodded smiled and said nothing a talent few men possess your people enslaved me i said he frowned ive been a warleader for five years he said ive never marched on plataea you came to us once with the athenians you beat us like a drum he laughed that got me i had heard it elsewhere of course but always from men who might have had the story wrong i was there he continued right opposite your plataeans i have a scorpion on my shield were you in the phalanx you must have been young i nodded and there were suddenly tears in my eyes my brother died fighting the spartans i said and i took his place in his armour he was brave eualcidas asked he was and he died facing a spartan man to man i was weeping and the euboean rolled over and put an arm around me he didnt say anything after a while he rolled back to where hed been i was better i hadnt really let myself think about it my brothers death and my fathers and now in the dark with a battle looming i was filled with a bitter angry grief for both they were in the ground and i was still here its an odd thing honey one ive seen often that soldiers rarely mourn a comrade when he falls sometimes it takes years my father fell fighting your phalanx i said quietly i was behind him and i stood over his body for a little i stopped because it was a bitter memory how i had been too weak to stand my ground and how the rain of bronze and iron had beaten me to my knees and knocked me down i told it just like that when i awoke i was a slave i finished eualcidas shook his head and his teeth gleamed in the dark you need to go to delphi he said you are godtouched and you have been betrayed no man of euboea sold you as a slave we ran i ran he said and he smiled that boys smile if you live long enough youll run too the day comes and the moment and life is sweet i found that i was holding his hand he had hard calluses on his palm i felt better i dont think theres shame in running when everyone runs i said im not sure thats really what i thought but he was a great man and suddenly he was looking for my comfort he smiled and it wasnt his boys smile it was a very old smile indeed wait until you run he said he shrugged youre a good young man i like you but i have a feeling you wont come and share my blanket i shook my head sorry lord i said i was to be honest tempted he was kind he was a killer of men but something in him was basically good and just sitting with him taught me i dont know what but maybe that what i was becoming could be greater than the sum of the corpses i left in many ways aristides and miltiades were better men they built to last and they did things for their city that will live for ever aristides was a noble man in every way and his mind went deep and miltiades was the best soldier ive ever known except maybe his son but eualcidas was a hero a man from the age of gold almost like a god he kissed me lets be heroes tomorrow he said and went off among the rocks back to his own men they tried us in the dawn but we were cold surly and awake and the shower of thrown spears bounced off our shields and we chased them down the pass without trouble my part of the line wasnt even engaged the slaves brought us some dried meat and some cheese and i ate what i could get down and drank my share of water my canteen was still full and i kept it and my leather bag on under my shield while most of the athenians sent all their gear away with their slaves late in the morning i saw men on horseback round the bend and come forward and i saw that it was artaphernes his right arm in a sling we were standing in our ranks and he rode quite close but had the sense to stay a spears cast away from us then he shook his head made a quip to one of his aides and rode away it was perhaps an hour before they made their effort we were bored and nervous and aristides and eualcidas kept walking along our front and talking which made the boys nervous you the writer with the wax tablet if you ever lead men to war let me tell you something not to do dont have long conferences with your subordinates got that what an old bastard i am my pardon sir you are a guest in my house have some more wine and send some to me talking of battle is thirsty work do you know that most of what men say about war is a tissue of lies all the girls know it women get a distrust of male bragging in their mothers milk eh hah you arent blushing now my pretty no what i say is true when the spears go down and the shields smack together who in tartarus remembers what happens it all goes by in a blur of panic and desperation and you are always one sword thrust from the dark until you stand there breathing like the accordion bellows in my fathers shop and someone tells you it is over what soldiers remember is the time before and sometimes the time after at the fight in the pass i remember cleon my secondranker had to piss four times even though he hadnt had enough water for two days and herks best spears head was loose and he kept making it rattle in irritation not that we could hear it but the vibration annoyed him and he kept at it the way a man will pick at a sore heraklides in the front rank on the right had the finest horsehair plume of any men among the athenians he removed it combed it out and remounted it which was a nice way of showing his contempt for the medes and did a lot for the rest of us then eualcidas threw one of his spears he didnt run or hop he just stepped forward and threw with all his might and ares he was a hero i had time to say something while it was in the air i said will you look at that or something equally inane while it cleft the heavens it struck point first and then he ran along the front unless you bastards think you can outthrow me he said no one throws a spear until the medes are closer than that no waste we cheered him and then the medes came they knew their business they poured around the corner of the pass the bodyguard itself and then more persians their high hats and scale armour obvious less than half a stade away they halted and formed their front in a matter of instants much faster than any of us had anticipated the first flight of arrows hit while we were still watching them in admiration we were mostly veterans and all our shields were off our insteps up on our arms and held high i doubt a man died in that first flight but a few men took an arrow in the instep cleon had one ring his helmet and it dazed him and all of us had shields moved by the weight of the arrows two arrows punched through the thin bronze on the face of my aspis and the heavier one went right through the rim and that was just one volley the second volley came in and the third was in the air and already men were losing their nerve after the second volley there were screams and i cant remember the next five or six except that it was as if a big man was throwing stones at my shield i took a graze along the outside of my left thigh and another arrow hit my left greave so hard that i almost fell but the bronze held despite the mediocre work i turned and looked because cleons shield wasnt pressed against my back he wasnt far away an arms length but he was also looking back close up and get your fucking shields up i yelled and then the next pair of volleys hit more screams now we had men down and other men pressing back heedless of the arrows eualcidas ran across the front of the phalanx ten men to run with me he shouted i had no idea what they had planned but if eualcidas was leading it i was going front rank i shouted at cleon i stepped out as the next arrow storm hit aristides was no coward he stepped right out from his place as the strategos as soon as you rush them well march he shouted oddly ten paces in front of the phalanx only one arrow hit my shield the persians were lofting their arrows now i understood what we were doing and how suicidal it was most of the men who stepped up were euboeans i think there were eight of them and eualcidas wasnt waiting for more first man into the medes will live for ever he said and we ran we ran as if we were running in the hoplitodromos the race in armour we ran right at their line three hundred persians a front rank of spearmen with big shields scalloped like boeotian shields and then eight more ranks of men with heavy bows and short swords cyrus would be there and pharnakes if i hadnt put him down and all the others i knew i thought all that in one step as my sandal crunched the gravel i had about two hundred more strides to run or die we must have surprised them and we surprised them again by being so fast we were fast when i think of that run i remember what it was to be young to be so stupid that i would dare to cross a field of persian arrows alone and to be so strong that it seemed a reasonable risk we set the medes a quandary shoot the runners or shoot the phalanx the phalanx came in behind us and they were not slow they began to sing the paean and it wasnt the best ive ever heard but it was loud in the narrow confines of the pass then you have to understand the persian way the front rank as i say is spearmen sometimes the second rank as well so all the archers have to shoot over the first two ranks and that means that they lose the ability to pick off individual men master archers the officers decide how they will shoot it is hard for them to detail a few men to shoot one target while the rest shoot another not that i knew any of this i just ran and the only sound i could hear was my feet on the gravel it was like running for a prize i ran fifty paces perhaps more before they began to shoot at me it wasnt the storm from before either it was a steady impact of single shafts against my shield something stung my foot and then i felt a blow like the kick of a mule against my shin but again the greave held and still i ran forward and then the world cleared for me it is hard to describe really i was running and then as if my eyes had been closed i was running like a god i felt as if i was a god i had been running with my aspis held in front and high which made me blind to everything but the ground under my feet now i let my shield go down a fraction and i ran looking at the medes and they were close i have so much to say about this that i will only bore you thugater except that something changed and it was as if i could see having been blind i could see that i was going to live i could see that i was about to be a hero athena granted me this i think or my ancestor heracles twenty paces from their shield wall i decided not to slow down it is worth saying that when men run at a shield wall they slow as they close in the last three or four paces they have to or they risk being spitted in the knee or thigh by a cool hand and most men correctly dread the moment when they crash into the enemys shield you are vulnerable then you could fall i didnt even slow i lengthened my stride like a runner finishing a race as if a garland or a crown of laurel waited for me an arrow rang off the front of my helmet so hard that i almost lost my balance and then i smashed into their wall and all the sight and sound and smell of it hit me at once i killed men no man killed me i didnt know it at the time but i was one of just two men to reach their wall but we did reach it and i was told afterwards that we knocked holes in their shield wall like a big iron awl punching bronze the phalanx was close behind us and no arrows were falling on them they roared although i didnt hear it i was in a world no bigger than the bloodsoaked ground beneath my sandals and the limits of my helmet i remember that blows fell on that helmet like paters hammer on his anvil and more blows glanced off the scales on my back and slashed my outer thighs and my right arm but i refused to stop i remember that i remember deciding that i would go all the way through them and see what happened then i pushed and stomped and killed and i have no memory of fighting the spearmen but only of killing archers hacking their faces and their bows and pushing forward always forward and the pain of the blows on my back and my helmet and then faster than i tell it i was through i was against the rock face of the pass and i turned both my spears were gone the gods know where and i drew my sword put my back to the rock and cut at every persian who came forward they were brave a dozen of them rearrankers inexperienced men pressed at me they had neither shields nor spears and they were not much hand to hand and they pressed me clumsily and despite the ringing in my head i killed them not all of them just enough to make the rest pause and doubt themselves then there was pressure the kind of pressure you get in a nightmare and i was crushed against big rock and the aspis pushed into my neck and thighs and i cried out from the pain of it and then men were screaming my name and it was over eualcidas was the first to embrace me he pushed his helmet back on his brow and he was shaking from head to foot and had an arrow clean through his helmet by ares he said i knew you were beautiful and in those five minutes in the time that the waterclocks give a man to speak his mind in the assembly i was no longer a man i became a hero most of the other eight men who ran with us were dead or badly wounded only eualcidas and i had made the enemy line and we had hurt the medes badly killing fifteen and downing another twenty we had captives i was so dazed that i was sick i threw up on the rocks and heraklides held my hair then we went back down the pass to where we had started the slaves buried our dead and we waited in the sun i drank the water men gave me and then i drained the water and wine in my canteen eualcidas came by if they come back will you do it again he asked i grinned of course i said it was like madness or the smell of fine wine or that moment when a woman lets her peplos fall but before you can touch her you want to know what makes achilles different from the other men among the noble achaeans homer must have known some killers of men he knew us because any man any good man and the world is full of them can stand his ground one fine day he sets his mind or he is angry or simply young and he will stand his ground and kill fighting his fears and his enemies together we honour those men but the killers come alive when there is nothing left but that fear and the rush of spirit when all of your life falls away and you are the edge of your sword and the point of your spear the killers will fight every day not one fine day eualcidas was serious he knew we might have to run into the arrow storm again and now that he had my measure he wanted me to run with him and of course i wanted to go no that doesnt mean i wasnt afraid i was terrified but i had to feel that terror again and again but they didnt come back and an hour after dark we marched away into the torchlit darkness down the rest of the pass and on to the plain artaphernes followed us on to the plains but now he had lydian cavalry and some medes and they harried our retreat we had bought aristagoras a day only for him to squander it like the fool he was and so just two days later while my wounds were still unhealed and the aches from the fight at the pass were at their height he forced us to battle aristagoras arrayed us he hated the athenians by then and he was visibly afraid a traitor in a losing rebellion eualcidas didnt hide his contempt and aristagoras retaliated like any petty tyrant by putting us on the left and questioning our courage he put his milesians on the right opposite the medes and he put the ephesians in the centre with the chians and the lesbians he set the lines in full view of artaphernes the satrap responded by moving his best infantry carians who later joined the rebellion against us unlike aristagoras artaphernes never believed his own propaganda he knew that the athenians and the euboeans were the most dangerous aristagoras set our lines in the late afternoon of the second day after the fight in the pass we stood in our places until the shadows were long and then we walked back to our fires and ate i didnt have a slave but cleons slave a surly italian boy made me stew and took my coppers with carefully hidden delight eualcidas and i sat together after we ate most men thought us lovers perhaps if things had gone otherwise we might have been lovers because he was patroclus in every way that mattered and perhaps i was achilles at any rate we sat and talked and other men came and sat with us not just athenians or euboeans either epaphroditos came with some men of lesbos and there were chians and even milesians around that fire we drank wine and eualcidass singer he had a rhapsode gave us a thousand lines of the iliad his son sang another poem and stephanos came clasped my hand and drank wine with me men treated me differently i liked it i liked being lord i was a hero and other heroes accepted me as such we lay on sheepskins and listened to the iliad and drank wine and life was good heres a truth for you thugater war is sweet when you are one of the heroes late in the evening archilogos turned up he stood in the firelight until i saw him i rose and went to embrace him but he held his hand between us we are not friends he said i remember nodding i understood then perhaps for the first time that it was not possible for us to be friends and for him to retain his place in the world i heard that you had the name of a hero he said that you slew ten medes in combat i nodded he smiled but only for a moment damn it doru why did you fuck my sister we could have been brothers my father loves you i reached out again but he turned his head away pater intends to prosecute you in the courts he said aristagoras pretends he does not know what happened but he has suggested that we revoke or deny your manumission and have you taken as an escaped slave neither pater nor i will accept this he crossed his arms why he asked me and suddenly he was angry he had come to talk but i had ruined his life or so he reckoned it i knew that a shrug might start a fight i dont know i said carefully was it because of penelope he asked his face towards the new moon i tried to reach him the the first time i thought that she was penelope that made him turn i didnt even know that you and penelope were anything he said yes you did you just forgot because you were the master and i the slave i said then i shrugged penelope liked you better and like all of us she wanted her freedom shes pregnant he admitted ill free her and see to it she has employment mater will take her to weave shell like that i said my fucking sister will marry aristagoras oh hes a worm archi spat she plans she makes plans and then carries them out i decided that anything i said would make things worse we were having a conversation but it was a fragile thing like a spiderweb in a flood why does she want to marry him archi asked i paused again perhaps it was three days with eualcidas but i wanted to watch my words carefully part of her believes she deserves no better i said part of her wants a man she can control which were you he asked he was angry now i had not given the right answer both i admitted he took a deep breath if we win tomorrow he said and my hopes rose because despite all my talking to your fine people about heroism what i really wanted back was my family that house in ephesus and daily lessons with heraclitus yes i asked run he said run far and dont let aristagoras catch you he threw his chlamys over his shoulder i wish id been there in the pass me too thats all i could say it was true i knew my former master he too had it in his soul he would have run all the way into the medes or died trying he walked away i let him go i still think about it ive changed that conversation a thousand thousand times said better things chased him and wrestled him to the ground thats not what happened though maybe if i had a great deal of pain might have been averted i never promised you a happy story thugater in the morning we formed early i was in the front rank now and for the first time i could see the whole army the athenians were on a slight hill with the remnants of an old town under our feet i rested my shield on the edge of an old wall buried in the ground this had been a village with a tiny acropolis a thousand years ago i could see then i looked south along our lines and i could see what a worthless army we were no two contingents would form together except the hereditary enemies from athens and euboea the rest of them were in little regiments and their lines werent even level aristagoras had put his milesians slightly in front to show us all how brave they were and every time another contingent tried to match shields with them hed shuffle a few paces forward aristides put us up on our little hill he placed eualcidas and his men on our right they had a talk and then aristides came over and pointed behind us if the army breaks he said we go north we can go all night and reach the estuary in the morning and let the medes catch the locals he shrugged heraklides pointed at the lydian cavalry who were coming up on artaphernes left so theyd come at us why dont we just leave now he asked aristides shook his head because no man will say that the athenians ran first behind me cleon spat ill die knowing that i gave my life so that my city had a good reputation with the fucking ionians he said they already hate us let them do the dying these sentiments were widely echoed but aristides ignored them and we stood our ground while the carians came and formed against us they glittered not for nothing did the medes call them the men of bronze they had more armour than any men id ever seen and every man in the front rank had a bronze corslet and greaves and most had thigh pieces and armlets and some had cuffs of bronze and even bronze foot armour that covered their sandals their shields were faced in bronze and they were big men ive always hated fighting men who were bigger than me artaphernes rode up and down his line and they cheered him even though he was the foreign overlord he had more ionian greeks in his army than we had in ours id wager aristagoras didnt give a speech we stood around all morning and then just before midday the milesians sang their paean and went forward the rest of the rebels went forward too but they did it by fits and starts and the left hung back aristides didnt seem in a hurry to leave our hill the lydian cavalry rode forward at a brisk trot determined to flank our phalanx and rip us apart i watched the cavalry and i feared them greeks dont have much cavalry and we arent always good at standing against it but aristides had done his job and over on the flank of our hill there were orchards and vineyards small but walled and all our slaves and skeuophoroi were inside those walls they ripped into the flanks of the cavalry with slings and javelins and the lydians didnt stay to fight they turned and rode off ive always thought that the fatal flaw with cavalry is the ease with which they ride away then the carians came forward from my ripe old age i now suspect they had intended to hit us while the cavalry chewed our flanks to ruin but as with most plans that require men to cooperate on a battlefield they screwed it up so that the men of caria came forward alone aristides came and said a few things they sounded good and we cheered him but all i could see was that wall of bronze coming at us and how big the carians were i didnt feel like a hero at all i kept waiting for that wonderful feeling to come and it wouldnt come when they reach the foot of the slope aristides said finally we will sing and go forward into them i could see that this surprised the men around me and that meant it would surprise the carians we had a nice secure hilltop and they had to climb to us in the sun fuck cleon said behind me look at that we all stopped watching aristides and looked south instead we had a superb view of the battlefield so we were able to watch as the milesians broke and ran they had never even reached the persian lines aristides stared at them with disgust the carians would have done better to give us a few minutes wed have marched away the battle was over our strategos was already running instead they did as theyd been ordered and came forward we beat them and then we get out of here aristides said then he gave orders for something wed practised but never actually done in combat rearhalf files he cried close to the front march we formed a dense wall what spartans call the synaspismos where we put shield on shield but we were only half as deep only four men instead of eight as soon as we formed close we raised our voices and sang and we moved down the hill in many ways this was my first fight in a phalanx oh i know it was my fourth or fifth but in all the others id been at the back and the fighting had broken up quickly or id been alone as in the fight at the pass this time both sides fought like lions when you are in the front rank theres an instant just before the lines close when a skilful man can hurt his opponent with a spear thrust once the lines come together theres no fine spearfighting you just thrust as fast and hard as you can until the shaft breaks and then you draw your sword i had two spears most of us had a pair balanced for throwing with long leather thongs when we were five paces apart i stepped forward with my left foot in time to the paean and threw my first spear most of us did and two hundred heavy spears crashed into the carians as their spears came right back at us if the pounding of the medes arrows had been like the fall of hail on my shield the jar of a carian spear was like being hit with a log i had my second spear in my hand in the last three paces i remember being pleased at how well i threw and changed hands and i stepped forward planted my foot and thrust overhand diagonally right we crashed into their front and they stopped us dead and we stopped them my spear went in under the carians helmet and he went down i let the spear go i was locked up against a big man and his spear was over my right shoulder trying to kill cleon ares that press was close we were doubled up and we had the hill behind us they had armour and size no one gave a foot i got my sword from under my arm and i thrust under my shield because the crush was too close for a cut the point glanced off his thigh armour and i thrust again and again and finally gods it seemed to take for ever i got the blade around his outthrust leg and cut his sinews and he went down i raised my sword up over my head in the single breath before his filemate slammed his shield into mine i cut at his helmet and scored shearing off part of his crest and slamming the helmet against his cheek he stumbled and i pushed into his shield and he fell tripping over his mate and quicker than thought my sword went left and right at waist level or a little below i cut at their buttocks and the backs of their legs backcut forecut and then the thirdranker got past the tangle into me and i hammered my sword into his helmet he had no crest and his helmet rang and i hit him again he dropped his spear to get at his sword and cleon put his spear right into the tau of his faceplate a magnificent thrust i knew my job and now i felt the power i roared and pushed past the dying man slammed the fourthranker with my shield and backcut at the thirdranker without even looking at him so that my sword broke on his helmet but he went down probably unconscious cleon thrust over my shoulder and i took his spear he let go and i started fighting with it and he must have got another from the men behind him because when that spear broke he gave me another they were pushing away from me now the fourth and fifthrankers in the carian host none of them wanted to face me and i began to hurt them sniping against their thighs and necks with accurate spear thrusts a killer like me is most dangerous when no one will face him never give a man time to plan his hits or hell reap a whole rank i didnt kill them i just made them bleed and they fell no one is brave with the red flowing from an open vein beside me aristides and heraklides and all the files on either side of mine pushed forward into the hole i was cutting and they pushed and then as suddenly as the storm of bronze had begun it was over the pressure on my chest faded and then it was gone the dust rose and i punched my borrowed spear at a man as he turned away knocking him sprawling without killing him as i stepped over him he tried to roll and get his shield up but i put my spear point into the unguarded spot at the top of his back and it grated on his spine and he thrashed like a gaffed fish dead already and alive enough to know it cleon grabbed one of the wings on my scale shirt that covered my shoulders and tugged lets go he said the whole athenian phalanx was turning away into the dust the carians were running and we were running too unbroken but we knew what was coming i wanted to run every fucking carian down and kill them they were just men under all that bronze and now that the power was on me i wanted to punish them for making me afraid thats how men feel when the enemy breaks for a little while they all become killers and many husbands and fathers die before they regain their wits and realize that the enemy is running and they can sit down and revel in victory men are fools cleon was not a fool and hed held my back like a champion in story and probably saved my life so when he turned uphill i followed him and we moved fast up through the dust and over the hilltop and then down the other side heading north i stopped at the top and looked south even through the rising swirls of battle haze i could see that the whole greek army was in flight in the centre where artaphernes stood with his bodyguard against the ephesians the great eagle of persia shone like the sun and the ephesians ran like frightened children i looked back over my shoulder and saw the lydian cavalry moving forward i called a warning to aristides and got back in my place we trotted along together down the old acropolis and out on to the plain then around a farm pond aristides shouted and we turned there was a moment of confusion and then our shields locked and the cavalry turned away throwing spears six times we turned and stood our ground the last time id had enough and as they turned to run i broke from the front of the phalanx and ran after them they were contemptuous of us and the dust was high and i caught my man before hed even begun to ride away my spear killed his horse and then i put my point in his eyes as he lay under the animal other horsemen began to turn to come back and that was their error aristides charged them the whole athenian phalanx changing directions like a school of fish from prey to predator in a heartbeat the lydians wrestled to control their horses and we must have killed fifteen or twenty of them before they broke away the first lydian i killed had gold on his sword strap and cleon helped me pull it over his head then i saw the sword and it was a fine weapon a long leafblade thin near the hand and wide and sharp near the point see there it is on the wall take her down thats my ravens talon her blade snapped on me later and i got her a new one same scabbard long story there she took some time to come back to me once like an angry wife touch that blade honey fifty mens lives fell across that edge aye maybe more that lydian had a good sword and a good horse and later i heard that he was a good man a friend of heraclitus mores the pity but ares put him under my hand and i took him he thought we were beaten and he and his mates died on our spears and then we got back in our ranks and scampered off we went ten stades at something like a run and then we stopped it was midafternoon and the sun was still high we drank water wed run clear and we were safe enough the euboeans were weeping eualcidas had fallen and they had left his body i never heard how it happened he must have gone down in the first moments of the fight against the carians because thats when mistakes happen and when we turned to run no one was quite sure hed been hit the euboeans took more casualties than we did and perhaps all the men around him died too but the shame of leaving his body to be spoiled was more than could be borne aristides for all his nobility couldnt understand what they were talking about wed lost two dozen men in the fight and we were leaving them so that we could run for our ships to aristides base as that was abandoning the corpses was the price of saving his command and he was never a man to put his own honour above the saving of his men which is why we loved him but the euboeans began to shout and they were weeping as i said will the medes accept a truce to bury the dead heraklides asked aristides shook his head were rebels against the great king he said artaphernes wont accept a herald from us men started to look at me i dont know who started it but soon a dozen heads were turned my way and i knew what was expected its the most unfair part of high reputation once you choose to be a hero you have no choice in the matter i reslung my new sword until i liked the way it hung and hefted my borrowed spear ill go and fetch him then i said shall i i could see it all cross aristides face i wasnt a citizen i didnt count against his numbers my loss was acceptable and yet he was a truly noble man he came over to me he kept his voice low we all saw you he said he meant we all saw you shatter the carians his eyes rested on mine say the word and i will forbid your going he meant if i wanted out hed provide me with an excuse that my fine young friends is nobility damn he was a good man a man who understood men like me and remember he stood in the front rank five or six times not because he loved it but because it was his duty he was brave because he didnt love it oh no but i shook my head ill go i said give me two slaves to carry the body cleon volunteered his italian and the euboeans pushed forward their heros cretan boy he was weeping i took a deep breath searching for the power of combat and finding nothing i didnt even want to walk to the ships much less turn and go back ten stades i had no plan and no idea what i was up against but i knew my role already eualcidas had taught me so i shrugged as if it was nothing ill meet you at the ships i said trying to sound reassuring grand and noble i had taken three paces when aristides caught me and embraced me our breastplates grated together his bronze thorax and my scales and then herk came up go straight to the river he said how i asked i wasnt really listening i was trying to get my head around what id just said i would do he pushed an arm out and pointed down the long slope to the distant river ill set my rowers moving as soon as i get to the beach he said quickly go south with the body ill come to you i swear it by the gods suddenly it didnt seem so bad it was still stupid and impossible but herk was going to come and rescue me youre a fine man i said no matter what i say about you when your back is turned he laughed we all laughed the way heroes are supposed to laugh and then i turned to the slaves lets go i said and we were off the first thing i did was to tell the slaves that they were free as soon as we got that body to the ships that changed their demeanour desperate mission impossible odds but if freedom was the reward they were game heh i was a slave thugater i know the rules we walked forward i wasnt in a hurry in as much as i had a plan my plan was to lie low until dark and then go for the corpse we made it back to the farm pond and there were lydian slaves burying the men wed killed we went around a thicket well to the north of the corpses and then we stopped in a copse of olive trees and had something to eat and drank some of the wine and water that the three of us carried which to be honest was a fair amount by now i was afraid afraid to turn around and quit and afraid to go down to the battlefield the two slaves idomeneus and lekthes were not afraid idomeneus had been eualcidass bedwarmer a beautiful boy with kohl on his eyelashes but the muscles in his arms were like ropes and he had wept for his master until the kohl ran down his face he looked like a fury or a mourner at a funeral lekthes was a different kind of boy short and squat and just growing into heavy muscle with a thick neck and a pug nose he was brave enough to give me lip when i told him to polish my armour so i had some faith in him i was a famous warrior and a hero they believed in me and i could see it in them which made me braver sad but true i drank in their admiration and when id had enough food and enough wine we walked down into the darkening fields where vultures already ripped at the corpses the little acropolis was easy to find and the carians hadnt disturbed the bodies they lay where they had fallen and then the task began id expected hades i dont know what i expected but i think id wanted to fight fifty persians and take the body by force instead the three of us moved from ruined body to ruined body turning each over to look at the man dont ever go on a darkening battlefield most of the bodies were already stripped imagine we were forty stades from ephesus no one had come to bury the dead but human greed was enough that every peasant in the area was hurrying to the battlefield to strip finger rings only the gold was gone most men were still in armour although here and there a good helmet was missing after we combed the hill once i realized that i was looking for a bareheaded man the human vultures would have stripped his highwinged helmet my hands were foul with old blood and ordure most men soil themselves in death and many spear wounds open a mans entrails anyway i stopped to throw up drank some wine and held my hands away from my face because they stank and then i went back up the hill this time i tried to think like a philosopher i found my own place on the battlefield and then i reasoned where eualcidas should have been at the rightmost point of his line and then i walked down the hill being eualcidas in the halfdark i found him just as idomeneus whistled i had left the cretan boy at the hill crest because he was weeping and because id decided that we needed a lookout his whistle froze me my hand on eualcidass shoulder he was dead with a clean stab through his throatboll that had almost decapitated him lekthe was a tough bastard and he was right by me cavalry he said i glanced down at them they were behind us half a stade away strip him and put him on a stretcher i said use his cloak and some spears he nodded i picked up a pair of spears they were everywhere and went uphill until i reached the cretan kid go and help lekthe i said you found him he asked i pushed him down the hill then i crouched by a rock or perhaps the foundation stone of the old temple and watched the lydians they werent interested in me from the height of the hill i could see a hundred other parties gathering wounded and my hopes rose immediately there were wounded men all over the field of course why hadnt i thought of that in fact the worst mistake id made was to come armoured and armed because the winners as soon as the fighting ends shed their kit and go and find their friends of course they do but i was not abandoning my arms so i went down the hill and rooted among the dead men until i found one with his himation strapped inside his shield to pad his shoulder older men do it and i used the cloak to cover me by then the slaves had the body on a couple of spears i used one of my spears as a walking staff and discarded the other and i made lekthe carry my aspis on his back while idomeneus carried his masters shield a scorpion on his own back and then like a funereal procession we walked down off the old acropolis and into the valley heading for the river i felt clever brave and more than a little godlike heh the gods can smell hubris a stade away any of you young people ever been on a corpse field eh ill take that as a no it is not quiet we say as quiet as the grave and it may be that once the soul has flown out of the mouth and gone down with the other shades the grave is quiet but a battlefield is a noisy place the animals come to feast the crows and ravens fight over the tastiest morsels and men scream their last pain or defiance to the gods until they cannot scream and then they cough and pant and rattle once dark falls it is the worst place you can imagine may the gods preserve you from ever having to visit one in the dark or pass your last hours there although i always expected it for myself it unmans me just to think of it better a clean death in the heat of battle so that the soul goes burning with the pure fire of strife to the logos than the foul death amidst the carrioneaters and women and children who have to go searching among the corpses for a father a lover a brother a husband by hades that is a cursed way to see a man for the last time with the ravens picking at his eyes we walked down from the hill that the athenians and eretrians had held and darkness fell as we made our way among the corpses i didnt know it but it wasnt so bad there because the worst of the kills happen after one side runs and we didnt run and neither did the carians so there were not as many dead as there might have been it was down in the valley that the corpses became thick and they were all greek hades but they were thick honey the darkness hid the worst of it except for the sounds but i still had to stop and retch when i saw a dog rooting inside the chest cavity of a man and his eyes seemed to move the slaves saw and dropped the body when i had finished retching i put my spear in the mans throat to make sure i think the slaves wanted to run away i didnt blame them but i wiped the spear and then myself if you wont carry him to the ships ill run you down and add you to the pile of bodies i said neither of them met my eye they picked up the spearpoles and we started off again stumbling and cursing there were pinpoints of light in the dark most of them in a clump to the west we made to skirt around them and ran into our first patrol i had assumed that the battlefield was empty except for scavengers and mourners but of course the persians who organized everything in their lives had patrols to keep the scavengers from the corpses of their own slain until the sun should rise again i heard them in time and the three of us lay flat there was some moonlight just enough to make the whole scene hazy and hard to see like a foul dream i lay there the pale circle of my face hidden in my cloak and listened all i could hear was a dying man at my side grunting he tried to grab my elbow please he managed the poor bastard had lain there for six hours or more no water i could smell his guts i elbowed him now i could hear footsteps heeh heeh the dying man said and little grunts and mewls like those a toddler makes camelfuckers a persian voice said they were close come to loot our dead the cowards effeminate boyfuckers i hate the greeks run from a battle and come back to steal from the dead the man ranted on and on as men do after battles i didnt know his voice shush brother another voice said shush ahriman walks the dark no man should curse here heheh the dying man cried he gave a convulsive jerk what was that the first persian said men take a long time to die come brother keep walking if i stop i will have to start getting water for these poor bastards the second persian sounded familiar was he someone i knew it didnt matter because even cyrus and pharnakes would kill me if they took me or so i thought boyfuckers the man who was angry spat and they walked off i heard him stumble on a corpse and he fell ah he cried i am foul with the juices of his body his voice shook i am unclean the second persian spent half the night reassuring him he was a good man that one while he talked to his frightened brother he emptied his canteen into two wounded men and then he started killing them i heard him and though it sounds foul i knew that he was no murdering fury but a bringer of peace eheheh said the dying man at my elbow i looked at him and he was younger than me and kalos even at the point of death with big beautiful eyes that wanted to know how his world had turned to shit his skin where it was not smeared with sweat and puke was smooth and lovely he was somebodys son i drew my short dagger really my eating knife from under my scale shirt where i keep it and i put my lips by his ear say goodnight i said i tried to sound like pater when he put me to bed say goodnight laddy gnight he managed like a child the poor bastard go to elysium with the thought of home i prayed and put the point of my eating knife into his brain give me some fucking wine oh war is glorious thugater i dream of him i never saw his face in the dark you see he could have been anyone any one of hundreds of men ive put down myself battlefields sieges duels ship fights all leave that wastage of dead and near dead and every one of them was a man with all of a mans life before the iron or the bronze ripped the shade from him its funny i have killed so many men but that one comes back to me in the dark and then i drink more and try to forget here fill it the persians lingered and lingered but at last the older one got his brother to walk away into the dark and i picked myself up found the two slaves and we headed west to avoid more persian patrols west brought the sound of mourning here the persians and the lydians had reaped the ionians like weeds at the edge of a field cutting them down from behind as they fled now local women were out looking for their men and fathers and children with torches the persians didnt disturb them and they thought we were more of the same which we were or close enough as the moon climbed we could see the curved line of corpses like seawrack on a beach and men and women desperately turning them pushing torches down to look into a face grim work i knew heraclitus by his voice he was talking to a boy and the boy was weeping by his side i couldnt help myself i walked up to him in the dark and he raised his torch doru he said you live i threw my arms around him i wept i was no different from the younger persian i was unmanned by my reaction to the fight and then to the battlefield he let me cry for as long as my heart beat a hundred times no longer you are searching for him too he asked i i came for eualcidas of euboea my voice shook searching for who heraclitus nodded he had a torch and it made his face look like a statues his eyes were pools of darkness hipponax fell here trying to keep the line from breaking he said ah i choked i remember that suddenly i couldnt breathe the weeping boy was kylix the slave is briseis here i asked dont be a fool heraclitus said news wont even be in the city yet more softly he asked will you help me find him put the body down and rest i said to the slaves these are friends lekthes came and touched my arm to get my attention he pointed to the river which was clear just a stade away in the moonlight we are close master he said he didnt want to risk his soontobeaccomplished freedom he meant stow it i growled i came back to heraclitus you fought i asked i had a hard time picturing him in the phalanx do i look like a slave he asked of course i fought he reached out and touched my sword this is a bitter night for me doru and for you i know his eyes were shadowed but i knew he was looking over my shoulder help me find him he said quickly of course master i said i found him in a matter of moments i knew his bronzestudded sandals i had put them on his feet often enough i sobbed to see that alone of the men at that part of the line he lay with his face to the foe and he had a great wound in his side where a spear had gone in under his armpit where his rankmate should have protected him a mede lay by his head and hipponaxs spear point was stuck in the mans ribs i assumed that hipponax was dead but that was not his fate or mine i touched him to roll him over and be sure and he flinched and then screamed that scream was the worst sound i had ever heard it happens sometimes that a man will go down on the field a blow to the head or a sudden cut and the shock of it puts him under but later he awakens to the awful truth that he is almost a corpse lying amidst pain waiting to die that was hipponaxs fate he had a second wound a cut that had gone right into his leather thorax so that his guts glistened in the torchlight and lay hidden under his body and when he moved the pain must have been incredible but worse than the pain ive seen it is the realization when you see your guts in a pile you know you are dead he screamed and screamed have i not said that i loved him if not im a fool he was more my father than pater with his humour and his slow anger his sense of justice and his poetry he was a great man even when i was a slave and he ordered me beaten even when he threatened me with a sword i loved him i hated to leave him and i knew that if i had not been exiled from his side he wouldnt be screaming away the last heartbeats of his mortality amidst the ravens i got down in the bloody mud and put his head in my lap he screamed what could i do i tried to stroke his face but his eyes said everything the unfairness and the pain remember that he never wanted war with the great king and yet he had fallen with his face to the foe and his spear in a persians guts while worse men ran have i mentioned the glories of war thugater fill it to the top and dont bother with water all the way all the way when i give an order i expect it to be obeyed thats better where was i oh im not even to the bad part yet i told you how he screamed you have heard women in childbirth thats pain add to that despair which most women thank the gods dont need to fear in childbirth and that was his scream hed been out so his voice was fresh and strong after ten screams i couldnt think after twenty screams i stopped trying to talk to him who knows how many times he screamed finally i put my knife under his chin i hugged him close and i kissed him between screams and then i pushed it up under his jaw and into his brain heraclitus had told me once that this was the kindest stroke ive done it often enough and i know that it ends the screams the fastest cut a mans throat and he has to bleed out i dont know how long i sat there long enough to fill my lap with his blood you killed him archi said his voice was surprisingly calm i had no idea how long he had been standing there heraclitus had his hand on my shoulder you are a brave man he said to me you killed him archi said again now there was a lilt to his words archilogos heraclitus stepped between us we must take his body and go kylix came still crying he began to strip the armour from his dead masters body another of the house slaves was there dion the water boy no doubt he had come as hipponaxs skeuophoros together they rolled the corpse off my lap and stripped him idomeneus helped without being asked you killed him archi said after the body was rolled roughly in a himation and laid across spears heraclitus struck him a sharp blow with his hand open dont be a fool boy he turned to me your eyes are younger and sharper than mine can you lead the way you killed him archi roared and came at me his sword was in his hand and he cut at my head i drew and parried in one motion and our swords rang together with the unmistakable sound of steel on steel it was dark and the footing was bad the only thing that kept him alive was that i wasnt fighting back he made wild savage sweeps at me and i parried them and my new sword took the whole weight of his wide cuts and the blade held notching his blade again and again he hacked at me and i parried and heraclitus finally tripped him with a spear and then rapped him on the head with the spearbutt but it was too late for us even as archi slumped to the ground halfstunned the hoofbeats that i had halfheard while i blocked his savagery came closer and suddenly we were surrounded by torches and persian voices they surrounded us efficiently despite the bodies on the ground most of them had spears and there were more than ten i knew cyrus immediately even mounted in the dark he was giving orders hail lord cyrus i shouted he pushed his horse forward past his companions and raised a torch doru why are you here oh of course you were looking for your master cyrus slid from the horses back this is hipponax a fine man thats one of yours i said pointing my sword at the dead mede cyrus held the torch back over his head so that he could see the ground darius he said he didnt muster after the battle more hoofbeats sheathe that sword or you are a dead man cyrus said at my side i looked at him i felt perhaps i felt a hint of what hipponax felt awakening to pain and the knowledge that there was nothing to come but death they would enslave me no one on earth would pay a ransom for me and i would not be a slave again so i smiled or my face made an imitation of a smile i think im a dead man anyway i said why artaphernes asked from the dark i knew his voice too put up that sword heraclitus took my arm and stripped the sword from my hand as if i was a child i had forgotten that he was at my side damn you i spat artaphernes was on a white horse he rode between the two closewrapped corpses hipponax and eualcidas the wind was picking up and the torches were snapping like angry dogs oh he owed me a life but only a born nobleman expects the world to work like that like an epic poem a slave expects the instant revocation of every favour every promise but artaphernes was a different sort of man he gestured to me you he said you are a rebel cyrus spoke up and he was never a better friend to me than in that hour master they came to retrieve the body of hipponax your guestfriend in ephesus it was obvious in the torchlight that i was wearing a scale shirt you were in arms today boy the satrap asked yes lord i said he nodded i have already declared an amnesty for all those taken in arms he said no man will be sold into slavery or executed if he returns to his allegiance i will punish only those who came from over the sea to attack my lands the athenians and their allies i shrugged i served with the athenians i said and you wont find another one to punish they broke your carians and then marched off to their ships are you a complete fool cyrus hissed in my ear but you were born in the west i remember you telling me so the satrap shrugged go home boy tell them in the west that the great king is merciful he was going to let me go i took the ring his ring off my hand and held it up to him you repay my favour i said he shook his head gentlemen never repay he said they exchange keep the ring go with your gods who is that other man i knew he didnt mean the slaves heraclitus the philosopher i said artaphernes dismounted i have long wanted to meet you he said heraclitus shrugged you have the advantage of me lord you were in arms today the satrap asked he ignored the insult aye lord heraclitus said do you accept my amnesty artaphernes asked heraclitus bowed his head i do not lord your name carries much weight the satrap said will you not speak to your fellow citizens heraclitus shook his head no he said no words of mine could sway the wind that blows now lord war not reason is master here too many men are dead can we not stop before more die artaphernes asked there is nothing for you greeks to fight for we do not enslave you you do that to yourselves this freedom is a word just a word a greek tyrant takes more from a city than one of the great kings satraps ever would heraclitus grunted he raised his face and his tears showed in the firelight the logos is but words he said but words can take on the breath of life freedom is a word that breathes ask any man who has been a slave is it not so doru indeed master i said every man is slave to another artaphernes said no heraclitus said your ancestors knew better artaphernes let anger master him you have been held up to me as a wise man he said as long as i have come here men have told me of the wisdom of heraclitus yet here i stand surrounded by the stinking corpses of your friends i offer to preserve your city and you prate to me of freedom if my men storm ephesus who among you will be free have you ever seen a city stormed heraclitus shrugged my wisdom is nothing he said but i am wise enough to know that war is a spirit that can never be put back in a wine jar once released like the spirits of strife in pandoras box war is the king and master of all strife this war will not end until everything it touches has been changed some men will be made lords and others will be made slaves and when the world is broken and remade then we can make peace artaphernes took a deep breath do you prophesy he asked when the god is on me sometimes i see the future in the logos but the future does not always come to pass listen to my prophecy then wise man i will come in two days with fire and sword and i predict that submission would be the wisest course artaphernes remounted his horse i desire to show mercy please allow me to do so heraclitus shook his head every woman whose husband lies here will demand vengeance he said and their vengeance will be to spread their legs for my soldiers artaphernes sighed there is no greek army in the world that can stand against the great king go use your head philosopher heraclitus was wise enough to bow instead of saying what came to his lips cyrus came over to me you are a fool he said ten times over why do i like you he embraced me do you need money he asked with typical persian generosity i shook my head no i said i have my loot from sardis i added with the foolishness of youth dont let me find you at the end of my spear he said walk in the light he called as he mounted and then he followed his lord and they rode away into the darkness and just like that the enemy left us with our dead the enemy let me tell you friends i never hated artaphernes not when he was ten times deadlier to me than he was that night he was a man hah it is fashionable to hate the medes now well many are better than any greek youll find and most of the men who tell you what they did at plataea or mycale are full of shit persians are men who never lie who are loyal to their friends and love their wives and children aristagoras now i hated him we walked down to the river together we had no choice because heraclitus and i had to carry archi who was unconscious so deeply gone that i had begun to fear that the teacher had hit him too hard we only carried him a stade but it gave me a taste of what the slaves had endured all evening when we got to the waters edge i realized that i had no plan past that point as i stood there my hand in the small of my back like an old man panting from the exertion i wondered where herk could be and what i would do if he didnt come heraclitus sat in the grass catching his breath he was not young and he had stood his ground in the phalanx or the mob to be honest and then helped carry the bodies now he was done too tired to move or even be wise i left them in the false dawn cold and desperate and walked the riverbank a stade to the south and then back again herk appeared just as the first streak of orange came to the sky every persian must have seen his ship in the river but no man stirred to challenge the triakonter i got my party aboard and fell heavily on to the helmsmans bench herk was full of apologies my ship wouldnt go far enough upriver we had to row to ephesus and take this pig of a vessel from the docks he said who are they i shook my head men of ephesus i said we took them downstream i slept fitfully and then the sun was scorching my face and i felt as if i had drunk wine all night we took the boat to the beach below the city where some jabbering fool insisted that we had stolen his ship until he saw the philosopher and then he was silent that man aside it was a silent city the army was sprawled in exhaustion just upstream a few panicked fools had made it home however and the city held its breath waiting to find out how bad it might be we brought hipponax home and his son i hired a pair of public slaves to carry archi and as we climbed up the town my sense that this was an evil dream was heightened by the routine around me men were rising to transact business and slaves waited by the wells and fountains to fetch water at every little square women came and asked us for news of their husbands and i protested that i had served with the athenians and heraclitus didnt speak i think he knew or had an idea and even his courage was insufficient to meet the needs of telling a hundred wives that they were widows we didnt go quickly the sun was high by the time we made the upper town and the steps to the temple of artemis gleamed white like a stairway to olympus i began to think that heraclitus would take me aside awaken archi and we would go and have lessons and when i came back down the white steps i would be a happy man and hipponax would meet me in the courtyard and ask me to fetch him a cup of wine time plays tricks like that heraclitus used to speak to us often of how with age a wise man begins to doubt the reality of what we imagine is time it seems so possible that hipponax dead is in the same place as hipponax alive and laughing heraclitus used to tell us that time is a river and that every time you dip your toe the water it meets with is different but that all the water that ever flowed over your toe is still there all around you and then we came home euthalia met us in the courtyard and she knew who was wrapped in the himation she took charge of his body and her face was set and hard archi had been conscious for half an hour by then but every time he raised his head he retched i offered him water but he turned his head away from me doubt the gods if you like thugater but never doubt the furies i had sworn to protect archi and to protect hipponax but it was my knife that took his life and that polluted me and they took my friendship almost my brother as their price fair theres no such thing honey nothing is fair penelope came and she and dion took archi away i stood in the courtyard waiting for briseis she didnt come after a while i left with heraclitus he offered to take me to his home but i shrugged him off and went down the hill to where aristides was camped and i rejoined the athenians the next morning i went back to the house and darkar met me in the portico you are not welcome here he said go away how is archi i asked he will live you killed master my curse on you darkar slammed the gate on me the following day as the persian army came down the river and prepared a siege i tried the house from the back the slave gate and i found kylix he embraced me i told darkar he said i told him you did what you did from love not hate he kissed me will you take a message to briseis i asked him he had always worshipped me he shook his head shes gone he said she is to marry the milesian lord aristagoras she has gone to his brothers house she will come back for the funeral i said kylix shook his head i doubt it the things she said to her mother aphrodite they hate each other i had scribed some words on a piece of bronze give this to her if she comes kylix nodded and i gave him a coin worship is one thing service another i walked back down the hill that was the day that eualcidas had his funeral games we were a beaten army but he was a great hero a man who had triumphed at olympia and stood firm on fifty battlefields i felt sick and low and i won only the race in armour there was no hoplomachia no fighting in armour stephanos won the wrestling and epaphroditos won overall and carried away the prize a magnificent feathered helmet then we all drank until we couldnt stand and we set fire to his corpse and the two slaves were formally freed epaphroditos stood by the fire with his arm around idomeneus and tears streaming down his face may i end as he did he said stephanos shook his head ill take home and hearth lord i thought of the battlefield he went fast and in the fullness of his strength i said i nodded i was drunk herk laughed and held out his hand for the wine dont camp on the wineskin lad when its your turn and youre one of them i know that look youll think your time was too short me im with the chian boy home and bed and all my relatives gathered around arguing over the pile of silver im leaving cleon looked at the fire i just want to get home he said i stood there and loved all of them but the one i wanted with me was archi and that door was still locked every man in the army knew me now but i was not a captain or even an officer so when they had their great conference i did not go aristides went to speak for athens and he took heraklides and agios and another fileleader too many of the other leading men were wounded or dead they came back so filled with anger that it showed as they walked towards us on the road aristides ordered the ships loaded then he summoned me were leaving he said you served with me and you served well but you are not one of mine yet i dont think i can leave you here aristagoras knows your name what have you done that he hates you so much i shook my head it is a private matter i said had sex with his bride but how would the fool ever learn that why are we leaving lord i asked aristides raised an eyebrow even in democratic athens men like aristides are not used to being questioned by peasants from plataea apparently we abandoned the men of miletus on the battlefield he said ares i said aristagoras is one of those men who not only lie to others but to themselves he said and shrugged i am not sorry to leave will you go to athens i took a deep breath i think ill go home lord to plataea unless you would take me in service as a hoplite aristides laughed you are a foreigner listen lad here you see me as a warlord with a retinue but once i go home and lay my shield on the altar im done im just another farmer i dont keep warriors were not cretans were athenians herk spoke up for me we could find him work lord he said aristides shook his head hes a killer not a worker no offence lad i would have you at my back in any fight but i dont see you as a farm worker i nodded its true i had to laugh i could find a bronzesmith finish my training aristides looked interested but agios shook his head you said that you knew miltiades i nodded heraklides narrowed his eyes i could take him i have half a cargo for byzantium and i can get copper at cyprus or crete aristides shook his head herk youll make a profit off your own death they both looked at me and i was warmed by how much they both sought to do right by me lord i think that it is time that i went home i will not go to miltiades i said i will write you a letter aristides said come with me anyway herk said ill end up in piraeus soon enough if poseidon sends a good voyage youll make a few coins with me and be the richer for it this winter at home i was still afraid of going home theres no easier way to put it a few weeks with herk seemed delightful a respite yes i said but i have sworn an oath and i must see to getting my release well be off with the evening breeze herk said if you have goodbyes say them i ran up the hill i ran all the way to the gate and then i knocked and darkar opened it and i pushed past him into the house until i found archi he had a bandage around his head get out of my house he said i had had time to think and i spoke words i had considered i am leaving i said aristagoras has cast the athenians out of the army the fool ill go with them go he spat but i swore to support you i said and you need to get your family into ships support me the way you supported my father and my sister you are the fucking curse of this family he rose to his feet and then sank back still woozy from his blow to the head you have to get out of here i shouted at him pack the slaves and go when artaphernes takes the city i dont need any words from you he screamed have you freed penelope yet i said and he froze free her you owe her by ares archi get your head out of your arse i stood over him darkar came back with two big slaves i looked at them touched my sword and they backed away go archi said diomedes has not given up on revenge i said i didnt know it it came to me from the gods your father is gone and briseiss idiot husband intends to hold the city against artaphernes scuttle off cockroach he said we will hold the city i took a breath and let it out i would stay if you wanted i said all my plans for careful speaking were gone and i could only beg so you can kill me he said or would you rather fuck me whichever way you choose to wreck me did you hate us so much did we treat you so badly by zeus you must have lain awake plotting how to bring us down did you bring artaphernes into the house too spittle was coming from his mouth the next time i see you i will kill you i shook my head i will not fight you i said the better for me then he said grimly but your oath didnt protect my father and it will not protect me run far plataean so much for friendship at the door kylix pressed a slip of papyrus a single leaf into my hand written in her hand it said only stay away so much for love when we sailed the men of chios and miletus gathered on the beach to mock us as cowards there is no fairness honey i thought that i was sailing away towards home i hoped i was but when we sailed out of doomed ephesus i was leaving home and i wept part iv scattering the leaves the wind scatters the leaves on the ground but the live timber burgeons with leaves again in the season of spring returning so one generation will grow while another dies homer iliad i never saw byzantium that trip the storm hit us four days out of cyprus with a hull full of copper we ran before it because we were crossing the deep blue between cyprus and crete and we had nowhere to land and we didnt dare show the low sides of our trireme to the wind it hadnt been a good trip wed had weather out of ephesus weather all the way to cyprus weather while we collected copper and weather while we rowed all rowing no sailing to crete men looked at me i was the foreigner and the gods of the sea were angry well they might i was an oathbreaker fleeing from my oath to hipponax and the sea had no love for me i took turns with herk at the steering oars wed been trained well archi and i when we made the runs up to the euxine and across the winedark sea to italy i could handle a ship even a long killer like herks light trireme i marvelled at the athenian build style they really were pirates the hulls were thin as papyrus and the ship itself was narrower and lighter and the rowers were packed even closer than rowers in ephesian ships free men every one with a sword and a couple of javelins the richer men with a spolas or a thorax south and east of crete the weather seemed to abate and we made a good landfall and the first night that we slept on a beach every man kissed the sand i speak no blasphemy when i say that the furies must have had a lot of lawbreaking and oathbreaking to pursue perhaps some other bastard took up their attention cretans arent like other greeks the men of crete are warworshippers and they have aristocrats and serfs most of the farmers are not free men at all but something like slaves only the aristocrats fight and some of them still use chariots i didnt think much of their primitive agriculture it is a curse of youth that you cannot keep your mouth shut and so on our third night in the great hall of the local lord sarpedon of aenis i found myself arguing with local men about how best to grow wheat and barley i used an unfortunate phrase in the heat of my anger at the fools intransigence we dont call them cretans for nothing and this fool called me out demanding blood you must be joking i asked id had some wine he slapped me like a woman coward he said woman idomeneus came and told me that i had to fight or be ashamed i laughed i wasnt ashamed and i had little interest in fighting but the lord glowered and the other men hooted at my apparent cowardice his name was goras and i killed him he was a good fighter but half drunk and no match for me the only danger was from the darkness and the drink i vowed never to fight under such conditions again his first blows were wild and thus dangerous but i set my feet and put my spear into his throat and down he went and the hall fell silent herk shook his head he gathered me with his other men paid an indemnity and took us away in the morning we sailed heading west along the south coast of crete that cost me the whole value of my trading there he said to me in the morning cant you keep that sword in its sheath i wasnt surly in those days killing often brought me a black cloud i would sit alone and mope but i heard his words and they were just words we had good weather as we coasted crete and we sold our athenian olive oil and beautiful redfigured and blackfigured vases at enormous profit in the market of hierapytna and the mood of the crew improved but not for long herk took me aside after we were invited to the lords hall could you refrain from killing anyone until our business here is done he asked i nodded silent as the grave but of course i wasnt in truth theres little i could have done about it word of my fight up the coast had made it here and word of the ionian revolt was everywhere and men behaved like men like warriors as they had taken no part they had to belittle those who had as we had lost we were to be humbled i have watched this pattern play out too many times more wine here we were in the lords hall and herk had sent idomeneus to watch over me i was quiet listening and not talking striving to be the sort of man well the sort of man that eualcidas had been silent and cheerful grown men always tell you that this is the way of excellence but they neglect to tell you that it is easier to be silent and dignified and cheerful when you are forty and have won ten battles its like getting women much easier when you are too old to enjoy them hah im a foul old man too true i listened to them demean the ephesians and the athenians and i said nothing i said nothing when they laughed at aristides youth but i suspect my attempts at dignity werent much better than stubborn glowering i was easy meat finally an older man a leader came over to where i stood and he grinned i grinned back glad that someone at least was interested in being my friend i heard that you killed a man down the coast he said but i have to assume you stabbed him in the back i mean look at you no intestines no reply to the insults we heap on you or are you some sort of woman he laughed showing all his teeth i sputtered this is where heroes are supposed to make a good speech but i was taken by surprise and i failed blood rushed to my head and when idomeneus tried to hold my arm i punched him in the mouth then i turned you want to die i asked i dont remember what else i said just that he laughed and threw a punch a fast punch right through my defences and knocked me flat dislocated my jaw i lay there in a rage of pain and he laughed again this is their great killer he asked his friends when i got to my feet he didnt even take a stance he feinted and then i was on my back again and my right temple felt as if his knuckle had gone through it they all laughed all except the athenians they didnt laugh but they did nothing to help my friends the men id fought beside they werent all on herks ship and herk himself shifted uneasily but he stayed put not cowardice just being practical men of business i got to my feet slowly i wasnt thinking too well and i was filled suffused with the purest spirit of ares ares the hateful god i was glowing with hate i felt betrayed i was young my tormentor came forward again and i stumbled towards him and he laughed they all laughed thats what i remember best the laughter the rage and the hate were all through me and with them came a plan and i followed my plan i let him chase me around the hall i fell over benches i accepted the humiliation backing always backing running even oh yes i was the coward he thought me step by step and men roared with laughter to see my antics except herk he knew me and his eyes grew big and when i was close to him he yelled something at me pleading then my head cleared two heavy blows to the head do not leave you with much in a fight but if you are used to taking blows and i was you can get your own back if you stay alive and keep your blood pumping id run around the hall for five minutes by then and id taken blows to my abdomen but it was thick with muscle and to my thighs where the other tormentors rained their fists on me as i hopped past when my head was clear i jumped a bench and a kline in one bound and stood in the open space in the middle of all the men he came at me and he was still laughing he threw his punch and i caught his fist in the air and broke his arm the sound of his arm breaking was like a limb snapping from a good old olive tree then i broke his neck and they all stopped laughing i said nothing i watched them lie on their couches frozen in the act of fondling their boys now they had the rage and i was calm i watched the rage flow out of me and into them hed been someone they liked someone they fancied now he was meat they were warriors they had elaborate codes of honour and they did not rush me like a pack herk shook his head and all the athenians gathered together knives began to appear around the hall and swords i let my eyes rove over the cretans looking for a leader id like to say i was like a ravening wolf or a lion who had just killed a bull but i was shaken by the killing i had broken his arm had i always meant to break his neck too yes he attacked me i said to the room and insulted me how would you have me respond herk touched my shoulder and i flinched not from fear but because i was tense waiting for them to rush me come he said before they kill you they let us walk away i still wonder about it i didnt see fear in them only rage the same engulfing redness i had felt we were not welcome after that no mess the cretans live in messes of warriors like the spartans no mess would have us to dinner and no man would trade with us my fellow oarsmen looked at me with fear and i heard them whisper behind my naked back as we rowed the long ship west along the south coast of crete that was a black time we rowed along the coast and the next night we camped on a beach i tried to sleep by myself but instead i sat awake watching the stars then herk came and cleon the man who had held my back when we sacked sardis they shuffled and i shuffled hard to explain how men who can fight and kill in the phalanx cant tackle oh many things like talking to a friend whos doing wrong or getting a girl you really like to look at you so many ways to be a coward so we sat a while looking at the stars i cant keep you aboard herk said suddenly there it was wed all known what he had to say i had hoped for something different but i knew i knew from the heavy silence nor had i forgiven them for letting me down nor had they forgiven themselves so they held it against me see nothing is simple so i watched the stars a while longer but my rage mostly died with the man whose neck i broke so after a longer pause than anyone wanted i said i know i shrugged i think but i was bitter and young tomorrow we will come to gortyn herk said the richest kingdom on crete the king is always hiring mercenaries ill do my best for you i promise by hermes lord of trades but you my friend you are under a curse and it burns black over your head a sign for every man who can see and your curse kills the men they should love you you are a hero instead theyre afraid of you and so am i i cant risk taking you across the blue water to piraeus someone will put a knife in you and feed you to poseidon one storm thats all it would take theyd gut you i nodded i just want to go home i said suddenly herk looked away cleon put an arm around my shoulders ive never forgotten that cleon stood by me later i stood by him and if you keep listening youll hear but he said herk is right and you can get a ship to piraeus in the spring stay here a while make some money go to a priest find out what youve done purify yourself the arm tightened stop killing aye i think i wept herk was as good as his word too better gortyn sits in the mountains above the sea a strong place if not a beautiful one and it rests on the bones of an older castle and that rests on stones placed by giants and titans the past is all around you at gortyn so that when you stand in their temple of poseidon earthshaker you can look down through a hole in the floor at the stones placed by the gods a thousand lives of men ago or more the port town is called levin the lord of gortyn owns all the towns on that stretch of coast and nowhere have i been in a place where the divide between low and high was so deep as deep as the sea as high as the greywhite mountains that rise from them herk sold me in effect bragging about my fighting skills and my learning to the king and his leading warriors in the kings mess the king had a palace but he spent no time there instead he lived with nine other rich aristocrats in a fine marble building on the street that ended with the ancient temple of poseidon the building was newbuilt but in the fashion of an oldstyle megaron the ten men had their couches arrayed around the hearth and there were more slaves than you could shake a stick at i stood silently while herk talked me up hes a killer one of the aristocrats said he killed laenis down at hierapytna thats what we hear what happened you lad tell it yourself i shook my head men mocked me i said mocked my friends mocked the men i stood with in battle i became angry the kings name was achilles he was old enough that his hair was mostly grey all grey on his chest and back although he had muscles on his chest like a statue he nodded my son needs to learn from a killer but not if the killer cant control himself he got up let us hunt a boar tomorrow gentlemen they all nodded hunting is an excellent way to take a mans measure and they were going to take mine i remember that i slept badly not from worry but from shame or rather fear was i mad had the war god taken my wits tired and redeyed i walked out of the guest megaron as the sun rose found a spring on the hillside and washed for the first time in many days perhaps longer i prayed i prayed to heracles my ancestor and to athena because she was the enemy of ares and i wanted no more from ares then i walked down the hill to where forty or fifty men were gathered with spears naked on crete men always hunt naked the highest fashion is to have a perfect body and having put in the work to have one no one wanted to cover that work with cloth i got my spears and stood with them the king emerged from his mess with his officers and they shook hands with or embraced most of the men there and then the doghandlers came and we were off up the hillside past my spring the day went on and on the sun rising hotter and hotter on us the dogs flushed two pigs and both evaded us so that the men began to talk of nets but the king would have nothing to do with them i heard one voice shriller and angrier demanding nets and i could see the resemblance this was his son he had enough spots to be a fawn the third pig that the hounds eventually flushed for us was a little bigger than a dog and not very dangerous but she was smart enough to keep the dogs off her and fast enough to make us run to keep up and before long i was the only man still pacing the front coursers those men were all in top shape but id been at war and at an oar all summer and i was half their age i ran up the mountain and i began to catch the dogs it was so steep that i knew that if i stumbled id have to stop and climb but for the moment momentum and pride kept me going and i could see the pig i had no idea about the etiquette of cretan hunting and no desire to annoy the king in any case lord achilles had bandy legs and a broad chest and ran slowly but he was strong as an ox and had the open friendliness that only big men seem to have despite his ugly body men liked him he was a powerful lord and he was next behind me on the mountain the others were way behind us slow he might have been but he wasnt to be stopped and there i was lovesick and furyhounded sprinting along beside the lead hound wondering what artemis would have me do the pig lost her nerve when she saw a stand of oak we were well up the mountain and the ground was rough with stone the oaks were scrubby things nothing like the trees of cithaeron but i knew what she meant to do i put on a burst of speed and threw one of my heavy spears missing the pig but turning her away from the trees and back towards the hunters she lacked the experience of hunting to know what to do she turned and i stooped picked up a jagged rock and threw it just beyond her she turned again and the pack closed in on her achilles came up with his officers and their lovers and there were ten spears in the pig within a few heartbeats i got my spear wet in her blood out of habit in some circles a hunter who does not wet his spear is a coward or not a man different hunters have different habits old achilles he seemed old to me although he was ten years younger than i am today took me by the shoulder well done you are a man of courtesy like a warrior of the old times achilles eldest son i had pegged him correctly was introduced he was just a year or two younger than me a lout named nearchos all pimples and straggly black hair and youthful anger he glowered at me and then turned away affecting boredom my son is a rude fool nearchos this foreigner is a man he has killed in duels and in war look at him no need to run a little pig down and kill it when he could share the kill with the rest of us he doesnt need that little glory for himself see achilles squeezed my shoulder he needs a man to take him in hand and show him the path he winked at me nearchos looked at me from under his eyelashes and then blushed and turned his back more like a maiden at the well than was quite right as we walked back to the hall idomeneus took my spears they want you to be his well his lover his erastes to teach him the ways of the world idomeneus batted his eyelashes at me i rolled my eyes boys will be boys and what happens after a hunt is not for a maidens ears but ive never understood the peculiar mating of boys and men that some practise and even if i did appreciate such stuff nearchoss face would not have launched a single scow where helens launched a thousand ships on the other hand i was flattered to be treated as a hero in a foreign land back at the hall the pig grew in size with every retelling and my act of generosity was magnified to near legendary status herk took me aside they love you he said i thought they might will you stay do i have a choice i asked herk shrugged dont be a prick im doing my best for you and he was i shrugged nearchos was leaning against a pillar whittling a stick with a pretty knife and looking at me when he thought i couldnt see him i could live here for a season i shrugged again but sooner or later theyre going to know that my father was a bronzesmith not a noble herk tried to hide a smile as he saw how it was with nearchos and he turned his back on the boy lord achilles is as rich a man as miltiades and hes asked me twice if you might be interested in staying on as his boys war tutor and to fight in his war band of course the big athenian sighed its a soft life here but you already have a name whats waiting for you at home a farm farming is for fools stay here and be rich and when you leave here everyone will think of you as an aristocrat crete is the most aristocratic place in hellas what in tartarus does home have by comparison ill let them know who i am i said with a little too much youthful emphasis all right ill stay and cleons right see a priest my friend raised an eyebrow before the furies come for you i looked at nearchos then i looked back at herk you dont have to lie with him he said be unattainable but teach him you have a great deal to teach you have a brain lad remember that sophist you took us all to see heraclitus i asked thats it you have a formal education you can teach he pointed his chin at lord achilles who was laughing with his leading men ill negotiate your price if you like and i can set it high ten times what miltiades would pay for a spearman very well i said and the knucklebones were cast i was not going home both idomeneus and lekthes chose to stay with me as my men old herk wrote them into the contract like the wily athenian he was and so we all had bed and board and wages from lord achilles and they became my sworn men in the cretan way idomeneus was all for it he was a peasant from down the coast and he understood the system better than i in three weeks hed gone from bedwarmer to warrior he began to grow proud i had few friends on the ship as ive said but cleon was one we embraced and i promised to visit him in athens he laughed i live in a house smaller than a grainbyre he said but id love to see you by zeus and hermes and all the gods it is good to be going home and heres my hand and a prayer that i see you framed by my doors good man listen honey the poet talks about heroes but theres never enough about the cleons good men who love their wives and their children but still stand their place in the battle line he hated war but he did it then richer and lighter heraklides and cleon and their ship sailed away and left me and my little entourage with the lords of crete and cleons eagerness to be home rang in my ears in fact idomeneus the scared boy of the battlefield eualcidass catamite became my confidant and adviser he knew the local words he knew the laws and he understood the complex relations between lord and lord so much more complicated than life in boeotia or so it seemed to me then now i understand that every mans customs seem natural to him and alien to a foreigner when i discovered that idomeneus and lekthes were to fight in the line with me i bought them simple arms and armour good stuff from a local smith of godsent talent called hephaestion a fitting name for a smith they had simple leather corslets and good bronze helmets in the local style and it was my fancy to have us all carry boeotian shields to mark us as different you hardly ever see a boeotian any more take mine down thugater try that on your arm young man you see the porpax runs the opposite way from what you might expect eh long and narrow and the cutouts in the side are not for putting your spear through older men on crete told me that those holes are for wearing the shield on your back in chariot combat the holes make it easier on your back and elbows or so im told i think its just because thats the way a bulls hide cuts those old cretan noblemen never made a shield and ive made quite a few but you can see that it is lighter than an aspis not as safe thinner and a man with a boeotian shield has to be aggressive in his blocks no messing around you can stand behind an aspis and take blows but with a boeotian you have to get that forward edge out and in your opponents face anyway that was my whim i was flattered by the attention of all these cretan aristocrats and the word of my killing the warrior goras on the east coast had come to gortyn i trained the two of them and nearchos together nearchos had already received years of training or what the cretans called training meaning that he was in top shape and could recite the iliad so we ran and we hunted and i began by teaching them the pyrrhiche the boeotian war dance in armour that shows a man how to move his body flex his hips thrust low and high and drills a group of men to move in unison i drafted an old flute player from the hall and in two weeks they were able to do the dance men came and watched and laughed lord achilles watched one afternoon nearchos was surly because he hated performing in front of people i knew him a little by then and liked him a little better there was a noble young man buried beneath the angst and the boyhood and the burning desire when we had completed the dance ten times and all three of my students were stumbling with fatigue lord achilles got up and nodded you give them grace but how is it different from our dances i had seen their dances in gortyn when the ephebes dance they dance with weapons and armour but it is all show postures meant to show a mans muscles to stretch him and prove the soundness of his legs on crete they use the dances to pick the fittest by which they mean the most beautiful its the same dance in plataea and yet utterly different we dance for war and our dance has all the feints all the attacks all the shield parries and the first figure is the hardest where men learn to rotate from one rank to another on crete they never rotate ranks the frontrank dancers are the most beautiful i dont know what they do when they get tired in combat if we are all trained the same way i said we will all move together in combat i shrugged i think and he needs something different this is different then i remembered something that calchas had said and men are scared in combat i added if they learn to block and thrust by rote over and over then they can do it even when terror and panic pull at their guts old achilles had been in a fight or two he nodded how many fights have you seen he asked i thought for a minute four field battles ten duels that was an exaggeration but not by much a skirmish or two i added with modesty that was in fact the exact truth and some beatings and a murder i thought i was just eighteen and id seen more violence than any of the men in the lords hall after that day there was less laughter when we danced and other men came and asked to join in they came selfconsciously with servants carrying their armour i accepted them all and i moved the dancing to the broad field with a rose garden behind it the scent of roses coloured everything that summer for me we danced and then i put a heavy paling in the ground with the help of some slaves and i taught my students to use their swords and spears on the paling cutting at it lunging at it developing the fine control of the weapon that allows you to put your spear into a mans throat or between his eyes to feel how much thrust it takes to kill and how much is too little winter came and we trained in the hall we ran in a pack across the hills and we hunted deer news came that ephesus had fallen according to a cyprian merchant when the persian siege mound was even with the walls aristagoras filled his ships and sailed away leaving the ephesians to their fate and the ephesians had surrendered on terms i cried i should have been there i was wasting my life in a backwater far from the woman i loved it was a good life but dull and i was beginning to get tired of avoiding nearchos i wasnt home i wasnt with briseis and i wasnt anyone the next spring when the plants were in bud and all women were becoming equally attractive to me i was saved by heraklides who arrived with a cargo and told me that aristagoras was raising men and ships throughout ionia to liberate cyprus and his wife i asked medea come to life herk rolled his eyes he is a fool to marry a girl so young and so intelligent if only she was the strategos he laughed and i went back to dreaming of my lost love in the autumn as the wheat was coming in aristagoras came to crete he came with five ships and he toured the lords asking for support and receiving it cyprus was rich and the cretans longed to have a piece of cyprus they had not been to war for many years and every young man clamoured to go the wheat was in jars by the time aristagoras made his way to us at gortyn he lorded it over us wearing a purple cloak and flaunting his wealth and they followed him as men will follow a siren i avoided him at first a difficult trick in the close confines of a hall but soon enough i saw that he didnt know me from any other cretan and then i listened to his words and attended his dinners he was a hollow man his vanity unchanged by failure at sardis and ephesus and i listened with the blood pounding at my temples as he described how the athenians had broken and run in the great battle near ephesus leaving the ionians to struggle on alone men in the hall looked at me i wanted no part of this man but my own reputation would suffer if i allowed him to denigrate the athenians finally i stood up you lie i said silence fell over the hall and aristagoras turned his face composed and regal i lie he asked in the voice of a councillor or an advocate in the courts you lie i said i was at sardis when the milesians hung back and stayed out of the town i fought in the agora with the persians and then i stood my ground at ephesus when we stopped the carians cold and sent them back to their sisters the centre broke first i know because when i looked out over the battle the centre was already gone and i was still standing my ground aristagoras looked around who is this man that he is allowed to speak in your hall he asked achilles he is my sons war tutor lord achilles said he crossed his arms he is young and full of fire but he has the right to speak here aristagoras shrugged i say that the athenians were the first to break i smiled i say you lie and there are other men here who were at the battle aristagoras perhaps you should watch your words cretans are not as ignorant as you seem to think but aristagoras was not to be tripped up by a man as young as i instead he smiled at me rose from his couch and crossed the hall young man you know how it is in battle neither you nor i could see anything beyond the eyeslits of our helmets men tell me that the athenians were the first to flee myself i was fighting i was old enough to know that loud assertions would only lose me the argument but my temper was up i was in the front rank i said and i was done fighting when the carians ran when i had killed three of them my spear in their necks i looked around the hall any man who says that the athenians or the eretrians were the first to run lies and can meet my sword that was the cretan way as i had discovered my first night on crete against goras aristagoras took my hand we should be friends our argument causes the persians to laugh at us his words were sweet but his eyes were full of hate i had interrupted his performance what a petty tyrant he was even now my hate for him makes my hands shake hows briseis i asked it must have been in my voice he froze his hand clasped in mine his other hand on my elbow and both of his hands tightened oh shes a bad girl i thought my smile must have been too knowing no man speaks of my wife in public he hissed men around us looked at him curiously his mask of benevolence was slipping really i asked let go of my arm my lord before i kill you there it was said right out in public he didnt know me from before the fool my hand was on my fighting knife we didnt wear swords in the hall but hung them on pegs as the poet says oh the hate in his eyes you you were aristides buttboy he said in a gentle voice as the recognition dawned and then his expression changed as he felt the prick of my dagger against the inside of his thigh hidden from the other men in the hall send my regards to briseis i said in one push of the dagger i could make her a widow and then shed marry another nobleman that was the way of the world lass aristagoras looked at me in disbelief he was a coward in his soul for all his posturing and i could see the collapse in his eyes he let go of my elbow and stepped back i bowed slightly and dropped my blade on the couch behind me so other men would not see what had passed and aristagoras backed away quickly but achilles liked him or liked his ideas or was simply too greedy to see the foolishness of what was proposed and he promised three ships for the campaign against cyprus to be launched the next autumn aristagoras sailed away then the war preparations started in earnest men flocked to my teaching and soon i was teaching my way of war in the agora and i found that i was saying calchass words and heraclituss words together as if they were one philosophy and perhaps they are at that we danced and we cut and thrust at billets of wood and at each other the need for men armoured men drove hephaestion the smith to distraction and i began to spend more time with him i was no smith but i could make sheet out of an ingot and none of his apprentices could in the agora or at his shop i spent a lot of time in the town and the town was full of dangers the dangers all had to do with sex will i shock you thugater i wanted someone to share my bed and nearchos wanted to share my bed but the two were in opposition we were a balanced duality as the pythagoreans say if i had taken a slave girl nearchos would have pouted for weeks indeed his father might have disowned me nearchos and his father had assumed that i would take nearchos as a lover when he reached some level of heroic achievement that existed in their imaginations in fact i was coming to like the boy and by my second spring with them he was my equal in most things i had no idea whether he would stand in the battle line but he was fast and strong and he could use his spear point to chip out his name in a billet of wood a neat trick a year and more i had lived like a pythagorean taking no lovers to be honest for a long time i had no interest at least in part because i wanted no woman but briseis by the second spring in crete however my body was becoming too much for me the spring dances were all around me the older men took younger men hunting and i was alone i went to the smithy to hide from my lust and hammered bronze into sheet with hephaestion who enjoyed my company but was not inclined to empty flattery far from it he was the teacher i never had at metalforming critical and derisive when i deserved it full of praise when i did well his only son was long dead fallen in one of their local cattleraid wars serving his lord hephaestion taught me many things about forming bronze and yet he was not the smith my father was that is one of the mysteries of learning and teaching i suppose ill take this moment while this pretty girl serves me wine to say that good times like the time i spent with hephaestion are never as memorable as bad times it is odd and sad that i cannot make a story out of hephaestion because in a way i loved him the best of all the men i knew on crete he was gentle strong kind garrulous and grumpy he might strike a slave in anger but he apologized later and he was never above learning from me either when i could remember my fathers techniques for instance i would have gone mad without him the other warriors thought it odd that i played with bronze but they feared me so there was no talk that i heard and they needed armour swinging the hammers made me stronger too and kept me from trouble i practised arms until i was exhausted and then i swung a hammer until i was exhausted all over again that was life and then as i said the second spring came and all my careful reserves began to melt away as the sap rose in the trees and the first flowers bloomed persephone was returning to the earth i wanted a girl all girls were beginning to look equally beautiful to me young or old fat or thin and yet i knew that to tumble a slave in the lords hall would have instant consequences women know things too well might you toss your head you hussy im sure that women know what men want as soon as their hips get broad all the women in the hall knew me for what i was a man who liked women and that fascinated them because their men made a fashion of disdaining women at every turn the lord had three daughters and all of them made nearchos look handsome but they all tossed their heads at me just like that blush as much as you like young gentlewoman i love your blushes my thugater should bring you every day but there were other girls down by the beach there was a town not big enough to be a city even such a city as plataea but gortyn had two or three thousand free people and a substantial number of pretty girls hephaestions shop was at the top of the town in the nomansland between the lords hall and the merchants i would work at his forge and girls would come to watch me stripped to my waist the famous warrior getting his hands dirty it was the day before the thesmophoria which has a different name in crete all the girls were getting ready on crete it is a womans holiday and all the unmarried girls dress like priestesses in their best linen chitons so that when the sun is behind them no man need doubt a line of their bodies they put sashes around their waists and flowers in their hair and the girls who came to the forge were waiting for disc brooches that the smith and i had spent the morning making now we were polishing with the slaves just to get the job done one girl was bolder than the others fifteen and pretty with the flush of maidenhood and spring and she brushed her fingers against mine when i gave her a brooch next to briseis she was probably as plain as a daisy next to a rose but she had a slim waist and high breasts and i wanted to have her on the dusty floor of the forge our eyes spent a great deal of time together hephaestion laughed when she was gone troass daughter and no better than she ought to be theyre fisherfolk you want her i blushed i do blush lass and hung my head hephaestion laughed are you hagridden boy i shrugged up in the hall i was a young lord a warrior down in the forge i was a boy and i acted like one does nearchos know hephaestion asked no i said and then i dont lie with nearchos hephaestion reacted as if id slapped him you dont he asked he must be bitter i shook my head he thinks he is unworthy i shrugged hephaestion laughed you are a failure as a cretan he said but youre a good smith and you serve hephaestus like a dutiful son we polished for a while our rags full of powdered pumice and oil the slaves and apprentices were silent terrified to have their master working such menial duties i think perhaps while we make the helmets you should stay here at the forge hephaestion said you pais go and get me wine and wine for lord arimnestos he only called me lord to mock me while we drank watered wine wonderful stuff the wine of crete red as the blood of a bull he nodded at me you sleep here until the chalkeia well dedicate all the helmets as our sacrifice as our sacrifice of labour and then you can go back to the hall lord achilles will understand why i need you weve never had a chalkeia here thugater we should im a sworn devotee of the smith god and i can say the prayers why have we never had one in any case it is a smiths holiday and the smith has to dedicate work and pay the value of his labour as a tithe and the smith god judges the quality of the work in athens even in little plataea theres a procession of all the smiths iron and bronze and even the finer metals all together with images of the god and of dionysus bringing him back to olympia after zeus cast him out theres a lot of drinking we should institute it send for my secretary im not dead yet eh i had no idea why old hephaestion suddenly wanted me staying in his house the walk to the hall was only a matter of half a stade but he was my master as much as the lord was everything in that town was dedicated to preparing the lord and his men for the expedition to cyprus and we were two months from the date of launch women wove new sails of heavy linen from aegypt the tanner made leather armour as fast as he butchered oxen the two sandalmakers worked by lamplight and down by the slips twenty fishermen and their boys worked all day to build a third trireme in the phoenician style young men are all fools i sent lekthes up to the hall for my bedding and he came back with idomeneus they made me a bed where the smith directed not even in his house but in his summer work shed a pleasant enough building but only closed on three sides the two of them swept it clean and brought a big couch from the house and made it up idomeneus took a cup of wine with me lekthes had a girl up at the hall he was a warrior now not really a servant and he was considering marriage but idomeneuss tastes ran in other directions and he was in no hurry to leave the forge nearchos asked after you he said his eyes sparkled and he wore half a smile he burns for you master i shrugged im not your master idomeneus stretched out on a bench you call hephaestion master he said i shrugged he is a master smith you are a master warrior and you made me a free man idomeneus nodded i have a way out of your tangle lord i ran my fingers through my beard tangle i asked he laughed youve run off down here to avoid nearchos and lord he thinks you must know that when the ships sail you and he will be lovers why shouldnt he think this even his father says it i shook my head cretans what can i say and all of you tittering laugh all you like this was my youth so i have found a thread that you can follow out of our labyrinth he poured more wine straight from the amphora am i theseus or the minotaur i laughed and who does that make you we both laughed together i am prettier than any of nearchoss sisters he said and we both guffawed until hephaestion came and put his head under the eaves is this the dionysia he asked by the smith god i didnt expect a symposium your first night under my roof but seeing my wine he sat poured himself a cup unmixed and leaned in tell me the joke idomeneus was fond of the smith more than fond i think i am solving my lords dilemma he said hephaestion winked bed the boy yourself and pretend to be arimnestos he said idomeneus blushed then we started listing things that nearchos might notice and we drank a great deal more and hephaestion went to bed drunk i never heard your idea i said idomeneus was drunk and he put his arms around me i love you he said yes i said go to bed ish is that an invitation he asked with heavy innuendo and then he grinned lisshen master tell the boy that hesh a warrior now too noble to be your lover tell him you free him to have a lover of his own idomeneus burped which rather spoiled his performance hmm i said or something equally useless i was drunk myself but the next morning pounding metal with a heavy head not something i recommend to any of you the idea seemed better and better i drank water and worked trying to sweat the wine out of my head which was for the best because in early afternoon a long line of dancing women came up the hill from the town heading for the mountain troass daughter was at the head of one of the files of dancers and she led her laughing girls in a full rehearsal around the yard of the smithy i had a pair of roses that idomeneus had plucked at my direction from the garden behind the hall and id woven them with bronze wire so that they would sit with the laurel in her hair hephaestion had a mirror and i showed her what she looked like in the golden light of the bronze surface oooh she said patting the flowers gently i wish i was prettier though you are beautiful gaiana i said or words to that effect she laughed i kissed her and she did not kiss like a virgin she laughed into my mouth like briseis and then i knew why the smith had given me the shed i grabbed her hand but she pulled away and straightened her chiton she grinned too fast for me lord she said i had a horn comb and i combed her hair a little she leaned back against me and we kissed again then she stood up no one expects the girls down from the mountain until dawn she said outside the shop the other girls were calling for her i will be in the shed i said and ran a finger around one of her nipples and she smacked me playfully but hard dont go to sleep she said before darting out of my arms and out of the door and i didnt nor did gaiana thats another happy time in my memory she came to me every night and i worked all day in the smithy her father came on the third day and hephaestion introduced me hes smitten with your daughter hephaestion said you dont look like the kind of man who marries a fishermans daughter troas said he had a scraggly beard and the hands of a man who dragged nets all day with enormous shoulders marries i asked and i suspect thugater that my voice cracked troas laughed if i tell the priests you took her maidenhead youll owe me her bride price i felt foolish we were bartering before you think ill of the man remember that the lords of the town might take his daughter for nothing and he would have the care of any resulting children thats crete democracy has a great deal to recommend it honey mind you daughters were usually safe from lords on crete hah what is her bride price i asked in truth he scared me more than a persian battle line ten silver owls he said i almost laughed my relief hephaestion interrupted me ten for a girl who has lain with any man who will have her he spat troas flushed i think he was hurt i thought we were friends hephaestion glared at him when you come to buy a bronze knife what do you tell me that it is a beautiful item that the blade is as sharp as obsidian that it feels perfect in your hand no you tell me that it is too small dull ugly anything to lower the price why is your daughter different from my knife i served them both wine and hephaestion pretending to be my father arranged the bride price at six owls it was odd but i knew i would be sailing away with the fleet and i knew in my heart that i wouldnt come back so out of something it was hardly love i said that i would marry her troas looked as if he had been axed no lord he said well there you go he had a soninlaw lined up not some useless swordswinger who would vanish in the summer but a strong young man with a broad back for hauling nets beware when you think too much of yourself i realized in an ugly moment that troas didnt think much of me he wanted six silver owls so that his daughter and her boy could have a good start his own boat probably i was born a peasant lass never let yourself believe that peasants have a simpler life i went up to the hall still wearing my leather apron i opened the cedar box where i kept my goods my embroidered cloak my good linen chiton the gold and lapis necklace from sardis and my pay i took twelve silver owls from the hoard a little under a third of my coins and turned away to find nearchos gazing at me from the other side of the hall i smiled at him i couldnt help it he came across to me dressed in a scarlet chiton with matching sandals his pimples were gone and his chest had filled out and his hair was long and oiled you are an odd man arimnestos he said and we embraced walk with me i said he looked around and his face was red i sighed and prayed to aphrodite i caught the eye of idomeneus and he winked so we walked out into the garden and then up the mountain and the gossip of the older warriors followed us like a living thing im not taking you for an afternoon of love i said as soon as we were out of earshot of the other men he flushed i didnt expect as much he said but he had hoped it i want you to look at yourself i said like many a teacher and father before me i dare say but he looked away expecting censure do you listen to me when i tell you what heraclitus said do you understand anything of the logos and of change i asked he shrugged the angry young man id met more than a year before i am not a cretan lord nearchos i am a peasant from boeotia and i have made my name with my spear i took his shoulders and he looked at me then because this was not the speech he expected you are a lords son i said and now you are a man not a boy you are waiting all of you are waiting for me to take you as a lover i shrugged that would be wrong i admire you but you are a man now a man chooses his own lovers he stood suddenly but i want you suddenly i realized that this boy deserved the truth and not some story some manipulation from idomeneus he was an honourable boy with his whole life before him i am not available i said primly there the truth i am not worthy yet he said dont be foolish i said customs are different i am from plataea in plataea we frown on relations between men well not exactly but close enough that made him smile my sisters said the same to me he said smiling because it was so silly to him i am taking a girl in the town as a lover i said i will not bring her to the hall i do not seek to embarrass you and if you require it i will leave he shook his head a girl he asked you are the oddest man you spend your spare time pounding bronze and reading scrolls and now you make love to women it is unmanly he spat the last word i will leave then i said there id told the truth i felt better for it idomeneuss way might have worked but the deception would have required too much effort and i think that heraclitus would not have approved he took my hand no he said no i am being stupid i love you i embraced him we will fight side by side i said better than sex now go and take a lover and be kind to him or her a girl he asked he laughed we might set a fashion i was with a girl once theyre soft he laughed again you can get used to it i said on the way down the hill i considered that idomeneus and nearchos both loved me and said so while neither penelope nor briseis nor gaiana ever said they loved me perhaps it is because none of my three women ever stood with me in the battle line hah that would be a phalanx and not a coward among them at any rate after that day nearchos and i were friends and a little more i lived in the smiths shed until the festival and afterwards too we made fine helmets and good armour that turned persian arrows and kept men alive at the chalkeia i made myself known to the priest with signs and was raised from the first to the second degree because my sacrifices were found worthy i was happy too bad it doesnt take long to tell i am honest too honest and look at her blush when i say gaiana and i made love every night every night ten times if we wanted oh youth is wasted on the young honey but you might ask what of home didnt i want to go home didnt i want to avenge my father live on my farm or kill aristagoras and take briseis for my own see you do want to know well children this isnt the iliad if i had a fate i didnt know it and when you are eighteen or perhaps nineteen and men treat you like a hero when your hands make beautiful things when every night has a soft mouth and your couch is warm with love no one who is that happy gives a crap about fate or furies i was happy i didnt give my father my farm or briseis any more than a passing thought and of the three briseis would have won out for two months i was happy two months of making love while the rain fell on the roof of the shed and making beautiful things all day with the power of my arms and shoulders dancing the military dances drilling with weapons wearing armour a week before we were due to sail lord achilles paraded us in the agora and we made a fine sight there were men lacking swords and men lacking greaves but every man had a thorax of bronze or leather a good helmet spears and a knife every man even the rowers six hundred men sixty of us the lords retainers and relatives had full panoply on land we would be the front rank and at sea we would fight as marines nearchos had the new ship of course he was the lords son and i of course was to be his helmsman we celebrated with a night of drinking and we poured wine over the ram of the new ship and i called her thetis then we spent a week practising at sea our fisherfolk could row and our officers were decent enough but i needed that week and more i was not really a helmsman and i made mistakes every day getting the thetis off the beach and back on sternfirst but i was smart enough to go for help and i found it with troas who was rowing in our upper bank and wearing one of my helmets i brought him aft as assistant helmsman he had his own fishing boat and he knew the sea far far better than i never be too proud to get help honey bee and he did help after all id paid him double his price and id given gaiana good gifts id made her a mirror and id made her two pairs of bronze oarpins guessing that her eventual husband would want them the last day was hard for nearchos and the other local men me i was anxious to get away i could feel the draw of the world it was as if i had been asleep and now i was waking up again gaiana came to me one last time at the shed i had presents laid out for her on the bed a length of good aegyptian linen and a necklace of silver with black beads she cried a little im pregnant she said i smiled because i was a man of the world and i had expected this how do you know i asked she smiled no wild talk girls know she said i could just be late she admitted best marry your fisherboy then i said she looked confused dont you have a boy to marry i asked how do you know she blurted out and then she met my eyes i like him defiantly and then hesitantly i like you too i wont be coming back i said more harshly than i meant i offered to marry you and your father turned me down he knows i wont come back i shrugged i was growing to like the purity of telling the truth sometimes it was very hard sometimes i still lied just to make things easier but simple truths seemed to make things well simple is your boy on my ship she shook her head he wants to go but pater wont let him pater troas sounded smarter and smarter i gave her my gifts and we made love it should have been gentle and tragic but it wasnt gaiana never had tragedy in her she laughed in my mouth and she laughed when our fingers last touched what shall i call your boy she asked if hes yours hipponax i said the battle of amathus was my first seafight we sailed and rowed the long way around crete because lord achilles who hadnt been to war in ten years was still a canny old bird and he had a head on his shoulders so we rowed away towards italy and the rowers cursed lord achilles knew what he was about we spent two weeks going around the island and by the time we put our bows to the deep blue east of crete our muscles were hard as rock and our rowing was excellent our helmsmen even me could handle our ships we could sprint and we could cruise and we could backwater i have said that nearchos commanded the thetis in fact i commanded it while teaching him to command while troas taught me to be a seaman laugh if you like lord achilles commanded the poseidon and his brother ajax a longlimbed nobleman i had only met twice commanded triton we didnt practise formations much although we did take turns rowing in the middle of a threeship line so that we could get used to the length of another ships oars we made the rendezvous off cyprus just a week late and found the council of ionia in full assembly on the beach of amathus i stayed at nearchoss shoulder we spent a week listening to aristagoras talk other men talked too the leader of the cyprian rebels was onesilus king of salamis thats salamis on cyprus honey your friend from halicarnassus knows it dont you lad technically onesilus had summoned all of us and he was the leader of the fight on cyprus he and his men were laying siege to amathus a cyprian city that had remained fiercely loyal to the great king while the rest of the island had thrown off the yoke a year earlier here boy fill this with wine i need to talk about the ionian rebellion and that is thirsty talk it was the curse of the gods on the ionians that they were doomed to listen to aristagoras and his promises from one end of ionia to the other the army of artaphernes and the navy of his phoenician allies the greatest seamen in the world defeated the ionians every time they stood to fight at byzantium and in the troad at ephesus in a dozen ship duels the ionians had been worsted every time and yet the rebellion spread it was against all sense and against all reason but despite artaphernes fairness and aristagorass arrogance and failure the rebellion grew with every defeat the carians who had stood against us at sardis and at ephesus were with us now cyprus was in revolt and all the greek cities of asia were in the ionian council as they called themselves aristagoras was their leader and strategos we needed a victory there really were no more cities to join in unless athens or sparta chose to join and neither seemed disposed to fight aristagoras argued that we needed just one victory to convince both athens and sparta to join us i doubted him i had seen aristides face when he boarded his ship and i suspected that nothing short of a persian fleet in the piraeus would get him to fight again alongside the ionians but i was a mere helmsman and no one asked my opinion i had a week to get to know that fleet and i counted two hundred and twelve ships on the beach there were ships from lesbos and ships from chios miletus and samos and even exiled ships from the cities already retaken such as archilogos of ephesus there he was ablaze in magnificent panoply of blue and gold looking like a god i felt the tug of our friendship and my oath but i stayed away from him i also heard that briseis was on lesbos and that she had borne no children to her husband i learned this from epaphroditos after many an embrace he had his own ship now and he and nearchos became friends in an hour it flattered my vanity that so many men remembered me we had games on the beach and i won the hoplitodromos although i didnt win any of the other events until the duels on the last day and that was too easy ionians dont really like to fight in the duels the cretans did though so i found myself exchanging cuts with the very men i had trained and nearchos and i fought in the last bout for the prize he thought that he knew me i gave him a nice scratch on his forearm as a reminder that he didnt we laughed about it afterwards and lord achilles came and took my hand you are too good a man to hold in crete he said you could have your own ship with any lord here indeed several men had offered me ships epaphroditos first among them yes lord i said i would keep you in my service until we face the medes he said i will stay lord i said after the battle i will go thank you you are a fine young man whatever your tastes and may i add another thing as long as you serve with my son you will keep him safe eh all young men seek to be achilles my son will be a king do not let him off the leash am i clear i nodded he looked around then looked back at me what have you done to aristagoras he asked i shrugged there are some things best left unspoken why he asked me if you were my man i said yes and he said that he would not have you killed until you left my service so watch your back he hates you its in his eyes when he speaks of you i frowned what had someone told him i thought of how briseis could be when angered oh yes my thoughts must have been on my face because he chuckled our fearless leader is hardly a man to fear achilles said but he strikes me as the womanish sort who would cut your throat in the dark or put poison in a cup when you leave me watch yourself we left a great deal unsaid he knew things and i knew things he was not altogether comfortable with the loyalty his warriors showed to me and he was not always happy with the man i had made of his son either but im a father now and i understand him better and he never used me ill heres to him i had a man in the host repaint my shield which was battered from a year of weapons drill he made the raven all but leap from the bulls hide an old boeotian he said you dont see many of those the three of us thats me idomeneus and lekthes we probably had half the boeotians in the whole army but i wanted reputation and i wanted men to know me the persians landed across the island as we expected and they marched towards us by slow careful stages their fleet the cream of the phoenician cities accompanied them and both travelled every day in battle order daring us to fight they approached us slowly and any day we might have met them if we chose a persian army and a phoenician fleet i could hear the gods laughing the cyprians were gentlemen and they offered the ionian allies a choice man our ships and face the phoenicians or form our phalanx and face the persians the persian commander was not a man i knew artybius he was called and he had a strong force of cavalry so did the cyprians and they had chariots as well which made me feel as if i was serving in the trojan war no one but cyprians and libyans use chariots any more and yet i had trained as a charioteer and they made me smile i had never seen a chariot used for anything but a parade or a wedding or local travel or for races and the cyprians were good they had over a hundred of them everyone seemed to be excited by the prospect of using chariots in combat even i thought it sounded marvellous which goes to show how little i knew of war aristagoras chose to take on the fleet i suspected that he made the choice so that it would be easier to cut and run but i was in the minority most of the rest still worshipped him and he wore his purple cloak at every meeting as if he was the king of kings after making the decision we had three days of rough weather and we put out every day struggled to form our lines and suffered from the wind and waves the phoenicians stayed on their beaches by their camp and jeered at us the great kings commander was cautious he fortified his camp and would not risk battle until his fleet was there to cover his flank the fourth day dawned like a proper summer day on cyprus the sort of golden pink dawn when you can imagine the cyprian goddess coming across the foam to your beach we rose cooked our breakfasts and sang a hymn to that goddess and to zeus and then to all the gods and finally we boarded our ships the sea was as calm as a sheet of hammered bronze and i knew that this time we would fight my hands shook my stomach did flips inside my scale thorax and i drank a little too much wine we formed up well though and that counts for a great deal in a seafight north and west of us on the beaches north of the city where the persians had their camp we could see them forming and their allies with them and the cyprians forming against them two great phalanxes and a taxis of cavalry on either flank with the chariots farthest from the sea we cretans were untried and our heavy phoenicianstyle ships were slower than the other ionians so they put us in the second line it was an insult if you like but the fleet was well ordered and there was a rumour that aristagoras was receiving advice from a samothracian navarch whoever he was i thought that he knew his business we cretans were on the landward flank the left of our line so far out from the centre that my ship was second from the beach and by the whim of the gods archis ship was in the first line just seaward and ahead of us i swore to myself that if i had a chance to make good my oath to his family i would do it nearchos was shaking with nerves i hugged him our breastplates rubbing together oddly relax o phile pai the fear falls from you with the first arrow he gave me a shaky smile and we began to row forward with our line as did the enemy until we could see the eyes painted on their bows as clearly as we could see our own rowers but then before we could come to grips i had cause to bless all the training achilles had done with us because the phoenicians tried the oldest trick in naval warfare they backed water they were professionals and we were amateurs and they assumed that if they backed far enough wed lose our order and theyd kill us in small groups and indeed our line did begin to break up after half a dozen stades keeping a line at sea is hard enough and every wave and current is against you we split our first line into three because there was a current off the rivermouth by the city and the rowers couldnt stay in the midst of it but the strong current from the river split the enemy too and they didnt break into three even groups as we did again the whim of the gods and no cleverness of man but their beachward division was the smallest and it seemed to be out of order caught in some indraught near the beach by their camp or so it appeared to me troas i called and he came to my side we were rowing lower bank only creeping across the great bay and saving our men for ramming i pointed at the chaos among the landward phoenicians and now that they were closer i could see that they werent phoenicians either they were greeks there were plenty of cities who served artaphernes of course tide rip troas said before he even reached the command deck not much but enough to pull them apart they should row faster theyd be fine stand by me i said i nodded at lekthes take his bench lekthes was used to this but the look he shot me was full of reproach hed had a year of feasting as a warrior in the great hall he had no desire to go back to rowing but he went ahead of me the samian ships to the seaward of archi suddenly dashed from the line they were twenty strong and they acted in concert they went from the slow cruise all the way to the fastest attack stroke so quickly that we were watching them pull away before we were sure what they were doing but the other ships in our part of the first line followed them nearchos looked at me blankly the samians are going for the enemy greeks i stood on the rail and bellowed to lord achilles he could see it as well as i could but in my youthful arrogance i assumed he wouldnt know any more than his son he nodded ahead of us the exiled ephesians and lemnians followed the samians lord achilles had his squire raise a banner of red cloth and wave it up tempo to fast cruise i said i ran to the midships fighting platform leaving my navarch with the steering oars we didnt need to stay up with the first line or so id been told but i was anxious to get forward and i wanted to go faster than lord achilles had ordered speed changes require orders and now i was amidships i couldnt see as well i got thetis to fast cruise and then ran to the bow the samians were just putting their beaks into the enemy you could hear the collisions clearly across the water i watched archis ship but he was cut off from the first impacts by the rush of samians and he and the other exiles were rowing diagonally across the beach going to seaward north and east across the current to try and find an opening somewhere in the enemy line some oily phoenician made a decision and the battle changed in the twinkling of their oars their centre broke up like an egg under a hammer and the bulk of the centre turned landward into the flank of the samians our very aggression would now count against us and our vulnerable flanks would be open to the rams of the heavy phoenician ships thats why you keep a second line of course i ran back down the centre plank between the upperdeck benches to the north and west our front left the phoenician centre was turning south and archis exiles were all that stood in their way the milesians and chians seemed paralysed just as they had been at every other battle we need to turn north i shouted across the strip of sea between our ships at lord achilles ignoring his son by my side either the lord didnt hear me or he chose to ignore me if we held our course wed enter the winning part of the combat close to the beach a position where even in the event of a disaster the cretans could beach their ships and escape lord achilles was thinking like a king i was thinking like a nineteenyearold with an oath to fulfil i turned to nearchos if those ships are crushed we lose the battle i said pointing to the north and the gods sent me an inspiration because ships were sprinting out of the centre to help the exiles lesbian ships epaphroditos is going too we have to support him nearchos rose to the moment go he said let my father follow me i was sure that i had been hired to prevent just this sort of incident troas take the oars i pushed him into the steering rig nearchos get forward with the marines and be ready to lead the boarders lord achilles would have a fit i knew but i wasnt sending the boy anywhere i wasnt going myself troas got between the steering oars and we were turning even as i ordered the last increase in speed all our decks were rowing now and the oar masters were thumping the deck with their canes so that the whole ship rang with the tempo we were turning out of the second line heading across the bows of other cretan lords it was exhilarating there is something to war at sea the speed of a ramming ship the brilliance of the sea the wind the oarsmen singing the paean i felt like a god come to earth my fear fell away our bow swept north and then we slipped into our new course as if it was carved like a trough in the sea and we were moving as fast as a galloping horse you have it i asked troas my notquitefatherinlaw was in effect commanding the ship never done this before he said but he laughed some men rise to their moment troas a man who could bargain for his daughters virtue was ready for his and we stooped on the phoenicians like a hawk on doves i saw the first engagements in the centre archi got his ship turned in plenty of time and up to full speed he had a light trireme and he turned like a cat passing between the first phoenicians he met one ship got his oars in but the other got oarraked the broken shafts of the oars ripping mens arms and the splinters flying like arrows men die when their oars are shattered it was a brilliant stroke but archi would have a professional helmsman as good as any phoenician indeed the man might be a phoenician he was through in five heartbeats right through their first line follow that ship i said to troas at all costs ram what you have to troas grinned the faster of the two phoenicians the one that hadnt lost his oars was now closing with us at a terrific rate a seafight is a scary thing friends it starts very slowly but once everyone decides to engage the speed is bewildering two ships at full stretch come together as fast as two galloping horses imagine it in your head we were ram to ram with this enemy our ships the same weight i paused and turned back to troas diekplous i asked ram to ram he shook his head at the last minute ill go left he said a little flick to port and were into his oars ill warn the rowers i said and ran to the command platform on my command all starboardside oars inboard i roared the oar masters all raised hands showing me theyd heard otherwise their attention was on the stroke one missed beat here and we were all drowned men over my shoulder the enemy trireme looked as big as a citadel and fast as a porpoise and i had no one to help me when exactly do you order your oars in how long exactly does it take ninety men to drag their oars inboard i stood on the balls of my feet i flicked a glance at the enemy and saw that there was a second ship just abaft him troas had seen it too and it was too damned late to change our minds ready to ram i screamed forward the marines and nearchos would be bracing against the bow the rowers would be praying troas was grinning like a madman i wanted to shit myself i glanced at the enemy so close it felt as if we should already have hit i could see the face of their marine captain and an arrow clanked against my helmet and flicked away good shooting starboard side i yelled wait for another stroke dont give the game away oars in i roared blowing my voice for a day in one great shout trying to use the strength of my lungs to get the oars in through the ports whamm we hit so hard that i fell and lost my helmet it fell between the benches and vanished below the starboardside rowers had their oars in but it didnt matter both ships had settled on the same tactics and jibed the same way so wed hit beak to beak the hand of the gods our beak a month out of the shop held theirs broke off their ship was filling with water and my mouth was full of blood ares only knew why starboard oars out i screeched my voice was gone but the pettyofficers got the message backwater nearchos he was still stunned from the impact but he came to me his great helmet with bronze wings was a little flattened and he had it buckled get that thing off and take command i said my voice is gone a sailor clambered up from inside the hull and handed me my helmet i got it on my head troas was on the ball and he got the bulk of the sinking phoenician between us and the next enemy by backing to starboard the second phoenician overshot and went past us i looked back and most of the right flanks second line was behind us coming up fast by poseidon thugater that was a fine moment wed sunk a phoenician in one pass call it luck if you like it was luck nike was with us and her handsomer sister tyche too and troas just by thinking fast and steering got us around the wreck our timbers creaking but our ship intact there was water coming in i cant imagine how hard those two ships must have hit but the sailors were bailing and we werent finished yet archis ship was gone into the maelstrom in the centre there were a dozen phoenicians coming our way i looked at nearchos pick one and lets get it i said my oath would have to wait we were in effect alone against the phoenician centre the trick to staying alive in a seafight is never to show the long side of your ship the oar banks to the enemy if you keep your bow to their bows there should be a limit to how much damage you can take despite what had just happened to the ship wed killed troas played safe and nearchos didnt interfere we bumped hulls with the second phoenician ship in line cathead to cathead and we damaged his oars a little but he got most of them inboard we lost two men one oar fouled in the port and the loose end killed the rower who should have had it in and knocked the man above him in the oar loft unconscious and just that small error left us vulnerable because when the rowers were ordered to put their oars back in the water on the next stroke the whole port bank faltered and we turned to port losing way and turning across the path of another enemy but the gods were with us and he passed us just a spears length astern and then we had our stroke back and we were alive but our rowers were tired i could feel it tension is its own fatigue thugater the more you are afraid the more tired you feel and the more tired you are the easier it is to feel fear i looked around because suddenly we were between the fights to the north archilogos and epaphroditos and their allies were engaged with the second line of the phoenician centre behind us the cretans were overwhelming the first line by weight of numbers and the samians had already polished off the enemy greeks even aristagoras could scent victory he released the centre and left and the milesians and the chians went forward in fact we had won the battle i knew it and more important the phoenician navarch knew it his right flank declined the engagement and began to row backwards again i never saw their signal but all at once enemy ships began to flee not the ships around archi though they were locked together with grapples and marines spear to spear i pointed to the fight in the centre nearchoss fears were gone he grinned now we make you a name i said not the words achilles paid me to say but we were young troas put us in well we actually rowed a little past the melee and turned south taking our first phoenician in the flank i was in the bow my helmet down over my eyes arms braced against the bulkhead when we hit and i could see the upperdeck oarsmen and their round mouths and terrified eyes as our damaged ram broke open their long side wed had a full stade to turn and race at our target the men had the heart for one more burst and we were a heavy ship the enemy keel snapped under our ram and the ship broke in half it was a spectacular kill and every ship in the centre of our line saw us do it thats how you make a reputation honey we probably also killed our own ship with that impact the bow seams probably gave way right there we were too wild with the daimon of combat to care our beak went home into another enemy lashed alongside the one wed broken like an old toy and we spent our remaining momentum scraping down his side and coming to a rest broadside to broadside oar bank to oar bank i leaped up on our ships side and nearchos was beside me idomeneus and lekthes at my back and the oar benches were emptying i balanced on the rail and waved down on to the phoenicians deck after you my lord i said he grinned and we all leaped that was a great day and a great hour the enemy already knew they were doomed and doomed men seldom fight well we cleared that first ship faster than it takes to tell it killing their sailors all their marines were elsewhere boarding the lesbian ships i cut the captain down by his helmsman and nearchos gutted the helmsman and then we went over the side and down into the next ship another trireme and now we were coming up behind the phoenician marines as they fought shield to shield against lesbians and chians and ephesian exiles behind me the cretans were clearing the phoenician decks tripping from bench to bench a cretan ship is a fearsome thing because every bench has another warrior we were worth five ships worth of marines my spears were gone and my good sword was in my hand i was standing on the rail of a lesbian ship there were twenty ships all locked together in a single mass of death and i balanced there for three heartbeats while i looked for archilogos then i saw him a flash of blue and gold still on his feet his right arm covered in blood and his aspis a flapping mass of splintered wood and collapsed bronze some men fight better when they are doomed and i blessed the gods that they had given me the moment to redeem my oath hah i killed like the scythe of hades i wont bore you with the tale oh you want me to bore you it was one of my finest days all the doubt left me i cared nothing for their wives and their children and their petty lives as fast as my arm moved they died if they turned i cut them down and if they didnt turn i put my sword into their throats and thighs i could have cleared a ship by myself but i had nearchos by my side and his blade was as fast as mine and lekthes spear flashed over my head from time to time when i was pressed and they died the four of us were the cutting edge of a living axe of cretans and we flowed over their decks as fast as men can clamber from bench to bench my right arm was red to the shoulder with the blood of lesser men dripping down my chest inside my armour and there was the smell of copper in my nose like an offering to the god of smiths and still i killed them after we cleared our second ship i got my voice back and called archilogos and he turned because if he died without me i would never forgive myself he had to know i was coming another ship the last before archis and i was suddenly blade to blade with a giant to make it worse he was standing on the command platform and i was in the benches he was an officer of some sort because hed gathered a dozen marines and turned them to face our rush i paused he was huge and i felt the blood and the fire in my muscles spear i said reaching back and lekthes put his in my hand thats right honey and he eventually died a lord and his daughters play with you i thought youd recognize the name ive mentioned it a dozen times the giant raised his shield ready for me to throw the spear instead i charged him raising the shield cost him a second and i got a foot on the platform and my shield went against his and before i got the other foot up i slammed my spear point into the side of his helmet a broad bowl with cheek pieces riveted in the middle phoenicians are masters of many things but bronzework is not one of them he stumbled back id rung his bell then he cut low at my legs but i dipped the boeotian and put the bronzebound base into his sword then i slammed my spear into his helmet again in the same place he stumbled back and i roared i remember that moment best of all because this giant of a man was afraid and that fear was like the scent of blood to a shark he cut at my legs again but i blocked it stepped in and put my spear point into his helmet a third time where the browridge met the bowl and the third time the rivet popped and the point went under the bad weld right through the top of his skull i stepped over him and a spear punched into my side by ares that was pain the scales held but the rib broke and i was knocked to my knees never saw the blow that got me theres a lesson there nearchos got him i knelt there almost dead unable to raise my head ares the pain i hurt even thinking about it and lekthes and idomeneus stepped past me dancing the dance and men fell back before them they cleared the platform and i could breathe although it wasnt good and i got a leg under me and then another then the rest of them dropped their weapons cretans were flooding aboard from all directions id taken achilles heir into the heart of the chaos and his father had come with all his warriors to save him nearchos was as tall as a titan in that moment i managed to walk forward achilles glared at me but embraced his son i passed behind him and led my men across to archis trireme half of archis rowers were dead and all but two of his marines he himself was covered in blood and had an arrow right through his calf but somehow he was still standing i walked up the centre plank from the bow and the spear shaft in my hand had a tendril of blood that ran all the way down from the head the phoenician marines tried to surrender but there was no quarter just then and my cretans rolled over them like a wave rolling over a childs castle on the beach and they were gone their blood flowing into the sea and i was so close to archi i could reach out and touch him archi i said and pulled off my helmet get off my ship he said and fainted we bandaged him he was cut eleven times i remember that and the arrow through his calf when he came to he swore at me and demanded that i be executed no one paid him any heed but my dreams that our friendship would be restored when i saved him went the way of many dreams i had a couple of broken ribs and six bad cuts my sword arm had taken a lot of abuse desperate men cut at your arm instead of defending themselves and die while doing it death robs them of force but id always meant to buy vambraces and now i knew why i sat on the deck of an alien ship and let lekthes bandage me wed taken four ships or so idomeneus told me which was good because our own had sunk it sank empty but sink it did the bow opened like a slit belly nearchos came and gave me some shade along with troas my father is angry nearchos said as if it delighted him i suspect he feels that i should have protected you better i said i think i managed a smile pick any of the ships and it is yours he said we can crew it from the survivors im taking this one unless you want it i raised my head do i get troas what on earth am i to do with a ship and how is archilogos of ephesus nearchos shook his head youve been out a little while friend we lost the battle that snapped me awake blood loss or none what oh we won the sea battle nearchos said how godlike he looked and not a mark on him he shrugged the cyprians shattered like glass and half their nobles changed sides in midaction onesilus is dead cyprus is lost ares i muttered aristagoras has ordered us to stay together and run for lesbos he shrugged pater says that well crew you a ship and youll go for all of us the rest of us are going home he made a face your father is a great man i said troas you go home may you have a hundred grandchildren he laughed never planned anything else but ill choose you a good crew if you swear me an oath that youll send them home i got to my feet i felt like crap but there was something some weight gone from my shoulder and not just my scale shirt id kept my oath i could feel it i have one oath already on me i said ill do my best but thats all i can promise the second day out from cyprus and we were in the deep blue under sail reaching north for the coast of asia and familiar waters and my heart was in my throat with every rise of the bow the cuts on my arms hurt the worse for the salt air and there was a storm rising in the east i had one trick of command i wasnt going to show my fear to lekthes or idomeneus so they assumed all was well and transmitted that confidence down the decks but darkness was coming i knew that id fucked up pardon me ladies and by aphrodite despoina you blush like a maiden of twelve i mean that i knew id left it until too late in the day and i knew we werent on a course of true north and that meant we were still at sea when we should have been cooking and no sight of a coast the rowers were sitting on their benches enjoying the rest and no doubt planning how to retake the ship i called my two men and gave it to them straight were going to spend the night at sea i said and the crew will try for us once it is too dark to see lekthes winced idomeneus grinned maniacally the seafight had changed him for all his limp wrists and exaggerated prettyboy habits he was getting to be a hard man and he knew it and loved it let them come he said there arent ten men among them i shook my head the ten men you kill are the same ten men we need to get to lesbos alive i said lekthes shook his head so what then get the cretans up and armed then walk up and down confidently and see if there are any of the greeks worth having if you find a man you like send him aft while theres still light the two of them went forward armed the cretan deck crew and then began to move through the ship im sure that none of you wellbred ladies has ever been on a warship so ill tell you how it is at sea a trireme has three decks of rowers they arent really decks but three levels of benches with a sort of crawlspace between them it takes men time to come and go from the oar benches theres a single walkway the width of a mans shoulders that runs from stem to stern the length of the ship on an athenian ship theres a command platform amidships some of the easterners do the same and some build a little deck aft by the helmsman regardless the helmsman sits in the stern between his two oars which in a modern ship are strapped together with bronze or iron hes the real commander of the ship and it is the helmsmans voice that the other officers the deck crew obey under the helmsman theres an oar master who keeps order and counts time and a sailing master who manages the two masts and their sails the mainmast and the boatsail mast which is up forward in the bow the rest of the deck crew manage the sails and bully the oarsmen and provide a reserve of labour on a cretan ship they also serve as extra marines then there are marines usually citizenhoplites lord achilles didnt send me with any marines i had two dozen of his men as deck crew and not one of them would make an officer a more worthless group of men id seldom seen and troas had his revenge for my corrupting his daughter by the gods i swore to have vengeance on him if i ever caught him not one man who could be trusted between the steering oars nearchos may have wanted me to get the very best men but what i got was the dregs men no one needed human waste the prisoners were the better men in every instance i had at least forty phoenicians and twice that in captured greeks i didnt even have a full rowing crew i couldnt man all the lowerdeck oar shafts in good weather it should have been enough but there was a storm coming and lord achilles didnt give a rams fart whether this ship made it through the storm or not well id made a small fortune from him and i didnt mean to die at sea and yet i remember thinking that i had at least in part redeemed my oath and that meant that i was free to die in a way the thought relaxed me to be honest i was an honourable man again so i stayed in the steering oars and we sailed north or more likely north by west and the sun sank in the sky and the murmurs from forward grew louder a waterclock before sunset lekthes came forward with a black man id seen the nubian when the prisoners had been herded aboard by marines you couldnt miss him with his skin as black as new pitch in the smithy ready for the forging of fine bronze lord lekthes asked coming aft this one claims he was helmsman on a phoenician trireme he prodded the black man and the man looked at him with illconcealed resentment claims my arse lord the nubian said in ionian greek better greek than mine lord you are too far west of north ive been watching since the evening star rose i know these waters that will be all lekthes i said borrowing aristides manner when dismissing a man lekthes snapped a salute and went back to the decks whats your name i asked the nubian crossed his arms and looked forward paramanos lord your greek is excellent i said he nodded it ought to be i grew up with it my family owns ships at naucratis and theres more of us in cyrene he looked forward again and my daughters will be orphans if you dont point this ship north lord naucratis a greek city in the nile delta they say it was founded by mercenaries serving the pharaohs at the time of the siege of troy and cyrene is a colony richer than the mother city in africa what is it that your tutors teach you you are a helmsman i asked ive been navarch of a bluewater merchant he said if you are lying ill kill you i said take the steering oars i could see his fear and smell it but i didnt know whether he was afraid of me or simply afraid of death the coming storm hard to tell i stepped off the helmsmans bench and he took the oars i have the ship he said yes you do i said he shook his head im changing course see the evening star there by the moon thats well west of north from here he swung the oars his arms taut with muscle and the ship changed course smoothly the wind passing from under our quarter to dead astern before the north star rises well be in with the coast or you can feed me to the fishes he said but his voice shook i didnt trust him at sunset idomeneus came aft with a trio of lanky asian greeks all three brothers i guessed they were taken in arms as rebels on the mainland and pressed as rowers idomeneus said all citizens of phocaea in aeolis he looked aft weve a dozen more aeolians they shouldnt be prisoners to start with the eldest brother fell to his knees lord we are ionians we fought at sardis i was in the agora when you fought lord it was an easy claim to make i had no idea who had been in the agora at sardis but i had been a slave i knew that tone besides lets be honest i liked being called lord i held up my hand will you swear to me now all three knelt on the deck and swore ionians swear the way cretans do hands between the hands of their lords they arent much for democracy like mainland greeks i took their oaths by poseidon and zeus soter and then i armed them and set them to choosing any other aeolians that they knew herakleides was their leader and his brothers were nestor and orestes and they were good men i have a soft spot for men who carry the name of my ancestor i was just congratulating myself on having some good men when the phoenicians decided to take the ship they must have been desperate as they saw the aeolians separated out they must have known that their chances of taking the ship were dropping by the moment they almost killed lekthes in the first rush they clubbed him with oars broken short what a labour that must have been theyd worked in secret below decks of course muffling the sound in their cloaks and rowing cushions i suppose i had no idea they were brave men desperate men and they came in one gallant charge up the benches oar shafts falling like axe blows lekthes took one on his helmet and fell to his knees but idomeneus stood by him put a spear point in one big syrian and slammed his shield into another shoving him over the side they went to get around him but i got my sword out of my scabbard cursing myself for a fool i had ordered my men to arm but i was standing nearly naked my helmet and scale shirt stowed uselessly under the helmsmans bench short sword against oar shaft is not a good match i took a blow on my shield arm and killed the man my arm was numb the three aeolians werent armed but they threw themselves into the fight fists and gymnasiumtrained muscles the oldest took the oar shaft from the nerveless fingers of the man id hacked down i climbed on the next bench the rage of combat on me and all thought of leadership lost while idomeneus the only fully armed man was laying waste to the syrians there were two dead at his feet and a third was trying to hold in his guts while grappling idomeneuss feet i stepped on his throat and blocked a blow meant for lekthes then one of the aeolians doubled up my opponent with a vicious blow to the mans stomach and they broke we hunted them through the boat and killed them all it isnt pretty to say it but with a wind rising and the peril of mutiny and the blood hot we didnt take any prisoners syrian phoenicians cant hide among greeks and we werent too fussy about who had carried a broken oar shaft and who hadnt when i came back aft my arm still numb and my feet as red with the blood as if id been treading grapes in boeotia i found four more phoenicians clustered around the helmsmans bench their pointed beards gave them away i raised my arm to kill them and the nearest put up his arm to protect himself stop the nubian demanded stop it he tried to catch my arm and i socked him in the face with my sword fist he fell back into the steering rig and the ship yawed his nose pumped blood but he was back on his feet stop it or poseidon will take us he said that got through my blooddrunk head theyre trying to surrender he said again zeus soter lord these are noblemen worth ransom this one was my navarch stop it he was screaming at me while leaning all his weight on the oars and i saw that while id been slaughtering syrians the wind had come up get forward i said to the four phoenicians throw the bodies over the side i knew it was heartless but the bastards had tried to take my ship and i suspected that these four fine noblemen were just as guilty or more guilty after the slaughter of forty syrians we were down to half a compliment of rowers the coast was nowhere in sight and the wind was shifting around my new helmsman looked at me as if he thought i was mad i looked at him as if he was a traitor you seem awfully friendly with the phoenicians i said id broken his nose he shook his head to clear it i dont know who the fuck you are he said with your barbaric greek and your murderous temper but we all used to be friends with the merchants of tyre ive traded with them all my life there was something funny about a black man in an asian chiton telling me that i was a barbarian i laughed you are a brave man i said fuck your mother he growled were all going to die anyway he spat over the side you just killed the whole lower oar deck we dont have the manpower to beach the ship i laughed again well stay at sea then nothing to fear from a night at sea i laughed and pointed at the blood running out of the oar ports poseidon has had his share of sacrifices i said his eyes said that he didnt agree and the ship is rid of vermin i added if i was going to play the mad captain id play it to the hilt even the cretans were different in the morning they might still be useless but now they were terrified of me and that made them better sailors paramanos got us in with the coast of asia the long east west reach south of aeolis and west of lydia full of pirates and dangerous rocks but he knew that coast and we ran west with the new storm at our backs all night and morning showed the teeth of the mountains dead ahead unless we row south paramanos said were dead men i agreed so i had all three decks rowing well at least the two i could man in the grey rain and we had the sea broadside on pouring through the oar ports and pushing us steadily west for all the southing that we made which was precious little some time in that endless grey day i sent the deck crew to row and even gave orders for the handful of armed aeolians who still stood by to serve wine to every man strip their armour and take up an oar my left arm was still numb and even in the rain i could see a bruise as black as the darkest night where the oar had hit me but i knew that i had to row leadership is an odd thing sometimes you want your men to fear you as they fear the gods at others you need them to love you like a longlost brother so i settled to an upperdeck bench and for the first time i could see how much water was swirling down in the hold below me my stomach clenched we were a third full of water and if the phoenicians had still been manning the lower benches theyd have been drowning i called to the nubian and told him that we were full of water i could see him smile at my ignorance he was conning the ship of course he would know just how sluggish we were truly i was a pisspoor commander i had too much to learn it was a phoenician ship and it had tackle i didnt understand it had pumps sliding wooden pumps that rigged to the top strakes and allowed a strong man to shoot water up and over the side straight up from the bilges the nubian got them rigged and shooting water while i rowed on in a haze of pain because now that i was active my left arm hurt like fire with every stroke and the whole thing seemed pointless every rower harbours a secret fear in a storm that by rowing for the safety of all he is losing his own strength to swim if the ship founders i was a strong swimmer id learned in ephesus and swum every day on crete and now i knew that if we wrecked i would drown dragged under by a weak left arm and a hundred cuts and bruises whatd you do the man below me asked out of nowhere werent you deck crew everyone rows i said gritting my teeth trierarchs a madman aint he the man asked a killer thats what i hear i laughed i am the trierarch i said he twitched and almost lost the stroke and i felt better listen boy i said using the ionian phrase for a slave or a man of no value if we live you owe me an apology and if we all die youll have the satisfaction that ill be as dead as you that was the end of conversation with my rowers i dont think they loved me they thought i was insane another nightfall found us still at sea we were resting fifteen men at a time and i was relieved eventually by another shift of reserve rowers and i could see that if there was no less water in the bilges at least there was no more but i also knew that our rowers were almost finished i knew because i was as strong as an ox injury or no injury and my arms were like wet rawhide i went aft cold now that i wasnt rowing and pulled my dry cloak from under the bench and put it around me paramanos was still in the steering rig can you take the helm he asked give me cup of wine and a hundred heartbeats and ill do my best i shrugged lekthes and idomeneus were both rowing and there wasnt another man on deck its a miracle weve made it this far isnt it i said he nodded im good he said he pointed aft when the rowers fade i put the sea behind us for a few minutes his greyblack face had a ghost of a grin not my first storm i knocked back a cup of neat wine it flowed like warm honey through my veins and i was alive give me the oars i said he handed them over and the moment i took them i felt the strain i looked to starboard and i could see the coast passing in the fading light the combination of wind and oar was moving us at a speed that seemed superhuman i thought that the nubian would collapse hed been between the steering oars for twelve straight hours dawn to dusk but instead he ran forward the oars rose and fell to the beat but the men were barely moving them the wind was doing the work and it would soon bring about our ruin i reckoned that at roughly the time the sun finally set wed touch the rocks no beach at all there at the foot of the olympus of asia i poured another cup of wine and drank it i would die with my oath redeemed doing my best what more can the gods ask paramanos came back aft and the grey fatigue was gone from his face i handed him the wine cup and he drank off the rest if you served out wine he said we might get another waterclock of strong rowing and i think we might might save the ship we traded places again while he explained i didnt think his wine would work i thought that words would and i ran forward to the command platform and raised my voice over the rain listen you bastards i shouted into the wind well be on a beach cooking hot food and drinking wine before the sun sets if youll put your backs into it what a bunch of shits well look in hades if we drown a horselength from a safe beach it was my first battle speech it worked they all thought that they were dead men and the merest glimpse of hope was enough to fire them i walked up and down the central plank and i told them exactly what paramanos planned over and over again were going to thread the needle between the chelidon and korydela i said and then well be in the lee of the greatest mountain in asia calm water and rest our nubian says we can beach at melanippian even in the dark with this wind and i believe him its easy to believe when the only other choices are extinction and black death and they rowed with their guts and their hope of life sunset not that wed ever seen the sun gave way to a horrible grey light and then to full night and still we lived and i knew that our bow was due west now the storm was full at the stern and the motion of the ship was easier the only rowing we needed was to keep her stern on to the wind but i knew that we were still in a race with time and i got my three aeolians and lekthe and idomeneus and two men they seemed to know and we raised the boatsail id seen it done by hipponaxs trained mariners you lash the furled boatsail to the mast then raise the mast secure it ten times and then you cut the lashings on the sail and it spreads itself the ephesians did it to show off but hipponax had said once that it was a lifesaver in a storm it is one thing to lash a boatsail to its mast on an autumn day in a brisk breeze with the warm sun burning your shoulders surrounded by men who love you and another to do it in driving rain with your hands so cold that you cant tell whether you have rope between your fingers or not we managed to tie the boatsail eight times with hemp rope and then we found that we didnt have the strength to raise the mast the wind caught it and hurled it over the side and only the luck of the gods kept the pole from holing us as it went over but damn it we were close to making it through the strait i could see the cliffs rising on either side the rowers were finished even hope cant make spent muscles move an oar i wasnt finished i got the spar from the mainsail and let the wind take the mainsail over the side like a hundredhanded monster twenty silver owls of linen lost in two heartbeats and i didnt give a damn the spar was only three men tall much smaller than the boatsail mast but we carried a spare boatsail and we bent it to the spar and tied it down and then i stripped the upper deck of rowers the oars were in all along the deck with only the middle men pretending to row and we were beginning to fall off and broach time was running out we had cliffs on both sides and even paramanos was out of of whatever drove him they thought i was mad we were turning so that our long side was vulnerable to the wind the men still rowing didnt have the coordination or the strength to keep our head to the waves and like a ship in battle once the long sides were to the waves we were done i went from man to man in between lightning flashes pushing rope ends into unwilling hands i knocked a man sprawling when he was too slow to obey he went over the side and the sea took him pull you bastards i called love is a fine thing love will take a man above himself whether it is love for a man or a woman or a ship or a country but fear can imitate love in most situations and i knew they didnt love me pull or die i screamed and my sword was in my hand still time to bleed i shouted and i laughed let them think me insane the spar shot up like a stallions penis lash her down belay her then they were willing then they believed it was easy when we came to it but someone had to get them over the belief that they would fail now every man worked with a will and paramanos was next to me lashing the new stays as fast as his hands could work already the wind that brutal east wind was on the mast and the tightwrapped boatsail and our bow was cutting the sea little idomeneus was at the helm doing his best to get the bow headed west paramanos worked by my side as we tied the ropes and belayed ten ropes ten heavy cables to hold a mast smaller than the one a dayfisher carried then paramanos was gone back to his steering oars we were three horselengths from the rocks of chelidon and there was no more time to worry my sword was in my hand i cut the lashings in two sweeps as accurate as any sword cuts id ever made in combat and the whole sail blew free of the lashings as if poseidons fist had struck it i thought that the mast would snap it bent so far and the bronzeclad bow plunged into the sea so that i thought we might dive to the bottom like a cormorant fear took me but i got my arms around that mast and held on as the water drove aft and then the bow began to rise i felt the change under my feet even as i choked on the water in my mouth the bow came up sluggish at first and then the first stay rope gave with a crack like a thunderbolt killing the man it hit one of the aeolians he didnt even get to scream the new mast gave a grunt and moved the width of a mans arm and held the whole ship seemed to groan and the bow rose again clear of the sea the waves were at our stern and wed put more blood into the water the aeolian was our last sacrifice i had a chance to see the cliffs of chelidon and i dont think that i have ever moved faster across the surface of the earth than i did in those heartbeats as the full weight of the storm blew into our tiny sail and we raced across the sea like a mare run wild and then as fast as it takes to tell it we were through the strait first the force of the gale diminished by half because the cliffs were no longer funnelling the whole storm into our little sail and then paramanos grinning like a titan was turning us oh so gradually to starboard it took us longer than we could have imagined i think that if id told the men back in the teeth of the storm that we were still half a watch from safety wed all have died but the moment came when every man aboard knew we were not going to die hard to define but between one breath and the next the wind had dropped so far broken by the weight of asian olympus to our north and east now that if wed all slumped on our oars wed have floated the rest of the night and come to no harm and in the contrary way of the human heart that gave us strength we were all one animal by then and we were going to rise and fall together no mistake my cretan oar master was gone swept over the side by the wave when the bow went down and i beat the deck with my good spear and chanted the iliad at the sea and men laughed it was as dark as tartarus under the lee of the mountain but the beach rolled on for ever and we turned the ship in water as calm as any harbour and the stern grated on the gravel the kiss of life and the ship stopped all our oars out over the side as if we were a dead water bug we lay in a huddle on the beach a hundred exhausted men who didnt even try to start a fire it was hot in the midst of the pile of men and cold and wet on the fringes and no man slept but no man died in the morning the sun rose late over the mountain and we rose slowly like men who have survived a hard fight which we were we caught some goats sacrificed them to poseidon and ate them halfcooked we drank wine from the hold poured more libations than an assembly of priests and swore that we were brothers until the sun died in the sky the next morning i got them back aboard and with the bow pointed at lesbos we sailed away with our toy boatsail and as luck would have it twenty stades up the bay we found our own boatsail mast with the sail still lashed to it floating with the wrack of the storm and further downwind we found the mainsail floating below the surface like a dead creature truly the gods love you paramanos said i shrugged i have some luck i said he nodded i was at the steering oars and he was drinking fresh water from a little horn cup a phoenician habit ive never seen that trick with the boatsail before he said it was a peace offering if i wanted it he was a better sailor than i and hed taken command when he had to and he expected me to resent it he had me wrong i waited until hed finished his water then i put my arms around his neck you fucking saved us i said im not so mad as you think he nodded and finally he couldnt restrain his grin i did didnt i he said you did i answered the next afternoon i summoned the phoenicians aft i nodded at the helmsman paramanos has requested your lives i said for myself i bear no grudge against you we are at war but i will only free you for a ransom choose among yourselves who will go and who will stay as surety the eldest nodded first he embraced paramanos and then he came back to me i am the richest of these men and i will stay he said i could see the hatred in his eyes but who loves a man who has killed thirty countrymen in cold blood i didnt need his love set a price i said he named a figure in talents of silver paramanos approved and herakleides the eldest of the aeolians gave a curt nod herakleides was already serving as an officer and training with paramanos to be a helmsman on the beach at methymna i said to the youngest who was chosen to go thirty days i turned to idomeneus see to it that he has arms and ten silver owls the eldest syrian shrugged land him at xanthus he said we have a factor there and so we did when i promised all the rest of the crew shares in the ransom my status rose again the four phoenicians were worth ten times my whole fortune and i had accounted myself welloff before we fought the battle boeotians arent good at wealth the gods were kind dolphins sported at our bow and we had the mainsail up by noon of the second day a kinder east wind stayed at our sternquarter all the way up the coast of asia until we had to turn and row into the magnificent bay at mytilene the beach was not as full of ships as it should have been indeed it was as if only a portion of the fleet that had broken the phoenicians at amathus had come to the rendezvous more than a third of the ships had gone home and at first glance it looked worse the cretans were not the only ones to take their loot and go i recognized the athenian cut of the ships on the south end of the beach but not any of the ships themselves none of them were aristides but i saw a black hull that might be herks unlovely nemesis and i turned my ship at the south end of the beach and put the stern in the sand two oars lengths from the man himself who stood in the gentle surf laughing and shouting rude suggestions at my oarsmen he was the first man to embrace me as i put my feet on the beach miltiades was the second of course it had been miltiades advising that rascal aristagoras he was the samothracian navarch i heard a lot of that story later and if i have time ill answer all your questions about it but at that point i was simply happy to see someone i knew i was happy to have someone to be in command and i was delighted to receive his flattery which came thick fast and accurately that short sail from south of cyprus to lesbos was my first command and it had taken its toll i was boneweary and the broken ribs hadnt begun to knit so that every weather change and every jostle caused spikes of pain i had discovered that commanding men is the very opposite of fighting man to man what i mean is that when i am fighting the world falls away and everything is right there the whole circle of the world revealed in a single heartbeat as heraclitus used to say but when you are in command you have to face the infinite consequences of each action forward on and on until the gods strip the roots of the world away is there water is there food where will you beach tonight does that oarsman have a fever have you passed three headlands or four and it never ends no sooner were my bare feet in the sand of lesbos miltiades arms around me than my men were asking whether we would need the boatsail brought ashore and a hundred more questions miltiades laughed released my arms and stood back the bronzesmiths son is a trierarch no surprise to me allow me to add youve come right in among my ships why not camp with me i might have done better waited for the best offer but i was so happy to see someone from home to be honest when i saw miltiades i assumed that the ionians would win he always had that effect on me show me where we can build our fires i asked he waved and another friend joined me agios now helmsman to miltiades you have a ship of your own he asked and laughed poseidon help your oarsmen we walked down the beach and he found me space for fires a fire for every fifteen men then i gathered them all in a big circle and made sure of their mess groups eating on the voyage had been a matter of desperation now i meant to get them organized we mustered ninetysix oarsmen and twentyone cretans i put the cretans in two mess groups i didnt expect them to want to stay and i didnt want their bad attitude to infect the rest the aeolians and other greeks and random asians who made up the rest of the crew i divided in fifteens i paid silver out of my own hoard to buy them cook pots right there on the beach the local market was huge and every merchant in mytilene was selling his wares or hers the best of the potters was a middleaged woman with her hair tied up in a scarf and clay on her hands and her pots were so much better than her competitors that i agreed to pay her exorbitant rates men know when they have the best equipment i learned that from my father even pots are part of morale i bought a net full of small tuna gutted and fresh and the men fell to cutting and preparing i had to pay for firewood and vegetables and bread and by the time the oarsmen were settled to their first good hot meal of the week my hoard of silver had diminished by a little under a fifth i could not afford to be a trierarch when my belly was full of wine and tuna i caught idomeneuss eye and picked up my best spear ionians follow many of the old ways and one is that walking with a spear lends a man dignity and formality i walked over to miltiades fires and found him easily enough he was seated on an iron stool the legs digging deeply into the sand he was telling a tale an uproarious tale and the laughter swept higher every few heartbeats as we walked up the beach towards him his red hair burned in the sun and his head was thrown back to laugh at his own story and thats one of my favourite ways to remember him because he really could tell a story the hero of amathus he called when i was close enough he rose and embraced me again it was then i discovered just how far my fame had spread men gathered around me as if i was miltiades and he didnt stint in his praise yet one mans face grew dark archilogos turned on his heel and walked away his servant at his side i watched them go and the happiness of the moment was marred like a bad mark in an otherwise perfect helmet a dimple that you cannot remove miltiades paid no attention if he even noticed for those of you fine gentlemen who were busy it was young arimnestos who defeated their centre i saw the whole thing from the flagship he laughed oh how we cheered you lad like men watching the stadion run at the olympian games with heavy wagers on the runner he put his arm around my shoulders a big man bigger than me bigger than miltiades came and took my hand im kallikles brother of eualcidas to the men assembled he said this man too old to be a boy went alone and saved my brothers body from the medes i accepted his embrace but then i turned to idomeneus my hypaspist idomeneus he stood by me that long night and helped carry the body kallikles was not too proud to shake a servants hand may the gods bless you he said you were my brothers skeuophoros idomeneus nodded and shied a step i freed him for his aid i said i hoped that this was within my rights he served like a hero not a slave thats my brother all over kallikles smiled and shook his head even his bedwarmer is a hero eualcidas apparently had quite a few admirers even among the athenians because miltiades poured wine from a skin into a broadbottomed cup and raised a libation to the dead heros shade and many men came forward to drink from that cup miltiades stood at my elbow and one by one the other warriors wandered off until finally it was just half a dozen heraklides was there and idomeneus of course red with wine and the praise of his betters epaphroditos now a lord of mytilene and lord pelagius of chios if he held my killing of his grandson against me he hid it well i drink to you arimnestos of plataea miltiades said and he did he was looking at me steadily i heard that you were in the front rank our front rank at the rout at ephesus aristides spoke well of you and for that sourpuss it was high praise and you came off with eualcidass corpse men will sing that for some years i can tell you he looked at me with more appraisal than praise but any man has one days heroism in him all of us with the favour of the gods can rise to it once pelagius nodded too true miltiades stroked his beard but amathus sealed the bargain i watched you clear those triremes lad youre the real animal arent you he had one fucking good helmsman too agios added who was it who cut the phoenician in half i had to grin not me i admitted heraklides nodded we knew that lad with a sword you are a titan come to life with a ship you may be good in ten more years i have an aegyptian now took him as a prisoner at amathus im hoping hell take service with me and teach me i pointed down the beach but of course my nubian was nowhere to be seen but the artist at amathus was a cretan fisherman in his first fight name of troas agios laughed aloud he was a small man but he had the laugh of a satyr threw his head back and roared until his chest heaved that for my arrogance he laughed i thought you had some veteran some shipkiller from aegina or miletus i kept screwing up my courage to talk to miltiades but i didnt want all the praise to end who does i was twenty and men of thirtyfive were singing my praises petty matters like money should be beneath a hero but the boeotian farmer won out over the heroic i cant afford to run a ship i blurted out pelagius turned away hiding a smile agios and heraklides looked at the sand obviously i could have done that better epaphroditos shrugged i can he said miltiades shook his head no hes mine he looked at me his head slightly tilted i think hed known what i was coming for from the moment he saw me walking with a spear and hed pushed me forward as a hero to raise my value i blushed i didnt have a lot of blushing left in me at the age of twenty but i blushed then miltiades laughed is your city going to make him a citizen he asked epaphroditos and my friend had the sense to shake his head you going to protect him against fucking aristagoras who wants him dead epaphroditos looked incredulous oh yes our dear lord and commander wants to see this young pups head on a spike theres a rumour he chuckled and looked at me hey i can keep my mouth shut eh lad epaphroditos made a noise as if he were strangling he what exactly whereas im a tyrant i can make him a citizen of the chersonese this instant and only i decide who captains my ships and frankly aristagoras cant survive the summer without me he turned to me again come lets have a look at your ship he looks like a heavy bastard one of the phoenicians you took i nodded deeper and broader than a cretan trireme i said all six of us walked back to my ship whats his name lord pelagius asked i shrugged storm cutter i said meaning it as a joke good name herk said men give ships the daftest names gods and tritons storm cutter is a real name i only have half a crew i said i turned to epaphroditos and most of them are aeolians will they stay with me miltiades cut him off doesnt really matter im never short of rowers thracians line up outside my palisade to serve for wages my men were forming two neat lines on the sand lekthes and paramanos had the men mustered and ready and they looked good herakleides was at the right end of the line and i introduced him to heraklides the aeolian and the athenian version of a son of heracles and then we walked down the rank of men must have been quite a storm miltiades said these men look like a crew then he went and looked at the ship heavy wood he said nice timber he nodded what do you think agios ran a loving hand over the sternposts where they rose in a graceful arc over the helmsman tyrian they build well he looked at miltiades this is a heavy ship meant to carry a heavy compliment and twenty marines hell be slow even with a full compliment at the oars and brutally expensive to maintain miltiades nodded to me he said you have a helmsman i looked at paramanos i dont know i said i cant speak for the man i want fair enough thats a heavy ship ill buy her from you and keep you as trierarch or ill pay you a wage for her herk will work out the details he grinned mostly what i want is you youre worth fifty spears now i grinned back i believe it lord but will your treasurer believe it herk bargained like a peasant that was fine with me i was a peasant we argued like henwives and i finally turned and left him on the beach he didnt want me to own the ship his contention was that i had less than half a crew of oarsmen no deckhands no marines and no helmsman so i tracked paramanos down to a wine shop that is to a blanket awning over a couple of rough stools with a huge amphora of good chian wine that was buried in the sand the shopkeeper charged by the ladleful the wine was good you have a wife and children i said after asking permission to sit he drank some wine i have a pair of daughters my wife died bearing the second they live with her sister i nodded what would i have to do to convince you to sail as my helmsman i asked he put a copper down for another cup of wine buy me he said and aim high i laughed one eighth i said thats my opening offer and my final offer he raised both eyebrows you know miltiades of athens i asked he nodded the pirate king he said i nodded exactly he wants me to serve him someday i imagine hell stop milking the trade fleets for money and hell go back to athens and make himself tyrant there i saw a dramatic new vista opening before me a vista where i was a nobleman a shipowner the sort of man who could marry briseis but i have a mind to spend a year or two making money ill give you one eighth of our take in silver if youll serve a whole year he drank more wine tell me who gets the other eighths he said one for me one for you one for keeping the ship i rhymed off one for the other officers three divided among all the other men one in reserve for a crisis if theres no crisis then in a year we share it out by eighths he sat back im a merchant he said not a pirate fifty silver owls down i said it was from my own hoard but i had money coming from miltiades i let the sack clink on the table fifty silver owls bonus he countered and he put his hand on the bag but did not seize it who wants a helmsman who doesnt have a high opinion of himself i had to smile because three years earlier i had been a penniless slave in ephesus fifty silver owls was a high price but id seen him in the storm yet there was still something about him i did not trust he was older and more experienced i think i assumed that was the problem and he feared me without respecting me that was another problem but he was poseidons own son done i said and took my hand off the pouch he made it vanish i should have asked for more he said he leaned forward so do you know that two men are following you i went back to herk with the nubian at my shoulder and found him in another wine tent he was enjoying a massage while drinking i let him interrogate paramanos and he was satisfied you found yourself a phoeniciantrained navigator just lying around he asked the gods love you the men dividing the spoils saw him only as a black man i said more fool them so you have a helmsman and you think that makes the difference that now i should hire you he raised his head and the man kneading his back slapped him down i would have laughed but there was a familiar face peaking at me from a corner of the stall kylix the slave boy kylix the slave boy a foot taller and four fingers broader he didnt look like a boy any more he was right on the cusp between boy and man he grinned my promotion from slave to free man to hero hadnt changed much for kylix id always been a hero to him message he said and put a piece of animal skin in my hand and for your ear he said and i bent down for him that ship of yours is so heavy i wonder if shell fit through the bosporus agios was saying unaware that i was listening to kylix a friend wants to see you be a lord kylix said handing me a leather sack it clinked my surprise must have shown on my face slaves love to surprise masters it is a free gift lord how are you kylix i asked he shrugged me im a slave he laughed but it was forced maybe ill become a sea lord too tell archi ill buy you i said i wish you could he said he looked around he hates you i nodded i know i clasped kylixs hand he frowned and then looked into my eyes aristagoras has paid men to kill you he said like diomedes at home he looked at paramanos and somehow i thought that he was accusing the man then he was gone herk leered friend of yours nicelooking boy someone elses slave i said sure herk laughed and made a rude gesture learned a thing or two from the cretans eh i grimaced and looked in the leather sack it held gold dozens of gold darics fresh gold darics i was holding a small fortune and as usual my thoughts showed on my face good luck death of a rich but unloved relative herk asked agios peered at the bag from over my shoulder the slave just gave you his life savings i couldnt imagine why archi who spurned me in public had just sent me so much money with ephesus fallen to the medes his own fortune must have suffered or so i thought i cocked an eyebrow though oh how the former slave loves to play the great man i dont think i need to hire out my ship after all i said really herk asked your friend sent you money for rowers too how soon the bubble bursts but as you are in funds i think i can trust you to get rowers dont play high and mighty with me lad i knew you when you were a slave like yon im not sure i like your phoeniciantrained helmsman and im not sure i think you are ready to command a ship does that kill our friendship it was a far cry from what id heard all afternoon and a good deal more like straight talk but i asked but ill hire you on for miltiades at the usual rate two hundred obols a day thats all found he smirked you have to fill up your own compliment of oarsmen and fifty a day for me i asked i assume the average man gets a drachma a day it was agios not herk who cut in he frowned i didnt agree to any such foolishness you pay yourself out of the two hundred a day now it was my turn to frown thats for aristocrats friend they can pass it all to their men and take nothing but political profit i shrugged ill look for another offer epaphroditos made a mention he is lucky to keep command of his ship the aeolians are full of tyrannicides he smiled its good to be the officer of an athenian aristocrat you get to have a foot in both camps he looked around as if he feared interruption two hundred obols and five drachmas a day for you two and forty i said i cant actually serve for less what did the cretans do to you boy he asked you used to be a tender morsel two and ten thats it two and fifteen i said and held out my hand herk took my hand fine but im going to charge you two days pay to get rid of the two twits who have been paid to kill you theyre waiting outside fifteen drachmas a day was more than i had made with the cretans not much more because the cretans had bought my bed and board and food and clothes good clothes too but the thought of men waiting to kill me scared me far more than thoughts of spending the summer fighting other men face to face the more men you kill the easier you know it is and the easier you know it will be for some bastard to kill you but id be commanding a ship with miltiades and that was enough for me done i said we spat and clasped hands and then i left him to his massage and took my bag of gold to the storm cutter i still couldnt see the two men but later that afternoon i saw two heads on spears near miltiades ship there was a board between the spears and it said thieves herk pointed them out as if i hadnt already seen them you owe us he said somehow those words made me feel as if my fate had been sealed paramanos was recruiting right on the beach he was shameless he asked every goodlooking oarsman who walked down the beach if he wanted to raise his pay shameless twice he was spending my money but hed already engaged a dozen more aeolians when i came up behind him he was talking to a big man with his back to me but i knew the mans voice i darted under his arm and gave him a squeeze and then he crushed the air out of my lungs stephanos i said indeed id all but forgotten the big chian why arent you at home most of the chian contingent had left to bring in their harvests he shrugged i dont want to go back to being a fisherman he said im a marine with lord pelagius he was proud he had a fine quiltedlinen corslet that must have come from cyprus and a beautiful cretan helmet well dont talk to this nubian too long or youll be an oarsman on my ship i said he nodded lord pelagius is heading home tomorrow he said id be honoured to serve that is as a marine not as an oarsman and your brothers i asked two of them had been pulling oars and any other chians in the end there were six of them five oarsmen and stephanos so i went to lord pelagius because thats how the cretans did things he was surprised but pleased that id asked all free men he said i cant hold them he nodded when you are hailed as the new achilles young man may i brag that i gave you your first award i thought fleetingly of his grandson cleisthenes i forced a smile yes my lord perhaps he was thinking of his grandson too he nodded curtly take good care of stephanos he said hes a good man the addition of stephanos seemed to change everything for me i made him my captain of marines which might have gone to another mans head but hed been much talked of among the ionians too and the two of us together in one ship how many times have i blessed lord apollo and the day of the competitions on chios stephanos and herakleides got along from the first and the crew settled down to have a decidedly aeolian flavour paramanos recruited promiscuously without regard to race dorians and ionians together aeolians and mainlanders and asiatics but the core was aeolian and their lisping lilting accents could be heard in our camp and on every gangway of the ship i forgot the note kylix had given me until a day had passed such was the effect of the gold and when i read it i was shocked to see that it asked me to a meeting on a beach well around the headland a meeting whose time had already passed i looked long and hard at the writing but it didnt seem familiar indeed the ink had scarcely left a mark on the deerhide and was difficult enough just to read i tossed it aside determined to speak to kylix about it when next we met and my heart soared at the thought that archi wanted to see me there was fear too what if archi had made the first step towards a reconciliation and he thought i had spurned it but my first command took all my time i was everywhere seeing to the underside of the ship watching paramanos train the oarsmen choosing officers and arranging for the cretans to travel home i bled gold darics the way a sacrifice jets blood buying better rigging paying wages and buying a pair of slaves that paramanos said were trained oarsmen going cheap they proved a bargain i traded them their freedom for a years rowing without wages a good deal for both parties but i still had to pay gold for them up front i bought the cretans a fishing boat a good hull with a fine sail paramanos was teaching me to sail in small boats a pleasure in itself and a wonderful way to come to understand the sea and through him i had come in just a week to love the sleek lines of the local fishing craft the cretans all felt the same and squabbled about whose boat it would be when they reached home it is for troas and his daughter i said then lekthes came to me and asked to go with them i will come back lord he said but my share of the spoils will buy me my bride he was an italiote a man from the lovely coast of southern italy you will settle on crete i asked after i make my fortune with you ill take her home to my mother he said he was one of my best men but what kind of lord stands between his men and happiness i let him go i knew that if he was on the boat the other men had a better chance of getting home alive i gave him my secondbest helmet and a new bronze thorax and a fine red cloak with a white stripe so that men would know that he was a man of consequence idomeneus surprised me by giving him a fine silver brooch with garnets set in the rivets for the girl he said so the cretans sailed away with many salutations and backward looks and herk laughed to see them go he and paramanos were virtually inseparable now playing polis in the shade of the beachedge trees and hunting wild goats together whenever they could or sailing one of the local fishing boats for sport paramanos shook his head the quality of our crew just improved threefold to be honest honey they were happy days and as usual i cant remember exactly what happened when the golden summer of my life is long ago but i think the cretans left first and then i received the message that the phoenician was waiting at methymna epaphroditos told me his people held the citadel there and that saved my life i took paramanos and his fishing boat with herakleides and stephanos to help guard the phoenician prisoners the four of us were enough to work the boat and we made a party of it three hundred stades in a fishing boat and i was beginning to learn the ropes as the fishermen say i thought that i knew sailing and the sea until i met paramanos he taught me that i didnt even know how much i had to learn and im lucky the lesson didnt cost a lot of men their lives at any rate we had beautiful weather even the three phoenicians seemed to enjoy the trip at least they laughed at our jokes and ate our food with gusto it was early autumn and the rain might have fallen on us but it didnt and we went around the long point of the islands and kept the mountain of lepetymnos on our left hands and before the moon rose on the third day we had the port of methymna over the bow i knew it from my visits as a slave and when i was first a free man sailing with archi and i remembered that he had a house here and a factor we beached with the fishing boats right under the walls of the town where a spit of rocks makes poseidons own natural harbour there was a phoenician merchant trireme on the deep beach south of the citadel i walked up to the guard post explained my business to the captain of the guard and received his respectful salute he knew my name i was flattered and flattery put me in a good mood so when i returned to my crew i thought to do the phoenicians a favour any point in waiting i asked paramanos shrugged i expect these gentlemen would like to be free he said i walked them down the beach and left them with stephanos and herakleides right under the wall where the gateguard could hear us if the phoenicians decided to take their friends by force but of course the phoenician captain wasnt aboard he was up in the town being hosted by his trading partners the war hadnt stopped trade far from it and mytilenes loss was methymnas gain but the fourth man the youngest was there he jumped down to the beach ran past me and threw his arms around his uncle and the other two the ransom is down in the hold he said we will sway it up in the morning he looked at me and i didnt like the look i was getting to be afraid of my own shadow or you could come and get it right now he said and his smile was forced now its hard to tell whether a man hates you because you killed his friends or whether hes just scared or whether he plans to kill you best to play safe i shook my head thats good i said and you can all spend a last night with me until i see it then he started away but i caught him easily put a knife to his throat while the rest of the phoenicians muttered angrily i pushed him off to herakleides and turned back all four of them are my prisoners until the ransom is paid i said i am an honourable man but dont try me my prisoners were surly now and i was suspicious we all slept badly under the hull of our overturned boat we could hear voices on the phoenician boat perhaps i should have posted a sentry i awoke with the point of a dagger at my throat you did not come when i summoned you briseis said quietly i could see kylix standing by the embers of our fire you summoned me i asked my head full of sleep was that briseis the arm across my chest felt familiar i brought you a note kylix said please tell her you received the note paramanos was awake i could see that he had a blade in his hand and he was moving very slowly towards stephanos i got the note i said i felt like a fool ten times over of course the note was from briseis for a man who brags about his intelligence i can be stupid i had wanted the note to be from archi yet you did not come she asked and her voice was like ice and fire together you sent me fifty darics i asked i thought that kylix came from archi without moving the knife she put her mouth down over mine and kissed me at some point the knife vanished and she pushed herself back up and dusted sand from her chiton walk with me she said you still love me that is all i required to know she looked at paramanos and he froze my husband is in league with the men you are ransoming he said he communicates with the persians and the phoenicians and he has paid them to kill you paramanos gave me a look oh such a look the look that older men use when they are laughing at younger men but when she said paid them to kill you he became alert ill watch he said i nodded and followed briseis and the two of us walked off into the first light of dawn she was wearing only a linen chiton i felt that while she was kissing me she had light sandals and a wreath of flowers in her hair the yellow flowers of lesbos and she walked with her usual grace but i could see she was just pregnant your first i asked she shrugged second she said she smiled at me you live you were closer to killing me than any man since i was a slave i joked when you didnt come to meet me i thought i would kill you she stopped put her hips against a big rock and tossed her head aristagoras wants you dead miltiades made him swear to keep you alive but hes a liar and his oaths are worthless why does he want me dead i asked and she smiled like the dawn every time he fucks me i call your name she said and she laughed but briseis always scared me as much as i thought that i loved her but you are married feh her contempt was palpable i am married to aristagoras if a fart could become a man it would be aristagoras she looked at me and i thought you were going to kill diomedes eh but he has gone over to the medes and taken all our property in ephesus my brother is all but a pauper i had forgotten what she could be like three years had made her more like herself not less i thought of you every day i said she sighed you might benefit from reading sappho she said some men say a squadron of cavalry is the most beautiful thing and some say a band of hoplites and some think that a squadron of ships is the most beautiful but i say it is whomsoever i love i said to her deliberately warping my sappho and she laughed i hear that you are a great hero she added and smiled her approval i hear that you killed more medes at amathus than any other greek i love to hear men talk of you she rose on her toes and kissed me and pregnant or not only kylixs heavy cough stopped us from making love right there i was hard before her mouth was open and her hands never mind ladies there is a party of armed men coming down the beach from the phoenician galley kylix said the guard is being summoned in the town i had my sword and was otherwise naked except for my chiton my feet were bare i had been asleep take your mistress and run i said run where briseis asked there is no entrance to the town from the sea i remember shaking my head she wanted to stay and see the blood just run i said and turned back towards my own boat he wants me dead too briseis said he dares not do it openly but on a beach where you can be blamed and you thrust yourself into this lions mouth i asked she laughed youll save me she said or well die together paramanos wasnt caught napping as i watched he bundled the prisoners aboard the fishing boat and put to sea the phoenicians came down the beach to find the birds flown they were all in armour and i was unarmed which gave me an advantage i knew that i could outrun any of them and they didnt appear to have a bow among them i hailed paramanos and he ran the fishing boat down the beach to us i put my love in the boat and pushed it off then walked up the beach as if i had nothing to fear youre up early i said im arimnestos have you come to pay the ransom the two bestarmoured men halted the rest and they formed a small phalanx on the beach the men of the town will be here in the time it takes to sing a hymn i called in persian and they will kill all of you and take your ship i pointed up the hill the lord of the town is my friend any bribe you paid the guards was wasted they were arguing among themselves its a lesson you learn early plotters never trust anyone i was nearly certain that the town garrison were going to watch me butchered and not raise a hand but the phoenicians didnt know that i pointed out to sea my prisoners are out there in that fishing smack i called and if you dont pay up theyll have their throats slit and be pushed over the side the two men in bronze armour argued and finally when i could see the new sun shining on spear points in the town they turned and went back to their ship well pay one of the men said honey ive seldom heard those persian words invested with so much hate they stacked bars of silver on the sand i ran off down the beach to paramanos and i didnt look back the exchange went well enough i rolled the silver and gold in my cloak and carried it to my boat then we released all four prisoners well down the beach almost as far as the threshing floor where the goats play we were gone around the point before the freed men joined their friends briseis asked me to take her around to eresus how could i refuse eresus is one of the most beautiful places in the world briseis had made that fart aristagoras buy her a house there on the back side of the acropolis good land with figs and olives like a little piece of boeotia in the desert of eastern lesbos the jasmine on the slopes of the acropolis perfumes the air and the sun is bright on the cliffs over the town the people came down to meet us then briseis took me up to the acropolis where i met sapphos daughter an old old woman she was strong the lady of the town and still fully in command you are her husband she asked i shook my head no but she smiled you are her true husband she said she was an odd woman a priestess of aphrodite and the lady of the aeolian goddess and a famous teacher i was a tonguetied killer in her presence but i saw another briseis that day a witty educated woman who could sing a lyric as well as an olympic competitor that night we lay together in her house with the doves cooing and the jasmine smell and i have never forgotten it it was the first time we had been together without an element of fear it was different she was different i knew love that night not the maddened halfangry love of the young but the gift of the cyprian that turns your head for ever i would have stayed a second day but paramanos came to me pounding on her door and his words were hard you are mad he said and she is no better and that is what is wrong with the world thugater because i accepted his words we shared a last drink of wine under her fig tree you are helen i said to her of course im helen she said why shouldnt achilles have helen why cant helen have achilles i have to sail away from you for a time i said otherwise one of us will die or ill kill aristagoras and be an outlaw she put her arms around my neck and it felt like the most natural thing in the world when ive had my way with the world ill call you to me and we will make love until the sun stops in the sky she said ill send you a copy of sapphos epic to pass the time she laughed i kissed her i love you i said she laughed how could i have doubted you listen achilles when you have a chance kill my husband if you dont ill have to do it myself and men will talk she laughed again and ice touched my spine there was never anyone like briseis and if you know your iliad youll know that it was on that very beach that achilles took her she made me feel more alive she climbed the cliff while i walked down to the beach and then she watched us sail away from the top i never promised you a happy story miltiades was waiting for me on the beach at mytilene i hadnt learned yet that he was the greatest spymaster in the west and knew of every event long before it happened indeed his reach was long he embraced me as i stepped ashore but he was curt walk with me he said he was my commander i walked away with him thinking of briseis i saw the cloud on his face and wondered how i could next see her you had aristagorass wife in your boat he said the bastard tried to ambush me i didnt know what else to say he tried to ambush you when you sneaked off to fuck his wife miltiades said he turned to face me thats what hes going to say shes two months pregnant i said which was not strictly speaking a denial i went to get my ransoms what ransoms miltiades asked me and he was as shrewish as a woman buying fish in the agora i hadnt told him and suddenly i realized that this not briseis was the real matter i had phoenicians to ransom after the fight at amathus i said you thought to take the money for yourself he asked and his voice was dangerous i stopped walking what the ransom for the phoenicians he said you sought to sneak away you thought that i wouldnt know this was a different miltiades a sharper more dangerous man what i asked foolishly and then what concern is it of yours dont try that on me he said half of anything you take is mine you expect me to squander political capital to save you from aristagoras and then you try to steal my money i stepped back fuck off i said i shook my head those are my ransoms from amathus nothing to do with you half he said half of every penny you take that is the price of being my man i pay the wages on your ship you agreed to the contract he spat dont act like a fucking peasant you got more than a talent i think that my hand went to my sword hilt because he looked around suddenly the great miltiades was afraid to be alone on the beach with me it wasnt the money thugater i am a killer and a lecher but i have never been a greedy man but i thought that he was cozening me and i cant stand to let other men get the better of me this is my money from before the contract i said ive promised part of it to my men that will have to come from your half then he said he crossed his arms he was a little afraid even then men saw me as a mad dog but he was bold and he must have needed the silver if you want to know how great a man truly is see him talk about money i sighed why didnt you come to me like a man i might have said like a friend but i had just discovered that pirates have no friends if you ever speak to me that way again ill have you killed miltiades said now pay up your half and we can forget all about this he was shaking with fury and yet he was above mere insults of manhood he didnt point at the boat behind me but he did jut his chin at it you think its going to be easy to keep you alive after this he hates you and you come sailing back from a rendezvous with his wife oh i can be a fool i paid perhaps youll think less of me but miltiades was the only anchor i had in that world i had no family and no friends and i was living far above my birth so i walked back down the beach took the rolled cloak out from under the floorboards of my boat and i paid miltiades half of the ransoms that i had earned without him paramanos watched me do it without a muscle moving on his face but i knew who the sycophant was by watching herakleides wouldnt meet my eye i couldnt believe it he was such an upright man but he was an aeolian and such men can be bought cheap i cursed miltiades counted it out and threw me back a gold bar an enormous sum of money thats to take the sting out he said im going to assume you misunderstood dont let it happen again and lets just forget he grinned and offered his hand i took it and we clasped miltiades looked over his shoulder then he looked back i think he was measuring my value to him i met his eye i trusted miltiades as i heard it from him aristagoras had plotted to kill her and me and that was enough later he came back and told me i earned every penny of the ransom you tried to hide from me ungrateful boy he said then he waved always the great man forget it he chuckled were going to have some wonderful times together i never forgot though and i assume he didnt either he sent me to sea immediately that evening with orders to haunt the asian coast it should have been a happy autumn but the politics of the ionian camp were vicious and i would have done better to enquire more closely from where my fountain of gold had come now that i served miltiades i was tied to the faction that favoured the war there was a peace faction led by none other than the author of the revolt aristagoras who now espoused a peaceful solution men said that he had been bought by the medes with golden darics and other men said that he feared the great king i discovered in between short cruises in the ionian sea that miltiades had informers everywhere and that being his man did have benefits he heard of a pair of phoenician biremes taking a cargo of copper and ivory up the coast of asia for heraklea in the euxine we took them off the islands without so much as a fight and you can be sure that i had miltiades half bagged and ready before my stern touched the beach autumn was welladvanced when we heard that the ionian cities of the troad had all fallen in two short weeks as artaphernes took the great kings army and besieged and captured them our morale plummeted and men and ships deserted the last of the chians sailed away and only the aeolians remained the tyrant of mytilene demanded that miltiades leave our piracy thats what he called it was bringing the city into ill repute what the bastard meant was that our ongoing commercial war against the medes was costing his city which was losing business to methymna around the coast of lesbos salamis the last free city of cyprus fell in late autumn miltiades called his captains to council it was a fine day with a stiff west wind blowing wed been beachbound for ten days with bad weather and no targets the asians were staying well clear of lesbos and the bad feeling between aristagoras and miltiades had reached a new height men said i was to blame some even said that briseis had had an affair with miltiades himself foolishness as she was eight months pregnant and hundreds of stades around the coast of the island but thats the sort of wickedness that spreads in a divided camp were leaving he said that was it the whole council reduced to a few words he wasnt much for a lot of talk unless it was his own back home heraklides asked what do you call home piraean miltiades asked chersonese herk said he grinned dont act the tyrant with us lord the wind is fair for the chersonese and we can lie on our couches with buxom thracians before the first snow falls one of miltiades captains was cimon his eldest son metiochos his second son was his other most trusted captain thats how the old aristocratic families worked plenty of sons who could be trusted as war captains i love to hear men call the athenians democrats as if any of them ever wanted to give power to common men if miltiades had had his way hed have been lord of the chersonese first and then tyrant of athens he only loved democracy when it packed the phalanx with fighters hah im a fine one to talk look at me lording it in thrace theres no hypocrite like an old hypocrite at any rate cimon was my age a man just coming into his reputation i liked him and he was not afraid of his father were going back to bad wine and blonde thracian women because pater is under sentence of death in athens he said the first the rest of us had heard of it miltiades look told me that he hadnt intended the rest of us to know but cimon just laughed i never knew exactly when and where miltiades and aristagoras had started to be allies and i never knew when they had a falling out although i suspect that briseis and i played our part i still dont know but miltiades did all the thinking that won us the battle of amathus in that much i suppose the bastard deserved a share of my spoils and i guess that miltiades had no stomach for peace with the medes not that he hated them but because he made his fortune preying on their ships and he needed that money to make himself tyrant at athens or thats how i see it now i should have said earlier that by the time miltiades wanted us to leave aristagoras had been supplanted by his former master histiaeus of miletus who had served the great king as a general for years and then deserted suddenly he must have been a great fool the ionians were all but beaten when he joined us and many men thought that he was a double traitor come to betray us into the hands of the persians in fact i suspect he was one of those tragic men who make bad decision after bad decision his betrayal of the great king was foolish and dishonourable and all his subsequent behaviour was of a piece i only met him once and that was on the beach at mytilene he was haranguing aristagoras as if the latter was a small boy i stayed to listen and laugh and aristagoras saw me and the hatred in his eyes made me laugh louder no one respected him by then his failure to lead us against the medes anywhere and especially to help the men of the troad when our fleet was just a hundred stades away showed that he was a fool if not a coward at any rate histiaeuss arrival was the last straw i think that miltiades imagined that he would become the leader of the ionian revolt and eventually the tyrant of all ionia and they would have been better for having him i can tell you honey he may have been a bastard about money but he was a warleader men loved to follow him i ramble here mix some of that lovely water from the spring in the bowl and add apples by artemis girl do you blush just for the mention of apples what a delicate flower you must be thugater where did you find her now pour that in my cup we sailed away ahead of the first winter storm and just as heraklides predicted we were soon snug on our couches at miltiades great palace at kallipolis aristagoras took his own retainers and fled to the mainland of thrace he had founded a colony there at myrcinus and he abandoned the rebellion or so miltiades informers reported i wondered where briseis was she must be bitter i thought from the queen of the ionian revolt to the wife of a failed traitor in three short years the winter passed quickly enough i bought a pretty thracian slave and learned the language from her i taught the pyrrhiche to all my oarsmen and kept them at it through the whole rainy winter and we went together to celebrate the feast of demeter and the return of the sailing season i was another year older i dreamed all winter of ravens and when the flowers began to bloom i saw a pair rise from a dayold kill and fly away west and i knew that it was an omen that i should be going home to plataea but there was nothing there for me i thought i worried more about my oath to hipponax and archilogos which goes to show what fools men are about fate in the spring histiaeus declared himself commander of the ionian alliance and set the rendezvous of the fleet at mytilene again where he had over the winter made himself tyrant he did it the simple way his picked men infiltrated the citadel then he killed the old tyrant with his own hands and every one of his children too soaked in blood he stepped forward to the applause the terrified applause i assume of the town miltiades told us the tale at dinner shaking his head with disgust should have been you i said i didnt mean it as flattery simple fact not the killings the lordship he grinned at me we were almost friends again which is to say he was unchanged and i had almost forgiven him miltiades land of the chersonese was the most polyglot kingdom id ever seen thracians and asiatics and greeks and sakje at every hand at dinner and in the temples if paramanos was the only black man he was not the only foreigner he loved the place and my fear about his loyalties began to relax at any rate that afternoon we had been joined by olorus the king of the local thracians and miltiades fatherinlaw he grunted that aristagoras he said i visited him over the winter hes a greedy fool and if he keeps taking slaves out of the bastarnae and the getae theyll kill him miltiades nodded he is a greedy fool he said does he have his wife with him i asked trying to sound uninterested he grinned now that is a woman he said by all the gods miltiades count yourself lucky you didnt marry her she is all the spine aristagoras lacks miltiades shrugged i met her on lesbos he said she is too intelligent to be beautiful he looked at me heh honey thats how men like miltiades like their women dumb fear not i wont marry you to one of those miltiades chief wife he had several concubines was hegesipyle as beautiful as a dawn and as stupid as a cow tied to a post oloruss daughter in fact i couldnt stand to talk to her she had never read anything never been anywhere my thracian slave was better educated i know because i taught her greek letters in exchange for her teaching me thracian and then we read sappho together and alcaeus oh im an old man and i tell these stories like a moth darting around a candle flame the point of telling you about that dinner is that miltiades rose and told us that we would not be joining the rebels the ionian revolt is only dangerous to the fools who play at it he said and his bitterness was obvious he was a man who sought constantly for greatness and greatness kept passing him by cimon was there he had a lovely girl on his couch i remember because she had bright red hair and we all teased him about what her children would look like miltiades had red hair too remember he rose so what will we do to win honour this summer he asked miltiades shook his head and he sounded both bitter and old win honour there is no honour in this world but well fill the treasury while old artaphernes is busy with his rebellion he had a grand plan for a raid down the asian coast all the way past tyre to the harbour of naucratis i frowned when i heard it because i knew the idea must have come from paramanos we sailed after the spring storms seemed to have blown themselves out we sailed right past the beach at mytilene they must have thought we were on our way to join them but we didnt so much as spend the night we stayed on chios instead and stephanos gave money to his mother and impressed all his friends with his riches and then sailed away and i was a little jealous of the ease with which he returned home and left his sister was married now and had three sons and i held one on my knee and thought about how quickly the world was changing and i wondered if miltiades was right that there was no more honour to be had we fell on the aegyptian merchants like foxes on geese all the cities of cyprus had fallen by then and they didnt think there was a greek within a thousand stades we came out of a grey dawn five warships our rowers hard and strong from the trip south and they didnt have a single trireme to protect them i didnt even get blood on my sword greeks have a name for when a wrestler wins a match without getting his back dirty we call it a dustless victory we took those poor bastards and we were dustless i took three merchants myself when a squadron came out of the port too late to save their merchants we scattered i ran south at the advice of paramanos i dumped the rowers from the ships wed taken on the low dunes of aegypt and kept the gold and bronze and the gigantic eggs of some fabulous animal africa is full of monsters or so im told there was a slave girl too illuse all over her and a flinch reflex like a beaten dog i kept her and treated her well and she brought me luck we picked up another pair of aegyptian merchants just north of naucratis the day after the raid ships inbound with no idea of what had happened more silver and gold and cyprian copper the bilge of storm cutter was filled so deep that we had a hard time beaching the ship and rowing was a horror i beached again carefully fed my crew on stolen goat meat and sent the newly captured crewmen to walk back to naucratis then i went west to cyrene that was for paramanos hed found a girl he fancied in the chersonese a free thracian woman and hed decided to pick up his children which filled me with joy because that meant that he was committed to me it was touch and go in cyrene the authorities knew us for what we were but paramanos was a citizen and they chose not to tangle with my marines his sister brought his daughters to the boat clutching their rag dolls the poor little things they wept and wept to be put on a boat full of men and hard men at that but some things earn the smiles of the gods and my aegyptian slave girl turned out to be a fine drynurse she was ridiculously thankful now that she found she wasnt to be raped every night and i have noticed this honey animals and people repay good treatment and the gods see we put to sea with a strong south wind coming hot and hard off africa we hadnt dared to sell even an ostrich egg out of the hold in cyrene they didnt like us and paramanos feared that the council would seize the ship i spent the whole night afraid that he would change his spots and betray us which shows that i had something to learn about men the wind was fair for crete we had a hold full of copper and gold and i knew a good buyer besides i wanted to know how lekthes was doing the bastard im laughing because most greek captains thought that it was a great thing just to go down the coast of asia or across the deep blue from cyprus to crete but thanks to paramanos i sailed the winedark as if i owned it and every night he showed me the stars and how to read them the way the phoenicians read them good times paramanos was showing off for his daughters and they reciprocated turning into a pair of little sailors ten days at sea and they could climb masts the elder girl niobe had a trick that scared me spitless every time i saw her do it when we were under way rowing full out she would run along the oar looms a foot on each oar the oarsmen loved her every ship needs a brave funny athletic elevenyearold girl probably as part of his showingoff for his girls paramanos made a disgustingly accurate landfall on crete and was insufferable as a result we walked up the beach at gortyns little port and were welcomed like homeric heroes better in that quite a few of them were murdered nearchos embraced me as if hed forgotten that we werent lovers and his father was decidedly warmer than i feared tell me everything nearchos said nothing has happened here of course he said glowering at his father so i bragged a little of the raid and i talked of the sea i was falling in love again with poseidons daughters as the fisherfolk say but the sea bored nearchos boats were a tool for glory not an end in themselves you raided aegypt lord achilles asked your miltiades is a bold rascal you must be a bold rascal yourself i raised my cup to him and we pledged each other until i stumbled out of the hall into the rose garden and puked up an amphora of good wine but i gave each of them a cup of beaten gold half the wages theyd given me returned in a guestgift and then they were my friends for life in the morning i had a hard head but i went to visit the bronzesmith he wanted to buy all my copper as i expected he would i gave him a good price and we parted with a dozen embraces any time you want to give up piracy he said i could make you a decent smith i waved to him and went down to the fishermens village and found troas he was sitting by his lesbian boat mending a net i heard you was back he said he didnt look up shes wed and well wed and its your boy she calved first so dont go making trouble then he looked at me she called him hipponax he said and we all thank you for the boat id sold a pair of the eggs and all the copper i put a bag on the upturned boat hull for the boy when hes a man i said i had planned a long speech or perhaps just a blow i hadnt forgotten how hed given me a boatload of fools but standing there on the beach by his upturned boat i had to acknowledge to the gods that his boatload of fools had made me the trierach i was his hands and the gods had helped make me still i glared at him you nigh on killed me with your castoff men i said i had no reason to send my neighbours and friends with you boyo he said calmly enough i got them home even the fools i said aye youre a better man than some troas said he nodded and that was my apology id like to see my boy i said nope troas answered my fool of a daughter took quite a shine to you my young achilles shes just about over it now and settling down to be a prosperous fisherwoman she almost loves her husband whos a good man and not a fucking killer his eyes held mine as tough in his way as eualcidas or nearchos or miltiades then he nodded on your way hero he said no hard feelings come back in five years if youre alive and ill see to it that you and your boy are friends i felt a rush of sadness rage and a lump in my throat as big as one of the ostrich eggs can i give you a piece of advice lad troas asked i slumped against the boat hull im listening i said he nodded you think youre happy as a hero but you aint youre a farm boy its not too late to go back to the farm i saw you play house with my daughter and i didnt figure youd ever come back but the fact that you did come back tells a whole different story he went back to his net thats all i have for you son it is odd how quickly you go from the killer of men to the bereft boy i have no home i said i still remember the taste of those words which slipped past the fence of my teeth against my will troas looked at me then really looked at me dont give me that shit he said but his tone was kind go and make one and he got up and embraced me troas giving me a hug for comfort thats the way of youth honey one moment you are achilles risen from the dead the next an old netmender feels sorry for you and each moment is as real as the other i got to my feet i was crying and i didnt know why still some human in you eh boy he said give me another hug then and ill pass it to your son in a few years he held me close if you dont leave this life soon all youll be is a killer he said i held him hard and then i went back down the beach to my ship nearchos was waiting with lekthes lekthes was standing with a sea bag on his shoulder and all his armour nicely shined his wife held his hand and wept i kissed her and promised to bring him home and then i embraced nearchos i have three ships and all the men to man them nearchos said when you when you want me call well come i sailed away with a lump in my throat part v an equal exchange for fire all things are an equal exchange for fire and fire is an equal exchange for all things as goods are for gold and gold for goods heraclitus fr it is necessary to know that war is common and right is strife and that all things happen by strife and necessity heraclitus fr we didnt see another ship until we were north of miletus the rebels and miltiades between them had swept the oceans clean north of samos we caught a merchantman out of ephesus i knew the ship as soon as i saw him on the horizon it had been hipponaxs pride a big long merchant with enough rowers to be a warship i remembered what briseis had said that diomedes had taken all their wealth and we ran him down easily enough they used slave rowers and slaves will never save your cargo with my spear at his throat the captain admitted that he served diomedes of ephesus i took the ship as well as the cargo and all the slaves at the oars too but i put the deck crew ashore east of samos tell diomedes that arimnestos took his ship i said tell him that im waiting for him i laughed to think how the little shit would react and then i took my new ship back to the chersonese on the way i stood in my bow and wondered at what troas had said and how i had cried how could i ever give this up to shovel pig shit i was a lord of the waves a killer of men i laughed and the gulls cried but over on the european coast of the chersonese a raven cawed the raucous sound braying on and on miltiades came down to the docks to meet us and i laid his share of the take at his feet every obol and he shook his head walk with me he said we walked down the beach and i remember the smell of the seawrack and the dead fish rotting in the whitehot summer sun he put an arm around my shoulder i thought youd deserted he said i apologize men will tell you that i said some things about you but you are weeks overdue i had a lot of copper in my bilges i said and it was true i went to a port i know in crete to sell it he wasnt listening right right he said i have a note for you from olorus he handed me a small silver tube i opened it it held a scrap of papyrus and on it someone had written a verse of sappho i smiled i have a big draft of recruits coming in he said you planning to crew that ephesian ship yourself planning to return him to his true owner i said an old friend of mine but i paid you your half miltiades shook his head i told your father once that you were more like an aristocrat than most men i knew he said you love this man enough to give him a ship i had an idea a mad idea id thought about it since id had diomedes captain under the point of my sword or perhaps since troas told me that i should go back to the plough and find a home i would need miltiades good will though so i shrugged and told the truth always disarming with manipulative men and women i love aristagorass wife i said it was miltiades turn to shrug i know he said ive seen her even pregnant and men tell me things about you too it is her ship i said miltiades nodded he turned to face me and he was a different man he was dealing with me a new way one warlord to another maybe or one adulterer to another if you send her that ship he said her husband will take it and lose it i thought that i might just kill her husband i said and go back to my farm in boeotia i wondered his people would follow you to thule to the hyperboreans miltiades shook his head i hate the bastard too but if he goes down my hand cant be in it and that goes double for my captains i feared you might have some such foolishness in mind i turned away bide your time miltiades said youre young and shes young i assume she loves you too if she didnt aristagoras would hardly hate you the way he does does he i asked hes pretty dickless miltiades chuckled its true his parts must be fairly small but he did try to have you murdered on lesbos the athenian said youll recall that i saw to it he grinned ive been a good friend to you ah the delightful customs of the aristocracy theres no rush miltiades said again listen to me boy i was getting wiser in the ways of men hard men when paramanos brought his daughters aboard i knew he was mine because hed committed his life to the chersonese i liked him but i needed him and yes i would have twisted his arm to keep him the longer i spent with miltiades the more like him i would become that summer i was the highest earner of all miltiades captains briseis gave him a hold on me he knew it and i knew he knew it i wasnt going anywhere he looks like a good ship miltiades said cheerfully crew him up and give him to paramanos he looked at my new acquisition when the time is right when you need help ill see to it you have my aid in getting your girl my word on it now miltiades was as foxy as his red head proclaimed subtle devious and dangerous he lied he stole and he would do anything and i mean anything for power but when he gave his word that was his word he was the very archetype of the kind of greek the persians couldnt understand the kind of man artaphernes detested all talk and no honesty as persians saw it but when he gave his word a thing was done even if im dead i said he took my hand and we shook even if you are dead athena nike goddess of victory and ajax my ancestor hear my oath and that was that i named the new ship briseis and i kept the newly enfranchised rowers crewing the deck and marines from miltiades men including all his former slaves our new recruits came from athens three hundred men i let paramanos pick himself a crew from the best of them miltiades had an arrangement with the city it was a secret or so i reckoned since even herk and cimon were closedmouthed about it but the men who came were thetes lowclass free men of athens and sometimes of athenian allies like plataea or corcyra the cities were rid of their malcontents and we got motivated men ready to fight for a new life miltiades swore them to service he was absolute lord in the chersonese and he didnt play games with democracy like some tyrants and made them citizens he got aristocrats too not many and most of them down on their luck but he bought their loyalty with land and rich prizes and they served him as household officers and marines the positive side to the arrangement was that new men former slaves like idomeneus and lekthes and me were at home in the chersonese the aristocrats needed us and treated us as equals or near enough miltiades informants said that the great king darius was tired of the pirates in the chersonese and intended to send a strong naval expedition against us on the opposite shore of the bosporus artaphernes and his generals hymaees and otanes and dariuss soninlaw daurises campaigned against the carians the first battle was a bloody loss for the men of bronze and they sent to lesbos for help from their supposed confederates the men of aeolis but the new tyrant ignored them they fought a second battle to a bloody draw and though they lost many of their best men they drove the medes from caria for a time we felt like spectators worse we felt like truants or deserters the fighting was so close that we could sometimes see troops moving on the opposite shore i would train my marines with actual sparabara the elite persian infantry visible across the straits by midsummer miltiades could take no more he added another pair of triremes to his fleet purchasing them from athens got another draft of new men to crew them then took us to sea to attack the phoenician squadron that supported dariuss army we had better rowers our ships except mine were lower and faster under oars and we could turn faster miltiades insisted that we were fighting for profit not glory so we were cautious attacking only when we had overwhelming odds seizing a store ship here and a lebanese merchant there by the great feast of heracles i couldnt stand it any more my ship was not suited to these tactics and all my crewmen were grumbling because we were snatching at snacks while the other crews feasted i wonder now if miltiades intended that i should revolt a great many things happened in the space of a few days and the course of events is lost to me now i can only tell this as i remember it i remember sitting in a wine shop on the quay drinking good chian wine with paramanos and stephanos paramanos had his own ship the briseis and he wanted lekthes as his marine captain i shrugged cant you find your own i asked he laughed why not give me all your marines you dont use them any more he chuckled and i frowned it was true my ship was too heavy for the new tactics stephanos shook his head why dont we go after them where no one can run he asked now its worth saying that the phoenician commander baales had a dozen warships at lampasdis down the bosporus towards the troad miltiades had eight ships all smaller we always ran when the warships came out they always ran from us when they were outnumbered it was a hard summer for oarsmen on both sides i fingered my beard and admired my ship i loved to sit and look at him while i had a cup of wine miltiades cant risk it i said we only have to lose once and artaphernes has us he can lose two or three squadrons and he can always force tyre to send more stephanos drank some wine admired the woman serving it and began to dabble in the spilled wine on the table i just keep thinking of the aegyptian raid he said no risk no blood and a crippling blow my eyes met paramanoss over the rims of our wine cups we could catch them on the beach he said i had the same thought in my head they must have lookouts and coastwatchers i said all down the strait every three or four stades we certainly do stephanos said morosely indeed every farmer on our side of the bosporus reported on ship movements we broke up without any decision but we talked about it every time we were together catching baales on the beach his men asleep and some time just after that while i was arguing with paramanos on the beach cimon brought a man up beside me i can make lekthes career paramanos was insisting i knew he was right but lekthes was closer to me than any of my other men except stephanos and idomeneus and i was loath to give him up thugater there is no argument as harsh as one where you know that you are wrong by zeus of the waves you are a thankless bastard i found you a prisoner and ive made you a captain i was spitting mad you made me a captain paramanos grew in size without me youd be at the bottom of the ocean three times over i taught you everything you know theres no debt between us my lords cimon asked he was my own age of impeccable ancestry and had beautiful manners he was already a prominent man not least because he disdained his fathers politics cimon always wanted to fight what he wanted was glory glory for himself and glory for athens on that day he leaned forward holding his staff and the only sign that anything was amiss was the trace of a smile on his lips that suggested we were making a spectacle of ourselves your heart is as black as your skin you fucking ingrate i did say that and which of us is a former slave i can smell the pig shit on you from here turdflinger paramanos pointed a finger at me you are like all dirtgrubbers you cant stand to see another man succeed you think it makes you fail lekthes deserves cimon stepped between us my lords he said again keep out of it cimon im tired of his poaching my best crewmen i was equally tired of how now that he was an independent captain paramanos was the highest earner it suggested that he was right he had made me and that enraged me some friend youth is wasted on the young i knew he was right about lekthes and i suspected that he was right about how much i owed him arimnestos asked a voice i knew the man standing at cimons side was dressed like a peasant in a dirty hide apron over a stained chiton with a dogshead cap on blond curls the name was said so softly that i wasnt sure i had heard right and i turned my tirade draining out of me arimnestos he asked again and his voice was stronger happier hermogenes it took me a moment i hadnt seen him for eight years he was a man not a boy he had a bad scar on his face a cut that went from the top of his scalp to the top of his nose he grinned as if hed just won the olympian games arimnestos we fell into each others arms such was my happiness the instant lifeaffirming happiness of rediscovering a friend from home that i burbled the story of my life in a hundred heartbeats leaving out everything that mattered and then turned to paramanos im a fucking idiot i said lekthes needs to go and be an officer and i do owe you my life that shut him up ha what a tactic capitulate utterly leaves your opponent with nothing to say he sputtered and then he embraced me we sat in my favourite wine shop hermogenes and me lord cimon miltiades son and herk you never came back hermogenes said he was happy and angry at the same time we waited and waited and you didnt come back to camp and then simonalkes came back and said that you were dead he shrugged i searched the battlefield for your corpse and i couldnt find you i asked everyone even miltiades he knew who you were and he knew where your father had fallen he looked at me youve changed he said accusingly you havent talked to miltiades about any of this i shrugged no i said he doesnt concern himself with petty things petty hermogenes asked petty arimnestos your cousin simonalkes has married your mother and taken your farm is that nothing to you he drank down his wine my father sent me i dont know three years back sent me to athens to find miltiades and you if your shade was still in your body simonalkes always said that you were dead killed in the last rush of the eretrians but there was no body he looked at me what happened i felt a rush of memory it wasnt that i had hidden the memories it was only that i hadnt thought about them i hope that makes sense honey young people live in the moment i had lived in the moment for eight years hidden if you like men in stories rush home to avenge their fathers i had been a slave i didnt want to go home sometimes in the silence of my slave cubicle at hipponaxs house or on my bed in lord achilles palace i would think of home sometimes i would dream of ravens flying west or i would see a raven and i would think of home always a home with pater and my brother as if they were alive but they werent alive they were dead and i knew as soon as i let myself think about it that simonalkes had killed my father i could see him turning away from the fighting line the fucking coward his sword red at the tip and pater falling stabbed from behind it is like the difference between hearing that your woman is sleeping with your friend and finding them together in your bed hermogenes was there it was time to face the facts i was sold into slavery i said slowly i was at ephesus as a slave for years hermogenes pursed his lips and fingered the scar on his forehead that would have been hard for you i think he said there spoke a man who had been a slave it was hardest at first i said and i told him about the slave pens more than ive told you actually he was born a slave and in our family he was never sold nor bought that was terrible he said zeus soter i never had to do any of that pater did though hes told me the story a dozen times how he was taken how he struggled and failed to escape and how your father bought him hermogenes shrugged simonalkes tried to reenslave us but old epictetus stuck up for us thanks to him pater is a citizen now and youve been looking for me for three years i asked he shrugged on and off friend i had to eat what did you do i asked he looked at the wine shop table things he said a little carpentry some gardening he took a sip of wine some theft by the father of the gods i said how did you come here he flexed his shoulders and rubbed his scar again an athenian magistrate gave me the choice come here or have an ear cut off he smiled not a hard choice and then when i was waiting in a warehouse with a bunch of other lowlifes i heard a man mention your name he said wed be fighting under miltiades of athens and cimon and arimnestos doru when i got here cimon took me for his crew he said that you were a plataean it seemed too much to hope but here we are cimon shook his head what a tale he looked at me i take it this man is your friend as he claimed to me i nodded absolutely cimon smiled i shouldnt give him to you for the things you shouted at paramanos i hung my head i was in the wrong i said cimon shrugged you know what i like about you arimnestos that you can say it just like that i was in the wrong he nodded have your friend and may your friendship always be blessed you owe me an oarsman ill see to it you get the best i have i said having hermogenes sitting by my side was like a drink of clean water on a hot day for all that his news disturbed me i dont need your best he may be your friend but hes a scrawny sewer rat send me another and were quits cimon rose his eyes grew serious this man simonalkes really murdered your father doru i nodded cimon made a face you have to do something about that dont you he shrugged some day some bastard probably an outraged husband will kill pater and then ill have to kill him or the furies will haunt me suddenly with the clarity of longdelayed realization i understood the raven dreams yes i said cimon nodded pater will have a fit if you leave before the sailing season ends he said he raised an eyebrow and left us alone the next day i took hermogenes for a sail with paramanos stephanos lekthes and idomeneus hermogenes already looked better cleaner wearing a new chiton and new sandals id armed him and put silver in his purse he was two fingers breadths taller when he was clean and dressed i hadnt had a hypaspist since idomeneus rose to warrior status and hermogenes took the job immediately it made him laugh to dress so well it was days before he stopped hiking his chiton to look at the purple stripe paramanos wasnt even angry he just shrugged angry men talk shit he said with a smile i dont need a picnic on the sand to make it better youll want to be at this picnic i said we had a fishing smack a light craft lovingly built with a single mast we took turns sailing it racing along the bosporus in a way that real fisherman would never risk their rigging or their boat hermogenes looked anxious and stephanos shook his head at what he a lifelong fisherman saw as recklessness we sailed down the bosporus for twenty stades and put in at a gravel beach well south of kallipolis with an old shrine to a hero long forgotten i sacrificed there sometimes so i went ashore first and hermogenes and i sacrificed a lamb in thanksgiving and then we all had potted hare and chicken and lamb and lots of wine after we ate paramanos sat back poured a libation and we all shared a cup then he rose well he said is this all by way of apology or because youve rediscovered your friend i shook my head no i know how to come at baales squadron paramanos nodded i thought as much so tell instead of telling i pointed at the upturned hull of our smack paramanos shook his head brilliant he said he shook his head why didnt i think of it that was that and it was that week or the next week that an ambassador came to us from the carians begging us to help them i was invited to hear him and paramanos came with me we lay on couches with miltiades and his sons agios and heraklides and the other captains and the carians asked us to help them with the persians anywhere we go baales can drop troops behind us on the coast the lead carian insisted you have a great reputation as a lover of freedom men say you were the architect of the great victory at amathus cant you defeat baales miltiades shook his head no he said and i no longer serve the ionians he shrugged im a pirate not a liberator callicrates the leader of the embassy shook his head we thought you might say such a thing he handed over a goldcapped ivory scroll tube the kind that the great king used we captured this miltiades took it and unrolled the scroll he read it by the light of the window and then handed it to cimon cimon read it with heraklides and then herk brought it to me and paramanos and i read it together it was a set of orders the orders were to baales and his subordinates they were ordered to raise twenty more ships and take kallipolis and our other ports and also the thracian coast including aristagorass town the new ships are almost ready callicrates said miltiades looked angry why dont i know any of this there have been rumours cimon said his brothers nodded plenty of time to run for athens miltiades said bitterly i cant fight thirty ships i looked at paramanos my lord if i may i have a way you can knock baales out of the campaign for this year at least very little risk at least for you miltiades was leaning on his hands staring out of the window he turned really he asked his voice said that he didnt expect much like most arrogant men miltiades assumed hed thought of everything in short my lord i propose that we catch baales at dawn and take or burn his ships while they are beached i sat up on my couch no miltiades sounded like a bored schoolteacher talking to stupid children his coastwatchers will see us coming i smiled fishing boats i said the story of the boat raid has been told so often that i wont bore you with it every fisherman in these waters can tell you how we borrowed their boats sailed down on the outflow from the euxine as the fishing fleet does every evening in summer and caught baales on the beach at moonrise it was slaughter we had just two hundred men all fighters the pick of miltiades men the only hard part was the last ten stades when we could see their hulls black in the moonlight and we could see their fires and for all we knew they were lining the beach ready for us they were not someone gave the alarm when we were a stade out but they never got formed we raced the last stade rowing our open boats as if they were triremes my boat went a mans length up the gravel beach when it hit and i was over the side almost dryshod with stephanos on one side of me and hermogenes on the other paramanos had one half of the men their mission was to secure our retreat by taking the likeliest of the enemy triremes and getting it afloat my men were to set fire to the rest of the ships and kill as many oarsmen as we could those ships burned like torches we had fire pots rigged on poles heavy crockery filled with coals and we smashed them inside the enemy hulls as we went two pots per hull they were afire before the enemy recovered and we were armoured men formed at the edge of the firelight against the desperation of an unarmed rabble the sad truth is we burned too many we could have taken more our two hundred men broke the phoenicians most men fight badly when surprised and they were no different baales died in the first attack although we didnt know it i hardly fought i was too busy giving orders by athena nike we drove them where they were brave we killed them and where they ran we reaped them hah that was a victory when it became clear that we were masters of the field we managed to beat out the fires in one of the smallest of the enemy ships still on the beach and we turned it over in the water doused the embers and got it afloat too so we managed to capture two of their dozen hulls while the rest burned to their keels and we got away with ten dead and as many wounded only ares knows how many of their oarsmen and marines we left face down on the sand we rowed tired but happy back up the bosporus towing the fishing boats in long lines behind us it sounds wonderful that way doesnt it thats the way a proper singer tells a battle without mentioning that the ten dead men were dead and their children were fatherless their mothers widows their lives over perhaps for ever because miltiades chose to remain master of the chersonese eh and another thing though it shames me to tell it i dont always remember mens names the men who fell there on the beach making my reputation and saving miltiades i cant remember them the sad truth honey is that some time that summer i stopped learning their names they died in raids in little ship fights and of fevers men died every week they came out from athens lowerclass men with nothing to lose and most of them brought their deaths with them some were too weak some never learned to handle their weapons we were pirates thugater i can coat it in a glaze of honey set it in epic verse but we were hard men who lived a hard life and it wasnt worth my time to learn the new mens names until theyd survived for a while dont mind me i philosophize at any rate the next morning the carians ambushed daurises columns as he tried to push into the mountains west of the temple of zeus of the army at labraunda in caria and destroyed them killing daurises and quite a number of persians the first real victory of the whole war the news went through the ionians like a bolt from zeus and sacrifices appeared on ares altars from miletus to crete i didnt know it at the time but pharnakes who had been my friend and with whom i had twice crossed swords died at labraunda in the ambush in the aftermath of these two small victories we heard that darius had lost all patience with the revolt and with greeks in general he ordered his satraps to prepare a major armament for the reduction of the chersonese and he bragged that he would see athens destroyed that didnt please the democrats in athens who were aware that miltiades was responsible for dariuss anger but thats not part of my story just a comment as summer gave way to autumn miltiades received word from various sources about dariuss preparations he had ordered fifty ships to be levied from the syrian towns and the satrap of phrygia was to aid artaphernes in raising an army to destroy caria and retake aeolis we lay back on our couches and laughed because that would all happen next summer there was only six weeks left in the sailing season miltiades toasted me in good chian wine one stroke he said and i am once again master in my own house you are dear to me plataean i frowned next summer darius will come with a vast army miltiades would not be sober for all your heroism he said you have a great deal to learn about fighting the medes he looked at cimon cimon laughed and spoke up other provinces will revolt this winter he said miltiades nodded you think we hit naucratis for pure profit he asked me i could see paramanos grinning i had thought we went there for pure profit yes i said miltiades nodded not to be spurned profits but when we took their ships we showed the greek merchants and the aegyptian priests that their persian overlords couldnt defend them and when it appears that we are winning they will evict their garrisons as they did in my fathers time and darius will have to bend all his will to aegypt and then we will have lovely times he laughed the whole greek world was speaking of our coup on the beach south of kallipolis and miltiades name was on every mans lips in athens and all was right in the world it was a good dream but we had underestimated darius and we had forgotten those twenty ships that were on their way to reinforce baales that night i asked miltiades for permission to go home once the sailing season ended miltiades heard me out and nodded he was a good overlord and he had a reputation to protect besides i had just put new laurels on his brow go with hermes lad in fact ill see to it that herk or paramanos runs you home take a couple of men youll want to kill the bastard and not take any crap from neighbours he nodded anything you need you ask its as much my fault as anyones i knew something was wrong i didnt give it enough thought when your father died i mean he shrugged i knew what he meant when the plataeans helped athens defeat the eretrians miltiades was done with that part of his busy plotting and he let his tools drop that was the sort of man he was but he was also enough of a gentleman to regret that he had allowed the tools to become damaged when he dropped them i spent the next few weeks making arrangements for my absence i didnt tell miltiades but i wasnt sure that i would return i gave herakleides one command and stephanos the other herakleides and his brothers were trusted men by then and they showed no signs of running back to aeolis both nestor and orestes were promising helmsmen and they had the birth and military training to carry rank stephanos did not he wasnt an aristocrat and he didnt have all the command skills that i had learned nor the enormous heroic and largely unearned reputation that i had acquired which grew with every day and vastly exceeded the reality of my accomplishments even though i was in love with it reputation alone is enough to carry most men but stephanos was a fine seaman and a careful considerate officer hed led the marines for a year and they worshipped him i thought that he was ready idomeneus informed me that he was coming with me so was hermogenes you think i came all the way out here just to grab a pot of persian silver hermogenes asked pater sent me to find you so that you could restore order simonalkes is a bad farmer and a fool but when hes dead it will take time to rebuild i found it comic that hermogenes had spent three years looking for me so that he could get the farm in order paramanos offered to take me home all the way to corinth if i wanted but i had other plans plans id worked at for a long time miltiades supported me as i moved captains so paramanos moved from briseis to the newly rebuilt ember the ship wed taken still smoking from our attempt to burn her during the boat raid the smaller ship wed taken was ravens wing and stephanos had her and herakleides took command of briseis i had briseis stowed for a long voyage and i gave him his own two brothers as officers nestor as the oar master and orestes as the captain of marines i spent money like water i had plenty and the rowers in that ship still owed me three months of service before wages were due i intended to sail that ship into aristagorass town at myrcinus in thrace and take briseis or give her the ship and go horseback overland it was a foolish plan a boys plan but without it the next weeks would have been worse it is a fine example of fate and how the gods work had i left all to chance i would have died and many others with me but i planned carefully my plans all failed of course but among the shards of my broken plans lay the makings of an escape the first rain of autumn came and went and my intentions were set i sent briseis a message via the thracian king asking her to be ready miltiades cautioned me again directly against killing aristagoras i dont remember what i told him perhaps i lied outright i thought myself tremendously clever so did miltiades the hubris flowed thick and fast that autumn the grain was sheaved in the fields along the bosporus the peasants had their harvest festivals and the sun shone in an autumn that seemed more like summer when hymaees descended on the troad with thirty ships and a thousand marines the first we knew of his arrival was that our southernmost town was burned and all the inhabitants sold into slavery and the refugees poured up the one bad road with tales of war and slaughter the next day we heard that hymaees himself was in caria with twenty thousand men and the carians were unable to make a stand just like that the northern arm of the revolt was going down the carians didnt give in without a battle but we were too busy to help them miltiades ordered all the ships manned we worked night and day to refurbish the two triremes taken in the night attack and with them we had ten hulls on the first day of the new month miltiades led us to sea down the bosporus past the still smoking ruins of our town he had no choice if we didnt fight hymaees would plug the bosporus like a cork in a bottle and take us one town at a time and no one would come to our aid thats the price of being a pirate we sailed down the bosporus in early morning and the phoenicians got their hulls in the water then they did the oddest thing they formed a defensive circle they outnumbered us but they pulled all their sterns together pulled in their oars like a seabird tucking in its wings and waited for us i had never seen anything like it but miltiades had he spat in the sea and leaped from his ship on to my storm cutter bastards he said all they have to do is not lose he shook his head i nodded say the word lord say the word and ill go at them miltiades slapped my armoured shoulder ill miss you when you leave me arimnestos but theres no point he went back to his own ship and we spent a fruitless day circling them twice paramanos tried to lure one of them into an attack by passing so close that his oar tips almost brushed their beaks but they werent coming out we camped close to them just four stades up the coast and the next morning we went for them in the dawn by ship but they were awake and ready we threw javelins and they shot bows and i went ashore in the surf and cleared a space on the beach killing two men in the surf but miltiades ordered me back to my boat i took a pair of prisoners phoenicians of course and i gave them to paramanos i still think miltiades was wrong we had the moral advantage those syrians were afraid of us if wed landed but he was the warlord and he saw it differently that night paramanos called us all together there are ships missing he said the two boys that arimnestos captured say that eight ships went north last week miltiades was incredulous eight more ships he asked where bound i asked paramanos looked at me myrcinus in thrace he said they went to get aristagoras i walked away calling for my officers miltiades chased me down you are not going he said i ignored him this is my fleet he said i own two ships i said perhaps three i owe you nothing lord i was leaving anyway and i am going to myrcinus he seemed to swell and in the torchlight his hair caught fire he was like a titan come to life larger than a mere man i give the orders here he said not to me i said i have your word that took him aback and he changed tack theres nothing you can do lad he said his voice suddenly pleading he was a good rhetorician the town will already be on fire you dont know that it rained two days last week if the storm caught them on the coast they would have lost days give it up he said i walked away my men my trusted men lekthes and idomeneus and stephanos herakleides and nestor and orestes and hermogenes got the rowers together and started loading storm cutter and briseis and ravens wing but heraklides always the voice of reason came up to me out of the dark and wouldnt let me act in anger miltiades has been a good lord to you and you owe him better than this he said and he was right although at the time i growled at him herk fed me a cup of wine his arm around my shoulders my men were standing around waiting for my word and there was some pushing and shoving at the edges between them and miltiades men this wont end well herk insisted listen to me boy i knew you when you were a new free man a pais youre a big man now a captain lord of five hundred rowers and marines every merchant in the aegean pisses himself when your name is said aloud but you are nothing without a base and a lord and if we squabble with miltiades who will fight the medes i am not nothing i said but i knew that he was right i couldnt keep a crew together by myself unless i wanted to engage in pure piracy bloody murder for profit and i did not heraclitus was too strong in me even then in fact what i liked least about miltiades was his ceaseless search for profit i remember sitting there on a damp rock just above the tide line my feet in the seawrack when i heard a raven not a gull but a raven cawing in the dark like lord apollos voice speaking i held up a hand to silence herk and i listened and then i got to my feet and walked off down the beach to where paramanos and miltiades were arguing herk followed at my heels clearly afraid i was about to open the breach but i was not the god had given me the answer and i thrust between paramanos and miltiades and shouted for them to listen their faces were backlit by the big fires we had burning at the sentry posts we didnt want the syrians to surprise us either we should all go i said that silenced them i almost remember what i said i felt as if lord apollo stood at my side whispering fine words good arguments into my ear or perhaps heraclitus his servant listen lord you think i am blinded by love perhaps i am but if the mede is foolish enough to send eight ships away we can catch them and destroy them and then the balance is ours it might make him hesitate it will increase our power over the phoenicians i paused if we take those ships honeyed words homer calls them no sooner were they out of my mouth than paramanos was agreeing sometimes there is a right answer an answer that suits every man it took us less time than it takes to heat a beaker of wine to convince our lord that we had a winning strategy and then he grinned drank wine and clasped my hand and we were friends again instead of rival pirates we left in complete darkness that was the campaign where i learned the value of having all my men in high training the value of making my rowers feel as elite as the hoplites felt we left that beach like champions we left our fires burning to deceive the enemy and we raced north under oars and every man felt as if he was swept along on nikes wings we came on myrcinus as the sun set on the third day the lower town was afire and the syrian ships were drawn up on the rocky beach south of the town miltiades summoned me aboard his ship and i leaped from my helmsmans rail to paramanoss and then on to the ajax the blackhulled athenian trireme that was miltiades pride cimon and herk were already there we never slowed we were under sail the wind under our sterns and our sails must have looked like flowers of fire in the ruddy light miltiades face was lit as if from within he was a foot taller than a mortal man his hair glowed in the sunset as if he was an immortal and his words flowed thick and fast beach your ships as you find room he said get ashore get their ships and sweep the beach clean paramanos you and arimnestos land your full compliment every man on the beach form tight and get between us and the town he grinned once we own those hulls this campaign is over their commander is a fool or it is a trap his younger son said he shrugged cimon the older son shook his head dont be a stubborn ass little brother theres no trap because they shouldnt know we could even be here miltiades nodded his approval of his older sons thinking even if it is a trap he said theres not much they can do to us if we keep our ships manned and only land our marines you two can cover us on the beach if we have to run your crews are fast he laughed oh i can feel the power of the gods companions we are about to burn the great kings beard we were five stades off the beach when i leaped back to paramanoss ship the medes and the syrians could see us coming and men were running down from the burning town to form on the beach most of them were greeks i could see from their arms in the centre was a knot of persians but their line wasnt long enough to cover the whole length of the beach even two deep but there were other men thracians some of them came down from the town in clumps like thick honey dripping from the comb others hung back the enemy commander had hired thracians it probably wasnt hard because from all we heard the locals detested aristagoras as much as we did i had never faced them but i heard that they were titans big tough men with no fear of death i always doubted such tales but the men i could see in the red light of sunset had tattoos like black slashes on their faces and around their arms and they held heavy swords and long spears im going for the town as soon as we break their line i said to paramanos i know that you dont have to follow me i looked at him he shrugged no he said i dont he pointed at the thracians there were more of them every heartbeat you think we can break that we were three stades out from the beach i got up on the rail where it rose to protect the helmsman and balanced there waiting for the rise of the wave watch me i boasted and jumped i landed on my own deck bow first i said marines aft empty the first ten benches forward and send all those men aft i waved at my deck master sails down then masts the other ships were starting to turn because they intended to beach stern first a necessary precaution to prevent their rambows from digging so deep into the sand and gravel that the ship was damaged or worse could never be brought off i caught a stay and swung up on the rail stephanos i called he was behind me in line in the smaller ravens wing i had to wait while he came forward precious time while my bow rowers ran back dragging their cushions unsure what they were supposed to do while the deck crew swarmed over the masts caught in the midst of arming and the marines clustered by the helmsmans bench hermogenes was in full armour and idomeneus looked like a hero in a solid bronze thorax with silver work and a fine helmet with a towering crest shaped like a heron my lord stephanos called back into the port i said land your full crew and take the thracians from behind see indeed the little port itself was covered by a mole there were two ships moored to the mole and no defenders because the lower town had been lost so there was no longer any point in holding the harbour before the lower walls fell there had no doubt been a garrison on the mole i had seen this and miltiades had not if ravens wing could get into the harbour her marines would be behind the enemy line stephanos turned away already calling orders and his ship turned went to ramming speed and sprinted for the mole on me i shouted and ran forward as far as the amidships command station at the foot of the mast get that mast down i called to the deck crew who looked like hoplites pirates are always betterarmed than other men with the pick of many dead mens gear to plunder and i dare say that my sailors had better armour than the front rank of many a city the deck crew let the mast down on to the central gangplank with all the marines and thirty rowers to speed things along we passed the other ships who were all still turning or backing ashore the smaller ember was already halfway around i had just time to line up the marines and sailors and rowers behind me they filled the central catwalk all the way aft to the helmsman and filled the small deck around him pushing the stern down in the water and raising the bronzetipped bow the weight of the mast and the sail helped too i pushed the men farther back and again pushing against them with my shield to pack them tight in the stern when we beach i roared every man follow me we will form under the bow and cut our way up the beach our war cry is heracles i looked aft and raised my spear and my voice filled my chest like the sound of a god are you ready i shouted and the oar master shouted oars in brace and we struck our bow went right up the beach i was too far aft to see it but im told that our ram actually broke their line scattering men to the right and left follow me i called and raced forward between the oar benches along the catwalk over the bow and i jumped without breaking stride into a clump of ionian greeks still shocked by the arrival of the ship they had no order and i got my feet under me and my spear licked out and ripped the back of a mans knee behind his greave blood spurted red as red in the dying sunlight and then i looked at a second man my eyes locking with his under the bronze brows of our helmets and my spear shot out and caught another man oldest trick in the world caught him between his thorax and his helmet ripping up his chest and plunging deep into his neck stealing his life he fell off the spear point and i reversed my spear thrusting underarm with the buttspike i thrust deliberately into the aspis of a fourth man he was trying to retreat under my feet the sand thumped as other men came off the storm cutters bow i knew that in a fight like that i had to attack attack and keep attacking until my arm failed me because as soon as they recovered from the shock theyd turn back into warriors and kill me my buttspike stuck in the bronze face of his shield i ripped it out and thrust again knocking him back and off balance by attacking his shield i could feel idomeneus behind me so i pushed forward thrust into my opponents shield and when the tip stuck i used it as a lever and prised his aspis to the right idomeneus killed him with a quick thrust over my shoulder all my marines were on the beach and my deck crew was pouring in behind them the shield wall forming hardening the way bronze hardens when you pour the molten stuff on a slate floor to make a sheet and even as the wall solidified we pressed forward up the beach the ionian greeks i had been fighting were in flight and i risked a look pushed my helmet back on my brow and looked left and right to the left the town burned throwing an evil light on the beach on the road from the town were two hundred or more thracians their leader was inciting them to deeds of valour or simply promising them loot i didnt understand a word of his language but i knew what that body language and those gestures meant the other ships were landing briseis was stern to stern with my storm cutter and herakleides was sending his marines right down storm cutter over the bow and onto the beach leading his men himself oh i loved him like a brother that hour to my right the big knot of persians and phoenician marines was wheeling towards me intent on pushing me off the beach before the other ships were ashore my men were like the runners in the fight at the pass we were drawing all the enemy to us while the other ships got their marines ashore i knew the game i roared defiance at them i was ares i raised my spear over my head and told them they were all dead men in persian i had no intention of awaiting the onset of the enemy if i waited the persians and the thracians would hit me together and each of them outnumbered me on the other hand my rowers were coming over the sides now and every breath put three more men in the rear ranks the persians i shouted and i ran forward a few paces and held my spear parallel to the enemy line on me wed been together all summer my crew knew what i wanted and they were beside me in three long breaths more than a hundred men a ships length to my right i saw herakleides black horsetail and i knew his big aspis was locked into the line heracles i roared heracles came the response like the thousandfold voice of the god and we were off up the beach the phoenicians had no bows and the handful of persian officers got off one volley i know that i got an arrow in my shield and then we were into them that was hard fighting no quarter given and the sun was set low enough that skill was replaced by luck twice i caught heavy blows on my sword arm one bent my vambrace without cutting through into my arm and a second blow was the flat of an axe and not the blade thank the gods or my life would have spurted out of my arm even so i dropped my spear and idomeneus stepped past me while i fell on my knees a blow that hard unmans you i thought i was finished for a long heartbeat then my eyes told me that my sword hand was intact my arm ached but was not broken and again the vambrace had held and saved my life but while i was on my knees a mede in a gold helmet and bronze aventail cut at my head with his short akinakes his blow landed and my ears rang but hermogenes stood by me and he made clumsy parries with his spear over my shoulder when you are in a real fight your world is a tunnel formed by the walls of your helmet and the width of the eye slits i had no idea whether we were winning or losing but even with my ears ringing and my arm afire i knew that having their heroic captain on his knees in the sand was not going to help my men win their way up the beach i exploded to my feet pushing with my boeotian shield just as hermogenes blocked another cut i got the bronze spine in the persians face trapped his sword arm high dug my feet in the sand and pushed he landed another blow but it sheered my horsehair crest without connecting with my head and i shook it off and pushed again he tripped and fell i punched him with the rim of my shield the rim an extension of my fist a boeotian shield lacks the weight and authority of an aspis but the rim is a weapon in a way that an aspiss rim can never be i broke his nose with my first lefthanded blow broke his sword arm with the second and crushed his throat with the third as he tried to cover himself with his arms i had time to flex my numb hand once and then i drew my sword from under my arm fumbled it and dropped it i remember looking at it lying in the sand and thinking now im a dead man but the phoenician marines gave ground backed away from us ten paces and rallied they were magnificent fighters those men they didnt lose heart just backed off to give the thracians time to take us in the flank but their retreat showed them that all their officers were down and that rattled them i could see it in the movement of their shields in the fiery light idomeneus was ahead of me lithe limbs flashing he harried their retreat and the best of my marines followed him so that our taxis lost cohesion the better men were willing to keep fighting the others hung back pleased to have beaten the phoenicians and the medes and wanting a rest from terror thats how it always is thracians one of my rowers shouted just before he leaped from the ships rail into the surf and ran to join us the thracians were still hesitating and their hesitation had already cost them the battle but they might still wreck my men with their charge i could hear miltiades calling his battle cry ajax to my right and i knew that the rest of our men would be coming ashore now and in the time it took to beach a ship the fight would be over but there was plenty of time for things to go wrong i had to go forward stephanos is behind the thracians i shouted follow me i stooped and picked up my sword just about i remember well how little grip i had but a greek cannot lead from the second rank no one would follow such a warrior so i pushed forward and bellowed heracles like an angry bull trying to get the daimon of combat to fill me and carry me up the beach idomeneus was on his knees when i came up using his big shield to cover his body against two phoenician marines with axes i ran full tilt over one man and his axe bit through my shield the bronze plate over my left arm turned the blade and i hacked at him with my nerveless sword hand like any green ephebe who doesnt know how to hold a sword sometimes as heraclitus says when skill fails passion must suffice hermogenes took the second man the man with the axe swung and for a long heartbeat i thought he was gone but the shaft not the blade bit into his shield hermogenes had an aspis and the tough face turned the shaft with a hollow boom and hermogenes was on the man stabbing wildly with his spear what he lacked in accuracy he made up in ferocity now that we had cleared the ground around idomeneus struggled to his feet we shamed the rest of our line forward the phoenicians might have rallied then but they didnt they hesitated for a moment they were brave men and they knew what the loss of their ships would mean but they decided that retreat was the wiser option and they went up the beach still cohesive enough to drag their wounded and one of their leaders with them the sun had set and the only light was the red autumn sky and the fires of the town the thracians still outnumbered us but they were retreating flowing up the hillside like a herd of deer and stephanos was harrying them from the left his best runners trying to outrun the thracians to the crest of the long hill above the town i flexed my hand some feeling was returning at that point aristagoras elected to bring his men out of the citadel in a sortie it was typical of the bastard too late to help win the victory too soon to come out in safety his sortie caught the thracians in the flank though and suddenly they had to turn or be eaten by the new threat and by stephanoss crew nipping at their heels like a hunting pack i could see it all happening in the red light on the hillside above me it was unreal i have never seen such light again red as blood and i knew that ares himself was watching us that we were on his dance floor and he would judge us i could see the swan on aristagorass helmet and i knew who he was and thanks to the folds in the hill i could see what neither he nor stephanos could see there was another contingent of thracians behind a parallel crest and i was already tired too bad i wanted aristagoras dead and i would never have a better chance than now ive made all this seem to last a long time but in truth miltiades marines were still coming off his stern and some of our ships were just coming ashore it had all happened that fast but if you want to know what fatigue is fight for your life for three or four hundred heartbeats then run up a rocky hillside at dusk with a hundred men baying at your heels my scale shirt felt as if it weighed as much as my body and my helmet sat on my head like the weight of the world on atlass shoulders who am i to complain many of my rearrankers had rowed all day up we went and the thracians stood against us i think they were shocked appalled even that they were being charged they werent men who stood in a line to fight they were wild tribesmen who killed with the ferocity of their charge i think they stood only because they knew that their allies were in position to take us in the flank but my men overlapped their flank so that my own flank files were bound to push right up into their ambush i didnt have to plan it that way there was no other way it could happen the hillside wasnt that wide and its seaside edge was a cliff that rose above the beach paramanoss men were pouring ashore from his ship which was beached beside mine turning his ship hadnt taken long yet in that time my crew had broken the phoenicians killed the ionians and run up the hill and now his men were eager to come up and get their share of the loot thracians were famous for having gold my men slowed as we came up to the thracians i couldnt blame them there is no such thing as a ferocious charge uphill at least not on a hill that steep form tight i called and the men pressed in sorry honey i should explain theres no phalanx in a fight like that no order we didnt form by rank and file on the beach nor yet going up the hill in a fight like that you are a mob but my mob had been together in fifty fights and we didnt need a lot of orders so when i roared get tight all the boys in the front rank crowded in on me and all the rest pushed and we made a shield wall in less time than it takes to tell it the thracians threw spears and javelins with the whole weight of the hill behind them and men fell a spear came right through my torn boeotian and the scale shirt turned the wicked point ares hand had turned death aside again the right end of my line was lapping over their shield wall and then extending further as paramanoss men came up i could hear his voice and his cyrenian greek as he ordered them into line all together i sang my voice held steady and high if you want an order to carry in a storm or on a battlefield you sing my boeotian shield was flapping in pieces i used it to bat another javelin out of the air and the spine snapped shield i roared an oarsman behind me passed his forward and hermogenes held it for me i dropped the useless corpse of a shield off my arm and thrust my left hand into the leather porpax of the cheap aspis and then i was ready all together i called again heracles they called back it wasnt the gods own roar of the first shout but it was sufficient to get us forward and we went up the rocky ground someone started the paean and our voices rose like sacred incense to ares and he must have smiled on us thracians fight with ferocity but they are not competitors in an athletic event the way greek warriors are and they dont practise together dancing the war dances and measuring the swing of their weapons they stand too far apart to have a solid line and their crescentshaped shields are too small to use in a close fight where men to the left and right and men in the rear ranks can all take a thrust at you when your tunnelvision is turned on a single opponent they hit us hard with javelins as we started forward though and men fell gaps were opened in our wall and we werent deep enough for those holes to close naturally so the fight that resulted was sheer deadly chaos and the carnage was grotesque skill in arms counted for little it was too dark but we had the burning town behind us and they were above us and we could see them much better than they could see us and in that fight a minute advantage of vision was sufficient and we sang thats what i remember the red light of the dying sun and the paean of apollo it was no pushover in the first contact men fell like weeds cut by a housewife in the garden i got three men so fast that when my borrowed spear fouled in the third the first still hadnt given up his life and fallen on his face i dropped my spear shaft and pulled my sword again the marines who should have been either side of me were gone and idomeneus was in the front rank and herk of all men his scarlet plume nodding pushed in beside me arent you supposed to be on the beach i asked he laughed fuck that he shouted we all felt the impact as the thracian charge struck paramanoss end of the line the thracian subchief hadnt waited for paramanos to come over the crest at him he must have been wise enough to figure that we knew he was there i didnt see it but ive heard the tale often enough paramanos went down knocked from his feet by a barbarian and lekthes stood over his body until he rose lekthes died there like a hero he took three thrusts but he didnt fall until paramanos was back on his feet i didnt know it but lekthes moment of heroism steadied the whole line paramanoss men turned unwilling to abandon their commander and they stood where they might have broken even then we felt the shock and our line bent back but stephanos was on their other flank with aristagoras and his sally and the fortunes of the thracians began to ebb like the tide from a salt flat when fishermen go into the surf to collect the catch their line disintegrated the way an old linen sail rips when the ropeedge is lashed to the mast and the wind begins to tear at a weakened corner so that each gust rips a little more of the sail and then the sail goes faster and faster the rip wider and the rate of the tear faster with every gust and then with the noise of a thunderclap the whole sail rips out of its harness of rope and flutters away into the storm just like that the thracian line tore asunder towards the end their centre gave way or died i began to kill men with every cut of my arm my hand was growing better as i cut and my opponents eyes were elsewhere looking up the hill and behind them where stephanoss men had climbed the ridge and now came back down on their left flank from above every cut and every thrust took another man down and then none of them would stand against me i killed twenty men i think yet even as they ran they fought thracians are never more dangerous than when they run men will turn and throw spears and they can form again as soon as they think you have lost your order and my rowers had no stomach to follow them nor could i blame them so we pushed left trapping their left wing in a pocket formed of the three forces the sally from the town stephanoss marines and my own left wing my right separated from me going up the hill with paramanos so that herk and idomeneus were the end men of our part of the line i couldnt see whether the thracians were rallying in the trees beyond the crest or not one of their chieftains commanded their left and he must have known that the end was on him a handful of his men threw themselves at us there were three of them and there was still a gap between herk and stephanos as he came down the hill to close the circle but i put my cheap shield into the face of one and knocked him flat and his falling fouled the other two then we put them down in less time than it takes to tell it herk thrusting hard past my shield with his spear and hermogenes giving me a rap on the helmet in his haste to kill the third one over my shoulder it was clear to all that the thracians were going to die the chieftain had a scale shirt a doublebitted hunting axe and a tall helmet of scales crowned with a boars head in gold he was bellowing challenges but neither stephanos nor aristagoras intended that we would fight him man to man and the circle tightened i had other plans i ran at him two paces all the space that the dying melee allowed his axe went up and i gave him the edge of my aspis and he split it gashing my shoulder so that i saw white but i had his axe trapped in my shield and my good sword thrust into his face as if of its own accord i stabbed him twice but i think he was dead after the first and then i was helmet to helmet with aristagoras he was trying to claim my kill and he cut at me probably because his vision was blurred and it was dark or because he knew me and hated me now i keep promising that i will be honest i want to tell you that we duelled at the edge of the dark me the hero and he the villain but in fact i had lost the crest of my helm and had a rowers shield and unless he knew me by my scale shirt he had no idea who i was but by the gods i knew him the last of the thracians were dying noisily and i had him all to myself i was a little above him on the hill and i had my shield fouled by the dead chieftains axe it was split and my shoulder was gushing blood and i couldnt spin fully to face aristagoras so i rotated on my rear foot pulling my left arm clear of the porpax as i spun and taking a second blow from aristagoras on the reinforced shoulder of my scale thorax as i turned so that i just managed to keep my footing aristagoras thrust at me a third time and his blade slid off my scales and down my thighs cutting me but i paid no heed instead i completed my rotation clear at last of the wreck of my shield the gods must have decreed that shields would be my bane that day and i cut at him a long overhand blow that caught him behind the shield because i had spun so fast i sheared through his swan and my blade rang on his helmet i powered my right foot forward and lifted my blade with my right arm catching it under the rim of the cheekpiece of his helmet and cutting into his throat an ugly blow no skill to it but i had my blade inside his shield and i wasnt going to let him go i saw his eyes then and he knew he was a dead man he would have run but id cut the artery in the neck he wasnt dead but he let his limbs go loose a final cowardice he might have cut me one more time but he gave up i like to think he knew it was me but i dont know that for certain my sword glanced off his neck guard where the yoke of his corslet rose to cover his back and i lifted it high in the harmodius blow an overhand back cut with the legs reversed and the whole weight of a mans body and hips behind it and i cut his head right off his body no easy feat with a short sword try it the next time you sacrifice a calf the stump of his neck jetted blood like a newborn volcano and he fell i wont lie it was a sweet moment herk caught my wounded left shoulder and the pain brought me to my senses well done lad he said now get out of here before one of his men fingers you for it the fighting was fading away it was the ugly part of a fight when the brave men find how bad their wounds are and the cowards push forward and bloody their weapons on dead and wounded men as if anyone can be fooled by such stuff i had a dozen cuts and my arms were both hurt hermogenes had to prise the vambrace off my arm it was twisted the cut that had numbed my arm had deformed the surface and he had to deform the metal to get it off me putting the flat of his eating knife against my skin and using it like a crowbar but my right hand and arm felt better immediately my left arm wasnt so easily fixed i had four different cuts and hermogenes pulled his old chiton out of his pack ripped it in four pieces and used one of them to wrap my arm this is no life for a man he said out of nowhere your friend lekthes is dead that was the first id heard although ive already told you the manner of his passing idomeneus had as many cuts as i had and a deep gash on the outside of his thigh that wrapped around his hip and on to his buttock you could see white at the bottom of the wound where the deep fat was thats not good idomeneus said looking at his hip and fainted hermogenes shook his head this is no life for a man he repeated look at yourselves and this for gold who needs fucking gold he laid out his leather bag lit a lamp he was a monster of efficiency our hermogenes even then and wrapped idomeneus even stitching his arse which woke the poor bastard he woke with a scream but by then herakleides and nestor had his arms and he fainted again herk came back with agios and a wineskin attracted by the lamp there was no breeze and the wounded were calling for water and the night things were coming he handed me a cup of wine but hermogenes intercepted it and drank it fair enough he was the one doing all the work still thracians in the town herk said miltiades is anxious to get off paramanos came up with stephanos paramanos had a bandage around his head and he sighed and pushed the wineskin away one drink and ill be out he said i owe lekthes widow he said he traded his life for mine he was a good man i said the wine cup had come to me and i poured a libation to his shade apollo light him to elysium aye he went down like achilles herk said i handed the cup back to hermogenes im going for the town i said stephanos stepped forward and i shook my head you gather up the wounded i said to him make sure men go aboard the right ships herakleides ill bring briseis to her namesake be ready i embraced them all one by one i dont know if ill be back i said they all embraced me again and then i headed downhill to the sally port from which aristagoras had come paramanos came with me when i turned to look at him in the moonlight his eyes sparkled you need a keeper he said a party of aristagorass men was carrying his body through the gate a young man had his shield over his shoulder we followed them if there were thracians we didnt see them although we could hear screams and occasional sounds of fighting from lower in the town we followed the body up two narrow alleys and a long staircase set into an outer wall and then we were at a torchlit gate it was a small place compared with kallipolis there were two sentries and they were too young and raw to have gone with the sortie i dont know what i expected honey i think that i thought that she would throw herself into my arms and weep it wasnt that way at all of course the hall was small and she was waiting to receive the body her handmaidens were around her and they took his body the man id beheaded an hour before and they washed it she caught my eye and started she raised an eyebrow that was all the greeting i got and then went back to her task her role like a priestess she had her part to play and she played it well an old woman sewed the head back on while that happened i stepped up next to briseis she bowed lord arimnestos she said we are honoured she bowed to me imagine briseis the untouchable bowing to doru the slave it was all like a dream i am a poor hostess she said and led the way out of the hall on to a balcony over the sea i still expected an embrace i killed him i said quietly and i think i smiled she nodded i know that she said and i thank you now go you should not be here but i couldnt believe it she was pregnant again i could tell about three months but her beauty was unchanged and her power over me but i came to rescue you such things once said sound very weak indeed why do you think i need rescuing she asked then she laughed she stood on tiptoe and kissed me he tongue darted in and out of my mouth and then she stepped back and licked her lips blood in your mouth and all over you she said and she smiled achilles now be gone before people talk im a widow and my reputation will matter i dont care i said im your next husband then she looked hurt not proud and not angry and not sad but as if some deep pain had touched her she reached out and touched my bloody right hand no my love she said i will not marry you she shook her head i have children to protect beautiful children and where would we go i felt as if the persians axe had got me i want to take you home i said to ephesus she asked to plataea i said to my farm she smiled then and i knew that my dreams were foolish the gods must have laughed at me all autumn listen my love she said gently i am not called helen by other men for nothing it is not my fate to be a farmwife in boeotia wherever that may be her smile became bitter the bitterness of selfknowledge that is not my fate nor would i want it i will be the lady of a great lord her hand remained on mine i love you but you are a killer a pirate a thief of lives you seem to need me from time to time i said and my bitterness was too close to the surface she looked past me into the room where her husbands body was being washed she had things that she needed to be doing she said with her eyes be glorious so that i may hear of you often achilles she said softly come with me i pleaded she shook her head well i had my pride too and that was my foolishness when archi walked away from me i should have wrestled him to the ground and when briseis chose another life i should have put her over my shoulder and taken her wed both have been happier but i was proud in the harbour there will be a ship in ten days i said unless poseidon takes him his name is your name and he is your ship i took him from diomedes of ephesus the rowers are yours until the end of autumn then she threw her arms around my neck oh thank you she said now i am truly free i turned to leave but then it struck me you will marry miltiades i said and there was death in my tone her lip curled in disgust you are worth ten of him she said and if it were my fate to be a pirate queen i would be yours who then i asked i could protect your children and make them tyrants of miletus she asked lords of ephesus she came and put her arms around my neck and i had no hatred for her in my body go let me hear of you in songs of praise and perhaps we will meet again we kissed it cannot have helped her reputation much since every woman in that hall could see us but it did me a world of good that kiss had to hold me for many years part vi justice citizens must fight to defend the law as if fighting to hold the city wall heraclitus fr for gods on the one hand all things are beautiful good and just but men on the other suppose some things to be just and others to be unjust heraclitus fr i had almost recovered from my wounds when i stepped wearily off my own gangplank like an old man and limped up the beach at piraeus the red wounds were closed and the bruises had faded but the black hole where my guts had been was never going to close herakleides landed me from briseis and he embraced me like a brother to be honest id never really forgiven him for selling the information of the value of our ransoms to miltiades but in his way hed done me a favour showing me who i worked for and what a life id come to so when i limped down the plank i turned and took his hand take this ship back to its owner and shell keep you as captain i said you are too good a man to spend your life as a pirate and die face down on the sand and youre not good enough with the bronze and iron to stay alive do you hear me friend he nodded take this ship to briseis and were quits you and me no blood price over a certain matter back on lesbos fail to deliver and ill find you am i clear behind me hermogenes and idomeneus and a pair of thracian slaves men id taken as part of the booty were carrying my goods down off the ship aye lord he said i swear it by all the gods and may the furies track me down and rip my guts from me stop i said youre hurting me and never ever swear by the furies and so it was done i embraced him and he sailed away idomeneus and i watched that ship until it vanished around the great promontory he had tears in his eyes i laughed bitterly i didnt ask you to come with me i said hermogenes grunted some people would be nostalgic about torture he said im going to hire a wagon you can afford it lord he had a wicked glint in his eye best forget about anyone calling you that ever again i traded some silver for copper and tin in the city at athens and got bitten by bedbugs in a horrible tavern lower than anything id seen since i had become a slave and then we started walking home a day on the roads of attica and i remembered all too well greece land of farmers every man was equal and surly farmers cared nothing for swagger i could put my hand on my sword hilt and they would just glower the more we came to oinoe and i looked up at the tower in the sunset we camped within easy walk of the place where my father and his friends had stopped the spartans hermogenes and i told the story to idomeneus and the two slaves who were already becoming part of the household they were decent men not too smart tough as nails i told how my brother died that night i wept look at me even now i blubber listen honey may you never know the loss of love but you will i loved pater for all his ways and he died and my brother and those losses will never be redeemed you will lose me and your mother and your brothers too and if the gods dont favour you you will lose a child no i dont mean to be cruel but that night with the watch tower at our backs while i sat watching our cart i wept for briseis and for pater and for archi and for hipponax and for lekthes i wept for the man who i killed in the dark on the battlefield at ephesus most of all like most people i wept for myself when i walked away from the ship in piraeus i walked away from myself my reputation my riches all gone i was going home to avenge my fathers killing against a man whose face i couldnt hold in my mind not because i wanted to but because i could think of nothing else to do i think it was the loss of briseis most of all i think that i had been certain i would have her that i would bring her up this pass to the foot of cithaeron lie with her in the grass by leitoss tomb and carry her over the threshold into my fathers stone house without her it seemed an empty exercise i cared nothing i promised when i started this story that i would tell the truth so heres a truth for you i didnt care much about avenging my father oh i see the shock listen honey listen all of you when you are young and you listen to the poet you take in the rules of life the laws of all hellenes oaths gods laws of gods and men when i sat with my back to the stone fort at oinoe i had probably killed a hundred men my love had chosen another life over me and i had turned my back on the only calling i had ever felt every time you kill a man the doubt grows every time you take a ship empty it of valuables and enrich yourself with the blood and sweat of other men every time you make another man a slave every time you buy a woman for sex and discard her when shes pregnant you have to wonder are there any laws are there any gods there werent any laws for me just then no rules perhaps no gods nothing mattered the darkness of that night is absolute even in memory and i was afraid to go to sleep i dont remember much more than that until we came to the foot of cithaeron the next day i hadnt slept and i was morose and illtempered and yet curiously happy to be walking the southern slopes where i could see my home mountain cithaeron is an old god and he reached out to me and touched the blackness the cart slowed us and it was nightfall when we came to pedeis pedeis was the typical border town with high prices and crap for wine dionysus first preached just over the mountains at eleutherai and the grape grew there first and my money says that his worship never spread to pedeis the girls were ugly and there was a wooden temple of demeter that was a disgrace to gods and men i snarled at my men to keep moving and we rolled through the streets and camped in the stony fields north of town the border garrison if they existed were so slipshod that we passed without a road tax almost without comment we climbed the pass to eleutherai up and up in switchbacks and our cart filled the road so that the faster traffic of men walking and men with packs on donkeys ended up in a long queue behind us like the baggage train of an army men chatted to idomeneus or hermogenes i walked on in silence we found the body near the summit of the pass the corpse was that of a young boy probably a slave about twelve years old hed been killed in a bad way with a series of hacks to his face and neck from a dull heavy knife he lay in his own blood in the middle of the wide space near the summit where wagons turn to begin the descent and where polite men pull to the side to let the faster traffic pass there are deep ruts in the rock where the old men cut a road for their chariots and he lay across the stone tracks like a botched sacrifice he looked so pitiful he was just about the age i had been when i stood in the phalanx for the first time frankly from the ripe old age of twentytwo he looked too small to have died by violence had he tried to fight i would have i was already low and the sight of the dead boy almost moved me to tears again i knelt by him and cursed because his sticky blood got on my chiton but i determined to bury him no idea why either in general i leave corpses for the ravens i got him on my sea cloak which had seen worse than blood and men from the rest of the caravan behind our slow wagon came up and joined me quite spontaneously in fact my opinion of men went up right there i was reminded of why greeks are good men we cleared a space and every man slave and free gathered rocks and we built a cairn as fast as you can tell the story i put coins on his eyes and another man poured wine over the grave more and more men came up they must have been cursing my wagon all the way up the pass and every one joined in there was a small man a potmender and he had a pair of donkeys and a young slave of his own he came up when the cairn was halffinished he looked more angry than sad i caught his eye and he looked away you know him i asked a pair of korai from thebes who were travelling to the temple of artemis at athens were washing his face under their mothers direction they were good girls conscious of so many men around them and yet aware of their duties as women he shrugged he looks like the pais of empedocles the chief priest of the smith god he made the sign automatically even a potmender is at least an initiate i gave him my sign it was the cretan version and probably a little different but he knew that i was an initiate and more and he stepped closer i know empedocles i said it was like remembering another life empedocles the priest and his magic lens i looked at the potmender you sure i asked he nodded and swallowed but he wasnt afraid of me or much else no travelling man can afford to be scared on the road and he called out to the other men anyone heard of thieves in this pass other men nodded a farmer and a wool merchant and a man with a load of fine wine still in cheap amphorae used at sea loaded carefully on a big wagon he wasnt the owner but a trusted slave and his manner suggested that he used this route often theres a gang of them he said off towards the east took the priest for ransom i asked the slave spat who knows what they want theyre killers theyre like animals an old peddler with a leather sack full of goods put his sack down and rubbed his chin i heard they were west of eleutherai he said always best to just give them the money he said to no one in particular we finished the cairn covered the boys face and sang a hymn to demeter the girls voices carrying sweet and high i wept again although i wasnt sure why and then we let the other men pass and we waited while another caravan coming up out of boeotia climbed past the turnaround the tinker and the peddler waited with us the tinkers name was tiraeus and he was shifty and unwashed but not i think a bad man the peddler was laertes he looked wistfully at my entourage you are a rich man he said hmmm i said sounding too much like pater for my own peace of mind but i had the lapis and gold necklace from sardis at my throat and a belt of heavy gold links around my waist under my chiton in my experience thats the safest way to carry a fortune i have money i said he shrugged it never sticks to me he said thanks for the wine tiraeus the tinker was emboldened by the peddler you a smith he asked suddenly you dont look like a smith he said apologies master too often i say what comes into my head i shrugged i can bang out a good flat sheet i said i can repair a helmet i make a nice simple cup i grinned thinking of my latest attempt at a helmet in hephaestions shop on crete my first grin in a day i think looking for an apprentice he asked eagerly mistaking my statement of fact for false modesty no i said but if you help get the wagon down the pass ill stand you both a good dinner he shrugged laertes grinned wolfishly i gathered that he lived life a day at a time deal he said and we turned the wagon yoked the pair of oxen backwards and started down the six of us braking the wagon leaving the new grave under the afternoon sun sweaty backbreaking work but many hands made it lighter and my mood had changed so i made jokes praised the two thracians when they worked and we were a different crew entering eleutherai than we had been at pedeis we were faster too and there was still plenty of light in the sky eleutherai is in boeotia honey men speak the right way there and women look right and the barley is sweeter what can i say im a boeotian honey eleutherai felt like home and my mood rose again men told us that eleutherai was so named because runaway slaves from boeotia were free when they got there and i felt like a freer man drinking the wine if id been a slave close to home instead of across the ocean in asia i like to think id have run the first night i wasnt watched i took the seven of us into the biggest taverna summoned the owner and put a gold daric on the table then i used my sword to split it in two and gave him half i want a dinner i said a really good dinner and wine thats not like cow piss and sweet almonds with honey i want clean straw food for my beasts and no crap half a gold daric should have bought his whole village but it did get us a passable meal a pretty girl to wait on us and some seriously obsequious service and the wine was the wine of home not the wonders of chian wine but good strong stuff the tinker was thankful and pleasant but the peddler was sullen i didnt like him my gold halfdaric brought the basileus in the morning he was an old man and not really the power of the town the athenians owned eleutherai to all intents and purposes by then and he was a puppet he was an old aristocrat and he was waiting for us in the courtyard of the wine shop he looked me over saw the blood stains on my chiton and drew the wrong conclusions where do you come from he demanded he had two men with him and they had spears i shrugged here and there sir i said answer he demanded he made me angry and i liked that because the blackness had been so heavy i serve miltiades i said does that mean anything to you it certainly did his whole demeanour changed he stepped forward and offered his hand and we clasped my apologies sir he said i have a plague of bandits to deal with he pointed to the blood stains on my chiton i thought i nodded a boy was killed by bandits in the pass yesterday i said and told him what i knew tiraeus added what he knew and the basileus shook his head they are bad men he said old soldiers or so i hear he looked at my men then at the two fellow travellers and then at my necklace i could see him taking it all in are you a local man sir he asked politely suddenly i thought that i knew just where the bandits would be but i held my tongue only glancing at the two travellers with sudden interest and the old basileus disconcerted me id been away for ten years and my first day in boeotia an aristocrat mistook me for one of his own plataea i said ah he said as if a mystery was solved and these bandits are operating from south of plataea you are going to deal with them miltiades sent you his relief was palpable a problem passed on is a problem solved and all that idomeneus brightened the prospect of violence restored his faith in the logos or whatever passed for the logos in the cretans world you know thugater sometimes the fates speak loudly and sometimes we have to be the men that other men expect us to be and old empedocles if indeed it was he deserved something from me frankly it was good to have a simple mission it allowed me to put off going home for another day or two even hermogenes nodded bandits were bandits yes i said that is it is not what im here for but ill deal with the bandits everyone smiled except the tinker who looked confused and the peddler but sullen was pretty much his only mood we got our oxen hitched and started up the long road to plataea theres a short road down the valley of asopus and a long road up along the skirts of the mountain the long road would pass the heros shrine and come down past my fathers farm the short road was faster i wasnt surprised when both of the other travellers stuck with us at the fork towards the mountain however not surprised at all you said that you were a smith the tinker said when we were clear of eleutherai yes i said but he thinks youre some sort of aristocrat the peddler said as if i was intentionally deceiving him hmm i said we crossed the asopus in silence and started up the long ridge towards the heros shrine when we reached the first copse of big oaks i pulled the wagon off to the side arm i said to idomeneus and hermogenes the tinker watched us as if we were performing a miracle play his eyes as wide as a young girls the two thracians were slaves of course but i took them aside handed each of them a heavy knife and a javelin stand by me and you will be that much closer to being free men its easy with thracians they arm their own slaves and a bold slave can expect to be freed faster than one who hangs back they took the weapons as if they were going to a party swords in your belt spears in the top of the wagon and a cloak over everything i said i went over to the peddler and the tinker you two might want to walk away i said i looked pointedly at the peddler you especially he wouldnt meet my eye oh i can look after myself he said hmm i said i turned to tiraeus the tinker he looked around youll let me go i remember laughing we must have been a grim band when we changed into our armour because he was terrified were not the thieves i said and then it hit me we werent the thieves here it actually took my breath away these thieves these men on cithaeron who stole from travellers were only doing what wed been doing to phoenician ships for years except that they preyed on their own and they werent very good at it tiraeus watched me i must have made a face because he flinched but then i opened my hands i intend to rescue the old priest and rid the pass of thieves i said the peddler made a noise tiraeus opened his chlamys and revealed a short sword or a long knife i am a servant of the god he said and perhaps it will change my luck maybe he had decided that following me might get him a job everyone made up his mind i said we went up the road the oxen plodding along the sky went from blue to leaden grey in the time it took to climb half the ridge and it began to rain a slow cold rain what if they have bows idomeneus asked i should scout ahead i shook my head they wont have bows i said that boy was hacked down by a kopis i shrugged theyre mercenaries theyre using the old shrine as a headquarters because all the hard men used to come there when calchas was priest in my head the rule of law was reasserting itself and the gods themselves and i thought that it must have been too long since the hero had had his sacrifice since oinoe i had thought about the logos how heraclitus said that men could only come to wisdom through fire how strife was the master of all and change was the way but most of all i thought of what he said to me when he chided me for beating diomedes if you would master the killer in you you must accept that you are not truly free you must submit to the mastery of the laws of men and gods so i trudged through the everincreasing rain and i thought about fire hermogenes stepped up beside me what are we going to do he asked find the bandits and teach them some philosophy i said idomeneus laughed i shook my head i had a boeotian cap a heavy felt one purchased that morning from a stall and it was more like a sponge than a hat so i pulled it off and wrung it out i mean it i said you are mad idomeneus said he laughed again lets hear the bronze sing he shouted who gives a fuck about philosophy you are the mad one i said and went back to the road we climbed and climbed i wasnt worried that they would attack us on the hillside bandits are lazy men they would want the wagon at the top and i knew this mountain like i knew the calluses on my sword hand there was the crest of the road and then a slight dip that would be full of mud and water in late autumn and they would be in the big trees around the sinkhole just short of the top i stopped the wagon like a man who was too tired to go on my sandals were full of mud and the oxen looked as miserable as we all felt idomeneus made a face i wouldnt rob anyone on a day like this he said id be on a nice soft couch with a cup of wine in my hand hermogenes chucked him with an elbow why arent you then eh i know why im here and i know why arimnestos is here and i dont think the slaves have any choice and the tinker thinks theres a meal in it you you mad cretan arimnestos is my lord the cretan proclaimed besides wherever he goes theres blood oceans of it never a dull moment youll see i doubted it the first days out of athens but here we are i winced at his description of me but i recognized it leave the wagon now i said i turned to the tinker stay here with the beasts well do the work the peddler was looking at idomeneus i put my fist in the peddlers ear and he fell like a sacrifice you see it dont you thugater the tinker turned white put his back to a tree and drew his sword dont fret i said i took the peddlers pack and dumped it it was full of rags and nothing else hes the spotter for the bandits i said tie him and dont let him go well be back he didnt protest and i led my little band off the road uphill the slope increases above the road and we took our time the deer trails had changed of course but i got us up to the little meadow where calchas had once killed a wolf and cocked an ear for sounds from below the only real weak point in my plan was the tinker and our wagon from above we could see the ambushers even through the rain the gods love irony and in the best tradition of their laughter the wagon and the ambushers were only a stade apart or less so that we could see tiraeus pacing nervously and we could see the bandits in the trees waiting for a wagon that was not coming ill go right down the hillside i said you drive them perhaps it seems foolish that i was going to take on all the bandits myself using my men as beaters i was in an odd place i wanted the fight i told myself that id let this make my decision for me thief against thief so to speak if i fell that was that another voice said that in fact there was no need for gods because there were few men in greece who could stand before me perhaps none and as i began to kick down the hill the wet leaves flying from under my boots i felt old calchas at my side how many times had we raced through these woods together he and i in pursuit of some quarry the bandits saw idomeneus first as i had intended they took too long to realize that this wasnt a chancemet farmer this was real the end man rose from his concealment and called a warning and then he was down his agony a better warning than his shouts hermogenes appeared from behind a boulder running hard and he threw a javelin then i was on them the bandit closest to me was a fool and he neither saw me nor heard me his whole attention on the crisis at the other end of the ambush they had no armour and they looked more like escaped slaves than mercenaries although the line between the two can be faint i put my spear point between his kidneys and ran on the whole band broke from cover then there were about a dozen of them and they ran for the road just as a frightened deer might but i was on the road first between them and the wagon and the two thracians were on the other side of the road we were five against twelve but the issue was never in doubt when two more of them were dead on my spear they fell back into the mudfilled hollow where they had intended to take my wagon i stopped and wiped my spear blade on a scrap of oily cloth from my pouch surrender i said surrender or ill kill all of you you cant kill us all one scarred wretch said he had a proper sword a kopis youre right i said my friends would have to kill a couple of you they trembled like sheep surrender i said i am arimnestos of plataea if you drop your weapons i will spare your lives by zeus soter the man with the kopis threw his spear at hermogenes and bolted running right up the face of the dip and away downhill hermogenes ducked the spearhead but got the tumbling shaft across his temple and went down another bandit broke downhill but the nearest thracian speared him like a fisherman on a thracian river and the rest dropped their weapons hold them here i said calchas was in my head and i knew what was going to happen as if i had read it on a scroll i ran downhill after the man with the sword he had a long start but i knew where he was going and i wanted him to get there i ran easily following the contour of cithaeron staying high on the hillside and after two stades of bushrunning i came to the trail i had used to climb the mountain as a child and i ran down it swifter than an eagle it was odd but at first i felt calchas beside me and then i felt him in me i was calchas or perhaps i had become calchas i passed the cabin running silently on the leafmould and i had just time to slow at the verge of the tomb when my prey burst out of the woods in front of me eyes wild with panic from whatever ghosts rode him through the woods i hope that boy was on him and the panic on his face exploded like a hot rock drenched in water when he saw me he raised the sword the same sword hed used to kill the boy at the top of the pass and cut at me i parried high and refused to give ground so that he slammed into my hip i turned him our bodies pressed close by his momentum and my hip pushed him ever so slightly and he went sprawling across the stones of the precinct of the heros tomb his head hit a stone and his sword hand hit another so hard that the kopis fell from his hand as if taken by the hero himself he tried to rise coming up on all fours like a beast and i caught his greasy hair in my left fist and sacrificed him cutting his throat so that his life flushed out across the cool wet stones and the hero drank his blood as he had with every bad man that calchas sent into the dark i wiped my sword on his chiton and went to the cabin such as it was the years had not been kind and the bandits had slaughtered a deer badly and left the hanging carcass to rot by the window of horn the fools the wreck of a door was open inside there were two women clinging to the priest they flinched away from me empedocles i asked gently and then when he still looked wild and afraid i tried a smile its a rescue i said they took my cup he said weakly and fainted we were quite a crowd by the time the rain stopped we had nine prisoners and six of us the two women and the priest he wasnt in a good way he had a fever and they had abused him he had burns but he was a strong man and he smiled at me come a long way eh apprentice he said when i gave him the sign of the journeyman he was lying on the cot we had cleaned the cabin and i had found his cup the fine cup my father had made him in the leather bag of the leader the thracians were amusing themselves rebuilding the door while hermogenes and idomeneus hunted for meat he frowned where did you learn that sign i knelt by him crete father i said he coughed crete by the gods boy youd have done better in thebes he coughed again here give me your hand thats the sign for boeotia then he lay still so long i thought he was asleep or dead but when i threw my cloak over him he managed a smile i saw you he said father i asked sacrificed the bastard he said zeus you frightened me son we fed the lot of them on deer meat and barley from our wagon i let the prisoners stew in their fear the tinker stayed with me and was enough of a help that i wanted him to stay i left the body of their leader across the threshold of the precinct so that his end was clear to all of them let them wonder how it had happened divine justice takes many forms i had just learned that lesson and it was steadying me the blackness of three days before was already a memory and seeing empedocles even older and badly hurt was a tonic it reminded me that this life boeotia a world with ordered harvests and strong farmers a cycle of feasts a local shrine it was real it was not a dream of youth idomeneus wanted to kill the lot of them of course thats what wed have done at sea my reluctance puzzled him different places have different rules i told him he nodded happy that there was some reason wasnt much of a fight he said im not here to fight i said i may go back to smithing and farming he had finished his deer meat and we were sharing wine from his mastos cup he winced as if i had cut him thats not you lord he said youre no farmer you are the spear arimnestos the spear men shit themselves rather than face you you cant be a smith im tired of killing i said in the morning i sat on a log with all the prisoners they were a useless lot beaten men in every way but theyd behaved like animals when they had the chance raping the women theyd taken burning empedocles and only the gods knew how many more victims were in the shallow graves behind the tomb you are broken men i said they stared at me dully waiting for death i will try to fix you i said one man a dirty blond smiled what will you have us do he asked already aiming to ingratiate with the conqueror well start with work i said if you displease or disobey the punishment will be death there will be no other punishment do you understand will you feed us master another man said yes i said they were ugly those men as far from the virtue that heraclitus taught as briseis was from an old hag in piraeus but i understood that the principal difference between us was that my hand still held a sword their first task was to dig up all the shallow graves there were fifteen ten men and five women none of the corpses was very old and the task horrified them that pleased me we made a pyre and purified the bodies and then we sent their spirits to the underworld avenged the old way at least in boeotia and their ashes went into the heros tomb where they could share in the criminals blood or thats how i understood it from calchas the women wept as we poured the oil we had over the bodies the two who survived had known some of the others i didnt ask them any questions it took us three days to restore the cabin and to dispose of the victims we raked the yard and we cut firewood and we cleaned the tomb i poured wine on calchass grave each day each night i lay awake thinking on the third day empedocles fever broke and he began to recover quickly that night hermogenes came and sat by me as i looked at the stars shining down into the clearing by the tomb i understand he said i put my hand on his thanks i said but it has to be done he said i had to put my own house in order i said before i go to my fathers this is not your house he said hermogenes lived in a very literal world yes i said this is my house the two women had been farm slaves across the river after some conversation and some halting answers i set on a course of action with hermogenes i left idomeneus at the shrine ah thugater you smile well might you smile i left him with the thracians as helpers and i told the thracians that they were halfway to their freedom they both nodded like the serious men they were tiraeus came he was already oikia by then one of mine i left my armour and all my weapons except my good spear a serious man in boeotia may walk abroad with a spear i wore a good wool chiton and my only concession to my recent life was the necklace we put empedocles in the wagon with the two women and walked down the mountain across the valley and up the hill i stopped at the fork where one lane ran up the hill the lane of my childhood and another ran down and away into the flat lands by the river epictetuss lane even alone or with hermogenes i knew i could go up that golden lane to my fathers house drench it in blood and make it mine in an hour i stood there long enough despite my resolve that hermogenes cleared his throat nervously and i found that i was standing with my hand on my sword hilt then i turned my back on my fathers lane and walked downhill coming into epictetuss farmyard i felt remarkably like odysseus especially when a farm dog came and smelled my hand turned and gave a friendly bark not a cry of joy but a bark of acceptance peneleos the old mans younger son came down into the courtyard from the womens balcony his face was reserved he admitted later that he had no idea who i was but he knew hermogenes theres a friend he called i saw a bow move in another window and i realized that the bandits must have preyed on all these farms i can be a fool peneleos i called its me arimnestos he started as if hed seen a ghost then we embraced although wed never been that close and his brothers came to the yard the eldest carrying a bow youre alive he said your sister will go wild and then the old man himself came into the yard they dont sound like thieves he said in an old mans voice it was hard to see epictetus as an old man of course id thought that he was older than dirt as a child but id seen differently at oinoe he was starting to bend at the waist and he had a heavy staff but his back straightened when he saw me and the arms he put around me were strong you came back he said as if hed just made a hard bargain but a good one he reached up and fingered my necklace huh he said but he gave me the lower half of a grin to take the sting out of the grunt what kept you he asked i was taken as a slave i said huh he said in a different voice he had started as a slave then he put his head over the edge of the wagon bed say he said we broke the bandits hermogenes said he was still being embraced now by a bevy of boeotian maidens epictetuss daughters the eldest who had once been offered to me was a matron of five years marriage to dracos eldest and she had a fairhaired boy just five years old and a daughter of four looking at her stopped me in my tracks because seeing her was like living another life not that id ever loved her simply that in another one of heraclituss infinite worlds i might have wed her and those would have been my children and i would have had no more blood on my sword than i got at the yearly sacrifice that other world seemed real when i looked at her and her children epictetus the younger now a tall man with a heavy beard lifted the two slaves down from the wagon theras he said the bandits killed her and took all her women and her slaves joined them he looked at me i guess theyre yours now that stopped all conversation simon has my fathers farm i said into the silence aye epictetus the elder said i nodded he killed my father i said a blade in the back while you fought the men of eretria all the men present winced the silence stretched on and on and then old epictetus nodded thought so he said and spat whatre you going to do peneleos asked you broke the bandits epictetus the younger asked you and who his father understood you going to kill him he asked epictetus didnt even care where id been how wed broken the bandits none of that mattered he had my right hand in his and the calluses on my palm told him all he needed to know his question returned the courtyard to silence i helped his son lift the priest down from the wagon i came to talk to you about that i said you want to call him before the assembly epictetus asked later over bean soup i nodded hermogenes shrugged i thought we were just going to kill him he said apologetically and then what i asked start a bandit gang this is boeotia not ionia what would the archon say if i butchered him and moved into the farm and hasnt he married my mother he has sons do i kill them all yes peneleos said bastards every one sorry ma i shook my head law i said empedocles was sitting up and taking broth he saw through me as if i was a pane of horn you could do it he said buy a few judges with that trinket around your neck men around here remember you and your father he died fighting for the city everyone knows that hades im from thebes and i know it kill the bastard and his brood if you must no one will hold it against you i was stunned youre the philosopher empedocles shook his head im interested in how the world works he said and heed the words of pythagoras there are no laws but these to do good for your friends and to do harm to your enemies epictetus the elder looked at me as if i was a good milk cow on the auction block you plan to live here he asked or will you go away again live here i said he nodded assembly then he looked around his table absolute master in his own house no talk of this until the assembly ill arrange it the archon was your fathers friend after all myron i asked epictetus nodded his son is married to my second he said he looked at peneleos and the young man flushed of course ill go he said his father drafted a message in heavyfisted letters and peneleos was off across the fields in the fading light you really going to stay epictetus asked as we watched his son run of course he is hermogenes said myron summoned the assembly on the pretence really the truth that there was news from athens in a city with fewer than four thousand citizens you can summon the assembly before sunset and expect the majority of your citizens to be standing under the walls in the old olive orchard when the sun rises i didnt sleep much and when i did calchas visited me from the dead and told me in a ravens voice that i was no farmer i knew that i woke in the chilly time before dawn plucked my face carefully by lamplight with a womans mirror and took hermogenes over the hill we waited among the olive trees by the fork as we had as children and we waited until we saw his father come down the hill alone walking quickly with a staff and then behind him raucous as crows following a raven came simon and his sons four of them i risked my whole future by laughing aloud how much easier it would have been having crushed the bandits to cross the valley slaughter this foul crow and all his people and blame the criminals men might have suspected the truth men would have known it for vengeance but if you would master the killer in you you must accept that you are not truly free you must submit to the mastery of the laws of men and gods heraclitus said it to me it took me a few years to see it i didnt want to be a landless man or a pirate king and yet i remember thinking even now i could leave them in a heap before the sun rises another fingers breadth simon started at the sound of the laugh but then he kept walking to town and for the first time i hated him as deeply as he deserved to be hated he had killed my father and he walked like a man who has a hard life the useless bastard we let them lead us by a couple of stades and then we followed them i wanted to make sure that they were at the assembly i rehearsed my speech as i walked and i feasted my revenge on the sight of simons back someone had talked i know that because by the time i reached the assembly most of the men of plataea were already there and the silence was like a living thing i was closer behind simon as he and his sons trudged up the acropolis to the meeting place the sun was up and the world was beautiful with autumn splendor demeter and hera had made a perfect day the sky was blue and justice was close to my hand myron was dressed in white and he stood on the little rise where the archon always stood he waited until simon walked into the crowd even simon noticed that the crowd parted around him and no man went to stand close to him but he was a surly man he had few friends and perhaps he expected no more he crossed his arms and his loutish sons stood around him i remember that there was one voice that went on and on draco he was trying to sell a man a wagon and he hadnt noticed the silence he was hidden by the crowd but after a while he understood or perhaps a neighbour caught him with an elbow i meant to be the last and i waited by a cowshed watching the latecomers some hurrying down from the heights through the gated wall others trotting up the lanes from outlying farms myrons sons were both late still chewing bread and then epictetus and his sons came in a group with empedocles on a litter i fell in with them and we walked into the middle of the assembly and stood before the archon men looked at me because i had a spear perhaps five other men in the crowd had spears and they were over sixty and my spear was fine in a way that farmers seldom decorate a weapon a murmur started myron raised his arms and silence returned and then with two other men priests he sacrificed a ram you owe me for that epictetus said in a hoarse whisper then the archon raised his hands wiped the blood and faced the assembly men of plataea he said i call you to order the assembly of the men of the city to make law we gave him three short cheers and then the whole assembly sang the paean i had imagined that my moment would come immediately but however long you wait for revenge theres always delay in this case an existing boundary dispute had to be read into the record i didnt even know the men involved while old myrons voice droned on i saw bion spot his son i saw the change come to his face and then i saw him look at me his grin was wide enough to split his face he looked away hiding his reaction from simon who was not far from him and then he began to move through the crowd not towards us but to stand behind simon simon took no notice but other men had marked bion he was a popular man and they followed his eyes and men began to point and stare first at hermogenes and then at me draco saw me he threw back his head and laughed myron got to the end of his boundary dispute new business he said news from athens he looked out over the assembly where is the messenger i stepped forward and men cleared a path for me i have come from athens i said and before that from asia where i was a slave i have come to accuse simon son of simon of the murder of my father and of selling me into slavery i turned and pointed my spear at simon and a path cleared from me to him what can the punishment be i asked into the silence for a man who stole my fathers farm his land his tools and his wife after stabbing him from behind in the face of the enemy simon was so surprised that one of his hands clawed the air as if to push away the words i said who here does not know simon the coward how many of you stood against the spartans when my brother died at oinoe who was it who ran from the rear of the phalanx and when we went against the thebans who shirked and stood in the rear is there a man here who remembers simon standing his ground and when we faced the eretrians i saw him stab pater i saw it you he spluttered it was nigh on the worst thing he could have said because his shock and his guilt were writ on his face i am arimnestos of plataea i roared in my stormcutter voice i accuse this man of murder he lost his case there before he opened his mouth to plead mind you the law doesnt work like an avenging titan the assembly voted to hear the case and appointed a jury and on the spot we argued our cases this wasnt athens and we had no paid orators nor did we have a prison or guards or scythians to take a man and bind him the jurors heard our evidence i had some and i was determined to use what i had learned in ephesus and from miltiades so i summoned witnesses about paters courage and simons cowardice and simon writhed and his sons glowered but when the sun began to set in the sky the jurors went to their dinners and the crowd wandered away and simon and his sons headed back up the road to the farm i followed them all of epictetuss sons were with me and hermogenes and his father and myrons sons in every way but the decision of the jurors the trial was over we followed them up the road and hounded them until they reached my lane stop i said they cringed simon i said and he turned he was shaking his sons stood away from him i think in revulsion take your chattels and go i said or the law will kill you he turned away from me a shadow of the angry man hed once been in my fathers andron honey i think what he had done had eaten him until he had nothing left but an angry shell like the outside of a thorn apple eaten by worms and this is the lesson remember that i said when i sat at oinoe that i had learned that you could kill and rape and force others to your will perhaps you can for a time but the gods are there they do watch simonalkes needed no punishment from me he wore his failure his cowardice his alienation on his face he was no plataean though he had occupied my house while i was a slave andi i was welcome back he lived an exile in his own house and if i was a poet i might say that id carried plataea with me wherever i wandered i would submit to the mastery of the laws of men and gods i went back to epictetuss house and slept well in the morning none of simons corvaxae came to the trial the jurors sent two men to find them they came back to say that simon was hanging by a leather rope from the rafters of the bronze shop and the sons were gone and my mother was too drunk to speak and so about noon on a beautiful day i walked up that long hill past the olive trees past the byres and the grape vines bion and hermogenes walked with me and empedocles moving slowly and epictetus and their sons and myron and his sons and draco and his sons i could hear the swarm of flies on the corpse in the shop i was numb but the men around me held me up the way men do in the phalanx when you are wounded the shields of their friendship covered me the spears of their humour kept the furies at bay they were there the furies baying for his blood revelling in the accomplishment of their task i could feel them on the air we walked up into the yard and then my sister was in my arms saying my name over and over i held pen a long time and then i put her down you are all my neighbours and my friends i said but i need to clean my own house every man there nodded even the youngest some things you have to do yourself i never promised you a happy story honey it has glad parts and sad parts like life i went upstairs to mater she was drunk but she knew me she had a knife a good bronze knife paters work shed tried it on her wrists a few times and there was blood on her linen and on her arms and incongruously some on her feet her skin was old and the blood found folds to run in she burst into tears when she saw me oh she wailed i meant to be dead when you came and now i am a coward as well as everything else i took the knife from her my strength against her weakness and then i took the water from her table and washed her and i bound up the slashes the inadequate slices on her wrists he killed pater i said i know she said she raised her head and a touch of her pride came back i never let them have pen she said not an excuse just a statement so many types of strength and so many types of weakness too when she was clean i got pen to help me get her dressed and then i went to my next task i went into the shop and i climbed the rafters alone and cut simon down he smelled like a newkilled deer all blood and meat and ordure it was the smell of hunting and battlefields the smell that attracts ravens i took the corpse to the wagon and i drove it scarcely a thought in my head to tell the truth across the valley and up the ridge i spent that night at the tomb with idomeneus in the morning we burned simon on the pyre with the dead thief and sprinkled their ashes across the tomb broken men sacrificed but what broke them later idomeneus had the criminals scrubbing the tombs round stones with brushes he had them make themselves i fed my oxen and turned both wagons for home a man came up the road from eleutherai with an aspis on his back and a beaten thracian cap on his head i didnt know him but i knew the look he came up the hill like a man doing a serious job and when he reached the tomb he took a canteen from under his arm and poured a libation then he hung his aspis on the great oak tree by the cabin is the priest here he asked his eyes were a little wild his hands shook a little i let the oxen stand i sat him on the cabins step and fed him some wine he was still telling about the campaign in caria when idomeneus came and sat with us the mercenarys name was ajax and hed known cyrus and pharnakes he told us how pharnakes died and his hands shook hed served with the medes against the carians sitting at the heros tomb in boeotia that didnt matter a fart we were brothers all of us in an ugly brotherhood of spilt blood and terror when i left they were weeping together neither cared when the oxen clumped out of the clearing i took the wagon over asopus and when i reached the fork i stopped and just breathed i took my time going up the hill over our gate was a wreath of laurel and there were men in the courtyard and there was a fire outside the smithy and the old priest stood with pen and peneleos i laughed im home i said epilogue my voice is gone and ive talked enough your stylus hand must hurt like a swordsmans after a long fight lad and you lady i must have run you out of blushes by now and you honey youve yawned more than a child at lessons although you were kind enough to weep for your grandmother aye theres more come again after the feast of demeter and ill tell you of how i next met briseis how i lost the farm and won it back how the men of plataea stood against the medes at marathon now theres a story
