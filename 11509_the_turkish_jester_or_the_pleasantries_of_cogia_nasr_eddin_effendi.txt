pleasant stories bears relicks of long departed years the story goes one of the stories of a hundred that cogia nasr eddin efendi one day ascending into the pulpit to preach said o believers do ye not know what i am going to say to you the congregation answered dear cogia efendi we do not know then said the cogia what shall i say to you until you do know one day the cogia ascending again into the pulpit said o mussulmen do ye not know what i am going to say to you we do know they replied then said the cogia some of ye do know already what should i have to say to you then descending from the chair he went out the assembly separated quite astonished and when they were out continued to say which are those of us who know which are those who do not know the cogia one day again mounting the chair in the same manner said o brothers when i said to ye do you know what i shall say there were some who said we know others said we do not it were now well that those among ye who knew what the cogia said should teach those that did not one day cogia nasr eddin efendi said o mussulmen give thanks to god most high that he did not give the camel wings for had he given them they would have perched upon your houses and chimneys and have caused them to tumble upon your heads one day cogia nasr eddin efendi having mounted the chair in a city said o mussulmen the air above this city is just like the air above my city the congregation said o cogia efendi how do you know that said the cogia because i have seen as many stars above this city as i saw above belgrade one night the cogia dreamt that he was given nine aspres whereupon the cogia said o now pray make them up ten afterwards he said make them up eleven and then presently a dispute having arisen he awoke and saw that in his hand he had nothing thereupon closing his eyes anew and stretching out his hands he said well well i shall be content with nine aspres one day the cogia went out into the plain and as he was going along he suddenly saw some men on horseback coming towards him cogia efendi in a great hurry set off towards a cemetery and having reached it took off his clothes and entering into a tomb lay down the horsemen on seeing the cogia run away followed him to the place where he lay and said o fellow why do you lie here cogia efendi finding nothing else to say replied i am one of the buried people but came here to walk cogia efendi one day went into a garden pulled up some carrots and turnips and other kinds of vegetables which he found putting some into a sack and some into his bosom suddenly the gardener coming up laid hold of him and said what are you seeking here the cogia being in great consternation not finding any other reply answered for some days past a great wind has been blowing and that wind blew me hither but who pulled up these vegetables said the gardener as the wind blew very violently replied the cogia it cast me here and there and whatever i laid hold of in the hope of saving myself remained in my hands ah said the gardener but who filled the sack with them well said the cogia that is the very question i was about to ask myself when you came up one day cogia efendi on whom god be merciful went to the city of conia and going into a pastrycooks shop seized hold of a tart and saying in the name of god began to eat it the pastrycook cried out halloa fellow what are you about and fell to beating him the cogia said oh what a fine country is this of conia in which whilst a man eats a tart they put in a blow as a digester for every morsel cogia nasr eddin at the time of the holy ramadan thought to himself what must i do in order to hold the fast in conformity with the people i must prepare an earthen pot and every day put a stone into it and when thirty days are completed i may hold my beiram so he commenced placing stones in the pot one every day now it happened one day that a daughter of the cogia cast a handful of stones into the pot and a little time after some people asked the cogia what day of the month is it today now it happened to be the twentyfifth the cogia however said to them have patience and i will see and going to his house and emptying the pot perceived that there were a hundred and twenty stones in it says the cogia to himself if i tell the people all this number they will call me a fool so going to them he said this day is the fortyfifth day of the month but said they o cogia a month has in all but thirty days so how can you say that today is the fortyfifth i spoke quite within bounds said the cogia if you were to see the account in the pot you would find that today is the hundred and twentieth one day the cogia was asked when there is a new moon what becomes of the old one they make forty stars out of each said the cogia one day the cogia went out of the city along with a cafila or caravan of people and felt a wish to ride now there was a camel belonging to the cafila and the cogia said to himself now if instead of walking i should mount on this camel how comfortably could i travel thereupon mounting on the camel he proceeded along with the cafila the camel however falling to kicking flung the cogia to the earth and knelt upon him the cogia cried out loudly and the people of the cafila came and rescued him after a little time the cogia coming to his senses said o mussulmen did you not see how thatperfidious camel maltreated me now do hold the perfidious brute for me that i may cut its throat one day the cogia bought a quantity of eggs at the rate of nine for the aspre and carrying them to another place he sold them at the rate of ten some people asking him why do you sell ten for what you gave for nine the cogia replied i always wish my friends to see that i lose by my bargains one day the cogia walking along the plain met a heifer and forthwith laying thievish hands upon it led it straight to his house where he slaughtered it and stripped off the skin the proprietor soon appeared before the cogias house making a loud cry and lamentation who would have thought said the cogia to his people and his wife that my flaying the heifer would have made that fellows face look so black one day the cogia nasr eddin efendi passing along the bazaar an individual coming up to him said pray cogia what is the moon today is it at three or four i dont know said the cogia i neither buy nor sell the moon one day the cogia taking a ladder on his shoulder placed it against a garden wall and mounting got over taking the ladder with him the gardener seeing him said who are you and what do you want here i am come to sell this ladder said the cogia without hesitation is this a place for selling a ladder said the gardener o you foolish man said the cogia cannot a ladder be sold anywhere nasr eddin efendi one day taking hold of some fowls one by one tied some strips of an apron round their throats and then let them go the learned men having assembled round the cogia said what was the matter with these fowls said the cogia they merely went into mourning for their slaughtered mothers one day a bull mounted a young cow of the cogias the cogia seeing what he was about took a staff in his hand and ran towards him the bull fled towards the car of a turcoman to which seven other oxen were attached the cogia keeping the ox in view ran after him and with the staff in his hand struck the ox several blows halloa man said the turcoman what do you want with my ox dont you interfere you foolish dog said the cogia he knows full well what he has done one day the cogia made his last will when i die said he place me in an old tomb when the people about him said why do you make this request the cogia said when the inquiring angels come and ask me questions i can say i am deaf do you not see that i as well as my tomb am old one day cogia efendi putting on very short habiliments went to the mosque to say his prayers whilst performing the rakoua the man who was behind him perceiving the cogias seized hold of them and squeezed them whereupon the cogia seizing hold of those of the man who was before him squeezed them too the man turning round and perceiving that it was cogia efendi himself said halloa what are you about you must ask the man behind me said the cogia one day the boys of belgrade took the cogia along with them into the bath they had secretly brought in their pouches a number of eggs one and all going into the bathinghouse took off their clothes and went in and then sitting down on the bench they all said to one another come let us lay eggs whosoever does not lay an egg shall pay the expenses of the bath after which they began to make a great noise cackling like hens and flinging the eggs which they had brought on the stone bench cogia efendi seeing what they were about suddenly began to make a great noise and crow like a cock what are you about cogia efendi said the boys why said he is not a cock necessary where there are so many hens one day the cogia putting on black clothes went out the people looking at him said cogia efendi for whose death are you in mourning the cogia answered my sons father is dead and i wear mourning for him one day cogia returning from the harvest field felt very thirsty looking around he saw that they watered a tree by means of a pipe from a fountain the cogia exclaimed i must drink and pulled at the spout and as he did so the water spouting forth with violence wetted the mouth and head of the cogia who in a great rage said they watered this wretched tree in order that one fool might wet another one day the cogia taking some water melons with him went to the mountain in order to cut wood feeling thirsty he cut one of the melons and putting it to his mouth cast it away saying that it was tasteless he then cut up another and to be short he cut them all up and having eaten a little of each made water over what remained he then fell to work at cutting wood after some time the cogia again became thirsty and finding no water he went to the bits of the melons which he had cut up and saying this is sprinkled and this is sprinkled ate them all cogia nasr eddin efendi had a lamb which he had fattened to a high degree one day some of his friends having assembled said let us get the lamb from the cogia and feast upon it so coming to the cogia as quick as possible they said o cogia tomorrow is the day of judgment what would you do with this lamb come take it and let us eat it the cogia however would not believe them coming again however they said the same thing and the cogia at lastbelieving their words were true slaughtered the lamb and taking it on his back he carried it to the public walk and lighting a fire he began to prepare a roast presently stripping their bodies they delivered their clothes to the cogia and each went aside to sleep whereupon the cogia taking their garments flung them all into the fire and burnt them in a little time their bellies becoming hungry from the sleep they had had they came again and saw that their garments were nearly reduced to a coal whereupon they said to the cogia who burnt our clothes my dear friends replied the cogia tomorrow is the day of resurrection so what need can you have of clothes one day a thief entering the house of the cogia laid hold of everything there was there and placing it on his back went away the cogia however spying somebody going out followed the thief who went into his own house the cogia following close behind pushed against him at the door whereupon the thief said what do you want cogia efendi what do i want said the cogia why are we not going to remove hither today one day certain individuals stole from the cogia a sum of money whereupon the cogia said o lord what need have you that you give my money to others so he made a dreadful outcry and going into the mosque wept until it was morning groaning like a ship labouring in the sea those who were there said ye who have found salvation make up a sum of money for the cogia so whosoever had found salvation through the assistance of the almighty made up what he could and brought it to the cogia whereupon the cogia exclaimed allah allah by lying one night publicly in the mosque and weeping i have caused allah to send me my money again one day the cogia borrowed a cauldron of a brazier and carrying it home put a little saucepan into it and then carrying it back returned it to its owner the owner seeing a little saucepan in the cauldron said what is this why cried the cogia the cauldron has borne a child whereupon the owner took possession of the saucepan one day the cogia asked again for the cauldron and having obtained it carried it home the owner of the cauldron waited one day and even five days for his utensil but no cauldron coming he went to the house of the cogia and knocked at the door the cogia coming to the door said what do you want the cauldron said the man oh set your heart at rest said the cogia the cauldron is dead o cogia said the man can a cauldron die oh said the cogia as you believed it could bear a child why should you not believe that it can die one day the cogia walking amongst the sepulchres saw a large dog lying upon a gravestone the cogia in a great rage laying hold on a stick aimed a blow at the dog who in his turn assaulted the cogia the cogia fearing that he should be torn to pieces said to the dog get you gone i conquered get you gone one day the cogia laying hold on a crane took it home and saying that its beak and feet were very long cut them off with a knife and placing it on a lofty place said now you look like a bird one day the cogia having made his broth very hot burnt his mouth and making a great outcry ran into the street saying make way brothers there is a fire in my belly a moolah who had travelled about arabia persia hindustan and in a word the whole seven climes without finding any one who could answer his questions was told by a man in this country there is a man called cogia nasr eddin who will answer your questions if any one can the moolah arising went straight to belgrade where he bought an aspres worth of pomegranates which he placed in his bosom going out of the suburbs of belgrade he saw a man going to his labour now this was the cogia himself going up to him he saw a man like a fakeah with shoes of raw hide on his feet and a kiebbeh or rough cloak on his back when he was close by him he said to him salaam and the cogia saying to him peace be unto you said moolah efendi for what have you come the moolah replied can you answer a question which i shall ask the cogia said i can do you know soandso the cogia said i can do nothing without being paid what will you give me the moolah taking the pomegranates which were in his bosom gave him one whereupon the cogia answered his question and got all his pomegranates one by one till not a single grain remained the moolah then said i have yet one question to ask the cogia replied go your way dont trouble me the pomegranates are spent whereupon the moolah went away saying if the labourers of moom are of this description what must the learned men be one day the cogia saw a great many ducks playing on the top of a fountain the cogia running towards them said ill catch you whereupon they all rose up and took to flight the cogia taking a little bread in his hand sat down on the side of the fountain and crumbling the bread in the fountain fell to eating a person coming up said what are you eating duck broth replied the cogia one day the cogia having bought a liver was carrying it to his house suddenly a kite swooping from above with a loud scream seized the liver and flew off with it the cogia remained staring after it but saw that it was impossible to recover his meat making up his mind he ran up to the top of an eminence and a person passing below with a liver in his hand the cogia darted down and snatched the liver out of the persons hand and ran again up the rock hallo cogia said the man what are you about i was merely playing the kite out of fun said the cogia a person coming to nasr eddin efendi requested him to let him have a rope the cogia went into his house and comingout again said the rope is striking ten how can a rope strike ten said the man it will always be striking ten said the cogia till i feel inclined to give you the rope one day the cogia put some fowls into a cage and set out for the castle of siouri as he was going along he said to himself these poor wretches are here imprisoned i think i may as well give them a little liberty so he let them all out and all the hens ran off in one direction or another the cogia taking a stick in his hand placed himself before the cock pushing him and driving him saying o you who in the middle of the night knowest when it is morning how is it that in broad day thou knowest not the way to the castle one day as the cogia was wandering amongst the tombs by the side of the way he fell into an old tomb and making believe as if he were dead he said let me see mounkhir is nekîr coming as he lay there stretched at his length it appeared to him that he heard from afar the voice of a bell it is the noise of the day of judgment said the cogia and forthwith sprang out of the tomb now it happened that a caravan was coming and the cogia by putting out his head frightened the camels who jostled each other in great confusion no sooner did the conductors see the cogia than seizing their cudgels they said to him you who are you the cogia said to them i am one who is dead and what are you doing here said the conductors i merely came to take a walk said the cogia we will now make you take a pretty walk said the carriers and instantly began belabouring him with their cudgels the cogia with tears streaming from his eyes ran home where have you been said his wife i have been dead said the cogia and in the tomb and what is there in the other world said his wife nothing said the cogia provided you dont frighten carriers camels once upon a time the cogia was sent into curdistan along with the ambassador whilst he was there the curdish beys invited the cogia to a feast which they had made in honour of him the cogia putting on a pelisse went to the place of festival during the entertainment he chanced to belch you do wrong to belch cogia moolah efendi said the beys i am amongst curds said the cogia how should they know a turkish belching even though they hear it one day the cogia went with cheragh ahmed to the den of a wolf in order to see the cubs said the cogia to ahmed do you go in ahmed did so the old wolf was abroad but presently returning tried to get into the cave to its young when it was about halfway in the cogia seized hard hold of it by the tail the wolf in its struggles cast a quantity of dust into the eyes of ahmed hallo cogia he cried what does this dust mean if the wolfs tail breaks said the cogia youll soon see what the dust means one day the cogia mounted upon a tree and sitting upon a branch forthwith began to cut it a person coming up said hallo man what are you about as soon as you have cut the branch you will fall the cogia made no answer but went on cutting and no sooner had he cut through the bough than down fell the cogia to the ground getting up he ran after the person crying out ho fellow if you knew that i should fall you also knew that i should kill myself and forthwith seized him by the collar the man finding no other way to save himself said leave hold of me and fling yourself down on the road face upwards at the first belching that you give half your soul will leave your body at the second all will go and not a particle will remain the cogia did so and at the second belching laying himself down on the ground he cried i am dead and remained motionless forthwith the ulemas hastened to him and bringing with them a coffin placed him in it saying let us carry him home on their way coming to a miry place they said we will rest and began to talk together the cogia forthwith raising his head from the coffin said if i were alive i would get out of this place as quick as possible one day the cogia set about making a stable under the earth as he was digging he got into a stable of one of his neighbours in which he found several oxen the cogia very much rejoiced went into his house and said o wife i have found a stable of oxen a relic of the times of the caffirs now what will you give me for bringing you this piece of good news nasr eddin efendi had two daughters one day the two coming to see their father the cogia said to them well daughters how do things go on with you now the husband of one of them was a farmer that of the other was a maker of tiles one of them said my husband has sown a great deal of corn if there is plenty of rain my husband will give me a new gown the other said my husband is a tilemaker he has made a great quantity if there is not a drop of rain he will give me a new gown the cogia said one of you two may be worth a cucumber but which of the two god knows i dont one day the cogia being at siouri castle he saw a great many people assembled to look at the moon what a strange land is this said the cogia in our country they pay no attention to the moon when it is as big as a cart wheel but here when it is quite new and of scarcely any size what a number of people assemble to look at it once as nasr eddin efendi was walking in belgrade he cried out o lord give me a thousand altoons but if one be wanting i will not take the rest now these words of the cogia were heard by a neighbour of his a jew who in order to try the cogia put nine hundred and ninetynine altoons into a purse and flung it down the cogias chimney the cogia sees a purse full of money before him up he gets and saying our prayer has been accepted he opens the purse andcounting the altoons finds that one is wanting never mind says he he who gives these can give one more and takes possession of the money the jew now began to be in a fidget and getting up knocked at the cogias door good day cogia efendi said he please to give me back my altoons quoth the cogia to the jew you are a merchant and not a fool i made a request to god on high he gave me what i asked what business had you to fling altoons to me the jew said o cogia of my soul i said i will have a jest with you on hearing you say if one is wanting i will not take the rest i said to myself i will see whether you will or not i did it merely in jest jest said the cogia i know nothing of jest i accepted the gold come come said the jew we will go before the judge said the cogia i will not go on foot before the judge thereupon the jew brought the cogia a mule very good said the cogia but i must now have a pelisse for my back the jew brought him the pelisse and they set off to the tribunal of the cadi the cadi asking what they came for the jew said this man took from me so many altoons and now he denies having done so the cadi looked in the cogias face whereupon the cogia said my lord i asked in prayer of the most high a thousand altoons which he gave on counting them however i found that one was wanting whereupon i said he who gives so many altoons will doubtless give one more and i accepted them but my lord this jew says that the pelisse which you see on my back and the mule on which i am mounted are also his yes assuredly my lord said the jew for mine they are both no sooner had he said these words than every one cried out upon you you jew rascal and rushing upon him they broke his head and kicked him out of the tribunal and the cogia was sent home to his house in triumph not only with the altoons but the pelisse and the mule beside one day cogia efendi went to a bridal festival the master of the feast observing his old and wretched garments paid him no consideration whatever the cogia saw that he had no chance of notice so going out he hurried to his house and putting on a splendid pelisse returned to the place of festival no sooner did he enter the door than the master advanced to meet him and saying welcome cogia efendi with all imaginable honour and reverence placed him at the head of the table and said please to eat lord cogia forthwith the cogia taking hold of one of the furs of his pelisse said welcome my pelisse please to eat my lord the master looking at the cogia with great surprise said what are you about whereupon the cogia replied it is quite evident that all the honour paid is paid to my pelisse so let it have some food too nasr eddin efendi going one day into a city found the doctors of the law eating and drinking no sooner did they see the cogia than they showed him great honour and brought him food it happened that that year was a year of famine and the cogia whilst eating and drinking said to himself no doubt this city must be one in which provisions are very cheap and asked a man who was by him whether it were not so the man replied are you mad this day is beiram every one according to his means cooks meat in his house and brings it forth and on that account the food is plentiful ah my good man said the cogia i wish that every day was beiram one day cogia efendi led a cow to the market for sale backwards and forwards he led it but was unable to sell it presently a man advancing to the cogia said why do you hold this cow in your hand without selling it said the cogia i have led it about since the morning and notwithstanding all the fine things that i have said about it i have been unable to sell it the individual taking the cow from the cogias hand began to walk it about exclaiming who will buy a young girl six months gone with child forthwith buyers followed at his heels and a very considerable sum was offered the cogia very much surprised took the money for the cow and went running to his house the inspectors however coming took away the cogias daughter whereupon his wife said o cogia do you stay a little the inspecting matrons have been for the girl i will now go to them and will give the necessary character so that they will take our daughter being satisfied with what i say quoth the cogia efendi no no wife do not open your mouth i have now learnt various praises fitted for her i will go and tell them do you see how they will be pleased with them so he went to the inspecting matrons who as soon as they saw him said o cogia efendi what have you to do with us matrons get you gone and let the girls mother come said the cogia efendi it is not the duty of the girls mother to give information with respect to any talents which the girl may possess whatever questions you may have to ask with respect to the talents we may have observed do you ask of me quoth the matrons let us hear you dilate a little on her talents ladies said the cogia if the girl is not six months gone with child she is my property the ladies on hearing this looked at each other and getting up went away said the cogias wife o cogia why did you drive the matrons away by using such words to them dont you fear wife said the cogia if they go through the whole country they will not find a girl of this description so let them go and come back but to tell you the truth if i had not praised the cow in this manner i should have found no purchaser for her one day cogia nasr eddin efendi as he was winding the muslin of his turban perceived that it was not long enough he again tried all he could to bring it to a point but in vain the cogia in great distress took the muslin and going to the public mart put it up to auction whilst it was being bid for a person came and bought it whereupon the cogia going softly up to him said brother dont take that thick thing it is too short for a turban you cant bring it to a point one day an individual coming to the cogia said something for my good news cogia efendi you have a son born to you if i have a son born to me said the cogia i owe thanks to god but what do i owe to you one day a man coming to the cogia asked him for the loan of his ass stay here said the cogia whilst i go and consultthe animal if the ass is willing to be lent i will let you have him thereupon he went in and after staying for a time came out and said the ass is not willing and has said to me if you lend me to others i shall overhear all the evil things that they say of your wife one day the cogia mounting his ass set off for his garden on the road wanting to make water he took off his woollen vest and placing it on the packsaddle of his ass he went aside a thief coming up took the woollen vest and ran away with it the cogia returning saw that the vest was gone whereupon taking the packsaddle from the back of the ass he put it upon his own shoulders and giving the ass a cut with his whip he said you lost my vest so i take your saddle one day cogia nasr eddin efendi mounting his ass again set out on the way wanting to make water he again laid his vest upon the ass and went aside a person who had his eye upon him instantly seized the vest and ran away just at that time the ass began to bray the cogia hearing him shouted out the ass brays the ass criesno good sign the person however hearing the braying and the shouting cast the vest upon the ground and made his escape one day cogia efendi having lost his ass inquired of a certain individual whether he had seen him i saw him said the individual in a certain town officiating as cadi you say true said the cogia i knew he would be a cadi for i observed when i taught him the principles of philosophy that his ears were not sewed up one day nasr eddin efendi went to the mountain to cut wood after he had cut the wood he loaded his ass and began to drive him home the efendis ass however would hardly move a person coming up said put a little sal ammoniac into the of the ass the cogia finding a little sal ammoniac put it in whereupon the ass began to run so quickly that the cogia was left far behind i would fain see the cause of this said the cogia and clapped a little of the sal ammoniac to his own no sooner had he done so than the cogias posterior began to swell and he set off running so quickly that he soon got before the ass and ran straight home but not being able to contain himself in the house he ran about it and observing his wife he said o wife whenever you wish me to get me on do you stick a little sal ammoniac in my one day a man came to the house of the cogia and asked him to lend him his ass he is not at home replied the cogia but it so happened that the ass began to bray within o cogia efendi said the man you say that the ass is not at home and there he is braying within what a strange fellow you are said the cogia you believe the ass but will not believe a greybearded man like me one day the cogia said to his wife o wife how do you know when a man is dead i know it by his hands and feet being cold said she one day as the cogia was going to the mountain for wood he felt cold in his hands and feet whereupon he said i am a dead man and laid himself down at the foot of a tree some wolves however coming up and beginning to devour his ass the cogia shouted to the wolves from the place where he was lying the ass is dead it seems and not the master one day as the cogia was cutting wood in the mountain a wolf coming up to his ass began to devour it but on seeing the cogia it took the ass and went away a man who saw what happened cried out there he goes whereupon the cogia said hallo man why do you cry out you must not hinder a wolf who has dined from mounting one day as the cogia was conducting his ass to the market the tail of the animal becoming draggled with mud the cogia cut it off and put it into a sack arriving at the market he put up the ass to auction and on a person crying out what is the use of this tailless creature he said dont you leave your tail in the desert when you come to market one day as the cogia was coming from a distant place his ass chanced to be very thirsty when all of a sudden they arrived at the margin of a pool unfortunately however the sides of the pool were very steep and the ass of the cogia on seeing the water not being able to restrain himself ran forward to the pool just as he was falling in the frogs of the pool began to croak violently their voices frightening the ass he ran back the cogia however seized hold of him and exclaiming bravo ye birds of the pool he took out a handful of aspres and flung them into the pool saying heres something for sweetmeats take and eat in the time of cogia nasr eddin efendi three priests who showed themselves versed in every kind of learning travelling through the world at last came to the country of the soldan ala eddin the emperor invited them to accept the true faith whereupon the three said each one of us has a question to ask and if you can give us an answer we will adopt your religion all agreed to this condition and soldan ala eddin having assembled his ulemas and sheiks not one of them was able to make any reply to the questions of the strangers the soldan ala eddin was very much incensed and mortified and exclaimed so there is not one of the ulemas and sheiks in the countries beneath my jurisdiction who can answer these fellows whereupon one of the ulemas replied though none of us can answer these questions perhaps cogia nasr eddin efendi can the emperor on hearing these words gave orders to his tartar messengers to go in quest of nasr eddin efendi the tartars with all imaginable speed went their way and having found the cogia communicated to him the commands of the sultan nasr eddin that moment saddling his ass took his staff in his hand and mounting the animal said to the tartar lead the way and set off straight for the palace of soldan ala eddin on his arrival he went into the presence of the emperor to whom he said salaam and received the same salutation from thesultan who pointing out a place to him bade him sit down said the cogia to the emperor after wishing him a blessing for what may it have pleased you to summon me whereupon the soldan ala eddin told him the whole circumstance the cogia forthwith turning to the priests said what are your questions then one of the priests coming forward said may it please your efendiship my question is this where may the middle of the earth be thereupon the cogia instantly dismounting from his ass pointed with his staff to the fore foot of the ass saying the middle of the earth is the spot on which my asss foot stands how do you know that said the priest if you doubt my words said the cogia take a measure and see whether it comes to more or less another of the priests coming forward said how many stars are there in the face of the heaven above us said the cogia as many hairs as there are upon my ass so many stars are there in the heaven how do you know said the priest if you doubt said the cogia come and count and if there is any difference say at once have you counted then said the priest the hairs upon your ass and have you counted how many stars there are said the cogia then another priest coming forward said if you can answer my question the whole of us will adopt your religion speak said the cogia let us hear it tell me o cogia said the priest how many hairs there are in this beard of mine just as many said the cogia as there are hairs in my asss tail how do you know said the priest soul of mine said the cogia if you dont believe come and count the priest would not consent if you will not consent said the cogia come let us pluck hair for hair from your beard and from the asss tail and see if they dont tally the priest seeing that he had the worst of the argument turned to the way of truth and forthwith said to his companions i embrace the faith of islam and acknowledged the unity of god the two others also with heart and soul embraced the true faith and the whole three became servants and disciples of the cogia nasr eddin efendi one day placed three plums upon a great table and set out in order to carry them as a present to the bey on the way the plums chancing to dance on this side and that the cogia said i will now eat you until i leave one to dance by itself so the cogia ate two of the plums and carrying one upon the table placed it before the bey who being very much delighted with the plum which the cogia brought presented him with a great deal of money the cogia went home and a few days after taking a number of beetroots set out again in order to carry them to the bey as he was going along he met an individual who said to the cogia to whom are you carrying those things i am carrying them to the bey said the cogia if you were to carry him some figs instead said the individual he would like it better the cogia instantly went and procured a few pounds of figs which he carried to the bey who ordered his attendants to fling them all at his head some of the figs striking the cogias head he forthwith began to cry out thank god thank god how is this cogia said they why do you thank god i was bringing a great quantity of beetroots said the cogia but meeting an individual on the road he advised me to bring these instead now if i had brought beetroots my head would have been broken the cogia going on another day to visit the bey the bey took him out ahunting but mounted him on a goodfornothing horse as they were hunting it began to rain every one escaped by means of his horse but the goodfornothing horse would scarcely move the cogia forthwith stripping himself naked took his garments and sat down upon them no sooner was the rain over than he got up and having dressed himself he went to the bey said the bey it is a wonder you escaped a wetting said the cogia i was mounted on a horse that was a great goer he flew away with me so fast that i escaped the rain the bey believed every word that he said on another day the bey again went out ahunting but he now rode that same horse himself whilst the cogia was mounted on another now it so pleased god that it again began to rain every one escaped as fast as he could but the bey on the goodfornothing horse was left behind and at last reached home creeping along like a crane he was very much incensed at what the cogia had told him and the next day addressed him in this manner was it fit and proper that you should tell me the lie you did and cause me to be wet through by the rain which god sent said the cogia why are you angry with me why had you not sense enough to strip off your clothes as i did and sit upon them and when the rain was over dress yourself and come here one day the bey sent this message to the cogia come i intend to play the jerreed with you for i wish to have a little jerreed playing now the cogia had an old ox which saddling immediately he mounted and rode to the place where they played at the jerreed no sooner did the people see him than they fell to laughing and the bey said o cogia why did you mount that ox for it cant run cant it said the cogia i have seen it when it was a calf running so fast that no horse could overtake it one day tamerlank invited the cogia to dine with him the cogia accepted the invitation and mounting his ass taking the groom along with him set out saying now tamerlank where may you be when he came to the emperor timour shah pointing to a place bade him sit down the cogia seeing that timour shah sat with one foot supported on a cushion when he sat down stretched out his own leg and placed it upon a corner of the cushion timour shah being very much offended that the cogia stretched out his leg as he did said to himself if i do so i have an excuse and i am also a king and then said to the cogia when you mount your ass what is the difference between you and him the cogia replied my emperor only this cushion divides us which is placed upon his back the shah perceiving the taunt was very much incensed and determined to mortify the cogia the food being brought they began to eat and presently timour without any cause sneezed in the cogias face the cogia when he saw tamerlank do this said my emperor is it not ill manners to do so it is not in our country said tamerlank forthwith the cogia let a and when tamerlank said is not that ill manners he replied it is not reckoned so in our country the repast being over the sherbet was brought and then the cogia getting up set off on his way home why did you break wind in the presence of timoursaid the groom answered the cogia when the imam the assembly breaks up one day the cogia roasted a goose and set out in order to carry it to the emperor on the way feeling very hungry he cut off one leg and ate it coming into the presence of the emperor he placed the goose before him on seeing it tamerlank said to himself the cogia is making game of me and was very angry and demanded how happens it that this goose has but one foot said the cogia in our country all the geese have only one foot if you disbelieve me look at the geese by the side of that fountain now at that time there was a flock of geese by the rim of the fountain all of whom were standing on one leg timour instantly ordered that all the drummers should at once play up the drummers began to strike with their sticks and forthwith all the geese stood on both legs on timour saying dont you see that they have two legs the cogia replied if you keep up that drumming you yourself will presently have four cogia efendi now at rest with god having been made cadi two individuals came before him one of whom said this fellow nearly bit my ear off the other said not so i did not bite it but he bit his own ear the cogia said come again in a little time and i will give you an answer the men went away and the cogia going into a private place seized hold of his ear i cant bite it said he then trying to rise from the ground on which he had seated himself he fell back and broke a part of his head forthwith wrapping a piece of cloth round his head he went back and sat in his place the two men coming and asking for his decision the cogia said no man can bite his own ear but if he tries may fall down and break his head once as the cogia was lying in bed at midnight a noise was heard in the street before the door said the cogia to his wife get up and light a candle and i will go and see you had better stay within said his wife but the cogia without heeding his wife put the counterpane on his shoulders and went out a fellow perceiving him instantly snatched the counterpane from off his shoulders and ran away the cogia shivering with cold went in again and when his wife asked him the cause of the noise he said it was on account of our counterpane when they got that the noise ceased at once one day the cogias wife said to him nurse this child for a little time for i have a little business to see after the cogia taking the child sat with him upon his lap presently however the child p upon the cogia whereupon the cogia getting up p over the child from head to foot his wife coming said o cogia why have you acted in this manner i would have over him said the cogia if he had done so over me one day the cogias wife having washed the cogias kaftan hung it upon a tree to dry the cogia going out saw as he supposed a man standing in the tree with his arms stretched out says the cogia to his wife o wife go and fetch me my bow and arrow his wife fetched and brought them to him the cogia taking an arrow shot it and pierced the kaftan and stretched it on the ground then returning he made fast his door and lay down to sleep going out in the morning he saw that what he had shot was his own kaftan thereupon sitting down he cried aloud o god be thanked if i had been in it i should have certainly been killed one day the cogia going to the college mounted into the car in the rear of the moolahs said the moolahs o cogia why did you mount backwards if i got in straightways said the cogia you would be at my back if you went before me your backs would be in my face therefore i mounted in this manner one night as the cogia was lying in his bed he perceived a thief moving upon the housetop now the cogias wife was lying at his side and he said to her o wife last night wishing to enter the house i repeated this prayer and descended the chimney on the rays of the moon the thief above heard these words of the cogia and after a little time repeating the prayer which the cogia had repeated essayed to go down the chimney upon the rays of the moon but tumbled down headlong the cogia who was not yet sleep rising in haste seized the thief by the collar and cried out o wife be quick and light a candle for i have caught a thief hereupon the thief exclaimed humorously o cogia efendi dont be in a hurry the virtue in that prayer being in me was rather too much for me and so i tumbled down here nasr eddin efendi had an old ox which had exceedingly great horns and so far apart that it was possible for a person to sit between them every time that the ox drew nigh the cogia was in the habit of saying to himself how i should like to sit between his horns and calculating as to the possibility of doing so one day the ox came and laid himself down before the house cries the cogia now is my time and mounting he took his seat betwixt the oxs two horns presently however the ox rising upon his legs flung the cogia upon the ground where he lay for some time quite senseless his wife coming and seeing him lying motionless began to lament after some time the cogia recovering a little on seeing his wife weeping by his side exclaimed o wife do not weep i have suffered a great deal but i have had my desire one day a thief got into the cogias house cries his wife o cogia there is a thief in the house dont make any disturbance says the cogia i wish to god that he may find something so that i may take it from him one day the cogias wife said to him go and lie down yonder a little way off the cogia getting up forthwith took his shoes in his hand and walked during two days at the end of which meeting a man he said go and ask my wifewhether i have gone far enough or must go yet farther one night as the cogia was lying with his wife he said o wife if you love me get up and light a candle that i may write down a verse which has come into my head his wife getting up lighted the candle and brought him pen and inkstand the cogia wrote and his wife said o efendi of my soul wont you read to me what you have written whereupon the cogia read amongst the green leaves methinks i see a black hen go with a red bill one day the cogia being ill a number of women came to inquire about his health one of the women said god knows whether you will die but if you do what shall we say when we lament over you say this said the cogia when you lament over me notwithstanding all he did he could never understand everything cogia efendi every time he returned to his house was in the habit of bringing a piece of liver which his wife always gave to a common woman placing before the cogia leavened patties to eat when he came home in the evening one day the cogia said o wife every day i bring home a liver where do they all go to the cat runs away with all of them replied the wife thereupon the cogia getting up put his hatchet in the trunk and locked it up says his wife to the cogia for fear of whom do you lock up the hatchet for fear of the cat replied the cogia what should the cat do with the hatchet said the wife why replied the cogia as he takes a fancy to the liver which costs two aspres is it not likely that he will take a fancy to the hatchet which costs four one day the wife of the cogia wanted to go to the bath now the cogia had a little money which he kept in a corner hid from his wife as she went out of the door she looked back stay said the cogia i am just dead and heres a little money i have left behind me one day the cogia and his wife went to the side of a pool in order to wash their linen as they were making a beginning with their linen by beating it upon the plain and using soap to it a raven coming seized the soap and flew away with it o cogia shrieked the wife the raven has taken away the soap say nothing wife said the cogia it was dirty enough after our using it let him take it and wash it one day the cogia and his wife made an agreement to copulate every friday night the wife was perfectly satisfied with the arrangement but said the cogia let us agree upon a sign by which i may know that the time for doing my duty is come the wife said when friday night is come i will hang your turban above the alcove you will know by that that it is friday night good good said the cogia one night however which was not friday night the cogias wife being desirous for copulation as soon as she arose to go to bed placed the cogias turban above the alcove said the cogia o wife this is not friday night it is friday night said the wife whereupon the cogia said o wife in this house either let friday night keep the reckoning or let me one day the cogias wife went with the wife of a neighbour to wash at a pool it happened that the governor of the country who was taking a walk came up and looked at them said the wife of the cogia pray man what are you looking at who is that woman said the governor to some one who was standing by she is the wife of cogia nasr eddin efendi replied the individual on the following day the governor sending for the cogia said to him is such and such a woman your wife yes said the cogia she is my wife said the governor go and bring her to me what do you want with her said the cogia i have a question to ask her said the governor do you only tell me the question said the cogia and i will go and put it to her one day some people said to the cogias son what is padligean it is a little deaf thing which walks without opening its eyes said the child it did not know that of itself i taught it said the cogia one day a chariot departed for the castle of siouri the cogia also set off for that place running quite naked the drivers on arriving at the town having given information of the cogias coming all the people came out to meet him who on seeing him quite naked said o cogia efendi why do you come in this manner from the love i bore you said the cogia i was in such a hurry in dressing that i forgot my clothes the cogia had a scalt head once he went to the barber had his head shaved paid an aspre and went away the following week he went again was shaved and had a lookingglass placed before him as the half of my head is scalt said the cogia is not an aspre for shaving it too much by half one day the cogia went with some men afishing they cast the net into the sea and the cogia cast himself into the net o cogia said they what are you about i imagined myself a fish said the cogia one day the boys of the town said to one another come let us get the cogia to climb a tree and we will steal away his sandals the boys coming to the foot of a tree stopped and said no one can climb this tree the cogia coming up said i can climb it no you cant said they forthwith the cogia tied the skirts of his robe about his loins and put his sandals in his bosom o cogia efendi said the boys what will you do with your slippers in the tree said the cogia if i find a road when i am above there i shall have my slippers ready to put onone day a man coming from the country brought the cogia a hare the cogia with much politeness and civility gave him some broth to eat at the end of a week he came again but the cogia appearing to have forgot him said who may you be i am the person who brought the hare said the man whereupon the cogia again entertained him after some days a number of men made their appearance and wanted to be entertained who may you be said the cogia we are the neighbours of the man who brought you the hare said they a few days after a whole troop of men arriving the cogia asked them who they were we are the neighbours of the neighbours of the man who brought the hare said they you are quite welcome said the cogia and placed before them a large jar of pure water on seeing which they said what is this the water of the water of the hare is what it is said the cogia one day the cogia whilst labouring in the field found a tortoise and seizing hold of it tied a string round its neck and hung it to his spade the tortoise beginning to cry and squeal it is of no use crying said the cogia you must now learn to work one day the cogia being on the point of death called his neighbours about him the neighbours coming began to eat and make merry without saying to the cogia come and partake the cogia incensed got up and went out after a little time they sought for the cogia and could not find him so dispersing themselves about they went after him and at last found him ho cogia said they come where have you got to said the cogia he who this day supplies the bridal meats has surely a right to go into the bridal chamber one day the cogia being out on a journey encamped along with a caravan and tied up his horse along with the others when it was morning the cogia could not find his horse amongst the rest not knowing how to distinguish it forthwith taking a bow and arrow in his hand he said men men i have lost my horse every one laughing took his own horse and the cogia looking saw a horse which he instantly knew to be his own forthwith placing his right foot in the stirrup he mounted the horse so that his face looked to the horses tail o cogia said they why do you mount the horse the wrong way it is not my fault said he but the horses for the horse is lefthanded the cogia had a disciple who was an abyssinian black of the name of hamet one day hamet having inadvertently broken a bottle of ink over the cogia what is this cogia said the others dont you think a few good kicks would be a useful lesson to our hamet let him be he got into a sweat by running said the cogia and melted over me one day the cogia having mounted up into the pulpit said o mussulmen i have a piece of advice to give you if you have sons take care that you do not give them the name of eiïoub job why o cogia cried the people lest the quality should accompany the name he replied and they should all become ips ropes one day as the cogia was performing ablution he found he had not sufficient water when the hour of prayer came on he stood like a goose on one foot o cogia efendi said the people why do you do so because said the cogia this foot has not performed ablution one day a man arriving became the guest of the cogia it happened at night some time after they had lain down that the light went out o cogia efendi said the guest the taper is gone out but there is a taper on your right side pray bring it and let us light it surely you must be a fool said the cogia how should i know my right side in the dark one day they said to the cogia pray what may be your horoscope said the cogia i was born under the sign of the hegoat o cogia said they there is no such sign as the hegoat said the cogia when i was a child my mother had my horoscope taken and at that time the kid was in the ascension o cogia said they thats all right but a kid is one thing and a hegoat is another said the cogia o you simpletons forty or fifty years have passed since then must not the kid have become an old goat one day whilst the cogia was holding an oration at the castle of siouri he was contradicted by the soubashi or superintendent shortly after it happened that the soubashi died and was buried whereupon they said come efendi preach a sermon over him you must find some one else said the cogia he wont mind my words for he always contradicts me one day two men were sitting together in a shop before their houses engaged in discourse their houses abutted upon each other and it so happened that a dog came and deposited his dirt on the ground in the middle of the street before their houses said one it is nigh your house nay my good friend said the other it is nearest to your house so you must go and take it up so they got into a dispute and not being able to settle it they went before the tribunal now it happened that the cogia had come that day to pay a visit to the cadi and sat beside him said the cadi to the cogia do you decide upon their dispute thereupon the cogia said to them is not that street a public way it is said they then said he one half of the perfumery belongs to you two and the other half to the cadi one day the cogia put a yoke upon a calf which he had the calf ran here and there forthwith the cogia seizing a stick fell to banging his ox o cogia said the people why do you beat the ox how can he be in fault all the fault is his said the cogia if he had taught him the calf would have known how to turnone day as the cogia was travelling in the derbend he met a shepherd said the shepherd to the cogia art thou a faquir yes said the cogia said the shepherd see these seven men who are lying here they were men like you whom i killed because they could not answer questions which i asked now in the first place let us come to an understanding if you can answer my questions let us hold discourse if not let us say nothing says the cogia what may your questions be said the shepherd the moon when it is new is small afterwards it increases until it looks like a wheel after the fifteenth it diminishes and does not remain then again there is a little one of the size of hilal which does remain now what becomes of the old moons says the cogia how is it that you dont know a thing like that they take those old moons and make lightning of them have you not seen them when the heaven thunders glittering like so many swords bravo faquir said the shepherd well art thou acquainted with the matter i had come to the same conclusion myself nasr eddin efendi now with god had a sum of money one day when all was quiet in the house he dug in the earth and buried it then going to the door he looked out and said ill suppose myself a thief and that i find this and forthwith take it away and bury it in another place and my heart is no more troubled about it thus saying he came and took up his treasure now before the house there was a height and the cogia going to the garden of the house cut a pole and putting the money in a sack tied the sack to the top of the pole and bringing the pole stuck it up on the top of the height then going down he looked upwards and said unless a man is a bird he cannot fly up to that i have surely chosen a good place and having said this he went away now it happened that a thief saw all that cogia did and no sooner was the cogia gone than he climbed up the height and took down the money and putting upon the top of the pole a quantity of bullocks dung he stuck up the pole again and went his way some time afterwards the cogia being in need of money came to the foot of the pole and saw that all the money was gone and that a quantity of bullocks dung was on the pole said he i said that no man could mount this pole and take away the money but how bullocks dung should get to the top of the pole is a very strange matter indeed so said the cogia may the lord have mercy upon him one day as the cogia was going to his house he met a number of students and said to them gentlemen pray this night come to our house and taste a sup of the old fathers broth very good said the students and following the cogia came to the house pray enter said he and brought them into the house then going up to where his wife was o wife said he i have brought some travellers that we may give them a cup of broth o master said his wife is there oil in the house or rice or have you brought any that you wish to have broth bless me said the cogia give me the broth pan and snatching it up he forthwith ran to where the students were and exclaimed pray pardon me gentlemen but had there been oil or rice in our house this is the pan in which i would have served the broth up to you one day the cogia going into the kitchen of his house laid himself down presently the cogias daughter entering into the kitchen to fetch something saw her father lying hidden behind a cask o my lord and father what do you do here said she what could i better do to get out of your mothers way than come into this foreign country said the cogia one day when the cogia was in his chamber a man knocked at the door of the house what do you want said the cogia from above come down said the man who was a beggar the cogia forthwith came down and said what do you want i want your charity said the man come upstairs said the cogia when the beggar had come up the cogia said god help you o master said the other why did you not say so below said the cogia when i was above stairs why did you bring me down once upon a time the wife of the cogia was in labour one day two days she sat upon the chair but could not bring forth the women who attended her cried from the interior apartment to the cogia o master do you know no prayer by means of which the child may be brought into the world i know a specific said the cogia and forthwith running to a grocers shop he procured some walnuts and bringing them he said make way and going into the room he spread the walnuts under the chair and said now that the child sees the walnuts he will come out to play with them one day the cogias wife in order to plague the cogia boiled some broth exceedingly hot brought it into the room and placed it on the table the wife then forgetting that it was hot took a spoon and put some into her mouth and scalding herself began to shed tears o wife said the cogia what is the matter with you is the broth hot dear efendi said the wife my mother who is now dead loved broth very much i thought of that and wept on her account the cogia thinking that what she said was truth took a spoonful of the broth and burning his mouth began to cry and bellow what is the matter with you said his wife why do you cry said the cogia you cry because your mother is gone but i cry because her daughter is here one day the cogias wife went to the hall of preaching and after listening to the sermon came home said the cogia o wife what did the preacher say he said replied the wife that if any one has a nights copulation with his lawful wife the almighty god will build for him a mansion in paradise after they had gone to bed the cogia said come let us build a house in paradise thereupon they copulated shortly afterwards the wife said o cogia you have built a house for yourself pray now build a house for me said the cogia i could easily build a house for you but i fear that i should have to build houses for your father and mother and not only for them but for all your family and relations so that themaster builder above would become angry come one house must suffice for us two one day the cogia met a company of young students and said unto them pray come along with me to our house so he led them to the door of the house and then said pray stay here a little whilst i go in then going in he said o wife pray go and send those people away whereupon the wife went and said the cogia is not come home said the students what do you mean by talking so the cogia came hither in our company he did not come said the wife but he did said the students and made a great outcry the cogia hearing a noise from above thrust his head out of the window exclaiming holloa my men what is all this dispute for you must know that this house has two doors no sooner did i come in by one than i left the house by the other one day the son of the cogia said o father i know that i was begotten by you his mother becoming very angry said what nonsense is the brat talking that he calls himself the son of a whore said the cogia o wife dont be angry he is a wise son if he knows what he says he does once on a time there was a drunken governor of siouri castle it happened one day that he lay in a state of drunkenness in the garden and the cogia taking a walk in the garden with amad came up and found him lying drunk and insensible the cogia instantly stripped him of his feradje or upper coat and putting it on his own back walked away on the other hand the governor on getting up saw that he had lost his feradje and going to his officers gave them the following command whomsoever you find with my feradje upon him lay hold on and bring him before me the officials seeing the feradje on the back of the cogia made him their prisoner and brought him before the governor who said to him ho cogia where did you find that feradje as i was taking a walk with amad said the cogia we saw a fellow lying drunk whereupon amad twice uncovered his breech and i taking off his feradje went away with it if it is yours pray take it oh no it does not belong to me said the governor one day the cogia having lain down to sleep on the bank of a river imagined himself dead an individual coming up said i wonder where one could cross this water said the cogia when i was alive i crossed over here but now i cant tell you where you should cross one day a persian barber was shaving the cogias head at every stroke of his razor he cut his head and to every place which he cut he applied a piece of cotton said the cogia to the barber my good fellow you had better sow half of my head with cotton and let me sow the other half with flax one time the cogia went to the well to draw water but seeing the face of the moon reflected in the well he exclaimed the moon has fallen into the well i must pull it out then going home he took a rope and hook and returning cast it into the well where the hook became fastened against a stone the cogia exerting all his might pulled at the rope once twice but at the second pulling the rope snapped and he fell upon his back and looking up into the heaven saw the moon whereupon he exclaimed o praise and glory i have suffered much pain but the moon has got to its place again one day the cogia going into a persons garden climbed up into an apricottree and began to eat the apricots the master coming said cogia what are you doing here dear me said the cogia dont you see that i am a nightingale sitting in the apricottree said the gardener let me hear you sing the cogia began to warble whereupon the other fell to laughing and said do you call that singing i am a persian nightingale said the cogia and persian nightingales sing in this manner the cogia now with god was master of all learning and perfect in every art if some people should now say we were in hope of receiving instruction from his sayings but have read nothing but the ravings of madness and if they should require some other book of his utterances we must tell them that he uttered nothing beyond what is noted here some people say that whilst uttering what seemed madness he was in reality divinely inspired and that it was not madness but wisdom that he uttered the mercy of god be upon him mercy without bounds
