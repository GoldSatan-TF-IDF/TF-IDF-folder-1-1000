ian rankin black book to the wicked all things are wicked but to the just all things are just and right james hogg the private memoirs and confessions of a justified sinner acknowledgements the author wishes to acknowledge the assistance of the chandlerfulbright award in the writing of this book prologue there were two of them in the van that early morning lights on to combat the haar which blew in from the north sea it was thick and white like smoke they drove carefully being under strict instructions why does it have to be us said the driver stifling a yawn whats wrong with the other two the passenger was much larger than his companion though in his forties he kept his hair long cut in the shape of a german military helmet he kept pulling at the hair on the left side of his head straightening it out at the moment however he was gripping the sides of his seat he didnt like the way the driver screwed shut his eyes for the duration of each toofrequent yawn the passenger was not a conversationalist but maybe talk would keep the driver awake its just temporary he said besides its not as if its a daily chore thank god for that the driver shut his eyes again and yawned the van glided in towards the grass verge do you want me to drive asked the passenger then he smiled you could always kip in the back very funny thats another thing jimmy the stink meat always smells after a while got an answer for everything eh yes are we nearly there i thought you knew the way on the main roads i do but with this mist if were hugging the coast it cant be far the passenger was also thinking if were hugging the coast then two wheels past the verge and were over a cliff face it wasnt just this that made him nervous theyd never used the east coast before but there was too much attention on the west coast now so it was an untried run and that made him nervous heres a road sign they braked to peer through the haar next right the driver jolted forwards again he signalled and pulled in through a low iron gate which was padlocked open what if it had been locked he offered ive got cutters in the back a bloody answer for everything they drove into a small gravelled car park though they could not see them there were wooden tables and benches to one side where sunday families could picnic and do battle with the midges the spot was popular for its view an uninterrupted spread of sea and sky when they opened their doors they could smell and hear the sea gulls were already shrieking overhead must be later than we thought if the birds are up they readied themselves for opening the back of the van then did so the smell really was foul even the stoical passenger wrinkled his nose and tried hard not to breathe quicker the better he said in a rush the body had been placed in two thick plastic fertiliser sacks one pulled over the feet and one over the head so that they overlapped in the middle tape and string had been used to join them inside the bags were also a number of breeze blocks making for a heavy and awkward load they carried the grotesque parcel low brushing the wet grass their shoes were squelching by the time they passed the sign warning about the cliff face ahead even more difficult was the climb over the fence though it was rickety enough to start with wouldnt stop a bloody kid the driver commented he was peching the saliva like glue in his mouth ca canny said the passenger they shuffled forwards two inches at a time until they could all too clearly make out the edge there was no more land after that just a vertical fall to the agitated sea right he said without ceremony they heaved the thing out into space glad immediately to be rid of it lets go man but that air smells good the driver reached into his pocket for a quarterbottle of whisky they were halfway back to the van when they heard a car on the road and the crunch of tyres on gravel aw hells bells the headlights caught them as they reached the van the fuckin polis choked the driver keep the held warned the passenger his voice was quiet but his eyes burned ahead of him they heard a handbrake being engaged and the car door opened a uniformed officer appeared he was carrying a torch the headlights and engine had been left on there was no one else in the car the passenger knew the score this wasnt a setup probably the copper came here towards the end of his night shift thered be a flask or a blanket in the car coffee or a snooze before signing off for the day morning the uniform said he wasnt young and he wasnt used to trouble a saturday night punchup maybe or disputes between neighbouring farmers it had been another long boring night for him another night nearer his pension morning the passenger said he knew they could bluff this one if the driver stayed calm but then he thought im the conspicuous one a right peasouper eh said the policeman the passenger nodded thats why we stopped explained the driver thought wed wait it out very sensible the driver watched as the passenger turned to the van and started inspecting its rear driverside tyre giving it a kick he then walked to the rear passengerside and did the same before getting down on his knees to peer beneath the vehicle the policeman watched the performance too got a bit of trouble not really the driver said nervously but its best to be safe i see youve come a ways the driver nodded off up to dundee the policeman frowned from edinburgh why didnt you just stick to the motorway or the a the driver thought quickly weve a dropoff in tayport first even so the policeman started the driver watched as the passenger rose from his inspection now sited behind the policeman he was holding a rock in his hand the driver kept his eyes glued to the policemans as the rock rose then fell the monologue finished midsentence as the body slumped to the ground thats just beautiful what else could we do the passenger was already making for his door come on vamoose aye said the driver another minute and hed have spotted your er the passenger glowered at him what you mean is another minute and hedve smelt the booze on your breath he didnt stop glowering until the driver shrugged his agreement they turned the van and drove out of the car park the gulls were still noisy in the distance the police cars engine was turning over the headlights picked out the prone unconscious figure but the torch had broken in the fall it all happened because john rebus was in his favourite massage parlour reading the bible it all happened because a man walked in through the door in the mistaken belief that any massage parlour sited so close to a brewery and half a dozen good pubs had to be catering to friday night pay packets and anytime drunks and therefore had to be bent as a paperclip but the organ grinder godfearing tenant of the setup ran a clean shop a place where tired muscles were beaten mellow rebus was tired tired of arguments with patience aitken tired of the fact that his brother had turned up seeking shelter in a flat filled to the gunwales with students and most of all tired of his job it had been that kind of week on the monday evening hed had a call from his arden street flat the students hed rented to had patiences number and knew they could reach him there but this was the first time theyd ever had reason the reason was michael rebus hello john rebus recognised the voice at once mickey how are you john christ mickey where are you no scratch that i know where you are i mean michael was laughing softly its just i heard youd gone south didnt work out his voice dropped thing is john can we talk ive been dreading this but i really need to talk to you okay shall i come round there rebus thought quickly patience was picking up her two nieces from waverley station but all the samno stay where you are ill come over the students are a good lot maybe theyll fix you a cup of tea or a joint while youre waiting there was silence on the line then michaels voice i could have done without that the line went dead michael rebus had served three years of a fiveyear sentence for drug dealing during that time john rebus had visited his brother fewer than half a dozen times hed felt relief more than anything when upon rebus the st leonards years release michael had taken a bus to london that was two years ago and the brothers had not exchanged a word since but now michael was back bringing with him bad memories of a period in john rebuss life hed rather not remember the arden street flat was suspiciously tidy when he arrived only two of the student tenants were around the couple who slept in what had been rebuss bedroom he talked to them in the hallway they were just going out to the pub but handed over to him another letter from the inland revenue really rebus would have liked them to stay when they left there was silence in the flat rebus knew that michael would be in the living room and he was crouched in front of the stereo and flipping through stacks of records look at this lot michael said his back still to rebus the beatles and the stones same stuff you used to listen to remember how you drove dad daft what was that record player agai a dansette thats it dad got it saving cigarette coupons michael stood up and turned towards his brother hello john hello michael they didnt hug or shake hands they just sat down rebus on the chair michael on the sofa this place has changed michael said i had to buy a few sticks of furniture before i could rent it out already rebus had noticed a few thingscigarette burns on the carpet posters against his explicit instructions sellotaped to the wallpaper he opened the taxmans letter you should have seen them leap into action when i told them you were coming round hoovering and washing dishes who says students are lazy theyre okay so when did this all happen a few months ago they told me youre living with a doctor her names patience michael nodded he looked pale and ill rebus tried not to be interested but he was the letter from the tax office hinted strongly that they knew he was renting his flat and didnt he want to declare the income the back of his head was tingling it did that when he was fractious ever since it had been burned in the fire the doctors said there was nothing he or they could do about it except of course not get fractious he stuffed the letter into his pocket what do you want mickey bottom line john i need a place to stay just for a week or two till i can get on my feet rebus stared stonily at the posters on the walls as michael ran on he wanted to find wormoney was tighhed take any johe just needed a chance thats all john just one chance rebus was thinking patience had room in her flat of course there was space enough there even with the nieces staying but no way was rebus going to take his brother back to oxford terrace things werent going that well as it was his late hours and her late hours his exhaustion and hers his job involvement and hers rebus couldnt see michael improving things he thought i am not my brothers keeper but all the same we might squeeze you into the box room id have to talk to the students about it he couldnt see them saying no but it seemed polite to ask how could they say no he was their landlord and flats were hard to find especially good flats especially in marchmont that would be great michael sounded relieved he got up from the sofa and walked over to the door of the box room this was a large ventilated cupboard off the living room just big enough for a single bed and a chest of drawers if you took all the boxes and the rubbish out of it we could probably store all that stuff in the cellar said rebus standing just behind his brother john said michael the way i feel id be happy enough sleeping in the cellar myself and when he turned towards his brother there were tears in michael rebuss eyes on wednesday rebus began to realise that his world was a black comedy michael had been moved into the arden street flat without any fuss rebus had informed patience of his brothers return but had said little more than that she was spending a lot of time with her sisters girls anyway shed taken a few days off work to show them edinburgh it looked like hard going susan at fifteen wanted to do all the things which jenny aged eight didnt or couldnt rebus felt almost totally excluded from this female triumvirate though he would sneak into jennys room at night just to relive the magic and innocence of a child asleep he also spent time trying to avoid susan who seemed only too aware of the differences between women and men he was kept busy at work which meant he didnt think about michael more than a few dozen times each day ah work now there was a thing when great london road police station had burnt down rebus had been moved to st leonards which was central districts divisional hq with him had come detective sergeant brian holmes and to both their dismays chief superintendent farmer watson and chief inspector fart lauderdale there had been compensationsnewer offices and furniture better amenities and equipmentbut not enough rebus was still trying to come to terms with his new workplace everything was so tidy he could never find anything as a result of which he was always keen to get out of the office and onto the street which was why he ended up at a butchers shop on south clerk street staring down at a stabbed man the man had already been tended to by a local doctor whod been standing in line waiting for some pork chops and gammon steaks when the man staggered into the shop the wound had been dressed initially with a clean butchers apron and now everyone was waiting for a stretcher to be unloaded from the ambulance outside a constable was filling rebus in i was only just up the road so he couldnt have been here more than five minutes when somebody told me and i came straight here thats when i radioed in rebus had picked up the constables radio message in his car and had decided to stop by he kind of wished he hadnt there was blood smeared across the floor colouring the sawdust which lay there why some butchers still scattered sawdust on their floors he couldnt say there was also a palmshaped daub of blood on the whitetiled wall and another less conclusive splash of the stuff below this the wounded man had also left a trail of gleaming drips outside all the way along and halfway up lutton place insultingly close to st leonards where they suddenly stopped kerbside the mans name was rory kintoul and he had been stabbed in the abdomen this much they knew they didnt know much more because rory kintoul was refusing to speak about the incident this was not an attitude shared by those who had been in the butchers at the time they were outside now passing on news of the excitement to the crowd who had stopped to gawp through the shop window it reminded rebus of saturday afternoon in the st james centre when pockets of men would gather outside the tv rental shops hoping to catch the football scores rebus crouched over kintoul just a little intimidatingly and where do you live mr kintoul but the man was not about to answer a voice came from the other side of the glass display case duncton terrace the speaker was wearing a bloodied butchers apron and cleaning a heavy knife on a towel thats in dalkeith rebus looked at the butcher and you ar jim bone this is my shop and you know mr kintoul kintoul had turned his head awkwardly seeking the butchers face as if trying to influence his answer but slouched as he was against the display case he would have required demonic possession to effect such a move i ought to said the butcher hes my cousin rebus was about to say something but at that moment the stretcher was trolleyed in by two ambulancemen one of whom almost skited on the slippery floor it was as they positioned the stretcher in front of kintoul that rebus saw something which would stay with him there were two signs in the display cabinet one pinned into a side of corned beef the other into a slab of red sirloin cold cuts one said the other stated simply fleshing a large fresh patch of blood was left on the floor as they lifted the butchers cousin cold cuts and fleshing rebus shivered and made for the door on the friday after work rebus decided on a massage he had promised patience hed be in by eight and it was only six now besides a brutal pummelling always seemed to set him up for the weekend but first he wandered into the broadsword for a pint of the local brew they didnt come more local than gibsons dark a heavy beer made only six hundred yards away at the gibson brewery a brewery a pub and a massage parlour rebus reckoned if you threw in a good indian restaurant and a corner shop open till midnight he could live happily here for ever and a day not that he didnt like living with patience in her oxford terrace garden flat it represented the other side of the tracks so to speak certainly it seemed a world away from this disreputable corner of edinburgh one of many such corners rebus wondered why he was so drawn to them the air outside was filled with the yeasty smell of beermaking vying with the even stronger aromas from the citys other much larger breweries the broadsword was a popular watering hole and like most of edinburghs popular pubs it boasted a mixed clientele students and low lifes with the occasional businessman the bar had few pretensions all it had in its favour were good beer and a good cellar the weekend had already started and rebus was squeezed in at the bar next to a man whose immense alsatian dog was sleeping on the floor behind the barstools it took up the standing room of at least two adult men but nobody was asking it to shift further along the bar someone was drinking with one hand and keeping another proprietorial hand on a coatstand which rebus assumed theyd just bought at one of the nearby secondhand shops everyone at the bar was drinking the same dark brew though there were half a dozen pubs within a fiveminute walk of here only the broadsword stocked draught gibsons the other pubs being tied to one or other of the big breweries rebus started to wonder as the beer slipped down what effect it would have on his metabolism once the organ grinder got to work he decided against a refill and instead made for gees which was what the organ grinder had called his shop rebus liked the name it made the same sound customers made once the grinder himself got to workoh jeez but they were always careful not to say anything out loud the organ grinder didnt like to hear blasphemy on the massage table it upset him and nobody wanted to be in the hands of an upset organ grinder nobody wanted to be his monkey so there he was sitting with the bible in his lap waiting for his sixthirty appointment the bible was the only reading matter on the premises courtesy of the organ grinder himself rebus had read it before but didnt mind reading it again then the front door burst open wheres the girls eh this new client was not only misinformed but also considerably drunk there was no way the grinder would handle drunks wrong place pal rebus was about to make mention of a couple of nearby parlours which would be certain to offer the necessary thai assisted sauna and rubdown but the man stopped him with a thick pointed finger john bloody rebus you son of a shitebreeks rebus frowned trying to place the face his mind flipped through two decades of mug shots the man saw rebuss confusion and spread his hands wide deek torrance you dont remember rebus shook his head torrance was walking determinedly forward rebus clenched his fists ready for anything we went through parachute training together said torrance christ you must remember and suddenly rebus did remember he remembered everything the whole black comedy of his past they drank in the broadsword swopping stories deek hadnt lasted the parachute regiment after a year hed had enough and not too lon after that hed bought his way out of the army altogether too restless john that was my problem what was yours rebus shook his head and drank some more beer my problem deck you couldnt put a name to it but a name had been put to it first by mickeys sudden appearance and now by deek torrance ghosts both of them but rebus didnt want to be their scrooge he bought another round you always said you were going to try for the sas torrance said rebus shrugged it didnt work out the bar was busier than ever and at one point torrance was jostled by a young man trying to manoeuvre a double bass through the melee could you no leave that outside not around here torrance turned back to rebus did you see thon rebus merely smiled he felt good after the massage no one brings anything small into a bar around here he watched deek torrance grunt yes he remembered him now all right hed gotten fatter and balder his face was roughened and much fleshier than it had been he didnt even sound the same not exactly but there was that one characteristic the torrance grunt a man of few words deek torrance had been not now though now he had plenty to say so what do you do deek torrance grinned seeing youre a copper i better not say rebus bided his time torrance was drunk to the point of slavering sure enough he couldnt resist im in buying and selling mostly selling and what do you sell torrance leaned closer am i talking to the polis or an old pal a pal said rebus strictly offduty so what do you sell torrance grunted anything you like john im sort of like jenners department storonly i can get things they cant such as rebus was looking at the clock above the bar it couldnt be that late surely they always ran the clock ten minutes fast here but even so anything at all said torrance anything from a shag to a shooter you name it how about a watch rebus started winding his own mine only seems to go for a couple of hours at a stretch torrance looked at it longines he said pronouncing the word correctly you dont want to chuck that get it cleaned itll be fine mind you i could probably partex it against a role so you sell dodgy watches did i say that i dont recall saying that anything john whatever the client wants ill fetch it for him torrance winked listen what time do you make it torrance shrugged and pulled up the sleeve of his jacket he wasnt wearing a watch rebus was thinking hed kept his appointment with the grinder deek happy to wait for him in the anteroom and afterwards theyd still had time for a pint or two before he had to make his way home theyd had tw no three drinks so far maybe he was running a bit late he caught the barmans attention and tapped at his wrist twenty past eight called the barman id better phone patience said rebus but someone was using the public phone to cement some romance whats more theyd dragged the receiver into the ladies toilet so that they could hear above the noise from the bar the telephone cord was stretched taut ready to garotte anyone trying to use the toilets rebus bided his time then began staring at the wallmounted telephone cradle what the hell he pushed his finger down on the cradle released it then moved back into the throng of drinkers a young man appeared from inside the ladies toilet and slammed the receiver hard back into its cradle he checked for change in his pocket had none and started to make for the bar rebus moved in on the phone he picked it up but could hear no tone he tried again then tried dialling nothing something had obviously come loose when the man had slammed the receiver home shite on a stick it was nearly half past eight now and it would take fifteen minutes to drive back to oxford terrace he was going to pay dearly for this you look like you could use a drink said deek torrance when rebus joined him at the bar know what deek said rebus my lifes a black comedy oh well better than a tragedy eh rebus was beginning to wonder what the difference was he got back to the flat at twenty past nine probably patience had cooked a meal for the four of them probably shed waited fifteen minutes or so before eating shed have kept his meal warm for another fifteen minutes then dumped it if it was fish the cat would have eaten it otherwise its destination would be the compost heap in the garden this had happened before too many times really yet it kept on happening and rebus wasnt sure the excuses of an old friend or a broken watch would work any kind of spell the steps down to the garden flat were worn and slippery rebus took them carefully and so was slow to notice the large sports holdall which illuminated by the orange streetlamp was sitting on the rattan mat outside the front door of the flat it was his bag he unzipped it and looked in on top of some clothes and a pair of shoes there was a note he read it through twice dont bother trying the door ive bolted it ive also disconnected the doorbell and the phone is off the hook for the weekend ill leave another load of your stuff on the front step monday morning the note needed no signature rebus whistled a long breathy note then tried his key in the lock it didnt budge he pressed the doorbell no sound as a last resort he crouched down and peered in through the letterbox the hall was in darkness no sign of light from any of the rooms something came up he called no response i tried phoning i couldnt get through still nothing he waited a few more moments halfexpecting jenny at least to break the silence or susan she was a right stirrer of trouble and a heartbreaker too by the look of her bye patience he called bye susan bye jenny still silence im sorry he truly was just one of those weeks he said to himself picking up the bag on sunday morning in weak sunshine and a snell wind andrew mcphail sneaked back into edinburgh hed been away a long time and the city had changed everywhere and everything had changed he was still jetlagged from several days ago and poorer than he should have been due to londons inflated prices he walked from the bus station to the broughton area of town just off leith walk it wasnt a long walk but every step seemed heavy though his bags were light hed slept badly on the bus but that was nothing new he couldnt remember when hed last had a good nights sleep sleep without dreams the sun looked as though it might disappear at any minute thick clouds were pushing in over leith mcphail tried to walk faster he had an address in his pocket the address of a boarding house hed phoned last night and his landlady was expecting him she sounded nice on the phone but it was difficult to tell he wouldnt mind no matter what she was like so long as she kept quiet he knew that his leaving canada had been in the canadian newspapers and even in some of the american ones and he supposed that journalists here would be after him for a story hed been surprised at slipping so quietly into heathrow no one seemed to know who he was and that was good he wanted nothing but a quiet life though perhaps not as quiet as a few of the past years hed phoned his sister from london and asked her to check directory enquiries for a mrs mackenzie in the bellevue area directory enquiries in london hadnt gone out of their way to help melanie and her mother had lodged with mrs mackenzie when hed first met them before they moved in together alexis was a single parent a dss case mrs mackenzie had been a more sympathetic landlady than most not that hed ever visited melanie and her mum theremrs mackenzie wouldnt have liked it she didnt take lodgers much these days but she was a good christian and mcphail was persuasive he stood outside the house it was a plain twostorey construction finished off in grey pebbledash and ugly double glazing it looked just the same as the houses either side of it mrs mackenzie answered the door as though shed been ready for him for some time she fussed about in the living room and kitchen then led him upstairs to show him the bathroom and then finally his own bedroom it was no larger than a prison cell but had been nicely decorated sometime in the mids hed guess it was fine hed no complaints its lovely he told mrs mackenzie who shrugged her shoulders as if to say of course it is theres tea in the pot she said ill just go make us a cuppy then she remembered something no cooking in the room mind andrew mcphail shook his head i dont cook he said she thought of something else and crossed to the window where the net curtains were still closed here ill open these you can open a window too if you want some fresh air fresh air would be nice he agreed they both looked out of the window down onto the street its quiet she said not too much traffic of course theres always a wee bit of noise during the day mcphail could see what she was referring to there was an old school building across the road with a black iron fence in front of it it wasnt a large school probably primary mcphails window looked down onto the school gates just to the right of the main building directly behind the gates was the deserted playground ill get that tea said mrs mackenzie when shed gone mcphail placed his cases on the springy single bed beside the bed was a small writing desk and chair he lifted the chair and placed it in front of the window then sat down he moved a small glass clown further along the sill so that he could rest his chin where it had been nothing obscured his view he sat there in a dream looking at the playground until mrs mackenzie called to him that the tea was in the living room and a madeira cake too andrew mcphail got up with a sigh he didnt really want the tea now but he supposed he could always bring it up to his room and leave it untouched till later he felt tired bone tired but he was home and something told him that tonight he would sleep the sleep of the dead coming mrs mackenzie he called tearing his gaze away from the school on monday morning word went around st leonards police station that inspector john rebus was in an impressively worse mood than usual some found this hard to believe and were almost willing to get close enough to rebus to find out for themselvealmost others had no choice ds brian holmes and dc siobhan clarke seated with rebus in their sectionedoff chunk of the cid room had the look of people who were resting their backsides on softboiled eggs so rebus was saying what about rory kintoul hes out of hospital sir said siobhan clarke rebus nodded impatiently he was waiting for her to put a foot wrong it wasnt because she was english or a graduate or had wealthy parents whod bought her a flat in the new town it wasnt because she was a she it was just rebuss way of dealing with young officers and hes still not talking said holmes he wont say what happened and hes certainly not pressing any charges brian holmes looked tired rebus noticed this from the corner of his eye he didnt want to make eyecontact with holmes didnt want holmes to realise that they now had something in common both had been kicked out by their girlfriends it had happened to holmes just over a month ago as holmes revealed later once hed moved in with an aunt in barnton it was all to do with children he hadnt realised how strongly nell wanted a baby and had started to joke about it then one day shed blown upan awesome sightand kicked him out watched by most of the female neighbours in their mining village south of edinburgh apparently the women neighbours had applauded as holmes scurried off now he was working harder than ever this also had been a cause of strife between the couple her hours were fairly regular his anything but he reminded rebus of a frayed and faded pair of work denims not far from the end of their life what are you saying rebus asked im saying i think we should drop it sir with all respect with all respect brian thats what people say when they mean you fucking idiot rebus still wasnt looking at holmes but he could feel the young man blushing clarke was looking down at her lap listen said rebus this guy he staggers a couple of hundred yards with a twoinch gash in his gut why no answer was forthcoming why rebus persisted does he walk past a dozen shops only stopping at his cousins maybe he was making for a doctors but had to stop clarke suggested maybe said rebus dismissively funny that he can make it into his cousins shop though you think its something to do with the cousin sir let me ask the both of you something else rebus stood up and took a few paces then retraced his steps catching holmes and clarke exchanging a glance it set rebus wondering at first there had been sparks between them sparks of antagonism but now they were working well together he just hoped the relationship didnt go further than that let me ask you this he said what do we know about the victim not much said holmes he lives in dalkeith clarke offered works as a lab technician in the infirmary married one son she shrugged thats it asked rebus thats it sir exactly said rebus hes nobody a nothing not one person weve talked to has had a bad word to say about him so tell me this how did he end up getting stabbed and in the middle of a wednesday morning if it had been a mugger surely hed tell us about it as it is hes clammed up as tight as an aberdonians purse at a church collection hes got something to hide christ knows what but it involves a car how do you work that out sir the blood starts at the kerb holmes looks to me like he got out of a car and at that point he was already wounded he drives sir but doesnt own a car at present smart girl clarke she prickled at girl but rebus was talking again and hed taken a half day off work without telling his wife he sat down again why why why i want the two of you to have another go at him tell him were not happy with his lack of a story if he cant think of one well pester him till he does let him know we mean business rebus paused and after that do a check on the butcher chop chop sir commented holmes he was saved by the phone ringing rebus picked up the receiver maybe it would be patience di rebus john can you come to my office it wasnt patience it was the chief super two minutes sir said rebus putting down the phone then to holmes and clarke get onto it yes sir you think im making too much of this brian yes sir well maybe i am but i dont like a mystery no matter how small so bugger off and satisfy my curiosity as they rose holmes nodded towards the large suitcase which rebus had placed behind his desk supposedly out of view something i should know about yes said rebus its where i keep all my graft payments yours still probably fit in your back pooch holmes didnt look like budging though clarke had already retreated to her own desk rebus expelled air and lowered his voice ive just joined the ranks of the dispossessed holmes face became animated not a bloody word mind this is between you and me understood holmes thought of something you know most evenings i eat at the heartbreak caf ill know where to find you then if i ever need to hear any early elvis holmes nodded and vegas elvis too all i mean is if theres anything i can d you could start by disguising yourself as me and trotting along to see farmer watson but holmes was shaking his head i meant anything within reason within reason rebus wondered if it was within reason to be asking the students to put up with him sleeping on the sofa while his brother slept in the box room maybe he should offer to lower the rent when hed arrived at the flat unannounced on friday night three of the students and michael had been sitting crosslegged on the floor rolling joints and listening to midperiod rolling stones rebus stared in horror at the cigarette papers in michaels hand for fucks sake mickey so at last michael rebus had elicited a reaction from his big brother the students at least had the grace to look like the criminals they were youre lucky rebus told them all that at this exact second i dont give a shit go on john said michael offering a halfsmoked cigarette it cant do any harm thats what i mean rebus drew a bottle of whisky out of the carrierbag he was holding but this can he had proceeded to spend the final hours of the evening sprawled across the sofa supping whisky and singing along to any old record that was put on the turntable hed spent much of the weekend in the same spot too the students hadnt seemed to mind though hed made them put away the drugs for the duration they cleaned the flat around him with michael pitching in and everyone trooped out to the pub on saturday night leaving rebus with the tv and some cans of beer it didnt look as though michael had told the students about his prison record rebus hoped hed keep it that way michael had offered to move out or at least give his brother the box room but rebus refused he wasnt sure why on sunday he went to oxford terrace but there didnt seem to be anyone home and his key still wouldnt open the door so either the lock had been changed or patience was hiding in there somewhere going through her own version of cold turkey with the kids for company now he stood outside farmer watsons door and looked down at himself sure enough when hed gone to oxford terrace this morning patience had left a suitcase of stuff for him outside the door no note just the case hed changed into the clean suit in the police station toilets it was a bit crumpled but no more so than anything he usually wore he hadnt a tie to match though patience had included two horrible brown ties were they really his along with the dark blue suit brown ties dont make it he knocked once on the door before opening it come in john come in it seemed to rebus that the farmer too was having trouble making st leonards fit his ways the place just didnt feel right take a seat rebus looked around for a chair there was one beside the wall loaded high with files he lifted these off and tried to find space for them on the floor if anything the chief super had less space in his office than rebus himself still waiting for those bloody filing cabinets he admitted rebus swung the chair over to the desk and sat down whats up sir how are things things yes things are fine sir rebus wondered if the farmer knew about patience surely not dc clarke getting on all right is she ive no complaints good weve got a bit of a job coming up joint operation with trading standards oh chief inspector lauderdale will fill in the details but i wanted to sound you out first check how things are going what sort of joint operation money lending said watson i forgot to ask do you want coffee rebus shook his head and watched as watson bent over in his chair there being so little space in the room hed taken to keeping his coffeemaker on the floor behind his desk where twice so far to rebuss knowledge hed spilt it all across the new beige carpet when watson sat up again he held in his meaty fist a cup of the devils own drink the chief supers coffee was a minor legend in edinburgh money lending with some protection on the side watson corrected but mostly money lending the same old sad story in other words people who wouldnt stand a chance in any bank and with nothing worth pawning could still borrow money no matter how bad a risk the problem was of course that the interest ran into the hundreds per cent and arrears could soon mount bringing more prohibitive interest it was the most vicious circle of all vicious because at the end of it all lay intimidation beatings and worse suddenly rebus knew why the chief super had wanted this little chat its not big ger is it he asked watson nodded in a way he said rebus sprang to his feet thisll be the fourth time in as many years he always gets off you know that i know that normally he would have recited this on the move but there was no floorspace worth the name so he just stood there like a sunday ranter at the foot of the mound its a waste of time trying to pin him on money lending i thought wed been through all this a dozen times and decided it was useless going after him without trying another tack i know john i know but the trading standards people are worried the problem seems bigger than they thought bloody trading standards now joh but rebus paused with respect sir its a complete waste of time and manpower therell be a surveillance well take a few photos well arrest a couple of the poor saps who act as runners and nobodyll testify if the procurator fiscal wants big ger nailed then they should give us the resources so we can mount a decent size of operation the problem of course was that nobody wanted to nail morris gerald cafferty known to all as big ger as badly as john rebus did he wanted a full scale crucifixion he wanted to be holding the spear giving one last poke just to make sure the bastard really was dead cafferty was scum but clever scum there were always flunkies around to go to jail on his behalf because rebus had failed so often to put the man away he would rather not think of him at all now the farmer was telling him that there was to be an operation that would mean long days and nights of surveillance a lot of paperwork and the arrests of a few pimply apprentice hardmen at the end of it all john said watson summoning his powers of character analysis i know how you feel but lets give it one more shot eh i know the kind of shot id take at cafferty given half a chance rebus turned his fist into a gun and mimed the recoil watson smiled then its lucky we wont be issuing firearms isnt it after a moment rebus smiled too he sat down again go on then sir he said im listening at eleven oclock that evening rebus was watching tv in the flat as usual there was no one else about they were either still studying in the university library or else down at the pub since michael wasnt around either the pub seemed an oddson bet he knew the students were wary expecting him to kick at least one of them out so he could claim a bedroom they moved around the flat like eviction notices hed phoned patience three times getting the answering machine on each occasion and telling it that he knew she was there and why didnt she pick up the phone as a result the phone was on the floor beside the sofa and when it rang he dangled an arm picked up the receiver and held it to his ear hello john rebus sat up fast patience thank christ you listen this is important i know it is i know i was stupid but youve got to believe just listen will your rebus shut up and listened he would do whatever she told him no question they thought youd be here someone from the station just phoned its brian holmes what did he want no they were phoning about him what about him hes been in some sort oi dont know anyway hes hurt still holding the receiver rebus stood up hauling the whole apparatus off the floor with him where is he somewhere in haymarket some ba the heartbreak cafe thats it and listen john yes we will talk but not yet just give me time whatever you say patience bye john rebus dropped the phon from his hand and grabbed his jacket rebus was parking outside the heartbreak cafe barely seven minutes later that was the beauty of edinburgh when you could avoid traffic lights the heartbreak cafe had been opened just over a year before by a chef who also happened to be an elvis presley fan he had used some of his extensive memorabilia to decorate the interior and his cooking skills to come up with a menu which was almost worth a visit even if like rebus youd never liked elvis holmes had raved about the place since its opening drooling for hours over the dessert called blue suede choux the cafe operated as a bar too with garish cocktails and s music plus bottled american beers whose prices would have caused convulsions in the broadsword pub rebus got the idea that holmes had become friends with the owner certainly hed been spending a lot of time there since the split from nell and had put on a fair few pounds as a result from the outside the place looked nothing special pale cement front wall with a narrow rectangular window in the middle most of which was filled with neon signs advertising beers and above this a larger neon sign flashing the name of the restaurant the action wasnt here however holmes had been set on around the back of the place a narrow alley just about able to accommodate the width of a ford cortina led to the patrons car park this was small by any restaurants standards and was also where the overflowing refuse bins were kept most clients rebus guessed would park on the street out front holmes only parked back here because he spent so much time in the bar and because his car had once been scratched when hed left it out front there were two cars in the car park one was holmes and the other almost certainly belonged to the owner of the heartbreak cafe it was an old ford capri with a painting of elvis on its bonnet brian holmes lay between the two cars so far no one had moved him he would be moved soon though after the doctor had finished his examination one of the officers present recognised rebus and came over nasty blow to the back of the head hes been out cold for at least twenty minutes thats how long ago he was found the owner of the placethats who found himrecognised him and called in could be a fractured skull rebus nodded saying nothing his eyes on the prone figure of his colleague the other detective was still talking going on about how holmes breathing was regular the usual reassurances rebus walked towards the body standing over the kneeling doctor the doctor didnt even glance up but ordered a uniformed constable who was holding a flashlight over brian holmes to move it a bit to the left he then started examining that section of holmes skull rebus couldnt see any blood but that didnt mean much people died all the time without losing any blood over it christ brian looked so at peace it was almost like staring into a casket he turned to the detective whats the owners name again eddie ringan is he inside the detective nodded propping up the bar that figured ill just go have a word said rebus eddie ringan had nursed what was euphemistically called a drinking problem for several years long before hed opened the heartbreak cafe for this reason people reckoned the venture would fail as other ventures of his had but they reckoned wrong for the sole reason that eddie managed to find a manager a manager who not only was some kind of financial guru but was also as straight and as strong as a construction girder he didnt rip eddie off and he kept eddie where eddie belonged during working hoursin the kitchen eddie still drank but he could cook and drink that wasnt a problem especially when there were one or two apprentice chefs around to do the stuff which required focused eyes or rock steady hands and so according to brian holmes the heartbreak cafe thrived he still hadnt managed to persuade rebus to join him there for a meal of king shrimp creole or love me tenderloin rebus wasnt persuaded to walk through the front doountil tonight the lights were still on it was like walking into some teenagers shrine to his idol there were elvis posters on the walls elvis record covers a lifesize cutout figure of the performer even an elvis clock with the kings arms pointing to the time the tv as on an item on the late news some oversized charity cheque was being handed over in front of gibsons brewery there was no one in the place except eddie ringan slumped on barstool and another man behind the bar pouring two shots of jim beam rebus introduced himself and was invited to take a seat the bartender introduced himself as pat calder im mr ringans partner the way he said it made rebus wonder if the two young men were more than merely business partners holmes hadnt mentioned eddie was gay he turned his attention to the chef eddie ringan was probably in his late twenties but looked ten years older he had straight thinning hair over a large ovalshaped head a of which sat uneasily above the larger oval of his body rebus had see fat chefs and fatter chefs and ringan surely was a living advertisement for somebodys cooking his doughy face was showing signs of wear from the drink not just this evenings scoop but the weeks and months of steady heavy consumption rebus watched him drain the inch of amber fire in a single savouring swallow gimme another but pat calder shook his head not if youre driving then in clear and precise tones this man is a police officer eddie hes come to talk about brian eddie ringan nodded he fell down hit his head is that what you think asked rebus not really for the first time ringan looked up from the bartop an into rebuss eyes maybe it was a mugger or maybe it was a warning what sort of a warning eddies had too many tonight inspector said pat calder he starts imagining im not bloody imagining ringan slapped his palm down on the bartop for emphasis he was still looking at rebus you know what its like its either protection moneyinsurance they like to call itor its the other restaurants ganging up because they dont like the business youre doing and theyre not you make a lot of enemies in this game rebus was nodding so do you have anyone in mind eddie anyone in particular but ringan shook his head in a slow swing not really no not really but you think maybe you were the intended victim ringan signalled for another drink and calder poured he drank before answering maybe i dont know they could be trying to scare off the customers times are hard rebus turned to calder who was staring at eddie ringan with a fair amount of revulsion what about you mr calder any ideas i think it was just a mugging doesnt look like they took anything maybe they were interrupted by someone coming up the alley then how did they escape that car parks a dead end i dont know rebus kept watching pat calder he was a few years older than ringan but looked younger hed drawn his dark hair back into what rebus supposed was a fashionable ponytail and had kept long straight sideburns reaching down past his ears he was tall and thin indeed he looked like he could use a good meal rebus had seen more meat on a butchers pencil maybe calder was saying maybe he did fall after all its pretty dark out there well get some lighting put in very commendable of you sir rebus rose from the uncomfortable barstool meantime if anything does come to mind and especially if any names come to mind you can always call us yes of course rebus paused in the doorway oh and mr calder yes if you let mr ringan drive tonight ill have him pulled over before he reaches haymarket cant you drive him home i dont drive then i suggest you put your hand in the till for cab fare otherwise mr ringans next creation might be jailhouse roquefort as rebus left the restaurant he could actually hear eddie ringan starting to laugh he didnt laugh for long drink was demanding his attention gimme another he ordered pat calder silently poured to the level of the shot glass theyd bought the glasses on a trip to miami along with a lot of other stuff much of the money had come out of pat calders own pockets as well as those of his parents he held the glass in front of ringan then toasted him before draining the contents himself when ringan started to complain calder slapped him across the face ringan looked neither surprised nor hurt calder slapped him again you stupid bugger he hissed you stupid stupid bugger i cant help it said ringan proffering his empty glass im all shook up now give me a drink before i do something really stupid pat calder thought about it for a moment then he gave eddie ringan the drink the ambulance took brian holmes to the royal infirmary rebus had never been persuaded by this hospital it seemed full good intentions and unfilled staff rosters so he stood close by brian holmes bed as close as theyd let him stand and as the night wore on he didnt flinch he just slid a little lower down the wall he was crouching with his head resting against his legs arms cold against the floor when he sensed someone towering over kill it was nell stapleton rebus recognised her by her very height lo g before his eyes ha reached her tearstained face hello there nell christ john and the tears started again he pulled himself upright embracing her quickly she was throwing words into his ear we talked only this evening i was horrible and now this happen hush nell its not your fault this sort of thing can happen anytime yes but i cant help remembering the last time we spoke it was an argument if we hadnt argue sshh pet calm down now he held her tight christ it felt good he didnt like to think about how good it felt it felt good all the same perfume her shape the way she moulded against him we argued and he went to that bar and the sshh nell its not your fault he believed it too though he wasnt sure whose fault it was protection racketeers jealous restaurant owners simple neds a difficult one to call can i see him by all means rebus gestured with his arm towards holmes bed he turned away as nell stapleton approached it giving the couple some privacy not that the gesture meant anything holmes was still unconscious hooked up to some monitor and with his head heavily bandaged but he could almost make out the words nell used when she spoke to her estranged lover the tone she used made him think of dr patience aitken made him halfwish he were lying unconscious it was nice to think people were saying nice things about you after five minutes she came tiredly back hard work rebus offered nell stapleton nodded you know she said quietly i think ive an idea why this happened oh she was speaking in a nearwhisper though the ward was quiet they were the only two souls about on two legs she sighed loudly rebus wondered if shed ever taken drama classes the black book she said rebus nodded as though understanding her then frowned what black book he asked i probably shouldnt be telling you but youre not just someone he works with are you youre a friend she let out another whistle of air it was brians notebook nothing official this was stuff he was looking into on his own rebus wary of waking anyone led her out of the ward a diary he asked not really it was just that sometimes he used to hear rumours bits of pub gossip hed write them down in the black book then he might take things further it was sort of a hobby with him but maybe he thought it was also a way to an early promotion i dont know we used to argue about that too i was hardly seeing him he was so busy rebus was staring at the wall of the corridor the overhead lighting stung his eyes hed never heard holmes mention any kind of notebook what about it nell was shaking her head it was just something he said something before w her hand went to her mouth as though she were about to cry before we split up what was it nell im not sure exactly her eyes met rebuss i just know brian was scared and id never seen him scared before scared of what she shrugged something in the book then she shook her head again im not sure what i cant help feelinfeeling im somehow responsible if wed neve rebus pulled her to him again there there pet its not your fault but it is it is no it isnt rebus made his voice sound determined now tell me where did brian keep this wee black book of his about his person was the answer brian holmes clothes and possessions had been removed when the ambulance delivered him to the infirmary but rebuss id was enough to gain access to the hospitals property department even at this grim hour he plucked the notebook out of an a envelopes worth of belongings and had a look at the other contents wallet diary id watch keys small change stuff without personality now that it had been separated from its owner but strengthening rebuss conviction that this was no mere mugging nell had gone home still crying leaving no message to be passed along to brian all rebus knew was that she suspected the beating was something to do with the notebook and maybe she was right he sat in the corridor outside holmes ward sipping water and skipping through the cheap leatherette book holmes had employed a kind of shorthand but the code was not nearly complex enough to puzzle another copper much of the information had come from a single night and a single action the night an animal rights group had broken into fettes hqs records room amongst other things theyd uncovered evidence of a rentboy scandal among edinburghs most respectable citizens this didnt come as news to john rebus but some other entries were intriguing and especially the one referring to the central hotel the central hotel had been an edinburgh institution until five years ago when it had been razed to the ground an insurance scam was rumoured and had been hoisted by the insurance company involved as a reward for proof that just such a scam had really taken place but the reward had gone uncollected the hotel had once been a travellers paradise it was sited on princes street no distance at all from waverley station and so had become a travelling businessmans homefromhome but in its latter years the central had seen business decline and as genuine business declined so disingenuous business took over it was no real secret that the centrals stuffy rooms could be hired by the hour or the afternoon room service would provide a bottle of champagne and as much talcum powder as any rooms tenants required in other words the central had become a knockingshop and by no means a subtle one it also catered to the towns shadier elements in all shapes and forms wedding parties and stag nights were held for a spread of the citys villains and underage drinkers could loll in the lounge bar for hours safe in the knowledge that no honest copper would stray inside the doors familiarity bred further contempt and the lounge bar started to be used for drug deals and other even less savoury deals too so that the central hotel became something more than a mere knockingshop it turned into a swamp a swamp with an eviction order over its head the police couldnt turn a blind eye forever and a day especially when complaints from the public were rising by the month and the more trash was introduced to the central the more trash was produced by the place until almost no real drinkers went there at all if you ventured into the central you were looking for a woman cheap drugs or a fight and god help you if you werent then as had to happen one night the central burnt down this came as no surprise to anyone so much so that reporters on the local paper hardly bothered to cover the blaze the police of course were delighted the fire saved them having to raid the joint but the next morning there was a solitary surprise for though all the hotels staff and customers had been accounted for a body turned up amongst the charred ceilings and roofbeams a body that had been burnt out of all recognition a body that had been dead when the fire started these scant details rebus knew he would not have been a city of edinburgh detective if he hadnt known yet here was holmes black book throwing up tantalising clues or what looked like tantalising clues rebus read the relevant section through again central fire el was there poker game on st floor r brothers involved so maybe mork too try finding he studied holmes handwriting trying to decide whether the journal said el or e the letter or the number and if it was the letter did he mean el to stand as the phonetic equivalent of a single letter why the exclamation mark it seemed that the presence of el or l or eone was some kind of revelation to brian holmes and who the hell were the r brothers rebus thought at once of michael and him the rebus brothers but shook the picture from his mind as for mork a bad tv show came to mind nothing else no he was too tired for this tomorrow would be time enough maybe by tomorrow brian would be up and talking rebus decided hed say a little prayer for him before he went to sleep a prayer which went unanswered brian holmes had still not regained consciousness when rebus phoned the infirmary at seven oclock is he in a coma or something then the voice on the other end of the phone was cold and factual there will be tests this morning what sorts of tests are you part of mr holmes immediate family no im bloody not ipolice officer his boss just a friend never mind he put down the receiver one of the students put her head around the livingroom door want some herbal tea no thanks a bowl of muesli rebus shook his head she smiled at him and disappeared herbal tea and muesli great god almighty what sort of way was that to start the day the door of the box room opened from within and rebus was startled when a teenage girl dressed only in a mans shirt came out into the daylight rubbing at her eyes she smiled at him as she passed making for the livingroom door she walked on tiptoe trying not to put too much bare foot on the cold linoleum rebus stared at the livingroom door for another ten seconds then walked over to the box room michael was lying naked on the narrow single bed the bed rebus had bought secondhand at the weekend he was rubbing a hand over his chest and staring at the ceiling the air inside the box room was foetid what the hell do you think youre doing rebus asked shes eighteen john thats not what i meant oh what did you mean but rebus wasnt sure any more there was just something plain ugly about his brother sharing a box room bed with some student while he slept on the sofa not eight feet away it was all ugly all of it michael would have to go rebus would have to move into a hotel or something none of it could go on like this much longer it wasnt fair on the students you should come to the pub more often michael offered thats whats wrong you know what you just dont see life john its time you started to live a little michael was still smiling when his brother slammed the door on him ive just heard about brian dc siobhan clarke looked in some distress she had lost all colour from her face except for two dots of red high on her cheeks and the paler red of her lips rebus nodded for her to sit down she pulled a chair over to his desk what happened somebody hit him over the head what with now that was a good question the sort of question a detective would ask it was also a question rebus had forgotten to ask last night we dont know he said nor do we have any motive not yet it happened outside the heartbreak cafe rebus nodded in the car park out back he kept saying he was going to take me there for a meal brian always keeps his word dont worry siobhan hell be all right she nodded trying to believe this ill go see him later if you like said rebus not sure quite what his tone was supposed to mean she looked at him again i like she said after shed gone rebus read through a message from chief inspector lauderdale it detailed the initial surveillance plans for the money lending operation rebus was asked for questions and useful comments he smiled at that phrase knowing lauderdale had used it hoping to deter rebus from his usual basic critique of anything put in front of him then someone delivered a hefty package the package he had been waiting for he lifted the flaps of the cardboard box and started to pull out bulging files these were the notes referring to the central hotel its history and final sorry end he knew he had a mornings reading ahead of him so he found lauderdales letter penned a large ok on it scrawled his signature beneath and tossed it into his out tray lauderdale wouldnt believe it wouldnt believe rebus had accepted the surveillance without so much as a murmur it was bound to perplex the chief inspector not a bad start to the working day rebus sat down with the first file from the box and started to read he was filling a second page with his own notes when the telephone rang it was nell stapleton nell where are you rebus continued writing finishing a sentence im at work just thought id call and see if youd found anything he finished the sentence such as well what happened to brian im not sure yet maybe hell tell us when he wakes up have yo talked to the hospital first thing me too rebus started writing again there was a nervous silence on the other end of the line what about the black book oh that yes i had a wee read of it did you find whatever brian was afraid of maybe and maybe not dont worry nell im working on it thats good there was genuine relief in her voice only when brian wakes up dont tell him i told you will you why not i think itit shows you care about him of course i care that didnt stop you chucking him out he wished he hadnt said it but he had he could hear her anguish and imagined her in the university library trying not to let any of the other staff see her face john she said at last you dont know the whole story youve on heard brians side thats true want to tell me yours she thought it over not like this on the telephone maybe some other time any time you like nell id better get back to work are you going to see brian today maybe tonight theyre running tests all morning what about you oh yes ill drop by its only two minutes away so it was rebus thought of siobhan clarke for some reason didnt want the two women to meet at brians bedside what time a you thinking of going lunchtime i suppose one last thing nell yes does brian have any enemies it took her a little while to answer no rebus waited to see if she had anything to add well take care nell you too john bye after hed put down the receiver rebus started back to his notetaking but after half a sentence he stopped tapping his pen thoughtfully against his mouth he stayed that way for a considerable time then made some phone calls to his contacts he didnt like the word grasses telling them to keep ears open regarding an assault behind the heartbreak cafe a colleague of mine which means its serious okay hed ended up saying colleague but had meant to say friend at lunchtime he walked over to the university and paid his respects at the department of pathology he had called ahead and dr curt was ready in his office wearing a creamcoloured raincoat and humming some piece of classical music which rebus annoyingly could recognise but not name ah inspector what a pleasant surprise rebus blinked really of course usually when youre pestering me its because of some current and pressing case but toda curt opened his arms wide no case and yet you phone me up and invite me to lunch it cant be very busy along at st leonards on the contrary but rebus knew the workload was in good hands before leaving hed loaded enough work onto siobhan clarke that she wouldnt have time for a lunchbreak beyond a sandwich and a drink from the cafeteria when shed complained hed told her she could take time off later in the afternoon to visit brian holmes how have you settled in there by the way rebus shrugged it doesnt matter to me where they put me where do you want to eat ive taken the liberty of reserving a table at the university staff club what some sort of canteen curt laughed shaking his head he had ushered rebus out of his office and was locking the door no said curt there is a canteen of course but as youre buying i thought wed opt for something a little bit more refined then lead on to the refinery the diningroom was on the ground floor near the main door of the staff club on chambers street theyd walked the short walk talking about nothing in particular when they could hear one another above the traffic noise curt always walked as though he were late for some engagement well he was a busy man a full teaching load plus the extra duties heaped on him at one time or another by most of the police forces in scotland and most onerously by the city of edinburgh police the diningroom was small but with plenty of space between the tables rebus was pleased to see that the prices were reasonable though the tally was upped when curt ordered a bottle of wine my treat he said but rebus shook his head the chief constables treat he corrected after all he had every intention of claiming it as a legitimate expense the wine arrived before the soup as the waitress poured rebus wondered when would be the right moment to open the real conversation slainte said curt raising his glass then so whats this all about youre not the kind for lunch with a friend not unless theres something you want and cant get by buying pints and bridies in some smoky saloon rebus smiled at this do you remember the central hotel a dive of a place on princes street it burnt down six or seven years ago five years ago actually curt took another sip of wine there was a smouldering body as i recall crispy batter we call those but when you examined the corpse he hadnt died in the fire had he some new evidence has come to light not exactly i just wanted to ask what you remember about the case well lets see curt broke off as the soup arrived he took three or four mouthfuls then wiped a napkin around his lips the body was never identified i know that we tried dental checks but to no avail there was no external evidence of course but people stupidly believe that a burned body tells no tales i cut the deceased open and found as id known i would that the internal organs were in pretty good shape cooked on the outside raw within like a good french steak a couple at a nearby table were soundlessly chewing their food and staring hard at their tabletop curt seemed either not to notice or not to mind dna fingerprinting had been around for four years but though we got some blood from the heart we were never given anything to match it against of course the heart was the clincher because of the bullet wound two wounds inspector entrance and exit that set you lot scurrying back to the scene didnt it rebus nodded theyd searched the immediate vicinity of the body then widened the search until a cadet found the bullet its calibre was eight millimetre matching the wound to the heart but it offered no other clues you also found said rebus that the deceased had suffered a broken arm at some time in the past did i but again it didnt get us any further forward especially said curt mopping his bowl with bread bearing in mind the reputation of the central probably every second person in the place had been in a fight and suffered some breakages rebus was nodding agreed yet he was never identified if hed been a regular or one of the staff surely someone would have come forward but nobody ever did well it was a long time ago are you about to start dusting off some ghosts there was nothing ghostly about whoever brained brian holmes sergeant holmes what happened rebus was hoping to spend some of the afternoon reading through more of the casenotes hed thought it would take half a day but this had been optimistic from the start he was now thinking in terms of half a week including some evening reading in the flat there was so much stuff lengthy reports from the fire department the councils building department news clippings police reports interview statement but when he got back to st leonards lauderdale was waiting he had received rebuss hasty comment on the moneylending surveillance and now wanted to push things on which meant that rebus was trapped in the chief inspectors office for the best part of two hours an hour of it headtohead stuff for the other hour they were joined by detective inspector alister flower who had worked out of st leonards since its opening day back in september and bragged continually that when he had shaken hands with the main dignitary at the occasion they had both turned out to be masons with flowers being the older clan flower resented the incomers from great london road if there were friction and factions within the station you could be sure flower was at the back of them somewhere if anything united lauderdale and rebus it was a dislike of flower though lauderdale was slowly being drawn into the flower camp rebus however had contempt even for the funny way the man spelt his first name he called him little weed and thought probably flower had something to do with the taxmans sudden enquiries in the operation against the money lenders flower was to lead the other surveillance team typically in an effort to appease the man lauderdale offered him the pick of the surveillances one would be of a pub where the lenders were said to hang out and take payments the other would be of what looked like the nominal hq of the gang an office attached to a minicab firm on gorgie road ive okayed the gorgie surveillance with divisional hq west said lauderdale as ever efficient behind a desk take him out onto the streets rebus knew and he was about as efficient as pepper on a vindaloo well said flower if its okay with inspector rebus i think id prefer the watch on the pub its a bit closer to home and flower smiled interesting choice said rebus his arms folded legs stretched out in front of him lauderdale was nodding his eyes flitting between the two men well thats settled then now lets get down to details the same details in fact that rebus and he had gone through in the hour prior to flowers arrival rebus tried to concentrate but couldnt he was desperate to get back to the central hotel records but the more agitated he grew the slower things moved the plan itself was simple the money lenders worked out of the firth pub in tollcross they picked up business there and generally hung around waiting for debtors to come and pay the weekly dues the money was taken at some point to the office in gorgie this office also was used as a dropoff point by debtors and here the leading visible player could be found the men working out of the firth were bitparts they collected cash and maybe even used some verbal persuasion when payment was late but when it came to the crunch everyone paid dues to davey dougary davey turned up every morning at the office as prompt as any businessman parking his bmw csi beside the battered minicabs on the way from car to office if the weather was warm he would slip his jacket off and roll up his shirtsleeves yes trading standards had been watching davey for quite some time there would be trading standards officers involved in both surveillances the police were really only there to enforce the law it was a trading standards operation in name the name they had chosen was moneybags another interesting choice thought rebus so original keeping surveillance in the pub would mean sitting around reading newspapers circling the names of horses on the betting sheet playing pool or the jukebox or dominoes oh yes and drinking beer after all they didnt want to stand out in the crowd keeping surveillance on the office meant sitting in the window of a disused first floor room in the tenement block across the road the place was without charm toilet facilities or heating the bathroom fittings had been stolen during a breakin earlier in the year down to the very toiletpan a happy prospect especially for holmes and clarke who would bear the burden of the surveillance always supposing holmes recovered in time he thought of his two junior officers spending long days huddling for warmth in a double sleepingbag hells bells thank god dougary didnt work nights and thank god thered be some trading standards bodies around too still the thought of nabbing davey dougary warmed rebuss heart dougary was bad the way a rotten apple was there was no repairing the damage though the surface might seem untainted of course dougary was one of big ger caffertys lieutenants cafferty had even turned up once at the office captured on film much good would it do hed have a thousand good reasons for that visit thered be no pinning him in court they might get dougary but cafferty was a long way off so far ahead of them they looked like they were pushing their heap of a car while he cruised in fifth gear so lauderdale was saying we can start with this as of next monday yes rebus awoke from his reverie it was clear that much had been discussed in his spiritual absence he wondered if hed agreed to any of it his silence had no doubt been received as tacit consent ive no problem with that said flower rebus moved again in his seat knowing that escape was close now ill probably need someone to fill in for ds holmes ah yes how is he doing i havent heard today sir rebus admitted ill call before i clock off well let me know were putting together a collection flower said for christs sake hes no deid yet flower took the explosion without flinching well all the same its a nice gesture lauderdale said flower shrugged his shoulders modestly lauderdale opened his wallet and dug out a reluctant fiver which he handed to flower hey big spender thought rebus even flower looked startled five quid he said unnecessarily lauderdale didnt want any thanks he just wanted flower to take the money his wallet had disappeared back into its cave flower stuck the note in his shirt pocket and rose from his chair rebus stood too not looking forward to being in the corridor alone with flower but lauderdale stopped him a word john flower sniffed as he left probably thinking rebus was to receive a dressing down for his outburst in fact this wasnt what lauderdale had in mind i was passing your desk earlier i see youve got the files on the central hotel fire old news surely rebus said nothing anything i should know about no sir said rebus rising and making for the door he reckoned flower would be on his way by now nothing you should know about just some reading of mine you could call it a history project archaeology more like true enough old bones and hieroglyphs trying to make the dead come to life the past is important sir said rebus taking his leave the past was certainly important to edinburgh the city fed on its past like a serpent with its tail in its mouth and rebuss past seemed to be circling around again too there was a message on his desk in clarkes handwriting obviously shed gone to visit holmes but not before taking a telephone call intended for her superior di morton called from falkirk hell try again another time he wouldnt say what its about very cagey ill be back in two hours she was the sort who would make up the two hours by staying late a few nights even though rebus had deprived her of a reasonable lunchbreak despite being english there was something of the scottish protestant in siobhan clarke it wasnt her fault she was called siobhan either her parents had been english literature lecturers at edinburgh university back in the s theyd lumbered her with the gaelic name then moved south again taking her to be schooled in nottingham and london but shed come back to edinburgh to go to college and fallen in love her story with edinburgh then shed decided on the police as a career alienating her friends and rebus suspected her liberal parents still the parents had bought her a new town flat so it couldnt be all strife rebus suspected shed do well in the police despite people like him women did have to work harder in the force to progress at the same pace as their male colleagues everyone knew it but siobhan worked hard enough and by christ did she have a memory a month from now he could ask her about this note on his desk and shed remember the telephone conversation word for word it was scary it was slightly scary too that jack mortons name had come up at this particular time another ghost from rebuss past when theyd worked together six years ago rebus wouldnt have given the younger morton more than four or five years to live such was his steady consumption of booze and cigarettes there was no contact phone number it would have taken only a few minutes to find the number of mortons nick but rebus didnt feel like it he felt like getting back to the files on his desk but first he phoned the infirmary to check on brian holmes progress only to be told that there wasnt any though there was also no decline that sounds cheery its just an expression the person on the phone said the test results wouldnt be known until next morning he thought for a moment then made another call this time to patience aitkens group practice but patience was out on a call so rebus left a message he got the receptionist to read it back so he could be sure it sounded right thought id call to let you know how brians doing sorry you werent in you can call me at arden street if you like john yes that would do shed have to call him now just to show she wasnt uncaring about brians condition with a speck of hope in his heart rebus went back to work he got back to the flat at six having done some shopping en route though hed proposed taking the files home he really couldnt be bothered he was tired his head ached and his nose was stuffy from the old dust which rose from their pages he climbed the flights of stairs wearily opened the door and took the grocery bags into the kitchen where one of the students was spreading peanut butter onto a thick slice of brown bread hiya mr rebus you got a phone call oh some woman doctor when ten minutes ago something like that what did she say she said if she wanted to find out abou brian brian holmes aye thats it if she wanted to find out about him she could call the hospital and thats exactly what shed done twice today already the student beamed pleased at having remembered the whole message so patience had seen through his scheme he should have known her intelligence amongst other things had attracted him to her also they were very much alike in many ways rebus should have learned long ago never try to put one over on someone who knows the way your mind works he lifted a box of eggs tin of beans and packet of bacon out of the bag oh my god said the student in disgust do you know just how intelligent pigs are mr rebus rebus looked at the students sandwich a damned sight more intelligent than peanuts he said then wheres the fryingpan later rebus sat watching tv hed nipped over to the infirmary to visit brian holmes he reckoned it was quicker to walk rather than driving around the meadows so hed walked letting his head clear but the visit itself had been depressing not a bit of progress how long can he stay conked out it can take a while a nurse had consoled its been a while she touched his arm patience patience patience he almost took a taxi to her flat but dropped the idea instead he walked back to arden street climbed the same old weary stairs and flopped onto the sofa he had spent so many evenings deep in thought in this room but that had been back when the flat was his only his michael came into the living room fresh from a shave and a shower he wore a towel tight around his flat stomach he was in good shape rebus hadnt noticed before but michael saw him noticing now and patted his stomach one thing about peterhead plenty of exercise i suppose youve got to get fit in there rebus drawled so you can fight back when someones after your arse michael shook off the remark like it was so much water oh theres plenty of that too never interested me whistling he went into the box room and started to dress going out rebus called why stay in seeing that wee girl again michael put his head around the door shes a consenting adult rebus got to his feet shes a wee girl he walked over to the box room and stared at michael forcing him to stop what he was doing what john you want me to stop going out with women if you dont like it tough rebus thought of all the remarks he could make this is my flaim your big brotheyou should know bettehe knew mickey would laughquite rightlyat any and all of them so he thought of something else to say fuck you mickey michael rebus recommenced dressing im sorry im such a disappointment but whats the alternative sit here all night watching you stew or sulk or whatever it is you do inside your head thanks but no thanks i thought you were going to look for a job michael rebus grabbed a book from the bed and threw it at his brother im looking for a fucking job what do you think i do all day just give it a rest will you he picked up his jacket and pushed past rebus dont wait up for me eh that was a laugh rebus was asleep and alone in the flat before the ten oclock news but it wasnt a sound sleep it was a sleep filled with dreams he was chasing patience through some office block always just losing her he was eating in a restaurant with a teenage girl while the rolling stones entertained unnoticed on the small stage in the corner he was watching a hotel burn to the ground wondering if brian holmes still unaccounted for had gotten out aliv and then he was awake and shivering the room illuminated only by the streetlamp outside burning through a chink in the curtains hed been reading the book michael had thrown at him it was about hypnotherapy and still lay in his lap beneath the blanket someone had thrown over him there were noises nearby noises of pleasure they were coming from the box room some therapy no doubt rebus listened to them for what seemed like hours until the light outside grew pale andrew mcphail sat beside his bedroom window across the road the children were being lined up two by two outside the school doors the boys had to hold hands with the girls the whole thing supervised by two female staff members looking hardly old enough to be parents never mind teachers mcphail sipped cold tea from his mug and watched he paid very close attention to the children any one of the girls might have been melanie except of course that melanie would be older not much older but older he wasnt kidding himself he knew the odds were melanie wouldnt be at this school probably wasnt even in edinburgh any more but he watched all the same and imagined her down there her hand touching the cool wet hand of one of the boys small delicate fingers the beginning of fine lines on the palm one girl was really quite similar short straight hair curling in towards her ears and the nape of her neck the height was familiar too but the face what he could see of the face was nothing like melanie really nothing like her and besides what did it matter to mcphail they were marching into the building now leaving him behind with his cold tea and his memories he could hear mrs mackenzie downstairs washing dishes and probably chipping and breaking as much crockery as she got clean not her fault her eyesight was failing everything about the old woman was failing the house was bound to be worth a pile of moneymoney in the bank and what did he have only memories of the way things had been in canada and before canada a plate crashed onto the kitchen floor it couldnt go on like this really it couldnt thered be nothing left he didnt like to think about the budgie in the livingroo mcphail drained the strong tea the caffeine made him slightly giddy sweat breaking out on his forehead the playground was empty the school doors closed he couldnt see anything through the buildings few visible windows there might be a latearriving straggler but he didnt have time to waste he had work to do it was good to keep busy keeping busy kept you sane big ger rebus was saying real name morris gerald cafferty dutifully and despite her good memory dc siobhan clarke wrote these words on her notepad rebus didnt mind her taking notes it was good exercise when she lowered her head to write rebus had a view of the crown of her head lightbrown hair falling forward she was good looking in a homely sort of way indeed she reminded him a bit of nell stapleton hes the prime mover and if were offered him well take him but operation moneybags will actually be focusing on david charles dougary known as davey again the words went onto the paper dougary rents office space from a dodgy minicab service in gorgie road not far from the heartbreak cafe the question surprised him no he said not too far and the restaurant owner hinted at a protection payoff rebus shook his head dont get carried away clarke and these men are involved in protection money too arent they theres not much big ger cafferty isnt involved in money laundering prostitution hes a big bad bastard but that isnt the point the point is this operation will concentrate on loansharking period all im saying is maybe sergeant holmes was attacked by mistake instead of the cafes owner its a possibility said rebus and if its true he thought im wasting a lot of time and effort on an old case but as nell said brian was frightened of something in his black book and all because hed started trying to track down the mysterious r brothers but to get back to business well be setting up a surveillance across the road from the taxi firm round the clock well start with working hours dougary has a fairly fixed routine by all accounts whats he supposed to be doing in that office the way he tells it everything from basic entrepreneurship to arranging food parcels for the third world dont get me wrong dougarys clever hes lasted longer than most of big gers associates hes also a maniac its worth bearing that in mind we once arrested him after a pub brawl hed torn the ear off another man with his teeth when we got there dougary was chomping away the ear was never recovered rebus always expected some reaction from his favourite stories but all siobhan clarke did was smile and say i love this city then are there files on mr cafferty oh aye there are files by all means plough through them theyll give you some idea what youre up against she nodded ill do that and when do we start thesurveillance sir first thing monday morning everything will be set up on sunday i just hope they give us a decent camera he noticed clarke was looking relieved then the penny dropped dont worry you wont miss the hibs game she smiled theyre away to aberdeen and youre still going absolutely she tried never to miss a game rebus was shaking his head he didnt know that many hibs fans i wouldnt travel that far for the second coming yes you would now rebus smiled whos been talking right whats on the agenda for today ive talked to the butcher he was no help at all i think id have more chance of getting a complete sentence out of the carcases in his deep freeze but he does drive a merc thats an expensive car butchers arent well known for high salaries are they rebus shrugged the prices they charge i wouldnt be so sure anyway im planning to drop in on him at home this morning just to clear up a couple of points but hell be at work unfortunately yes rebus caught on his wife will be home thats what im hoping the offer of a cup of tea a little chat in the living room wasnt it terrible about rory that sort of thing so you can size up his home life and maybe get a talkative wife thrown in for good measure rebus was nodding slowly it was so devious he should have thought of it himself get tae it lass he said and she did leaving him to reach down onto the floor and lift one of the central hotel files onto his desk he started reading but soon froze at a certain page it listed the hotels customers on the night it burnt down one name fairly flew off the page would you credit that rebus got up from the desk and put his jacket on another ghost and another excuse to get out of the office the ghost was matthew vanderhyde the house next to vanderhydes was as mad as ever owned by an ancient nationalist it sported the saltire flag on its gate and what looked like thirtyyearoldtracts taped to its windows the owner couldnt get much light but then the house rebus was approaching had its curtains drawn closed he rang the doorbell and waited it struck him that vanderhyde might well be dead he would be in his early to midseventies and though hed seemed healthy enough the last time theyd met well that was over two years ago he had consulted vanderhyde in an earlier case after the case was closed rebus used to drop in on vanderhyde from time to time just casually they only lived six streets apart after all but then hed started to get serious with dr patience aitken and hadnt found time for a visit since the door opened and there stood matthew vanderhyde looking just the same as ever his sightless eyes were hidden behind dark green spectacles above which sat a high shiny forehead and long sweptback yellow hair he was wearing a suit of beige cord with a brown waistcoat from the pocket of which hung a watchchain he leaned lightly on his silvertopped cane waiting for the caller to speak hello there mr vanderhyde ah inspector rebus i was wondering when id see you come in come in from vanderhydes tone it sounded like theyd last met two weeks before he led rebus through the dark hallway and into the darker living room rebus took in the shapes of bookshelves paintings the large mantelpiece covered in mementoes from trips abroad as you can see inspector nothing has changed in your absence im glad to see you looking so well sir vanderhyde shrugged aside the remark some tea no thanks im really quite thrilled that youve come it must mean theres something i can do for you rebus smiled im sorry i stopped visiting its a free country i didnt pine away i can see that so what sort of thing is it witchcraft devilment in the city streets rebus was still smiling in his day matthew vanderhyde had been an active white witch at least rebus hoped hed been white it had never been discussed between them i dont think this is anything to do with magic rebus said its about the central hotel the central ah happy memories inspector i used to go there as a young man tea dances a very acceptable luncheonthey had an excellent kitchen in those days you knoweven once or twice to an evening ball im thinking of more recent times you were at the hotel the night it was torched i dont recall arson was proven as usual vanderhydes memory was sharp enough when it suited him thats true all the same you were there yes i was but i left several hours before the fire started not guilty your honour why were you there in the first place to meet a friend for a drink a seedy place for a drink was it youll have to remember inspector i couldnt see anything it certainly didnt smell or feel particularly disreputable point taken i had my memories to me it was the same old central hotel id lunched in and danced in i quite enjoyed the evening was the central your choice then no my friends your friend bein vanderhyde considered no secret i suppose aengus gibson rebus sifted through the names connotations you dont mean black aengus vanderhyde laughed showing small blackened teeth youd better not let him hear you calling him that these days yes aengus gibson was a reformed character that much was public knowledge he was also so rebus presumed still one of scotlands most eligible young men if thirtytwo could be considered young in these times black aengus after all was sole heir to the gibson brewery and all that came with it aengus gibson said rebus the same and this was five years ago when he was stil high spirited vanderhyde gave a low chuckle oh he deserved the name black aengus then all right the newspapers got it just right when they came up with that nickname rebus was thinking i didnt see his name in the records your name was there but his wasnt im sure his family saw to it that his name never appeared in any records inspector it would have given the media even more fuel than they needed at the time yes christ black aengus had been a wild one all right so wild even the london papers took an interest hed looked to be spiralling out of control on evernew excesses but then suddenly all that stopped hed been rehabilitated and was now as respectable as could be involved in the brewing business and several prominent charities besides the leopard changed its spots inspector i know you policemen are dubious about such things every offender is a potential repeat offender i suppose you have to be cynical in your job but with young aengus the leopard really did change do you know why vanderhyde shrugged maybe because of our chat that night in the central hotel his father had asked me to talk to him you know them then oh from long ago aengus regarded me more as an uncle than anything else indeed when i heard that the central had been razed to the ground i saw it as symbolic perhaps he did too of course i knew the reputation it had garneredan altogether unsavoury reputation when it happened to burn down that night well i thought of the phoenix aengus rising cleansed from its ashes and it turned out to be true he paused yet now here you are inspector asking questions about long forgotten events there was a body ah yes never identified a murdered body and somehow youve reopened that particular investigation interesting i wanted to ask you what you remembered from that night anyone you met anything that seemed at all suspicious vanderhyde tilted his head to one side there were many people in the hotel that night inspector you have a list of them yet you choose to come to a blind man thats right said rebus a blind man with a photographic memory vanderhyde laughed certainly i can givimpressions he thought for a moment very well inspector for you ill do my best i only ask one thing whats that ive been stuck here too long take me out will you anywhere in particular vanderhyde looked surprised that he needed to ask why inspector to the central hotel of course well said rebus this is where it used to stand youre facing it now he could feel the stares of passersby princes street was lunchtime busy office workers trying to make the most of their limited time a few looked genuinely annoyed at having to manoeuvre past two people daring to stand still on the pavement but most could see that one man was blind the other his helper in some way so they found charity in their souls and didnt complain and what has it become inspector a burger joint vanderhyde nodded i thought i could smell meat franchised doubtless from some american corporation princes street has seen better days inspector did you know that when scottish sword and shield was started up they used to meet in the centrals ballroom dozens and dozens of people all vowing to restore dalriada to its former glory rebus remained silent you dont recall sword and shield it must have been before my time now that i think of it it probably was this was in the s an offshoot of the national party i attended a couple of the meetings myself there would be some furious call to arms followed by tea and scones it didnt last long broderick gibson was the president one year aenguss father yes vanderhyde was remembering there used to be a pub near here famous for politics and poetry a few of us went there after the meetings i thought you said you only went to two perhaps a few more than two rebus grinned if he looked into it he knew he would probably find that a certain m vanderhyde had been president of sword and shield at some time it was a fine pub vanderhyde reminisced in its day said rebus vanderhyde sighed edinburgh inspector turn your back and they change the name of a pub or the purpose of a shop he pointed behind him with his stick nearly tripping someone up in the process they cant change that though thats edinburgh too the stick was wavering in the direction of the castle rock it rapped someone against their leg rebus tried to smile an apology the victim being a woman maybe we should go sit across the road he suggested vanderhyde nodded so they crossed at the traffic lights to the quieter side of the street there were benches here their backs to the gardens each dedicated to someones memory vanderhyde got rebus to read the plaque on their bench no he said shaking his head i dont recognise either of those names mr vanderhyde said rebus im beginning to suspect you got me to bring you here for no other reason than the outing itself vanderhyde smiled but said nothing what time did you go to the bar that night seven sharp that was the arrangement of course aengus being aengus he was late i think he turned up at half past by which time i was seated in a corner with a whisky and water i think it was j and b whisky he seemed pleased by this small feat of memory anyone you knew in the bar i can hear bagpipes vanderhyde said rebus could too though he couldnt see the piper they play for the tourists he explained it can be a big earner in the summer hes not very good i should imagine hes wearing a kilt but that the tartan isnt correct anyone in the bar you knew rebus persisted oh let me thin with respect sir you dont need to think you either know or you dont well i think tom hendry was in that night and stopped by the table to say hello he used to work for the newspapers yes rebus had seen the name on the list and there was someone elsi didnt know them and they didnt speak but i recall a scent of lemon it was very vivid i thought maybe it was a perfume but when i mentioned it to aengus he laughed and said it didnt belong to a woman he wouldnt say any more but i got the feeling it was a huge joke to him that id made the initial comment im not sure any of this is relevant me neither rebuss stomach was growling there was a sudden explosion behind them vanderhyde slipped his watch from his waistcoat pocket opened the glass and felt with his fingers over the dial one oclock sharp he said as i said inspector some things about our precipitous city remain immutable rebus nodded such as the precipitation for instance it was beginning to drizzle the morning sun having disappeared like a conjurers trick anything else you can tell me aengus and i talked i tried to persuade him that he was on a very dangerous path his health was failing and so was the familys wealth if anything the latter argument was the more persuasive so there and then he renounced the bawdy life i wouldnt go that far the edinburgh establishment has never bided too far from the stews when we parted he was setting off to meet some woman vanderhyde was thoughtful but if i do say so myself my words had an effect on him he nodded i ate alone that evening in the eyrie ive been there myself said rebus his stomach growled again fancy a burger after hed dropped vanderhyde home he drove back to st leonards not a lot wiser for the whole exercise siobhan sprang from her desk when she saw him she looked pleased with herself i take it the butchers wife was a talker rebus said dropping into his chair there was another note on his desk telling him jack morton had called but this time there was also a number where rebus could reach him a right little gossip sir i had trouble getting away and something and nothing so give me the something rebus rubbed his stomach hed enjoyed the burger but it hadnt quite filled him up there was always the canteen but he was a bit worried about getting a doughring as he termed the gut policemen specialised in the something is this siobhan clarke sat down bone won the mere in a bet a bet clarke nodded he put his share of the butchers business up against it but he won the bet bloody hell his wife actually sounded quite proud anyway she told me hes a great one for betting maybe he is but it doesnt look like hes got a winning formula how do you mean she was warming to her subject rebus liked to see it the gleam of successful detection there were a few things not quite right in the living room for instance theyd videotapes but no video though you could see where the machine used to sit and though they had a large unit for storing the tv and video the tv itself was one of those portable types so theyve got rid of their video and their big television id guess to pay off a debt or debts and your money would be on gambling dues if i were the betting kind which im not he smiled maybe they had the stuff on tick and couldnt keep up the payments siobhan sounded doubtful maybe she conceded okay well its interesting so far as it goes but it doesnt go very far not yet and it doesnt tell us anything about rory kintoul does it she was frowning remember him clarke hes the one who was stabbed in the street then wouldnt talk about it hes the one were interested in so what do you suggest sir there was a tinge of ire to that sir she didnt like it that her good detection had not been better rewarded weve already spoken to him and youre going to speak to him again she looked ready to protest only this time rebus went on youre going to be asking about his cousin mr bone the butcher im not sure what were looking for exactly so youll have to feel your way just see whether anything hits the marrow yes sir she stood up oh by the way i got the files on cafferty plenty of reading in there most of it xrated i know ive already started and theres no xrating nowadays its called eighteen instead rebus blinked its just an expression as she was turning away he stopped her look take some notes will you on cafferty and his gang i mean then when youre finished you can refresh my memory ive spent a long time shutting that monster out of my thoughts its about time i opened the door again no problem and with that she was off rebus wondered if he should have told her shed done well at bones house ach too late now besides if she thought she were pleasing him maybe shed stop trying so hard he picked up his phone and called jack morton jack long time no hear its john rebus john how are you no bad hows yourself fine i made inspector aye me too so i heard jack morton choked off his words as he gave a huge hacking cough still on the fags eh jack ive cut down remind me to sell my tobacco shares so listen whats the problem its your problem not mine only i saw something from scotland yard about andrew mcphail rebus tried the name out in his head no he admitted youve got me there we had him on file as a sex offender hed had a go at the daughter of the woman he was living with this was about eight years back but we never got the charge to stick rebus was remembering a little of it we interviewed him when those wee girls started to disappear rebus shivered at the memory his own daughter had been one of the wee girls thats it just routine we started with convicted and suspected child offenders and went on from there stocky guy with wiry hair youve got him so whats the point jack the point is you really have got him hes in edinburgh so christ john i thought youd know he buggered off to canada after that last time we hassled him set himself up as a photographer doing shots for fashion catalogues hed approach the parents of kids he fancied he had business cards camera equipment the works rented a studio and used to take shots of the children promising theyd be in some catalogue or other theyd get to dress up in fancy dresses or sometimes maybe just in underwea i get the picture jack well they nabbed him hed been touching the girls that was all a lot of girls so they put him inside and and now theyve let him out but theyve also deported him hes in edinburgh i started checking i wanted to find out where hed ended up because i knew if it was anywhere near my patch id pay him a visit some dark night but hes on your patch instead ive got an address wait a second rebus found a pen and copied it down how did you get his address anyway the dss no the files said he had a sister in ayr she told me hed had her get a phone number for him a boarding house know what else she said she said we should lock him in a cellar and forget about the key sounds like a lovely lass shes my kind of woman all right of course hes probably been rehabilitated that wordrehabilitated a word vanderhyde had used about aengus gibson probably said rebus believing it about as much as morton himself they were professional disbelievers after all it was a policemans lot still its good to know about thanks jack youre welcome any chance well be seeing you in falkirk some day itd be good to have a drink yes it would tell you what i might be over that way soon oh dropping mcphail off in the town centre morton laughed ya shite ye and with that he put down the phone jack morton stared at the phone for the best part of a minute still grinning then the grin melted away he unwrapped a stick of chewing gum and started gnawing it its better than a cigarette he kept telling himself he looked at the scribbled sheet of notes in front of him on the desk the girl mcphail had assaulted was called melanie maclean these days her mother had married and melanie lived with the couple in haddington far enough from edinburgh so that she probably wouldnt bump into mcphail nor in all probability would mcphail be able to find her hed have to know the stepfathers name and that wouldnt be easy for him it hadnt been that easy for jack morton but the name was here alex maclean jack morton had a home address home phone number and work number he wondere he knew too that alex maclean was a carpenter and haddington police were able to inform him that maclean had a temper on him and had twice long before his marriage been arrested after some flareup or other he wondered but he knew he was going to do it he picked up the receiver and punched in the numbers then waited hello can i speak to mr maclean please mr maclean you dont know me but i have some information id like to share with you it concerns a man called andrew mcphai matthew vanderhyde too made a telephone call that afternoon but only after long thought in his favourite armchair he held the cordless phone in his hand tapping it with a long fingernail he could hear a dog outside the one from down the street with the nasal whine the clock on the mantelpiece ticked the tick seeming to slow as he concentrated on it times heartbeat at last he made the call there was no preamble ive just had a policeman here he said he was asking about the night the central hotel caught fire he hesitated slightly i told him about aengus he could pause now listening with a weary smile to the fury on the other end of the line a fury he knew so well broderick he interrupted if any skeletons are being uncloseted i dont want to be the only one shivering when the fury began afresh matthew vanderhyde terminated the call rebus noticed the man for the first time that evening he thought hed seen him outside st leonards in the afternoon a young man tall and broadshouldered he was standing outside the entrance to rebuss communal stairwell in arden street rebus parked his car across the street so that he could watch the man in his rearview mirror the man looked agitated pumped up about something maybe he was only waiting for his date maybe rebus wasnt scared but he started the car again and drove off anyway hed give it an hour and see if the man was still there if he was then he wasnt waiting on any date no matter how bonny the girl he drove along the meadows to tollcross then took a right down lothian road it was slow going as per the number of vehicles needing to get through the city of an evening seemed to grow every week edinburgh in the twilight looked much the same as any other place shops and offices and crowded pavements nobody looked particularly happy he crossed princes street cut into charlotte square and began the crawl along queensferry street and queensferry road until he could take a merciful if awkward right turn into oxford terrace but patience wasnt home he knew patiences sister was expected this week staying a few days then taking the girls home patiences cat lucky sat outside demanding entry and rebus for once was almost sympathetic nae luck he told it before starting back up the steps when he got back to arden street there was no sign of the skulking hulk but rebus would recognise him if he saw him again oh yes hed know him all right indoors he had another argument with michael the two of them in the living room everyone else in the kitchen that was another thing how many tenants did he have there seemed to be a shifting population of about a dozen where hed rented to three with a possible fourth he could swear he saw different faces every morning and as a result could never remember anyones name so there was another row about that this time with the students in the kitchen while michael sat in the box room at the end of which rebus said away to hell and proceeded to follow his own instructions by getting back in his car and making for one of the citys least respectable quarters there to dine on pies and pints while staring at a soundless tv he spoke with a few of his contacts who had nothing to report regarding the assault on brian holmes so it was just another evening really he got back purposely late hoping everyone else would have gone to bed he fumbled with the doorcatch of the tenement and let the door swing shut loudly behind him searching in his pockets for the flat key eyes to the ground so he didnt see the man who must have been sitting on the bottom step of the stairs hello there rebus looked up startled recognised the figure and sent small change and keys scattering as he threw a punch he wasnt that drunk but then his target was stone cold sober and twenty years younger the man palmed the punch easily he looked surprised at the attack but also somehow excited by it rebus cut short the thrill of it all by sharply raising his knee into unprotected groin the man expelled air noisily and started to double over which gave rebus the opportunity to punch down onto the back of his neck he felt his knuckles crackle with the force of the blow jesus the man gasped stop it rebus stopped it and wagged his aching hand but he wasnt about to offer help he kept his distance and asked who are you the man managed to stop retching for a moment andy steele nice to meet you andy what the fuck do you want the man looked up at rebus with tears in his eyes it took him a while to catch his breath when he spoke rebus either couldnt understand the accent or else just didnt believe what he was saying he asked steele to repeat himself your auntie sent me said steele shes got a message for you rebus sat andy steele down on the sofa with a cup of tea including the four sugars steele himself had requested cant be good for your teeth theyre not my own steele replied huddled over the hot mug then whose are they asked rebus steele gave the flicker of a smile youve been following me all day not exactly maybe if i had a car but i dont you dont have a car steele shook his head some private detective i didnt say i was a private detective exactly i mean i want to be one a sort of trainee then aye thats right testing the water so to speak and hows the water andy another smile a sip of tea a bit hot but ill be more careful next time i didnt even know i had an aunt not up north steeles accent was a giveaway andy steele nodded she lives next door to my mum and dad just across the road from pittodrie aberdeen rebus nodded to himself its coming back to me yes an uncle and aunt in aberdeen your dad and jimmythats your unclefell out years ago youre probably too young to remember thanks for the compliment its just what ena told me and now uncle jimmys dead three weeks past and aunt ena wants to see me steele nodded what about i dont know she was just talking about how shed like to see you again just me no mention of my brother steele shook his head rebus had checked to see if michael was in the box room he wasnt but the other bedrooms seemed to be occupied right enough said rebus if they argued when i was wee maybe it was before michael was born they might no even know about him steele conceded well that was families for you anyway ena kept harping on about you so i told her id come south and have a look i got laid off from the fishing boats six months ago and ive been going up the wall ever since besides i told you ive always fancied being a private eye i love all those films films dont get you a knee in the balls true enough so how did you find me steeles face brightened i went to the address ena gave me where you and your dad used to live all the neighbours knew was that you were a policeman in edinburgh so i got the directory out and phoned every station i could find asking for john rebus he shrugged and returned to his tea but how did you get my home address someone in cid gave it to me dont tell me inspector flower a name like that aye seated on the sofa andy steele looked to be in his midtwenties he had the sort of large frame which could be kept in shape only through hard work such as that found on a north sea fishing boat but already deprived of work for six months that frame was growing heavy with disuse rebus felt sorry for andy steele and his dreams of becoming a private eye the way he stared into space as he drank the tea he looked lost his immediate life without form or plan so are you going to go and see her maybe at the weekend said rebus shed like that i can give you a lift back but the young man was shaking his head no id like to stay in edinburgh for a bit suit yourself said rebus just be careful careful i could tell you stories about aberdeen that would make your hair stand on end and could they thicken it a bit at the temples while theyre at it it took andy steele a minute to get the joke the next day rebus paid a visit to andrew mcphail but mcphail wasnt home and his landlady hadnt seen him since the previous evening usually he comes down at seven sharp for a wee bitty breakfast so i went upstairs and there was no sign of him is he in any trouble inspector no nothing like that mrs mackenzie this is a lovely madiera by the way ach its a few days since i made it its probably a bit dry by now rebus shook his head and gulped at the tea hoping to wash the crumbs down his throat but they merely formed into a huge solid lump which he had to force down by degrees and without a public show of gagging there was a birdcage standing in one corner of the room boasting mirrors and cuttlefish and millet spray but no sign of any bird maybe it had escaped he left his card with mrs mackenzie telling her to pass it on to mr mcphail when she saw him he didnt doubt that she would it had been unfair of him to introduce himself as a policeman to the landlady she would probably become suspicious and might even give mcphail a weeks notice on the strength of those suspicions that would be a terrible shame actually it didnt look to rebus as though mrs mackenzie would twig and mcphail would doubtless come up with some reason for rebuss visit probably the city of edinburgh police were about to award him a commendation for saving some puppies from the raging torrents of the water of leith mcphail was good at making up stories after all children just loved to hear stories rebus stood outside mrs mackenzies house and looked across the road it had to be coincidence that mcphail had chosen a boarding house within ogling distance of a primary school rebus had seen it on his arrival it had been enough to decide him on identifying himself to the landlady after all he didnt believe in coincidence and if mcphail couldnt be persuaded to move well maybe the neighbours would find out the true story of mrs mackenzies lodge rebus got into his car he didnt always like himself or his job but some bits were okay back at st leonards siobhan clarke had nothing new to report on the stabbing rory kintoul was being very cagey about another interview hed cancelled one arranged meeting and shed not been able to contact him since his sons seventeen and unemployed spends most of the day a home i could try talking to him you could but it was a lot of trouble maybe holmes was right just do your best said rebus after youve talked with kintoul if were no further forward well drop the whole thing if kintoul wants to get himself stabbed thats fine with me she nodded and turned away any news on brian she turned back hes been talking talking in his sleep i thought youd know whats he been saying nothing they can make out but it means hes slowly regaining consciousness good she started to turn away again but rebus thought of something how are you getting to aberdeen on saturday driving why any room in the car theres just me then you wont mind giving me a lift she looked startled not at all where to pittodrie now she looked even more surprised i wouldnt have taken you for a hibs fan sir rebus screwed up his face no youre all alone in that category i just need a lift thats all fine and on the way you can tell me what youve learned from the files on big ger by saturday rebus had argued three times with michael who was talking about moving out anyway once with the students also talking about moving and once with the receptionist at patiences surgery when she wouldnt put rebus through brian holmes had opened his eyes briefly and it was reckoned by the doctors that he was on his way to recovery none of them however hazarded the phrase full recovery still the news had cheered siobhan clarke and she was in a good mood when she arrived at rebuss arden street flat he was waiting for her at street level she drove a twoyearold cherryred renault it looked young and full of life while rebuss car parked next to it looked to be in terminal condition but rebuss car had been looking like this for three or four years now and just when hed determined to get rid of it it always seemed to go into remission rebus had the feeling the car could read his mind morning sir said siobhan clarke there was pop music coming from the stereo she saw rebus cringe as he got into the passenger seat and turned the volume down bad night people always seem to ask me that now why could that be they stopped at a bakery so rebus could buy some breakfast there had been nothing in the flat worth the description food but then rebus couldnt really complain his contribution to the larder so far had filled a single shopping basket and most of that had been meat something the students didnt touch he noticed michael had gone vegetarian too at least in public its healthier john hed told his brother slapping his stomach whats that supposed to mean rebus had snapped michael had merely shaken his head sadly too much caffeine that was another thing the kitchen cupboards were full of jars of what looked like coffee but turned out to be infusions of crushed tree bark and chicory at the bakery rebus bought a polystyrene beaker of coffee and two sausage rolls the sausage rolls turned out to be a bad mistake the flakes of pastry breaking off and covering the otherwise pristine car interiordespite rebuss best attempts with the paper bag sorry about the mess he offered to siobhan who was driving with her window conspicuously open youre not vegetarian are you she laughed you mean you havent noticed cant say i have she nodded towards a sausage roll well have you heard of mechanically recovered meat dont warned rebus he finished the sausage rolls quickly and cleared his throat anything i should know about between you and brian the look on her face told him this was not the years most successful conversational gambit not that i know of its just that he and nell werwell theres still a good chance im not a monster sir and i know the score between brian and nell brians just a nice guy we get along she glanced away from the windscreen thats all there is to it rebus was about to say something but if there was more to it than that she went on i dont see that it would be any of your business with respect sir not unless it was interfering with our work which i wouldnt let happen i dont suppose brian would either rebus stayed silent im sorry i shouldnt have said that what you said was fair enough the problem was the way you said it a police officers never off duty and im your bosseven on a jaunt like this dont forget that there was more silence in the car until siobhan broke it its a nice part of town marchmont almost as nice as the new town she glared at him her grip on the steeringwheel as determined as any stranglers i thought she said slyly you lived in oxford terrace these days sir you thought wrong now what about turning that bloody music off after all weve got a lot to talk about the lot of course being morris gerald cafferty siobhan clarke hadnt brought her notes with her she didnt need them she could recite the salient details from memory along with a lot of detail that might not be salient but was certainly interesting certainly shed done her homework rebus thought how frustrating the job could be shed swotted up on big ger as background to operation moneybags but operation moneybags almost certainly wouldnt trap cafferty and shed spent a lot of hours on the kintoul stabbing which might also turn out to be nothing and another thing she said apparently caffertys got a little diary of sorts all of it in code weve never been able to crack his code which means it must be highly personal yes rebus remembered whenever they brought big ger into custody the diary would be collected along with his other possessions then theyd photocopy the pages of the diary and try to decipher them theyd never been successful rumour has it siobhan was saying the diarys a record of bad debts debts cafferty takes care of personally a man like that garners a lot of rumours they help make him larger than life in life hes just another witless gangster a code takes wits maybe in the file theres a recent clipping from the sun its all about how bodies keep washing up on the coastline rebus nodded on the solway coast not far from stranraer you think its caffertys doing rebus shrugged the bodies have never been identified could be anything could be people pushed off the lame ferry could be some connection with ulster there are some weird currents between lame and stranraer he paused could be anything could be cafferty in other words could be its a long way to go to dispose of a body well hes not going to shit in his own nest is he she considered this there was mention in one of the papers of a van spotted on that coastline too early in the morning to be delivering anything rebus nodded and there was nowhere along the road for it to be delivering to i read the papers sometimes clarke the dumfries and galloway police have patrols along there now siobhan drove for a while gathering her thoughts hes just been lucky so far hasnt he sir i mean i can understand that hes a clever villain and clever villains are harder to catch but he has to delegate and usually even though a villains clever his underlings are so stupid or lazy they would shit in the nest language clarke language he got a smile from her point taken though reading all about caffertys associates i didnt get an impression of many o grades theyve all got names like slink and codge and the radiator rebus grinned radiator mccallum i remember him he was supposed to be descended from a family of highland cannibals he did research and everything he was so proud of his ancestors he disappeared from the scene though yes three or four years ago four and a half according to the records i wonder what happened to him rebus shrugged he tried to doublecross big ger got scared and ran off or didnt get the chance to run off that too of course or else he just got fed up or had another job offer its a very mobile profession being a thug wherever the work is cafferty certainly gets through the personnel mccallums cousins disappeared from view just before mccallum himself did rebus frowned i didnt know he had any cousins known colloquially as the bruhead brothers something to do with a penchant for irnbru altogether understandable what were their real names though she thought for a moment tam and eck robertson rebus nodded eck robertson yes i didnt know about the other one though hang on a minut tam and eck robertson the r brothers which would mean that mork wa morris bloody cafferty rebus slapped the dashboard brian shortened the name and usefor the c chrisif brian holmes was on to something involving cafferty and his gang no wonder he was scared something to do with the night the central hotel caught fire did they start the blaze because the hotel hadnt been paying its protection dues what about the body maybe itd been some debtor or other and soon afterwards radiator mccallum and his cousins left the scene bloody hell if youre going to have a seizure said siobhan im trained in cardiac resuscitation rebus wasnt listening he stared at the road ahead one fist around the coffee cup the other pounding his knee he was thinking of brians note he hadnt said for sure that cafferty was there that night only that the brothers were and something about a poker game he was going to try to find the robertson brothers that was his final comment after which someone came along and hit him on the head maybe it was beginning to come together im not sure i can deal with catatonia though what was it something that i said yes it was the bruhead brothers the very same what else can you tell me about them born in niddrie petty thieves from the time they left the pram they probably stole the pram too anything else siobhan knew that shed hit some nerve plenty both had long records eck liked flashy clothes tam always wore jeans and a tshirt the funny thing is though tam kept scrupulously clean he even took his own soap everywhere with him i thought that was strange if i were the gambling kind said rebus id bet the soap was lemonscented how did you know that instinct not mine someone elses rebus frowned how come i never heard of tam he moved to dundee when he left school or rather when he was asked to leave school he only came back to edinburgh years later the records have him down as working for the gang for about six months maybe even less she waited are you going to tell me what this is all about its all about a hotel fire you mean those files on the floor behind your desk i mean those files on the floor behind my desk i couldnt help taking a peek they might tie in with the attack on brian she turned to him keep your eyes on the road you concentrate on the driving and ill tell you a story it might even keep us going till aberdeen and it did in ye come jock my my i wouldnt have recognised ye i was in shorts the last time you saw me auntie ena the old woman laughed she used a zimmer frame to walk back through the narrow musty hall and into a small back room the room was crammed with furniture there would be a front room too another lounge kept for the most special occasions but rebus was family and family were greeted in the back room she was fraillooking and hunchbacked and wore a shawl over her angular shoulders her silver hair had been pulled back severely and pinned tight against her head and her eyes were sunken dots in a parchment face rebus couldnt remember her at all you must have been three when we were last in fife you could talk the hind legs off a donkey but with such a thick accent i could hardly make out a word of it always wanting to tell a joke or sing a song ive changed rebus said eh she had dumped herself into a chair beside the fireplace and craned her head forward my hearings not so good jock i said nobody calls me jock rebus called its john oh aye john right you are she pulled a travelrug over her legs in the fireplace stood an electric fire the kind with fake coals fake flames and so far as rebus could tell fake heat there was one pale orange bar on but he couldnt feel anything danny found you then you mean andy hes a good laddie such a shame he got made redundant did he come back with you no hes still in edinburgh she was resting her head against the back of the chair rebus got the impression she was about to drift off to sleep the walk to the front door and back had probably exhausted her his parents are nice folk always so kind to me you wanted to see me about something auntie ena eh he crouched down in front of her resting his hands on the side of the chair you wanted to see me well she could see hiand then she couldnt as her eyes glazed over and mouth wide open she started to snore rebus stood up and gave a loud sigh the clock over the mantelpiece had stopped but he knew he had at least two hours to kill talking over the central hotel case with siobhan had made him agitated he wanted to get back to work on it and here he was trapped in this miniature museum he looked around wrinkling his nose at a chrome commode in one dark corner there were photos inside a glassfronted china cabinet he went over and examined them he recognised a picture of his grandparents on his fathers side but there were no photos of his father the feud or whatever it had been had seen to that the scots never forgot it was a burden and a gift the livingroom led directly onto a small scullery rebus looked in the antique fridge and found a piece of brisket which he sniffed there was bread in a large tin in the pantry and butter in a dish on the drainingboard it took him ten minutes to make the sandwiches and five minutes to find out which of the many caddies contained the tea he found a radio beside the sink and tried to find commentary on a football game but the batteries were weaker than his tea so he tiptoed back through to where auntie ena was still sleeping and sat down in the chair opposite her he hadnt come up here expecting an inheritance exactly but he had bargained for more than this a particularly loud snore brought auntie ena wriggling towards consciousness eh is that you jimmy its john your nephew gracious john did i nod off just forty winks isnt that terrible of me with a visitor here and everything im not a visitor auntie ena im family aye son so you are now listen to me theres some beef in the fridge shall i go and theyre already made eh the sandwiches ive made them up you have you always were a bright one now what about some tea sit where you are ill make some fresh he made a pot of tea and brought the sandwiches through on a plate setting them in front of her on a footstool there we are he was about to hand her one when she made a grab for his wrists nearly toppling the plate he saw that her eyes were shut and though she looked frail enough her grip was strong shed started speaking before rebus realised she was saying grace some hae meat and cannae eat and some hae nane that want it but we hae meat and we can eat so let the lord be thankit rebus almost burst out laughing almost but inside he was touched too he handed her a smile along with her sandwich then went to fetch the tea the meal revived her and she seemed to remember why shed wanted to see him your faither and my husband fell out very many years ago maybe forty or more years ago they never exchanged a letter a christmas card or a civil word ever again now dont you think thats stupid and do you know what it was about it was about the fact that though we invited your faither and mither to our ishbels wedding we didnt invite you wed decided there would be no children you see but then a friend of mine peggy callaghan brought her son along uninvited and we could hardly turn him away since there was no way for him to get back home on his own when your faither saw this he argued with jimmy a real blazing row and then your faither stormed out leaving your mither to follow him a sweet woman she was so thats that she sat back in her chair breadcrumbs prominent on her lower lip that was all she nodded doesnt seem like much does it not from this distance but it was enough and the both of them were too stubborn ever to make it up and you wanted to see me so you could tell me this partly yes but also i wanted to give you something she rose slowly from her chair using the zimmerframe for support and leaned up towards the mantelpiece rebus halfrose to help her but she didnt need his help she found the photograph and handed it down to him he looked at it in fading black and white it showed two grinning schoolboys not exactly dressed to the nines they had their arms casually slung around one anothers necks and their faces were close together best friends but more than that brothers he kept that you see he told me once that hed thrown out all the photos of your faither but when we were going through his things we found that in the bottom of a shoebox i wanted you to have it jock its not jock its john said rebus his eyes not entirely dry of course it is said his auntie ena of course it is earlier that afternoon michael rebus had lain along the couch asleep and unaware that he was missing one of his favourite films double indemnity on bbc hed gone to the pub for a lunchtime drink alone as it turned out the students werent into it instead theyd gone shopping or to the launderette or home for the weekend to see parents and friends so michael drank only two lagers topped with lemonade and returned to the flat where he promptly fell asleep in front of the tv hed been thinking about john recently he knew he was imposing on his big brother but didnt reckon on doing so much longer he had spoken on the phone to chrissie she was still in kirkcaldy with the kids shed wanted nothing to do with him after the bust and was especially disgusted that his own brother had given evidence against him but michael didnt blame john for that john had principles and besides some of the evidence had workeddeliberately he was sure in michaels favour now chrissie was talking to him again hed written to her all through his incarceration then had written from london too not knowing whether shed received any of his letters but she had she told him that when they spoke and she didnt have a boyfriend and the kids were fine and did he want to see them some time i want to see you hed told her it sounded right he was dreaming about her when the doorbell went welher and gail the student if truth be told he staggered to his feet the bell was insistent it took a second to turn the sniblock after which michaels world imploded with another hibernian defeat behind her siobhan clarke was quiet on the way home which suited rebus he had some thinking to do and not about work for a change he thought about the job too much as it was gave himself to it the way he had never given himself to any person in his life not his exwife not his daughter not patience not michael hed come into the police prematurely weary and cynical then he watched recruits like holmes and clarke and saw their best intentions thwarted by the system and the publics attitude there were times youd feel more welcome if you were painting plague markers on peoples doors a penny for them said siobhan clarke dont waste your money why not look how much ive wasted already today rebus smiled at that aye he said i keep forgetting theres always someone in the world worse off than yourselunless youre a hibs supporter ha bloody ha siobhan clarke reached for the stereo and tried to find a station that didnt run the days classified results full of good intentions rebus opened the door of the flat sensing immediately that nobody was home well it was saturday night after all but they might at least have turned the tv off he went into the box room and placed the old photograph on michaels unmade bed the room smelt faintly of perfume reminding rebus of patience he missed her more than he liked to admit when theyd first started seeing one another theyd agreed that they were both too old for anything that could be called love theyd also agreed that they were more than ready for lashings of sex then when rebus had moved in theyd talked again it didnt really mean commitment they were agreed on that it was just handier for the moment ah but when rebus had rented out his own flathat had meant commitment commitment to sleeping on the sofa should patience ever kick him out he lay along the sofa now noticing that he had all but annexed what had been the flats main communal space the students tended to sit around in the kitchen now talking quietly with the door closed rebus didnt blame them it was all a mess in here and all his mess his suitcase lay wide open on the floor beside the window ties and socks trickling from it the holdall was tucked behind the sofa his two suits hung limply from the picturerail next to the box room partially blocking out a psychedelic poster which had been making rebuss eyes hurt the place had a feral smell from lack of fresh air the smell suited it though after all wasnt this rebuss lair he picked up the telephone and rang patience her taped voice spoke to him the message was new im going with susan and jenny back to their mothers any messages leave them after the tone rebuss first thought was how stupid patience had been the message let any callerany callerknow she wasnt home he knew that burglars often telephoned first they might even go through the phone book more or less at random finding phones that rang and rang or answering machines you had to make your message vague he guessed that if shed gone to her sisters she wouldnt be back until tomorrow night at the earliest and might even stay over on the monday hi patience he said to the machine its me im ready to talk when you are miss you bye so the girls had gone maybe now things could get back to normal no more smouldering susan no more gentle jenny they werent the cause of the rift between rebus and patience but maybe they hadnt helped no they definitely hadnt helped he made himself a cup of coffee substitute all the time thinking of wandering down to the lateopening shop at the corner of marchmont road but their coffee was instant and expensive and besides maybe this stuff would taste okay it tasted awful and was absolutely caffeinefree which was probably why he fell asleep during a dreary midevening movie on the television and awoke to a ringing telephone someone had switched the tv off and perhaps that same person had thrown the blanket over him it was getting to be a regular thing he was stiff as he sat up and reached for the receiver his watch told him it was onefifteen am hello is that inspector rebus speaking rebus rubbed at his hair inspector this is pc hart im in south queensferry yes theres someone here claims hes your brother michael thats the name he gave whats up is he guttered nothing like that sir what is it then well sir weve just found hi rebus was very awake now found him where he was hanging from the forth rail bridge what rebus felt his hand squeezing the telephone receiver to death hanging i dont mean like that sir sorry irebuss grip relaxed no i mean he was hanging by his feet sort of suspended like just hanging in midair we thought it was some sort of joke gone wrong at first you know bungee jumper that kind of thing pc hart was leading rebus to a but on the quayside at south queensferry the firth of forth was dark and quiet in front of them but rebus could make out the rail bridge lowering far above them but thats not the story he gave us besides it was clear he hadnt taken the dive on his own how clear his hands were tied together sir and his mouth had been taped shut christ doctor says hell be all right if theyd tipped him over the side his legs couldve come out of the sockets but the doc reckons they must have lowered him over how did they get onto the bridge in the first place its easy enough if youve a head for heights rebus who had no head for heights had already declined the offer of a visit to the spot where michael had been found up on the ochrecoloured iron construction looks like they waited till they knew thered be no trains about but a boat was going under the bridge and the skipper thought he saw something so he radioed in otherwise well he could have been up there all night hart shook his head a cold night i cant say id fancy it they were at the but now there was only enough room inside for two men one of these seated with a blanket over his shoulders was michael the other was a local doctor called from his bed by the look of him other men stood around police the proprietor of a hotel on the waterfront and the boat skipper who might just have saved michaels life or at the very least his sanity john thank christ michael was trembling and seemed to have no colour in him at all the doctor was holding a hot cup of something from which he was coaxing michael to drink drink up mickey said rebus michael looked pathetic like the victim of some terrible tragedy rebus felt a tremendous sadness overwhelm him michael had spent years in jail where god knows what had happened to him then released hed had no luck at all until hed come to edinburgh the bravado the nights out with the students rebus suddenly saw it for what it really was a front an attempt to put behind him all that michael had feared these past few years and now this had happened reducing him to the crouched shivering animal in the hut ill be back in a second mickey rebus pulled hart around the side of the hut what has he told you he was trying to control the fury inside him he said he was in your flat sir on his own when this afternoon about four there was a ring at the doorbell so he answered and three men pushed their way in the first thing they did was put a cloth bag over his head then they held him down and tied him up took the bag off and taped shut his mouth then put the bag back he didnt see them they kept his face against the hall carpet he just got the quick glimpse of them when he opened the door go on rebus was trying not to look up at the rail bridge instead he focused on the flashing red lights on top of the more distant road bridge they seem to have wrapped something like a carpet around him and taken him downstairs and into a van it was pretty cramped in there according to your brother narrow like he reckoned there were boxes either side of him hart paused he didnt like the look of concentration on the inspectors face well rebus snapped he says they drove around for hours not saying anything then he was lifted out of the van and taken into something like a cellar or a storeroom they never took the bag off his head so he cant be sure hart paused i didnt want to question him too closely sir in his present condition rebus nodded anyway finally they brought him up here tied him to the side of the bridge and lowered him over it they still hadnt said anything but when they started to lower away they finally took the bag off his head christ rebus screwed shut his eyes it brought back the grimmest memories of his own sas training the way theyd tried to get him to hand over information taking him up in a helicopter with a bag over his head then threatening to drop him out and carrying out their threabut only eight feet off the ground not the hundreds of feet hed visualised horrible all of it he pushed past hart pulled the doctor out of the way and bent down to hug michael keeping him close against his chest as he heard michael start to bawl the crying lasted for many minutes butrebus wasnt about to let go and then at last it was over racking dry coughs the breathing slowing and a sort of calm michaels face was a mess of tear tracks and mucus rebus handed him a handkerchief the ambulance is waiting the doctor said quietly rebus nodded michael was obviously in shock theyd keep him in the infirmary overnight two patients to visit thought rebus what was more he suspected similar motives behind the attacks very similar motives if it came down to it the rage began in him all over again and his scalp prickled like hell but he calmed a little as he helped michael over to the ambulance do you want me to come with you he asked absolutely not said michael just go home eh part of the way to the ambulance michaels legs gave way his knees refusing to lock they carried him instead like taking an injured player off the field closed the door on him and took him away rebus thanked the doctor the skipper and hart hellish thing to happen hart said any idea why it did a few said rebus he went home to brood in his darkened living room his whole life seemed shot to hell someone had been sending him a message tonight theyd either decided to send it via michael or else theyd simply mistaken michael for him after all people said they looked alike since the men had come to arden street they were either working on very old information or else they knew all about his separation from patience which meant they were very wellinformed indeed but rebus suspected the former the name on the doorbell still said rebus though it also listed on a scrap of paper four other names that must have confused them for a minute yet theyd decided to attack anyway why did it mean they were desperate or was it just that any hostage would do to get the message across message received and almost understood almost this was serious deadly serious first brian now michael he had so few doubts that the two were connected it felt like it was time to do something not just wait for their next move he knew what he wanted to do too that one phrase had brought it to mind shot to hell a part of him wanted to be holding a gun a gun would even the odds very nicely indeed he even knew where he could get one didnt he anything from a shag to a shooter he found that hed been pacing the floor in front of the window he felt caged unwilling to sleep and unable to act against his invisible foe but he had to do somethinso he went for a drive he drove to perth it didnt take long on the motorway in the middle of the night in the city itself he got lost once or twice with no one about to ask directions of not even a policeman before finding the street he wanted it was sited on a ridge of land with houses on the one side only this was where patiences sister lived rebus spotted patiences car and found a parking space two cars away from it he turned off his lights and engine and reached into the back seat for the blanket hed brought pulling the blanket over as much of him as it would cover he sat for a while feeling more relaxed than in ages hed thought of bringing some whisky with him but knew the kind of head it would give him in the morning and tomorrow he wanted to be clearheaded if nothing else he thought of patience asleep in the spare room just through the wall from susan she slept soundly the moon lighting her forehead and her cheeks it seemed a long way from edinburgh a long way from the shadow of the forth rail bridge john rebus drifted into sleep and slept well for once when he awoke it was sixthirty on sunday morning he threw aside the blanket and started the car turning the heating all the way up he felt chilled but rested the street was quiet except for a man walking his ugly white poodle the man seemed to find rebuss presence there curious rebus smiled steadily at him as he shifted the gearstick into first and drove away he went straight to the infirmary where despite the early hour prebreakfast tea was being served michael was sitting up in bed with the cup on the tray in front of him he seemed like a statue staring at the surface of the dark brown liquid his face blank he didnt move as rebus approached pulled a chair noisily from a pile beside one wall and sat down hiya mickey hello john michael continued to stare rebus hadnt seen him blink yet going through it again and again eh michael didnt answer ive been there myself mickey something terrible happens you play it over in your mind eventually it fades you might not believe that just now im trying to understand who did it why they did it they wanted you scared mickey i think it was a message for me couldnt they have written instead they got me scared all right i could have shit through a polo mint rebus laughed loudly at this if michael was getting back a sense of humour the rest couldnt be far behind i brought you this he said it was the photograph from aberdeen rebus placed it on the tray beside the untouched tea who are they dad and uncle jimmy uncle jimmy i dont remember an uncle jimmy they fell out a long time ago never spoke again thats a shame uncle jimmy died a few weeks ago his widowauntie enawanted us to have this photo why maybe because were blood rebus said michael smiled you wouldnt always know it he looked up at rebus with wet shining eyes well know it from now on said rebus he nodded towards the cup can i have that tea if youre not drinking it my tongue feels like a happy hours welcomemat help yourself rebus drank the tea in two swallows jesus he said i was doing you a favour believe me i know all about the tea they serve in institutions youre not as daft as you look then rebus paused you didnt see much of them eh who the men who grabbed you i saw bodies coming through the door the first one was about my height but a lot broader the others who knows i never saw any faces sorry problem can you tell me anything no more than i told the constable last night what was his name again hart thats it he thought id been bungeejumping michael gave a low laugh i told him no i was just hanging around rebus smiled but thankfully not at a loose end eh but michael had stopped laughing i had a nightmare about it they had to give me something to make me sleep i dont know what it was but i still feel doped get them to give you a prescription you can sell tabs to the students theyre good kids john i know itd be a shame if they moved out i know that too you remember gail the girl youve been seeing ive seen every inch of her strictly past tense now but she has a boyfriend in auchterarder you dont suppose hes the jealous type i dont think hes behind last night no only ive not been around edinburgh long enough to make any enemies dont worry said rebus ive got enemies enough for both of us thats very reassuring meanwhil yes what about getting a spyhole for your door just think if one of the lassies had answered oh rebus had thought about it and a chain he said im getting them this afternoon he paused hart said something about the van when they pushed me in it was like i was fitting into a narrow space yet i got the feeling the van itself was a decent size so it had stuff in the back then maybe bloody solid whatever it was i bruised both knees michael shrugged thats about it then he thought of something oh yes and it had a bad smell either that or something had died in the carpet they wrapped me i they sat talking for another quarter of an hour or so until michael closed his eyes and went to sleep he wouldnt be asleep for long they were starting to serve breakfast rebus got up and moved the chair back then placed the photograph on michaels bedside cabinet he had another call to pay while he was here but there were doctors with brian holmes and the nurse didnt know how long theyd be she only knew that brian had woken again in the night for almost a minute rebus wished hed been there a minute would be long enough for the question he wanted to ask brian had also been talking in his sleep but his words had been mumbled at best and no one had any record of what hed said so rebus gave up and went off to do some shopping if he phoned around noon theyd let him know when michael was likely to be getting home he went back to the flat by way of the corner shop where he bought a weeks worth of groceries he was finishing breakfast when the first student wandered into the kitchen and drank three glassfuls of water youre supposed to do that before you go to bed rebus advised thank you sherlock the young man groaned got any paracetamol rebus shook his head definitely a bad keg of beer last night i thought the first pint tasted ropey aye but ill bet the second tasted better and the sixth tasted great the student laughed whatre you eating toast and jam no bacon or sausages rebus shook his head ive decided to lay off meat for a while the student seemed unnaturally pleased theres orange juice in the fridge rebus continued the student opened the fridge door and gave a gasp theres enough stuff in here to feed a lecture hall which is why said rebus i reckon itll do us for at least a day or two the student lifted a letter from the top of the fridge this came for you yesterday it was from the inland revenue they were thinking of coming to check on the flat remember rebus told the student anyone asks youre my nephews and nieces yes uncle the student recommenced rummaging in the refrigerator where did mickey and you get to last night he asked i crept in at two and there was no sign of life oh we were jus but rebus couldnt find any words so the student supplied them for him shooting the breeze shooting the breeze agreed rebus he drove to a diy superstore on the edge of the city and bought a chain for the door a spyhole and the tools a helpful assistant suggested would be needed for both jobs a lot more tools than rebus used as it turned out since there was a supermarket nearby rebus did a bit more grocery shopping by which time the pubs were open for business he looked in a few places but couldnt find who he was looking for but he was able to put word out with a couple of useful barmen who said they would pass the message along back at the flat he called the infirmary who told him michael could come home this afternoon rebus arranged to pick him up at four he then got to work he drilled the necessary hole in the door only to find hed drilled it too high for the girl student who had to stand on tiptoe even to get close so he drilled another hole filled in the first with wood putty and then fitted the spyhole it was a bit askew but it would work fitting the sliding chain was easier and left him with two tools and a drillbit unused he wondered if the diy store would take them back next he tidied the box room and put michaels stuff into the washing machine after which he shared the macaroni cheese which the students had prepared for lunch he didnt quite apologise to them for the past week but he insisted they use the living room whenever they liked and he told them also that he was reducing their rentnews they took unsurprisingly well he didnt say anything about michael he didnt reckon michael would want them to know and hed already explained away the extra security on the door by citing several recent burglaries in the locality he brought michael and a large bottle of sleeping tablets back from the hospital having first bribed the students to stay out of the flat for the rest of the afternoon and evening if michael needed to cry again he wouldnt want an audience look our new peephole said rebus at the door of the flat that was quick protestant work ethic or is it calvanist guilt i can never remember rebus opened the door please also note the security chain on the inside you can tell its a rush job look where the paints all scored dont push your luck brother michael sat in the living room while rebus made two mugs of tea the stairwell had seemed full of menace for both brothers each sensing the others disquiet and even now rebus didnt feel completely safe this was not however something he wished to share with michael just the way you like it he said bringing the tea in he could see michael was weepy again though trying to hide it thanks john the phone rang before rebus could say anything it was siobhan clarke checking details of the following mornings surveillance operation rebus assured her that everything was in hand all she had to do was turn up and freeze her bum off for a few hours youre a great one for motivation sir was her final comment so rebus asked michael what do you want to do michael was shaking a large round pill out of the brown bottle he put it on his tongue with a wavering hand and washed it down with tea a quiet night in would suit me fine he said a quiet night in it is agreed rebus operation moneybags began quietly enough at eightthirty on monday morning thirty minutes before davey dougarys bmw bumped its way into the potholed parking lot of the taxicab firm alister flower and his team of course wouldnt be starting work till eleven or a little after but it was best not to think about that especially if like siobhan clarke you were already cold and stiff by opening time and dreading your next visit to the chemical toilet which had been installed for want of any other facilities in a broom closet she was bored too dc peter petrie from st leonards and elsabeth jardine from trading standards appeared to be nursing postweekend hangovers and resultant blues she got the feeling that jardine and her might actually have a lot to talk aboutboth were women fighting for recognition in what was perceived as a male professionbut the presence of petrie ruled out discussion peter petrie was one of those basically intelligent but not exactly perceptive officers who climbed the ladder by passing the exams though never with brilliant harks and not getting in anyones way petrie was quiet and methodical she didnt doubt his competence it was just that he lacked any spark of inspiration or instinct and probably she thought he was sitting there with his thermos summing her up as an overtalkative smartarse with a university degree well whatever he was he was no john rebus she had accused her superior of not exactly motivating those who worked for him but this was a lie he could draw you into a case and into his way of thinking about a case merely by being so narrowminded about the investigation he was secretiveand that drew you in he was tenaciousand that drew you in above all though he had the air of knowing exactly where he was going and he wasnt all that bad looking either shed learned a lot about him by sticking close to brian holmes who had been only too willing to chat about past cases and what he knew of his bosss history poor brian she hoped he was going to be all right she had thought a lot last night about brian but even more about cafferty and his gang she hoped she could be of help to inspector john rebus she already had a few ideas about the fire at the central hote here comes someone said petrie he was squatting behind the tripod and busily adjusting the focus on the camera he fired off half a dozen shots unidentified male denim jacket and lightcoloured trousers approaching the office on foot siobhan took up her pad and copied down petries description noting the time alongside hes entering the officnow petrie turned away from the camera and grinned this is what i joined the police for a life of adventure having said which he poured more hot chocolate from his thermos into a cup i cant use that loo said elsabeth jardine ill have to go out nocan do said petrie it would attract too much attention you tripping in and out every time you needed a piss jardine turned to siobhan hes got a way with words your colleague oh hes a right old romantic but its true enough about going to the toilet the bathroom had flooded during the previous years breakin leaving the floor unsafe hence the broom closet jardine flipped over a page of her magazine burt reynolds has seven bathrooms in his home she commented one for every dwarf muttered petrie rebus might in siobhans phrase have an air of knowing exactly where he was going but in fact he felt like he was going round in circles hed visited a few earlyopening pubs near the offices of the daily newspaper down towards the docks at leith social clubs and betting shops and had asked his question and left his message in all of them deek torrance was either keeping a low profile or else hed left the city if still around it was unfeasible that he wouldnt at some point stagger into a bar and loudly introduce himself and his thirst few people once introduced could forget deek torrance hed also opened communications with hospitals in edinburgh and dundee to see if either of the robertson brothers had received surgery for a broken right arm the old injury found on the central hotel corpse but now it was time to give up and go check out operation moneybags hed left michael still asleep this morning and likely to remain asleep for quite some time if those pills were anything to go by the students had tiptoed in at a minute past midnight well kettled as one of them termed it having spent rebuss thirty quid on beverages at a local hostelry they too had been asleep when rebus had let himself out of the flat he hardly dared admit to himself that he liked sleeping rough in his own livingroom the whole weekend seemed like a strange bad dream now the drive to aberdeen auntie ena michaethen the drive to perth the lockfitting and too much spare time even after all that in which to brood he wondered how patiences weekend had gone shed be back later today for sure hed try phoning again he parked in one of the many side streets off gorgie road and locked his car this was not one of the citys safest areas he hoped siobhan hadnt worn a green and white scarf to work this morninhe walked down onto gorgie road where buses were spraying the pavement with some of the mornings rainwater and was careful not to pause outside the door careful not to glance across the street at the cab offices he just pushed the door open and climbed the stairs then knocked at another door siobhan clarke herself opened it morning sir she looked cold though she had wrapped up well enough coffee the offer was from her thermos and rebus shook his head normally during a surveillance drinks and food could be brought in but not to this surveillance there wasnt supposed to be any activity in the building so it would look more than a mite suspicious if someone suddenly appeared at the door with three beakers of tea and a homedelivery pizza there wasnt even a back entrance to the building hows it going slow this from elsabeth jardine who didnt look at all comfortable there was an open magazine on her lap thank god im relieved at one oclock think yourself lucky then commented dc petrie ah how rebus liked to see a happy crew its not supposed to be fun he told them its supposed to be work if and when we nab dougary and co thats when the party begins they had nothing to add to this and neither did rebus he walked over to the window and peered out the window itself was so grimy he doubted anyone could see them through it and especially not from across the street but a square had been cleaned off just a little enough so that any photos would be recognisable camera working okay so far said petrie i dont really trust these motorised jobs if the motor goes youre buggered you cant wind on by hand got enough batteries two backup sets theyre not going to be a problem rebus nodded he knew petries reputation as a solid detective who might climb a little higher up the ladder yet how about the phone its connected sir said siobhan clarke usually there would be radio contact between any stakeout and headquarters but not for moneybags the problem was the cab company the cabs and their home base were equipped with twoway radios so it was possible that communications from moneybags to hq could actually be picked up across the road there was the added complication too that the cab radios might interfere with moneybags transmissions to avoid these potential disasters a telephone line had been installed early on sunday morning the telephone apparatus sat on the floor near the door so far it had been used twice once by jardine to make a hairdressers appointment and once by petrie to make a bet after hed checked the days horseracing tips in his tabloid siobhan intended using it this afternoon to check on brians condition but now rebus was actually using it to phone st leonards any messages for me he waited oh thats interesting anything else what why the hell didnt you tell me that first he slammed the phone down brians awake he said hes sitting up in bed eating chicken soup and watching daytime tv either of which could give him a relapse said siobhan she was wondering what the other message had been hello brian hello sir holmes had been listening to a personal hifi he switched it off and slipped the headphones down around his neck patsy cline he said ive been listening to a lot of her since nell booted me out where did the tape come from my aunt brought it in bless her she knows what i like it was waiting for me when i woke up rebus had a sudden thought they played music to coma victims didnt they maybe theyd been playing patsy cline to holmes no wonder hed been a long time waking up im finding it hard to take in though holmes went on i mean whole days of my life just gone like that i wouldnt mind i mean i like a good sleep only i cant remember a bloody thing i dreamt about rebus sat down by the bedside the chair was already in place been having visitors just the one nell looked in thats nice she spent the whole time crying my face isnt horribly scarred and no ones telling me looks as ugly as ever what about amnesia holmes smiled oh no i remember the whole thing not that itll help holmes really did look fine it was like the doctors said the brain shuts all systems down thinks what damage has been done effects repairs and then you wake up policeman heal thyself so so said holmes id spent the evening in the heartbreak cafe i can even tell you what i ate whatever it was ill bet you finished with blue suede choux holmes shook his head theyd none left like eddie said its the fastest mover since the king himself so what happened after you ate the usual i sat at the bar drinking and chatting wondering if any gorgeous young ladies were going to slip onto the stool beside mine and ask if i came there often i talked with pat for a while he was on bar duty that night holmes paused i should explain pat is eddies business partner and maybe a sleeping partner too now now no homophobia some of my best friends know gays rebus said youve mentioned calder in the past i can also tell you he doesnt drive thats right eddie does even when hes shitfaced holmes shrugged ive never made it my business you will when he knocks some poor old lady down holmes smiled that car of his might look like a hotrod but its in terrible shape it barely does forty on the open road besides eddies the most if you will pedestrian driver i know hes so slow ive seen him overtaken by a skateboardand that was being carried under somebodys arm at the time so it was just you and calder at the bar until eddie joined us after hed finished cooking i mean there were other people in the place but no obvious villains pray continue well i went to go home someone must have been waiting behind the dustbins next thing i knew there was a draught up my kilt i opened my eyes and saw these two nurses washing my tadger what thats what woke me up i swear its a medical miracle the magic sponge said holmes so who thumped you any ideas ive been mulling it over maybe they were after eddie or pat and why would that be holmes shrugged dont keep secrets from old uncle rebus brian you forget i can read your mind well you tell me then could be theyve not been paying their dues you mean protection insurance as people like to call it well maybe the dynamic duo at the heartbreak cafe seem to think maybe its an unholy alliance of curry house owners disgruntled at the falloff in trade i cant see that neither can i maybe it was nobody brian maybe nobody was after eddie and pat maybe they were after you now why would that be the pink in holmes cheeks grew slightly redder youve seen the black book of course i have i was looking for clues so i had a rifle through your stuff and there it was all in code too or at least in shorthand so nobody but another copper would know what you were on about but im another copper brian now there were a lot of cases in there but only one that stood out the central hotel give the man a cigar yes the central a poker game took place and in attendance were tam and eck robertson neither of whom crop up in the list of punters at the central that night youve been trying to find them no luck so far holmes shook his head but someone told you all this didnt they theres no mention in the files of any poker game now rebus leaned closer would i be right in thinking that the person who told you is the mysterious el holmes nodded then thats all you need to tell me brian who the hell is el at that moment a nurse pushed open the door and came in bearing medicine and a lunch tray for holmes im starving he explained to rebus this is my second meal since i woke up he lifted the metal cover from the plate a pale pink slice of meat watery mashed spuds and sliced green beans yum yum said rebus but holmes looked keen enough he scooped some mash and gravy into his mouth and swallowed it down id have thought he said that since youve figured out the hard part you wouldnt have had any trouble with el sorry to disappoint you who is he its elvis said brian holmes elvis himself told me he lifted another forkful of mush to his lips and started to slurp it down rebus studied the menu finding little to his liking beyond the often painful puns the heartbreak cafe was open all day but hed arrived just in time for the special luncheon menu a footlong sausage on a roll was predictably if unappetisingly a hound dog rebus could only hope that there was no literal truth to the appelation more obscure was the drinks list with one wine called mama liked the rose rebus decided that he wasnt so hungry after all instead he nursed his teddy beer at the bar and handed the menu back to the teenage barman pats not in then he asked casually doing some shopping hell be back later rebus nodded but eddies around in the kitchen yeah the barman glanced towards the restaurant area he wore three gold studs in his left ear he wont be much longer unless hes making something special for tonight right said rebus a few minutes later he picked up his beer glass and wandered over to a huge jukebox near the toilets finding it to be ornamental only he studied some of the presley mementoes on the walls including a signed photograph of the vegas elvis and what looked like a rare sun records pressing both were protected by thick framed glass and both were picked out by spotlights from the surrounding gloom finding himself as if by chance at the door to the kitchen rebus pushed it open with his shoulder and let it swing shut behind him eddie ringan was creating sweat glistened on his face thin strands of hair sticking to his brow as he shook a small frying pan over a gas flame the setup was impressive cleaner than rebus had expected with many more cookers and pots and work surfaces a lot of money had been spent the cafe wasnt just a designer facade amusingly it seemed to rebus there was different music here from the constant diet of presley served at the bar eddie ringan was listening to miles davis the chef hadnt noticed rebus yet and rebus hadnt noticed a trainee chef whod been fetching something from one of several fridges at the back of the kitchen rebus watched as eddie pausing from his work grabbed a bottle of jim beam by its neck and upended it into his mouth taking it away again with a satisfied exhalation hey said the trainee chef no ones allowed in here eddie looked up from the pan and gave a whoop youre just the man he cried the very man come over here if anything he sounded drunker than at their first meeting but then at their first meeting there had been the civilising or at least restricting presence of pat calder as well as the sobering fact of brian holmes attack rebus walked over to the cooker he too was starting to sweat in the heat this said eddie ringan nodding towards the pan is my latest dish pieces of roquefort cheese imprisoned in breadcrumb and spice and fried either panfried or deepfried thats what im deciding jailhouse roquefort rebus guessed ringan whooped again losing his balance slightly and sliding back with one foot your idea inspector rabies im flattered but the names rebus aye well you should be flattered maybe well gie you a wee mention on the menu how about that eh he studied the golden nuggets turning them expertly with a fork im giving this lot six minutes willie im right here how longs that been the protege checked his watch three and a half ive put the butter down there next to the eggs willies my assistant inspector the exasperation in willies voice and expressions made rebus doubt he would be assisting for much longer though younger than ringan willie was about the same size you wouldnt call him slender rebus reckoned chefs were partial to too much r d can we talk for a minute two and a half minutes if you like id like to know about the central hotel ringan didnt seem to hear this his attention on the contents of the fryingpan you were there the night it burned down el was short for elvis and elvis was code for eddie ringan holmes hadnt wanted the wrong people getting hold of the black book and being able to identify the person whod been talking thats why hed gone an extra step in disguising ringans identity hed also made rebus promise that he wouldnt tell the chef holmes had shared their secret it was to have been a secret a little tale spilt from a bottle of bourbon but ringan hadnt poured out nearly enough hed just given holmes a taste did you hear me eddie a minute left inspector you never cropped up on the list of staff because you were moonlighting working there some nights without the other place you worked at knowing anything about it so you were able to give a false name and nobody ever found out it was you there that night the night of the poker game nearly done there was more sweat on eddie ringans face now and his mouth seemed stiff with suppressed anger im nearly done too eddie when did you start on the booze eh just after that night wasnt it because something happened in that hotel i wonder what it was whatever it was you saw it and if you dont tell me about it im going to find out anyway and then im going to come back here for you to emphasise this rebus pushed a finger against the chefs arm ringan snatched the fryingpan and swung it at rebus sending bits of jailhouse roquefort flying in arcs across the kitchen get the fuck away from me rebus dodged the fryingpan but ringan was still holding it in front of him ready to lunge just you get the fuck out of here who told you anyway nobody needed to tell me eddie i worked it out for myself willie meantime was down on one knee a hot cube of cheese had caught him smack in the eye im dying he called get an ambulance get a lawyer this is an industrial injury eddie ringan glanced towards the trainee chef then back at the fryingpan in his hand then at rebus and he began to laugh the laughter becoming uproarious hysterical but at least he put down the pan he even picked up one of the cheese cubes and took a bite out of it tastes like shite he said still laughing and spluttering bits of breadcrumb at rebus are you going to tell me eddie rebus asked calmly im going to tell you this get the fuck out rebus stood his ground though eddie had already turned his back tell me where i can find the bruhead brothers this brought more laughter just give me a start eddie then itll be off your conscience i lost my conscience a long time ago inspector willie lets get a fresh batch going the young man was still checking for damage he held one hand across his good eye like a patch i cannae see a thing he complained i think the retinas cracked and the corneas melted added ringan come on im hoping to have this on the menu tonight he turned to rebus making a show of astonishment still here a definite case of too many cooks rebus looked at him with sad steady eyes just a start eddie away tae fuck slowly rebus turned around and pushed open the door inspector he turned his head towards the chef theres a pub in cowdenbeath called the midtown the locals call it the midden i wouldnt eat the food there rebus nodded slowly thanks for the tip its you thats supposed to give me the tip he heard ringan roar as he exited from the kitchen he placed his empty glass on the bartop kitchens off limits the barman informed him more like the outer bloody limits but no he knew that only now would he be going to the outer limits back to the haunts of his youth he had only dropped into st leonards to pick up a few things from his desk but the duty sergeant stopped him short gentleman here has been waiting to see you he seems a bit anxious the gentleman in question had been standing in a corner but was now directly in front of rebus you dont recognise me rebus studied the man for a moment longer and felt an old loathing oh yes he said i recognise you all right didnt you get my message this had been the other message relayed to him when hed called in from gorgie road he nodded well what are you going to do what would you like me to do mr mcphail youve got to stop him stop who exactly and from what you said you got the message all i was told was that someone called andrew mcphail had phoned wanting to speak to me what i want is bloody protection calm down now rebus saw that the desk sergeant was getting ready for action but he didnt think there would be any need for that what have i got to do mcphail was saying you want me to hit you thatd get me a night in the cells wouldnt it id be safe there rebus nodded youd be safe all right until we told your cell mates about your past escapades this seemed to calm mcphail down like a bucket of ice maybe he was remembering particular incidents during his spell in the canadian prison or maybe it was a less localised fear whatever it was it worked his tone became quietly plaintive but hell kill me who will stop pretending i know you set him on to me it had to be you humour me said rebus maclean said mcphail alex maclean and who is alex maclean mcphail looked disgusted he spoke in an undertone the wee girls stepfather melanies stepfather ah said rebus nodding now he knew immediately what jack morton had done bugger that he was no wonder mcphail got in touch and as rebus had been round to see mrs mackenzie hed thought rebus must be behind the whole scheme has he threatened you mcphail nodded in what way he came to the house i wasnt there he told mrs mackenzie he be back to get me poor womans in a terrible state you could always move get out of edinburgh christ is that what you want thats why youve set maclean on me well im staying put heroic of you mr mcphail look i know what ive done but thats behind me rebus nodded and all youve got in front of you is the view from your bedroom jesus i didnt know mrs mackenzie lived across from a primary school still you could move a location like that its bound to rile maclean further mcphail stared at rebus youre repulsive he said whatever ive done in my life im willing to bet youve done worse never mind about me ill look after myself mcphail made show of pushing past rebus towards the door ca canny mr mcphail rebus called after him christ said the desk sergeant who was that that said rebus was someone finding out how it feels to be a victim all the same he felt a bit guilty what if mcphail had been rehabilitated and maclean did do him some damage scared as he was mcphail might even decide a first strike was his only form of defence well rebus had slightly more pressing concerns hadnt he in the cid room he studied the only available mugshots of tam and eck robertson taken over five years ago he got a dc to make him some photocopies but then had a better idea there was no police artist around but that didnt bother rebus he knew where an artist could always be found it was five oclock when he got to mcshanes bar near the bottom of the royal mile mcshanes was a haven for bearded folk fans and their woolly sweaters upstairs there was always music be it a professional performer or some punter whod taken the stage to belt out will ye go lassie go or both sides the tweed midgie mcnair did good business in mcshanes sketching flattering likenesses of acquiescent customers who paid for the privilege and often bought the drinks as well at this early hour midgie was downstairs reading a paperback at a corner table his sketchpad sat on the table beside him along with half a dozen pencils rebus placed two pints on the table then sat down and produced the photos of the bruhead brothers not exactly butch and sundance are they said midgie mcnair not exactly said rebus john rebus had once known cowdenbeath very well indeed having gone to school there it was one of those fife mining communities which had grown from a hamlet in the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries when coal was in great demand such demand that the cost of digging it out of the ground hardly entered the equation but the coalfields of fife didnt last long there was still plenty of coal deep underground but the thin warped strata were difficult and therefore costly to mine he supposed some opencast mining might still be going onat one time west central fife had boasted europes biggest hole in the groundbut the deep pitshafts had all been filled in in rebuss youth there had been three obvious career choices for a fifteenyearold boy the pits rosyth dockyard or the army rebus had chosen the last of these nowadays it was probably the only choice on offer like the towns and villages around it cowdenbeath looked and felt depressed closed down shops and drab chainstore clothes but he knew that the people were stronger than their situation might suggest hardship bred a bitter quickfire humour and a resilience to all but the most terminal of lifes tragedies he didnt like to think about it too deeply but inside he felt like he really was coming home edinburgh might have been his base for twenty years but he was a fifer fly fifers some people called them rebus was ready to do battle with some very fly people indeed monday night was the quietest of the week for pubs across the land the pay packets or dole money had disappeared over the course of the weekend monday was for staying in not that you would know this from the scene that greeted rebus as he pushed open the door to the midden its name belittled it its interior was no worse than many a bar in edinburgh and elsewhere basic yes with a red linoleum floor spotted black from hundreds of cigarette dowps the tables and chairs were functional and though the bar was not large enough space had been found for a pool table and dartboard a game of darts was in progress when rebus entered and one young man marched around the pool table potting shot after shot as he squinted through the smoke which rose from the cigarette in his mouth at a corner table three old men all wearing flat bunnets were playing a tense game of dominoes groups of steady drinkers filling the other tables so rebus had no choice but to stand at the bar there was just room for one more and he nodded a greeting to the pint drinkers either side of him a greeting no one bothered to return pint of special please he said to the slickhaired barman special son right you are rebus got the feeling this fiftyish bartender would call even the domino players son the drink was poured with the proper amount of care like the ritual it was in this part of the world special son there you are rebus paid for the beer it was the cheapest pint hed bought in months he started to think about how easy it would be to commute to work from fif pint of spesh dod spesh son right you are the pool player stood just behind rebus not quite menacingly he placed his empty glass on the bartop and waited for it to be refilled rebus knew the youth was interested maybe waiting to see whether rebus would speak but rebus didnt say anything he just took photocopies of the two drawings out of his jacket pocket and unfolded them hed had ten copies of each made up at a newsagents on the royal mile the originals were safe in the glove compartment of his car though how safe his car itself was parked on the poorly lit street outside was another matter he could feel the drinkers either side of him glance at the drawings and didnt doubt that the youth was having a look too still nobody said anything spesh son there you are the pool player picked up the glass spilling some beer onto the sheets of paper rebus turned his head towards him sorry about that rebus had seldom heard a less sincere tone of voice thats all right he said matching the tone ive got plenty more copies oh aye the youth took his change from the barman and went back to the pool table crouching to load coins into the slot the balls fell with a dull rumble and he started to rack them up staring at rebus you do a bit of drawing eh rebus who had been wiping the drawings with his hand turned to dod the barman not me no good though arent they he turned the drawings around slowly so dod could get a better look oh aye no bad im no an expert like the only things anybody around here draws are the pension or the dole there was laughter at this or a bowl added one drinker he made the word sound like bowel but rebus knew what he meant or a cigarette somebody else suggested but the joke was by now history the barman nodded towards the drawings anybody in particular like rebus shrugged could be brothers eh rebus turned to the drinker on his left who had just spoken what makes you say that the drinker twitched and turned to stare at the row of optics behind the bar they look similar rebus examined the two drawings as requested midgie had aged the brothers five or six years you could be right or cousins maybe said the drinker on his right related though rebus mused i cannae see it myself said dod the barman look a bit closer rebus advised he ran his finger over the sheets of paper same chins eyes look the same too maybe they are brothers who are they then asked the drinker on his right a middleaged man with square unshaven jaw and lively blue eyes but rebus just shrugged again one of the domino players came to the bar to order a round he looked like hed just won a rubber and clapped his hands together hows it going then james he asked the drinker on rebuss right no bad matt yourself ach just the same he smiled at rebus havenae seen you in here afore son rebus shook his head ive been away oh aye three pints had appeared on a metal tray there you go matt thanks dod matt handed over a tenpound note as he waited for change he saw the drawings butch and sundance eh he laughed rebus smiled warmly or more like steptoe and son steptoe and brother rebus suggested brothers matt studied the drawings he was still studying them when he asked are you the polis then son do i look like the polis no exactly no fat enough for a start said dod eh son you get skinny polis though argued james what about stecky jamieson right enough said dod thon bugger could hide behind a lamp post matt had picked up the tray of drinks the other domino players at his table called out that they were gasping matt nodded towards the drawings ive seen yon buggers afore he said before moving off rebus drained his glass and ordered another the drinker on his left finished and fixing a bunnet to his head started to make his goodbyes cheerio then dod aye cheerio cheerio james this went on for minutes the long cheerio rebus folded the drawings and put them in his pocket he took his time over the second pint there was some talk of football extramarital affairs the nonexistent job market mind you the amount of affairs that seemed to be going on rebus was surprised anyone found the time or energy for a job you know what this part of fifes become offered james a giant diy store you either work in one or you shop there thats about it true enough said dod though there was little conviction in his voice rebus finished the second pint and went to visit the gents the place stank to high heaven and the graffiti was poor nobody came in for a quiet word not that hed been expecting it on his way back from bathroom to bar he stopped at the dominoes game matt he asked sorry to interrupt you didnt say where you thought youd seen butch and sundance maybe just the one o them said matt the doms had been shuffled and he picked up seven three in one hand and four in the other it wasnae here though maybe lochgelly for some reason i think it was lochgelly he put the dominoes face down on the tabletop and picked out the one he wished to play the man next to him chapped bad sign that tam this early on bad sign indeed rebus would have to go to lochgelly he returned to the bar and said his own brief cheerio or you could draw a fire someone at the bar was saying poking the embers of that longdead joke the drive from cowdenbeath to lochgelly took rebus through lumphinnans his father had always made jokes about lumphinnans rebus wasnt sure why and certainly couldnt recall any of them when hed been young the skies had been full of smoke every house heated by a coal fire in the sitting room the chimneys sent up a grey plume into the evening air but not now now central heating and gas had displaced old king coal it saddened rebus this silence of the lums it saddened him too that he would have to repeat his performance with the drawings hed hoped the midden would be the start and finish of his quest of course it was always possible eddie had been setting a false trail in the first place if so rebus would see he got his just desserts and it wouldnt be blue suede choux he did his act in three pubs nursing three halfpints with no reaction save the usual bad jokes including the drawing the pension line but in the fourth bar an understandably understated shack near the railway station he drew the attention of a keeneyed old man who had been cadging drinks all round the pub at the time rebus was showing the drawings to a cluster of painters and decorators at the corner of the lshaped bar he knew they were decorators because theyd asked him if he needed any work doing on the fly like cheaper that way rebus shook his head and showed them the drawings the old man pushed his way into the group he looked up at all the faces around him all right lads here i was decorated in the war he cackled at his joke so you keep telling us jock every fuckin night without fuckin fail sorry lads jock apologised he thrust a short thick finger at one of the drawings looks familiar must be a bloody jockey then the decorator winked at rebus im no joking mister jock would recognise a racehorses bahookey quicker than a human face ach said jock dismissively away tae hell wi you and to rebus sure you dinnae owe me a drink fae last wee five minutes after rebus glumly left this last pub a young man arrived it had taken him some time visiting all the bars between the midden and here asking whether a man had been in with some drawings he was annoyed too at having to break off his pool practice so early his screwball needed work there was a competition on sunday and he had every intention of winning the prize if he didnt thered be trouble but meantime he knew he could do someone a favour by trailing this man who claimed not to be a copper he knew it because hed made a phone call from the midden youd be doing me a favour the person on the other end of the line had said when the pool player had finally been put through to him having had to relate his story to two other people first it was useful to be owed a favour so hed taken off from the midden knowing that the man with the drawings was on his way to lochgelly but now here he was at the far end of the town there were no pubs after this until lochore and the man had gone so the pool player made another call and gave his report it wasnt much he knew but it had been timeconsuming work all the same i owe you one sharky the voice said sharky felt elated as he got back into his rusty datsun and with luck hed still have time for a few games of pool before closing time john rebus drove back to edinburgh with just desserts on his mind and andrew mcphail and michael with his tranquillisers and patience and operation moneybags and many other things besides michael was sound asleep when he arrived at the flat he checked with the students who were worried that his brother was maybe on some sort of drugs he assured them the drugs were prescribed rather than proscribed then he telephoned siobhan clarke at home how did it go today you had to be there siri could write the book on boredom dougary had five visitors all day he had pizza delivered lunch drove home at fivethirty any of the visitors interesting ill let you see the photographs customers maybe but they came out with as many limbs as they went in with will you be joining us tomorrow probably only i thought maybe we could talk about the central hotel speaking of which have you seen brian i popped in after work he looks great she paused you sound tired have you been working yes the central christ knows i suppose so rebus rubbed the back of his neck the hangover was starting already you had to buy a few drinks siobhan guessed yes and drink a few right again sherlock she laughed then tutted and afterwards you drove home id be happy to chauffeur you if it would help she sounded like she meant it thanks clarke ill bear it in mind he paused know what id like for christmas its a long way off id like someone to prove that the corpse belongs to one of the bruhead brothers the body had a broken i know ive checked the hospitals came up with spit he paused again not your problem he said ill see you tomorrow good night sir rebus sat in silence for a minute or two something about his conversation with siobhan clarke made him want to talk with patience he picked up the receiver again and rang her hello ye gods not an answering machine hello patience john id like to talk are you ready there was silence then yes i think so lets talk john rebus lay down on the sofa one hand behind his head nobody else used the phone that night john rebus was in a good mood that tuesday morning for no other reason than that hed spent what seemed like half the previous night on the phone with patience they were going to meet for a drink he just had to wait for her to get back to him with a place and a time he was still in a good mood when he opened the ground floor door and started up the stairs towards operation moneybags gorgie centre of operations he could hear voices nothing unusual about that but the voices grew in intensity as he climbed and he opened the door just in time to see a man lunge at dc petrie and butt him square on the nose petrie fell back against the window knocking over the camera tripod blood gushed from his nostrils rebus only half took in that two small boys were watching along with siobhan clarke and elsabeth jardine the man was pulling petrie upright when rebus got an arm lock around him pinning the mans arms to his side he pulled rebus to right and left trying to throw him off all the time yelling so loudly it was a wonder nobody on the street below could hear the commotion rebus heaved the man backwards and turned him so that he lost balance and fell to the floor where rebus sat on top of him petrie started forward but the man lashed out with his legs and sent petrie back into the window where his elbow smashed the glass rebus did what he had to do he punched the man in the throat what the hells going on here he asked the man was gasping but still struggling you stop it then something hit rebus on the back of his head it was the clenched fist of one of the boys and it hit him right on his burnt patch of scalp he screwed shut his eyes fighting the stinging pain of the blow and a nausea in his gut right where his muesli and tea with honey were sitting leave my dad alone siobhan clarke grabbed the boy and dragged him off arrest that little bugger rebus said then to the boys father i mean it too if you dont calm down im going to have him charged with assault how would you like that hes too young gasped the man is he said rebus are you sure the man thought about it and calmed down thats better rebus rose from the mans chest now is someone going to explain all this to me it was quickly explained once petrie had been sent off to find a doctor for his nose and the boys had been sent home the man was called bill chilton and bill chilton didnt like squatters squatters thats what wee neilly told me squatters rebus turned to siobhan clarke shed been downstairs to check no passersby had been injured by falling glass and more importantly to explain the accident the two boys she said now came barging in they said they sometimes played here rebus stopped her and turned to chilton why isnt neil at school hes been suspended for fighting rebus nodded hes got a fair punch on him the back of his head throbbed agreement he turned back to siobhan they asked us what we were doing and ms jardineat this elsabeth jardine lowered her headtold them we were squatters just joking jardine found it necessary to add rebus feigned surprise and she lowered her eyes again blushing furiously dc petrie joined in the boys cleared out and we all had a laugh about it a laugh rebus said it wasnt a laugh it was a breach of security he sounded as furious as he looked so that even siobhan turned her eyes away from his he now turned his gaze on bill chilton well chilton continued neil came home and told me there were squatters here weve had a lot of that going on this past year or two deserted tenement flats being broken open and used for all sorts of thingdrug pushing and that some of us are doing something about it what are we talking about here mr chilton vigilante tactics pickaxe handles at dawn chilton was unabashed you lot are doing bugger all so you came up here looking to scare the squatters off before they got a toehold aye and chilton said nothing and rebus said for him you started shouting the odds at dc petrie who started shouting back that he was a police officer and youd better bugger off only by that time you were too fired up to back off got a bit of a temper mr chilton maybe its rubbed off on neilly eh did you get into a lot of fights at school what the hells that got to do with anything chiltons anger was rising again rebus raised a pacifying hand its a serious offence assaulting a police officer mistaken identity said chilton even after hed identified himself chilton shrugged he never showed me any id rebus raised an eyebrow youre very knowledgeable about procedure maybe youve been in this sort of trouble before eh this shut chiltons mouth maybe if i go down the station and look you up on the computewhat would this be second offence third might we be talking about a wee trip to saughton jail chilton was looking decidedly uncomfortable which was exactly what rebus wanted of course he said we could always shut the book on this one chilton looked interested if rebus warned you could keep your gob shut about it and get neil and his pal to forget they saw anything chilton nodded towards the camera youre watching somebody eh a stakeout best if you dont know mr chilton do we have a deal chilton thought about it then nodded good said rebus now get the fuck out of here chilton knew when he was being made an offer he got the fuck out of there rebus shook his head sir shut up and listen rebus told siobhan clarke this couldve blown the whole thing maybe it has we wont know for a day or two meanwhile get that camera set up again and get back to work phone hq and get someone in here to board up the window leaving a big enough hole for the camera either that or we need a new pane of glass and listen to me the two of you he raised a warning finger nobody gets to know about this nobody its forgotten as of now understand they understood what they did not understand perhaps was exactly why rebus wanted it kept quiet it wasnt that he feared the early termination of operation moneybagsas far as he was concerned the whole project was doomed to failure anyway no it was another fear altogether the fear that detective inspector alister flower safe and snug in the firth pub with his own surveillance crew would find out by god that would mean trouble more trouble than rebus was willing to contemplate a pity then that he hadnt managed to say anything to dc peter petrie who went back to st leonards for a change of shirt the blood on his tshirt might have been mistaken for tomato sauce or old tea but there was no doubting the cause of the white gauze pad which had been taped across his nose and half his face and when questioned peter petrie quite gladly told his story embellishing it only a littleas for example in exaggerating his assailants size skill and speed of attack there were sympathetic smiles and shakes of the head and the same comment was uttered by more than one fellow officer wait till flower hears about this by lunchtime flower had heard from several sources about the giant who had wreaked such havoc to the gorgie surveillance dearie me he said sipping an orange juice laced with blue label vodka thats terrible i wonder if chief inspector lauderdale knows ach of course he does rebus wouldnt try to keep a thing like that from him would he and he smiled so warmly at the dc seated beside him that the dc got quite worried really quite worried about his bos siobhan picked up the telephone hello she watched john rebus staring out of the broken window hed been watching the taxi offices for half an hour so deep in thought that neither she nor jardine had uttered a word to one another above a whisper its for you sir rebus took the receiver from her it was cid with a message to relay go ahead from someone called pat calder he says a mr ringan has disappeared disappeared yes and he wanted you to know do you want us to do anything this end no thanks ill go have a word myself thanks for letting me know rebus put down the phone whos disappeared siobhan asked eddie ringan the heartbreak cafe rebus nodded i was only speaking to him yesterday he threatened me with a panful of hot cheese siobhan was looking interested but rebus shook his head you stay here at least until petrie gets back the heartbreak cafe was only five minutes away rebus wondered if calder would be there a kitchen without a chef after all it was hardly worth opening for the da but when rebus arrived the cafe was doing a brisk trade in early lunches calder acting as maitre d waved to rebus when he entered passing the same young barman as yesterday rebus gave him a wink calder was looking frantic what the hell did you say to eddie yesterday what do you mean come off it you had a standup row didnt you i knew something was wrong he was edgy as hell all last night and his cooking went to pot calder saw no humour in this you must have said something who told you calder cocked his head towards the kitchen willie rebus nodded understanding and today willie gets his chance for fame and fortune hes doing the lunches if thats what you mean so when did eddie go missing after we closed last night he went off to look for some club or other one of those moveable feasts that takes over a warehouse for one night a week you didnt fancy it yourself calder wrinkled his nose in distaste would this be a dub for gentlemen mr calder a gay club yes no secret there inspector its all quite legit im sure it is and mr ringan didnt come home no so maybe he found someone else to go home wit eddies not that type then what type is he the faithful type believe me he often goes out drinking but he always comes back until now yes rebus considered bit early yet to start a missing person file we usually give it at least fortyeight hours if theres no other evidence what sort of evidence well a body for example calder turned his head away christ he said look im sure theres nothing to worry about im not said pat calder no and neither was john rebus calder slapped a smile on his face as a couple entered the cafe he picked up two menus and asked them to follow him to a table they were in their early twenties and dressed fashionably the man looking like hed walked out of a s gangster flick the woman like shed put on her wee sisters skirt by mistake when calder came back he spoke in an undertone someone should tell her you cant hide acne with panstick you know eddie hasnt been the same since the night brian was attacked brians okay now by the way yes eddie rang the hospital yesterday he didnt visit though we hate hospitals too many friends dying in them lately the news about brian didnt cheer him up calder pursed his lips i suppose it did for a little while he pulled a notebook and pen out of his pocket must go and see what they want to drink rebus nodded ill just have a word with willie and your barman see what they think fine lunch is on the house rebus shook his head we wont poison you inspector its not that said rebus its all this presley stuff on the walls it fair takes away my appetite willie the trainee chef looked like he was enjoying his day as ruler of all he surveyed flustered as he was with no one to help him still he gave off an air of never wanting things to change remember me willie willie glanced up jailhouse roquefort he went back to shimmying pans then started to chop a bunch of fresh parsley rebus marvelled at how speedily he worked with the knife mere millimetres from his fingertips you here about eddie hes a mad bastard that but a brilliant chef must be fun to be in charge though it would be if i got the credit but those buggers out there probably think the great eduardos prepared each dish of the day like pat says if they knew he wisnae here theyd go off for a tandoori businessmans lunch at half the price rebus smiled still being in charg willie stopped chopping what you think ive got eddie stashed away in my coal bunker just so i can have a day of tearing around like a madarsed fly he waved his knife towards the kitchen door pat might lend a hand but no hes got to be out there buttering up the clientele butter pat thats his name if i was going to do away with either one of them itd be the one right outside that door youre taking it very seriously willie eddies only been missing overnight could be sleeping it off in the gutter somewhere thats not what pat thinks and what do you think willie tasted from a steaming vat i think ive put too much cream in the potage its the way elvis would have wanted it commented rebus the barman whose name was toni with an i poured rebus a murky half pint of cask conditioned this looks as conditioned as my hair i know a good hairdresser if youre interested rebus ignored the remark then decided to ignore the beer too he waited while toni chattily served two student types at the other end of the bar how did eddie seem after i left yesterday whats the name of that scorsese film taxi driver the barman shook his head raging bull that was eddie he was like that all evening i didnt see him much by the time he comes out of the kitchen im putting on my coat to go home was there anyonunusual in the bar last night you get a mixed crowd in here any particular type of unusual forget it it looked like toniwithani already had it was beginning to look like the circle was now complete eddie told holmes something about the body in the central hotel holmes tried to find out more by going after the bruhead brothers then rebus came along to offer help now all three had been warned off in some way or other well he hoped eddie was just being warned off he hoped it wasnt more drastic everyone knew the chef had trouble keeping his mouth shut after a drink and after a drink seemed to be his permanent state yes rebus was worried theyd tried scaring him off and only made him more determined so would they now pull another stunt or would they perhaps revert to more certain means of silence rebuss face was as dark as the sky when he walked back into st leonards only to be ordered immediately to lauderdales office lauderdale was pouring whisky into three glasses ah there you are rebus could not deny it summoned by bells sir he accepted the glass trying not to look at alister flowers beaming face the three men sat down cheers offered lauderdale heres tae us said flower rebus just drank been having a bit of bother john lauderdale was positioning his halfempty glass on the desk when he used rebuss first name rebus knew he was in trouble i dont know about that sir there was a minor hiccup this morning all taken care of lauderdale nodded still seeming affable flower had crossed his legs at ease with the world when lauderdale next spoke he held up a finger to accompany each point two schoolkids barge in on you then dc petrie gets into a punchup with a complete stranger a window is smashed and so is petries nose dc clarkes down at street level trying to brush away broken glass and curious passersby he looked up from his full hand any possibility john that operation moneybags has been placed in jeopardy no possibility sir rebus held up one finger the man wont talk because if he does well charge him with assault a second finger and the boys wont talk because the father will warn them not to he held his two fingers in the air then lowered his hand with all due respect sir the little weed was saying weve got a fight and a broken window in what was supposed to be a deserted building people are nosy its human nature theyll be looking up at that window tomorrow and theyll be wondering any movement behind the window will be noticed lauderdale turned to rebus john what inspector flower says is true sir as far as it goes but people are quick to forget what theyll see tomorrow is a new window end of story nobody saw anything from the taxi offices and even if they heard the glass its not like it doesnt happen every day along gorgie even so joh even so sir it was a mistake ive already made that clear to dc clarke he could have told them that it was all the fault of the woman from trading standards but making excuses made you seem weak rebus could take this on the chin hed even take it on the back of his scalp if it would get him out of the office any faster the aromas of whisky and body odour were making him slightly queasy alister well sir you know my view on the subject lauderdale nodded john he said a lot of planning has gone into operation moneybags and theres a lot at stake if youre going to let a couple of kids wander into the middle of the surveillance maybe its time you rethought your priorities for example those files beside your desk that stuffs five years old get your brain back to the here and now understand yes sir we know you must have been affected by the attack on ds holmes what im asking is are you up to helping run operation moneybags ah here it was the little weed wanted the surveillance for himself he wanted to be the one to bring in dougary im up to it sir no more fuckups then understood understood sir rebus would have said anything to shorten the meeting well just about anything but he was damned if he was going to hand anything to flower least of all a case like this even if he did think it a waste of time get back to the here and now lauderdale had said but when rebus left the office he knew exactly where his brain was heading back to the there and then by late afternoon he decided that he had only two options regarding the central hotel only two people left who might help he telephoned one and after a little persuasion was able to arrange an immediate interview there may be interruptions the secretary warned were very busy just now i can put up with interruptions twenty minutes later he was ushered into a small woodpanelled office in a wellmaintained old stone building the windows looked out onto uglier new constructions of corrugated metal and shining steel steam billowed from pipes but indoors you miraculously lost that strong brewery smell the door opened and a thirtyish man ambled into the room inspector rebus they shook hands good of you to see me at such short notice sir your call was intriguing i still like a bit of intrigue close up rebus saw that aengus gibson was probably still in his twenties the sober suit the spectacles and short sleek hair made him seem older he went to his desk slipped off his jacket and placed it carefully over the back of a large padded chair then he sat down and began rolling up his shirtsleeves sit yourself down inspector please now something to do with the central hotel you said there were papers laid out on the desk and gibson appeared to be browsing through them as rebus spoke but rebus knew the man was taking in every word as you know mr gibson the central burnt down five years ago the cause of the fire was never satisfactorily explained but more disturbing still was the finding of a body a body with a bullethole through the heart the body has never been identified rebus paused gibson took off his glasses and laid them on top of the papers i knew the central quite well inspector im sure my reputation precedes you into this office past and present reputations sir gibson made no show of hearing this i was a bit wild in my youth and a wilder crowd youd be hard pressed to find than that congregating in the central hotel in those days youd be in your early twenties sir hardly a youth some of us take longer to grow up than others why did you arrange to meet matthew vanderhyde there gibson sat back in his chair ah now i see why youre here well i thought uncle matthew might appreciate the seedy glory of the central he was wild himself in years past and maybe also you thought it might shock him nobody could shock matthew vanderhyde inspector he smiled but perhaps youre right yes im sure there was an element of that i knew damned fine that my father had asked him to talk to me so i arranged to meet in the worst place i could think of i could probably have helped find a few worse places than the central me too really but the central wawell central and the two of you talked he talked i was supposed to listen but when youre with a blind man inspector you dont need to put up any pretence no need for glazed eyes and all that i think i read the paper tried the crossword watched the tv it didnt seem to matter to him he was doing my father a favour that was all but pretty soon afterwards you put your black aengus days behind you thats true yes maybe uncle matthews words had an effect after all and after the meeting we thought of having dinner togethernot i might add in the central filthiest kitchens ive ever seen but i think i had a prior appointment with a young lady well not that young actually married i seem to recall sometimes i miss those days the media call me a reformed character its an easy cliche but damned hard to live up to your name never appeared on the official list of the centrals customers that night an oversight one you could have corrected by coming forward giving yet more fuel to the newspapers what if they found out now that you were there well inspector that wouldnt be fuel aengus gibsons eyes were warm and clear that would be an incendiary is there anything you can tell me about that night sir you seem to know all of it i was in the bar with matthew vanderhyde we left hours before the place caught fire rebus nodded have you ever been on the hotels first floor sir what an extraordinary question it was five years ago a long time certainly and now the case is being reopened in a way sir yes we cant give too many details thats all right ill get my father to ask the chief constable theyre good friends you know rebus kept silent there was no case nothing he could present to his superiors would cause them to reopen it he knew he was in this all on his own and for not very good reasons there was a brisk tap at the door and an older man came into the office his face strongly resembled aengus gibsons but both face and body were much leaner ascetic was the word that came to mind broderick gibson would rarely loosen his tightknotted tie or undo the top button of his shirt he wore a woollen vneck below his suit jacket rebus had seen church elders like him their faces persuaded more guiltmoney into the collection sorry to butt in broderick gibson said these need a lookover before tomorrow morning he placed a folder on the desk father this is inspector rebus inspector broderick gibson my father and the man who had started gibsons brewing from his garden shed back in the s rebus shook the firm hand no trouble i hope inspector none at all sir replied rebus broderick gibson turned to his son you havent forgotten that do tonight for the sspcc no father eight oclock damned if i can remember i think its eight oclock youre right sir said rebus oh aengus gibson looked surprised will you be there yourself but rebus shook his head i read a piece about it in the paper he was so far below these people on the social ladder he wondered if they could see him at all as theyd climbed theyd sawn off the rungs behind them rebus could only peer up into the clouds catching a glimpse every now and then but they all liked to be liked by the police which was probably why broderick gibson insisted on shaking rebuss hand again before leaving with his father gone aengus gibson seemed to relax im sorry i should have asked you beforewould you like tea or coffee i know youre on duty so i wont ask if youd like to try a beer actually sir said rebus glancing at the clock on the wall i finished work five minutes ago aengus gibson laughed and went to a large cupboard which when opened revealed three barpumps and a gathering of sparkling pint and halfpint glasses the dark is very good today he said darks fine but just a half a half of dark it is in fact rebus managed another half this time of the pale ale but it was the taste of the dark that stayed with him as he drove back out through the brewerys wroughtiron gates gibsons dark the gibsons father and son were dark all right you had to look beneath the surface to see it but it was there to the outside world aengus gibson might be a changed man but rebus could see the young man was just barely in control of himself he even wondered if gibson might be on mood control drugs of some kind he had spent some time in a private nursing homeeuphemism for psychiatric care at least that was the story rebus had heard he thought maybe hed do a bit of digging just to satisfy his curiosity he was curious about one small detail in particular one thing aengus gibson had said he not only knew the kitchens of the central hotel were filthyhed seen them john rebus found that very interesting indeed he returned to st leonards and was relieved to find no sign of lauderdale or little weed hed forgotten to visit holmes so telephoned the hospital instead he knew how it went at the infirmary they could wheel a payphone to your bed brian hello there ive just had a visit from nell he sounded bright rebus hoped he wasnt just getting her sympathy vote how is she shes okay any progress rebus thought about the past twentyfour hours a lot of work no he said no progress he decided not to tell holmes that eddie ringan was missing he might worry himself back into relapse are you thinking of giving up ive got a lot on my plate brian but no im not giving up thanks rebus almost blurted out its not just for you now its for my brother too instead he told holmes to take care and promised him a visit soon better make it very soon theyre letting me out tomorrow or the day after thats good i dont knotheres this nurse in her ach away with ye but rebus remembered a nurse who had treated his scalp a nurse hed become too friendly with that had been the start of the trouble with patience be careful he ordered putting down the phone his next call was to the local newspaper he spoke to someone there for a few minutes after which he tried calling siobhan clarke in gorgie but there was no answer obviously dougary had clocked off for the day and with him her surveillance well it was time for inspector rebus to clock off too on his way out he heard the unmistakable brag of alister flowers voice heading towards him rebus dodged into another office and waited for flower and his underlings to pass they hadnt been talking about him which was something he felt only a little ashamed at hiding every good soldier knew when to hide michael was up and about that evening doing a fair imitation of a telly addict he held the remote control like it was a pacemaker and stared deeply at anything on the screen rebus began to wonder about the dosages hed been taking but there still seemed to be a fair number of tablets in the bottle he went out and bought fish suppers from the local chip shop it wasnt the best of stuff but rebus didnt feel like driving the distance to anywhere better he remembered the chip shop in their home town where the fryer would spit into the fat to check how hot it was michael smiled at the story but his eyes never left the tv he pushed chips into his mouth chewing slowly picking batter off the fish and eating that before attacking the fatty white flesh not bad chips rebus commented pouring irnbru for both of them he was waiting for patiences phone call giving the time and place for their meet but whenever the phone did ring it was for the students it rang for a fifth or sixth time and rebus picked up the receiver edinburgh university answering service its me said siobhan clarke oh hello there dont sound too excited what can i do for you clarke i wanted to apologise for this morning not entirely your fault i should have told those boys who we really were ive been going over it again and again in my head what i should have done well you wont do it again no sir she paused i heard you were carpeted you mean by the chief inspector rebus smiled more like a fireside rug than a length of wilton hows the window boarded up the glassll be replaced overnight anything of interest today you were there for it sir petrie came back in the afternoon oh yes how was he bandaged up like the elephant man rebus knew that if anyone had talked about the mornings incidentand someone hadit must be petrie hed little sympathy ill see you tomorrow yes sir goodnight what was all that about asked michael nothing i thought thats what youd say is there any more irnbru rebus passed him the bottle when patience hadnt phoned by ten he gave up and started to concentrate on the tv he had half a mind to leave the receiver off its cradle the next call came ten minutes later there was tremendous background noise a party or a pub a bad song was being badly sung nearby turn that down a bit mickey michael hit the mute button silencing a politician on the news hello is that you mr rebus its me chick muir here chick was one of rebuss contacts what is it chick the song had come to an end and rebus heard clapping laughter and whistles that fellow you were wanting to see hes about twenty feet away from me with a treble whisky up at his nose thanks chick ill be right there wait a second dont you want to know where i am dont be stupid chick i know where you are rebus put the receiver down and looked over at mickey who seemed to have fallen asleep he switched off the television and went to get his jacket it was a nap chick muir had been calling from the bowery a lateopening dive near the bottom of easter road the pub had been called finnegans until a year ago when a new owner had come up with the inspired change of name because as he explained he wanted to see loads of bums on seats he got bums all right some of whom wouldnt have looked amiss in the original bowery he also got some students and perennial hard drinkers partly because of the pubs location but mostly because of the late licence there had never been any trouble though well none to speak of half the drinkers in the bowery feared the other half who meantime were busy fearing them besides which it was rumoured big ger gave roundtheclock insurancefor a price chick muir often drank there though he managed not to participate in what was reckoned to be edinburghs least musical karaoke eddie ringan for one would have died on the spot at the various awful deaths suffered by hound dog and wooden heart offkey and out of condition the singers could transform a simple word like crying into a multisyllabled meaningless drawl huhkuhryeayeng was an approximation of the sound that greeted rebus as he pulled at the double doors to the pub and slitted his eyes against the cigarette fug as crying in the chapel came to its tearful end rebus felt a hand squeeze his arm you made it then hullo chick what are you having a double grouse would hit the spot not that i believe they keep real grouse in their grouse bottles chick muir grinned showing two rows of dull gold teeth he was a foot and a half shorter than rebus and looked in this crowd like a wee boy lost in the woods still he said it might not be grouse but its a quarter gill well there was logic in that somewhere so rebus pushed his way to the bar and shouted his order there was applause all around as a favourite son of song took the stage rebus glanced along the bar and saw deek torrance looking no more drunk or sober than the last time theyd met as rebus was paying for his drinks hed never to wait they knew him in here torrance saw him and gave a nod and a wave rebus indicated that he had to take the drinks but would be back and torrance nodded again the music had started up oh please no thought rebus not little red rooster on the video a cockerel seemed to be taking an interest in the blonde farmgirl who had come out to collect the morning eggs here you are chick cheers slainte chick took a sip savoured then shook his head im sure this isnt grouse did you see him i saw him and its the right chap rebus handed over a folded tenner which chick pocketed its him all right and indeed deek torrance was squeezing his way towards them through the crush but he stopped short and leaned over another drinker to tap rebuss shoulder john just going he yanked his head towards the toilets at the side of the stage back in a min rebus nodded his understanding and torrance moved away again through the tide chick muir sank his whisky ill make myself scarce he said aye see you around chick chick nodded and placing his glass on a table made for the exit rebus tried to shut out little red rooster and when this failed he followed torrance to the toilets he saw deek having a word with the dj on the stage then pushing open the door of the gents rebus glared at the singer as he passed but the crowd was whipping the middleaged man to greater and greater depths deek was at the communal urinal laughing at a cartoon on the wall it showed two football players in hearts strips involved in an act of buggery and above it was the caption jam tartswell stuffed it was the sort of thing you had to expect on easter road in a pub somewhere in gorgie there would be a similar cartoon portraying two hibernian players rebus checked that no one else was in the gents deek looking over his shoulder spotted him john i thought for a minute you were a williewatcher but rebus was in serious mood i need you to get me something deek torrance grunted remember when you said you could lay your hands on anything anything from a shag to a shooter quoted deck the latter rebus said simply deek torrance looked like he might be about to comment instead he grunted zipped his fly and went over to the washbasin you could get into trouble i could torrance dried his hands on the filthy rollertowel when would you need it asap any particular model they were both serious now talking in quiet level tones whatever you can get will be fine how much anything up to a couple of hundred you sure you want to do this im sure you could get a licence make it legit i could but you probably wont you dont want to know deck deek grunted again the door swung open and a young man grinning from one side of his mouth while holding a cigarette in the other breezed in he ignored the two men and made for the urinal give me a phone number the youth halfglanced over his shoulder at them eyes front son torrance snarled at him guide dogs are gey expensive these days rebus tore a sheet from his notepad two numbers he said home and work ill be in touch rebus pulled open the door buy you a drink torrance shook his head im heading off he paused youre sure about this john rebus nodded when deek had gone he bought himself another drink he was shaking his heart racing a goodlooking woman had been singing band of gold and adequately too she got the biggest cheer of the night the dj came to the microphone and repeated her name there were more cheers as her boyfriend helped her down from the stage his fingers were covered with gold rings now the dj was introducing the next act hes chosen to sing for us that great old number king of the road so lets have a big hand for john rebus there was some applause and the people who knew him lowered their drinks and looked towards where rebus stood at the bar you bastard deek he hissed the dj was looking out over the crowd john are you still with us the audience were looking around too someone rebus realised later must have pointed him out for suddenly the dj was announcing that john was a shy one but he was standing at the bar with the black padded jacket on and his head buried in his glass so lets coax him up here with an extra big hand there was an extra big hand for john rebus as he turned to face the crowd it was fortunate indeed he later decided that deek hadnt given him a gun then and there just the one bullet would have done deek torrance hated himself but he made the phone call anyway he made it from a public box beside a patch of waste ground despite the late hour some children were riding their bikes noisily across the churnedup tarmac they had set up a ramp from two planks and a milk crate and launched themselves into darkness landing heavily on their suffering tyres its deek torrance he said when the telephone was answered he knew he would have to wait while his name was passed along he rested his forehead against the side of the callbox the plastic was cool we all grow up he said to himself its not much fun but we all do it no peter pans around these days someone was on the line now the telephone had been picked up at the other end its deek torrance he repeated quite unnecessarily ive got a bit of new rebus was at work surprisingly early on wednesday morning hed never been known as the earliest of arrivals and his presence in the cid room made his more punctual colleagues look twice just to be sure they werent still warm and safe and dreaming in their beds they didnt get too close though an early morning rebus not being in the best of humours but hed wanted to get here before the days swarm began he didnt want too many people seeing just what information he was calling up on the computer not that there was much on aengus grahame fairmile gibson public drunkenness mostly usually with associated high jinks knocking the policemans helmet off seemed to be a game enjoyed by youthful gibson and his cronies other indiscretions included kerbcrawling in a part of town not renowned for its prostitutes and an attempt to enter a friends flat by the window the key having been lost which landed him in the wrong flat but it all came to a stop five years ago from then till now gibson had received not so much as a parking ticket or a speeding fine so much for his police files rebus punched in broderick gibson too not expecting anything his expectations were fulfilled the elder gibsons youthful indiscretions would be the stuff of musty old files in an annexe somewherealways supposing there were any to begin with rebus had the feeling that anyone associated with scottish sword shield would probably have been arrested for disorderly conduct or breach of the peace at some point in their career the possible exception perhaps being matthew vanderhyde he made a phone call to check that the meeting hed arranged yesterday was still on then switched off the computer and headed out of the building just as a bleary chief superintendent watson was coming in he waited in the newspaper offices public area flipping through the past weeks editions a few early punters came in with spot the ball coupons or the like and a few more hopefuls were checking copy with the people on the classified ads desk inspector rebus shed come from behind the main desk where a stern security man had been keeping a watchful eye on rebus she was already wearing her raincoat so there was to be no tour of the premises today though shed been promising him for weeks her name was mairie henderson and she was in her early twenties rebus had come up against her when she was compiling a postmortem feature on the gregor jack case rebus had just wanted to forget about the whole ugly episode but shed been persistenand persuasive she was just out of college where shed won awards for her student journalism and for pieces shed contributed to the daily and weekly press she hadnt yet forgotten how to be hungry rebus liked that come on she said im starving ill buy you breakfast so they went to a little cafe bakery on south bridge where there were difficult choices to be made was it too early for pies and bridies too early for a fruit scone well then theyd be like everyone else and settle for sliced sausage black pudding and fried eggs no haggis or dumpling mairie was so imploring the woman at the counter went off to ask the chef which made rebus make a mental note to phone pat calder sometime today but there was no haggis or dumpling not even for ready money so they took their trays to the cash till where mantle insisted on paying after all youre going to give me the story of the decade i dont know about that one of these days you will trust me they squeezed into a booth and she reached for the brown sauce then for the ketchup i can never decide between the two shame about the fried dumpling thats my favourite she was about five feet five inches and had about as much fat on her as a rabbit in a butchers window rebus looked down at his fryup and suddenly didnt feel very hungry he sipped the weak coffee so whats it all about she asked having made a good start into the food on her plate you tell me she waved a nono with her knife not till you tell me why you want to know thats not the way the games played well change the rules then she scooped up some eggwhite with her fork she had her coat wrapped tight around her though it was steamy in the cafe good legs too rebus missed seeing her legs he blew on the coffee then sipped again shed be willing to wait all day for him to say something remember the fire at the central hotel he said at last i was still at school a body turned up in the ruins she nodded encouragement well maybe theres new evidencno not new evidence its just that some things have been happening and i think theyve got something to do with that fire and that shooting this isnt an official investigation then not yet and theres no story rebus shook his head nothing that wouldnt get you pasted in a libel court i could live with that if the story was good enough it isnt not yet she began moppingup operations with a triangle of buttered bread so let me get this straight youre on your own looking into a fire from five years ago a fire which turned one man to drink he could have said and led another to the path of selfrighteousness but all he did was nod and whats gibson got to do with it strictly between us he was there that night yet he was kept off the list of the hotels customers his father pulled some strings could be well thats already a story ive nothing to back it up this was a lie there was always vanderhyde but he wasnt going to tell her that he didnt want her getting ideas the way she was staring she was getting plenty of those anyway nothing nothing he repeated well i dont know that this will help she opened her coat and pulled out the file which shed been hiding tucked down the front of her fashioncut denims he accepted the file from her looking around the cafe nobody seemed to be paying attention a bit cloak and dagger he told her she shrugged so ive seen too many films rebus opened the file it bore no title but inside were cuttings and spiked stories concerning aengus gibson those are only from five years ago to the present there isnt much mostly charity work giving to good causes a little bit about the brewerys rising image and ditto profits he glanced through the stuff it was worthless i was hoping to find out something about him from just after the fire mairie nodded so you said on the phone thats why i talked to a few people including our chief sub he says gibson went into a psychiatric hospital nervous breakdown was the word were the words corrected rebus depends she said cryptically then he was there the best part of three months there was never a story the father kept it out of the papers when aengus reappeared thats when he started working in the business and thats when he started all the dogooding shouldnt that be gooddoing she smiled depends she said then of the file its not much is it rebus shook his head i thought not still its all there was what about your chief sub would he be able to say exactly when gibson went into that hospital i dont know no harm in asking do you want me to yes i do all right then and one more question yes arent you going to eat any of that rebus pushed his plate across to her and watched her take her fill when he got back to st leonards there was a call from the chief supers office chief superintendent watson wanted to see him straight away as in ten minutes ago rebus checked that there were no messages for him and called siobhan clarke in gorgie to make sure the new window had been fitted its perfect she told him its got white gunk on it window polish or something we just didnt bother wiping it off we can take shots through it but from the outside it just looks like a new window thats waiting to be cleaned fine said rebus he wanted to make sure he was up to date if watson intended to carpet him over yesterday it would be considerably more than lauderdales fireside rug but rebus had got it way wrong what the hell are you up to watson looked like hed run a halfmarathon gobbling down chilli peppers all the way his breathing was raspy his cheeks a dark cherry colour if he walked into a hospital theyd have him whisked to emergency on a twoman stretcher no better make that a fourman im not sure what you mean sir watson fairly pounded the desk with his fist a pencil dropped onto the floor youre not sure what i mean rebus moved forward to pick up the pencil leave it just sit down rebus went to sit no better yet keep standing rebus stood up now just tell me why rebus remembered a science teacher at his secondary school a man with an evil temper who had spoken to the teenage rebus just like this just tell me why yes sir go on then with respect sir why what the words came out through gritted teeth why youve seen fit to start pestering broderick gibson with respect sir stop all that with respect shite just give me an answer im not pestering broderick gibson sir then what are you doing wooing him the chief constable phoned me this morning in absolute fucking apoplexy watson being a christian of no mean persuasion didnt swear often it was a bad sign rebus saw it all the bash for the sspcc yes and broderick gibson collaring his friend the chief constable one of your minions has been on to me whats it all about the chief constable not knowing anything about it stuttering and spluttering and saying hed get to the bottom of it just give me the officers nam its his son im interested in sir but you looked both of them up on the computer this morning ah so someone had taken notice of his early shift yes i did but i was really only interested in aengus you still havent explained why no sir well its a binebulous watson frowned nebulous whens the graduation party rebus didnt get it since youve obviously watson was happy to explain just got your astronomy degree he poured himself coffee from the machine on the floor offering none to rebus who could just use a cup it was the word that came to mind sir he said i can think of a few words too rebus your mother wouldnt like to hear them no thought rebus and yours would wash your mouth out with soap the chief super slurped his coffee they didnt call him farmer for nothing he had many ways and predilections that could only be described as agricultural but before i say any of them he went on im a generous enough man to say that ill listen to your explanation just make it bloody convincing yes sir said rebus how could he make any of it sound convincing he supposed hed have to try so he tried and halfway through watson even told him he could sit if he liked at the end of fifteen minutes rebus placed his hands out in front of him palms up as if to say thats all folks watson poured another cup of coffee and placed it on the desk in front of rebus thank you sir rebus gulped it down black john have you ever thought you might be paranoid all the time sir show me two men shaking hands and ill show you a masonic conspiracy watson almost smiled before recalling that this was no joking matter look let me put it like this what youve got so far iwell it nebulous sir piss and wind corrected watson somebody died five years ago was it anyone important obviously not or wed know who they were by now so we assume it was somebody the world had hardly known and was happy to forget no grieving widow or weans no family asking questions youre saying let it die sir let somebody get away with murder watson looked exasperated im saying were stretched as it is all brian holmes did was ask a few questions somebody brained him for it i take over my flats invaded and my brother half scared to death my point exactly its all become personal you cant allow that to happen look at the other stuff on your plate operation moneybags for a start and im sure theres more besides youre asking me to drop it sir might i ask if youre under any personal pressure there was personal pressure aplenty as watsons blood rose his face purpling now wait just one second thats not the sort of comment i can tolerate no sir sorry sir but rebus had made his point the clever soldier knows when to duck rebus had taken his shot and now he was ducking i should think so said watson wriggling in his chair as though his trousers were lined with scouringpads now heres what i think i think that if you can bring me something concrete the dead mans identity perhaps within twentyfour hours then well reopen the case otherwise i want the whole thing dropped until such time as new evidence does come forward fair enough sir said rebus it wasnt much good arguing the point maybe twentyfour hours would be enough and maybe charlie chan had a clan tartan thanks for the coffee much appreciated when watson started to make his joke about feeling full of beans rebus made his excuses and left he was seated at his desk glumly examining all the dead ends in the case when he happened to catch word of an altercation at a house in broughton he caught the address but it took a few seconds for it to register with him minutes later he was in his car heading into the east end of town the traffic was its usual self with agonisingly slow pockets at the major junctions rebus blamed the traffic lights why couldnt they just do away with them and let the pedestrians take their chances no thered only be more holdups what with all the ambulances theyd need to ferry away the injured and the dead still why was he hurrying he thought he knew what he was going to find he was wrong it was turning out to be one of those weeks a police car and an ambulance sat outside mrs mackenzies twostorey house and the neighbours were out in a show of conspicuous curiosity even the kids across the road were interested it must be a breaktime and some of them pushed their heads between the vertical iron bars and stared openmouthed at the brightly marked vehicles rebus thought about those railings their intention was to keep the kids in keep them safe but could they keep anybody out rebus flashed his id at the constable on door duty and entered mrs mackenzies house she was wailing loudly so that rebus started to think of murder a wpc comforted her while trying to have a conversation with her own overamplified shoulder radio the wpc saw rebus make her some tea will you she pleaded sorry hen im only cid needs someone a bit more senior to mash a pot of brooke bond rebus had his hands in his pockets the casually informed observer distanced from the mayhem into which he walked he wandered over to the bird cage and peered in on the sand floor amidst feathers and husks and droppings lay a mummified budgie away the crow road he muttered to himself moving out of the living room he saw the ambulancemen in the kitchen and followed them there was a body on the floor hands and face heavily bandaged he couldnt see any blood though he nearly skited on wet linoleum and steadied himself by gripping the edge of the antiquated gas cooker it was warm to the touch a police constable stood by the open back door looking out to right and left rebus squeezed past the carers and their patient and joined the pc nice day eh what i see youre admiring the weather rebus showed his id again no not that just seeing the way he went rebus nodded how do you mean the neighbours say he climbed three fences then ran down a close and away the pc pointed that close there just past the line full of washing behind the clothespole aye that must be the one three fenceone two three its got to be that close over there well done son that really gets us a long way the constable stared at him my inspectors a stickler for notes youre from st leonards not quite your patch is it sir everywheres my patch son and everybodys my constable now what happened here the gentleman on the floor was attacked the attacker ran off rebus nodded i can tell you the how and the who already the pc looked dubious the attacker was a man called alex maclean and he almost certainly punched or headbutted mr mcphail there the constable blinked then shook his head thats maclean lying there rebus looked down and for the first time took in the size of the man a good forty pounds heavier than mcphail and he wasnt punched or butted he had a pot of boiling water thrown over him just a little abashed rebus listened without comment to the pcs version of events mcphail who had been steering well clear of the house had at last telephoned to say hed be popping over for some clothes and things hed fobbed mrs mackenzie off with some story about working long shifts in a supermarket hed arrived and was in the kitchen chatting to his landlady while she put on the water for her boiled eggs boiled eggs every wednesday lunchtime poached on thursdaysthis was one part of mrs mackenzies statement she wanted to get absolutely clear but maclean had been watching the house and saw mcphail go in he opened the unlocked front door and ran into the kitchen a terrifying sight according to mrs mackenzie ill never forget it if i live to be a hundred it was at this point that mcphail lifted the pan and swung it at maclean showering him with boiling water then hed opened the back door and fled over three fences and througha close end of melodrama rebus watched them lift maclean into the back of the ambulance theyd be taking him to the infirmary soon everyone rebus knew in edinburgh would be lying in the infirmary mcphail had been lucky this time if he knew what was good for him he would now take rebuss advice and flee the city dodging the police who would be looking for him rebus wondered if mcphail really did know what was good for him this after all was a man who thought little girls were good for him he wondered this as he sat in heavy lunchtime traffic slowly oozing towards st leonards the route hed taken to broughton had been so slow he saw little to lose by sticking to the bigger roadsleith street the bridges and nicolson street something made him stay on this road till he came to the butchers shop where rory kintoul had ended up bleeding beneath the meat counter he registered only slight surprise at the wooden board which had been placed across the entire front window of the shop pinned to the board was a large white sheet of paper with thick feltpen writing the sign said simply business as usual interesting thought rebus parking his car he noticed that rain or general wear underfoot had done away with the splashes of blood which had once left a crimson trail along the pavement mr bone the butcher was slicing corned beef with a manual machine whose circular blade hissed through the meat he was smaller and thinner than most butchers rebus had come across his face all cheekbone and worry line hair thinning and grey there was no one else in the front of the shop though rebus could hear someone whistling as they worked in the back bone noticed that he had a customer and whatll it be today sir rebus noticed that the display cases just inside the front window were empty doubtless waiting to be checked for slivers of glass before restocking he nodded towards the wooden board when did that happen ach last night bone placed the sliced corned beef in an unsullied section of the display case then skewered the price marker into it he wiped his hands on his white apron kids or drunks what was it a brick search me well if there was nothing lying in the shop it must have been a sledgehammer i cant see a kick with a steel toecap doing that sort of damage now bone looked at him properly and recognised him you were here when ror thats right mr bone they didnt use a sledgehammer on him though did they i dont know what you mean pound of beef links by the way bone hesitated then took out the string of sausages and cut a length from it you could be right of course rebus continued could have been kids or drunks did anyone see anything i dont know you didnt report it didnt have to police phoned me at two this morning to tell me about it he sounded disgruntled all part of the service mr bone thats just over the pound bone said looking at the weighing scales he wrapped the sausages in white paper then in brown marking the price with a pencil on this outer wrapper rebus handed over a fivepound note insurance will take care of it i suppose he said bloody hope so the money they charge rebus accepted his change and made sure to catch bones eye but i meant the real insurance people mr bone an elderly couple were coming into the shop what happened mr bone the woman asked her husband shuffling along behind her just kids mrs dowie said bone in the voice he used with customers a voice he hadnt been using with rebus he was staring at rebus who gave him a wink picked up his package and left outside he looked down at the brown paper parcel it was chill in his hand he was supposed to be cutting down on meat wasnt he not that there was much meat in sausages anyway another passing shopper stopped to examine the boardedup window then went into the shop jim bone would do good business today everyone would want to know what had happened rebus was different he knew what had happened though proving it wasnt going to be easy siobhan clarke hadnt managed to talk to the stabbing victim yet maybe rebus should push her along especially now that she could tell rory kintoul all about his cousins broken window next to his car someone had parked a land roverstyle x inside which a huge black dog was ravening to get out pedestrians were giving the car a wide berth and quite right too the whole vehicle rocked on its axle when the dog lunged at the back window rebus noticed that the considerate owner had left the window open an inch maybe it was a trap intended for a particularly stupid car thief rebus stopped in front of the open window and unrolled the package of sausages into the car they fell onto the seat where the dog sniffed them for a nanosecond before starting to dine the street was blessedly quiet as rebus unlocked his own car all part of the service he said to himself at the station he telephoned the heartbreak cafe where what sounded like a hastily recorded message told him the place would be shut due to convalescence in brian holmes desk drawer he found a printout of names and phone numbers those most often used by holmes himself some numbers had been added at the bottom in blue biro including one for eddie ringan marked h rebus returned to his desk and made the call pat calder answered on the third ring mr calder its di rebus oh the hope left calders voice no sign of him then none right lets make it official then hes a missing person ill have someone come over and why cant you come rebus thought about it no reason at all sir make it anytime you like were shut today what happened to wonderchef willie we had a busy night busier than usual he cracked up came flying out of the kitchen yelling im the chef im the chef lifted some poor womans entree and started eating it himself with his face in the bowl i think hed been taking drugs sounds like he was just doing a good impersonation of lateperiod elvis ill be there in half an hour if thats all right stockbridges colonies had been constructed to house the working poor but were now much desired by young professional types they were designed as maisonettes with steep flights of stone stairs leading to the first floor properties rebus found the proportions mean in comparison with his marchmont tenement no high ceilings here and no huge rooms with splendid windows and original shutters but he could see miners and their families being cosy here a hundred years ago his own father had been born in a miners row in fife rebus imagined it must have been very like thiat least on the outside on the inside pat calder had done incredible things rebus didnt doubt that his was the designing and decorating hand there were wooden and brass ships trunks black anglepoise lamps japanese prints in ornate frames a dinner table whose candelabra resembled some jewish icon and a huge tv hifi centre but of elvis there was nary a jot rebus seated in a black leather sofa nodded towards one of the coffinsized loudspeakers neighbours ever complain all the time admitted calder eddies proudest moment was when the guy from four doors down phoned to tell us he couldnt hear his tv considerate eh calder smiled eddies never been exactly politic have you known one another long calder lying stretched on the floor with his bum on a beanbag blew nervous smoke from a black sobranie cigarette two years casually we moved in together about the time we had the idea for the heartbreak whats he like i mean outside the restaurant brilliant one minute a spoilt brat the next do you spoil him i buffer him from the world at least i used to so what was he like when you met drinking more than he does now if you can believe that ever tell you why he started rebus had refused a cigarette but the smoke was getting to him maybe hed have to change his mind he said he drank to forget now youre going to ask forget what and im going to say that he never told me he never even hinted i think he told brian holmes more than he told me jesus was there a hint of jealousy there rebus had a sudden vision of calder bashing holmes on the nappeand maybe even doing away with fast eddie to calder laughed i couldnt hurt him inspector i know what youre thinking it must be frustrating though this genius you call him wasting it all for booze people like that take a lot of looking after and youre right it can become frustrating especially when theyre gassed all the time calder frowned peering through the smoke from his nostrils why do you say gassed it means drunk i know it does so do a lot of other words its just that eddie used to have these nightmares about being gassed or gassing people you know with real gas like in the concentration camps he told you about these dreams oh no but he used to shout out in his sleep a lot of gays went to the gas chambers inspector you think thats what he meant calder stubbed out the cigarette into a porcelain bedpan beside the fireplace he got up awkwardly from the floor come on i want to show you something rebus had already seen the kitchen and the bathroom and so realized that the door calder was leading him towards must be to the only bedroom he didnt know quite what to expect i know what youve been thinking calder said swinging the door wide open this is all eddies work and what a work it was a huge double bed covered with what looked like several zebraskins and on the walls several large paintings of the rhinestone elvis at work the face an intentional blur of pink and sheen rebus looked up there was a mirror on the ceiling he guessed that pretty much any position you took on that bed youd be able to watch a white onepiece suit at work with a microphonehand raised high whatever turns you on he commented he visited clarke and petrie for a couple of hours just to show willing unsurprisingly jardine had been replaced by a young man called madden with a stock of puns not heard since the days of valve radio madden by name the trading standards officer said by way of introduction mad un by nature make that steam radio rebus began to wonder if it had been such a good idea phoning jardines boss and swearing exotically at him for twenty minutes i make the jokes around here son he warned rebus had spent more exciting afternoons in his life for example being taken by his father to watch cowdenbeath reserves at home to dundee he managed to break the monotony only by stepping out to buy buns at a nearby bakery though this sort of activity was supposed to be verboten he kept the custard slice for himself peeling away and discarding the icing madden asked if he could have it and rebus nodded siobhan clarke looked like shed stepped under a gardyloo bucket she tried not to show it and smiled whenever she saw him looking in her direction but there was definitely something up with her rebus couldnt be bothered asking what he got the idea it was to do with briamaybe brian and nell he told her about bones window make some time he said track down kintoul if not at home then at the infirmary he works in the labs there right right definitely something up with her as was his prerogative rebus eventually made his excuses and left back at st leonards there was a message for him to call mairie henderson at work mairie inspector that didnt take long youre about the only lead ive got its nice to feel wanted she had one of those accents that could sound sarcastic without really flexing any muscle dont get too excited though your chief sub didnt remember only that it was around august making it three months after the central burnt down could mean something or nothing i did my best yes thanks mairie hold on dont hang up rebus wasnt about to he did tell me something apparently some snippet thats stuck with him she paused in your own time mairie this is my time inspector she paused again are you drawing on a fag what if i am since when did you start smoking it beats chewing the ends off pencils youll stunt your growth you sound like my dad well that brought him back to earth here hed thought they werwhat chatting away chatting one another up aye in your dreams john rebus now shed reminded him of the not insignificant age gap between them are you still there inspector sorry my hearing aid slipped out what did the chief sub say remember that story about aengus gibson entering the wrong flat i remember well the woman whose flat he broke into was called mo johnson rebus smiled but then the smile faded that name almost rings a bell hes a football player i know hes a football player but a female mo johnson thats what rings bells but they were faint too faint let me know if you come up with anything i will mairie and mairie what dont stay out too late rebus terminated the call mo johnson he supposed it must be short for maureen where had he come across that name he knew how he might check but if watson found out it would mean more trouble ach to hell with watson anyway he wasnt much more than slave to a coffee bean rebus went to the computer console and punched in the details bringing up aengus gibsons record the anecdote was there but no charges had ever been pressed the woman was not mentioned by name and there was no sign of her address but since gibson was involved cid had taken an interest you couldnt always depend on the lower ranks to hush things up properly and look who the investigating officer was ds jack morton rebus closed the file and got back on the phone the receiver was still warm youre in luck he got back from the pub five minutes ago away ya gobshite rebus heard morton say as he grabbed at the receiver hello two minutes later thanks to what was left of jack mortons memory rebus had an address for mo johnson a day of contrasts from bakery to butchery from the colonies to gorgie road and now to the edge of dean village rebus hadnt been down this way since the water of leith drowning he had forgotten how beautiful it was tucked down a steep hill from dean bridge the village gave a good impression of rural peace yet it was a fiveminute walk from the west end and princes street they were spoiling it of course the developers had squeezed their hands around vacant lots and decaying buildings and choked them into submission the prices asked for the resultant apartments prices as steep as bells brae boggled rebuss mind not that mo johnson lived in one of the new buildings no her flat was a chunk of an older property at the bottom of the brae with a view of the water of leith and dean bridge but she no longer lived there and the people who did were reluctant to allow rebus in they didnt think they had a new address for her there had been another owner between her moving out and their moving in they might still have that owners new address though it would go back a couple of years did they know when ms johnson herself moved out four years ago maybe five which brought rebus back to the fire at the central hotel everything he did in this case seemed to bounce straight back to a period five years ago when something had happened which had changed a lot of peoples lives and taken away at least one life too he sat in his car wondering what to do next he knew what to do but had been putting it off if tangling with the gibsons could earn him minus points he dreaded to think what he might earn by talking with the only other person he could think of who might be able to help help that was a laugh but rebus wanted to meet him all the same christ flower would have a field day if he found out hed hire tents and food and drink and invite everyone to the biggest party in town right up from lauderdale to the chief constable theyd be blowing fuses that could have run hydro stations yes the more rebus thought about it the more he knew it was the right thing to do the right thing he had so few openings left it was the only thing and looking on the bright side if he did get caught at least the celebration would bankrupt little wee hetelephoned first morris cafferty not being a man you just dropped in on will i need my lawyer cafferty growled sounding amused ill answer that for you strawman no i fucking wont because ive got something better than a lawyer here better than a fucking judge in my pocket ive got a dog thatll rip your oesophagus out if i tell it to lick your chops be here at six the phone went dead leaving rebus drymouthed and persuading himself all over again that this jumpedup bastard didnt scare him what scared him more was the realisation that someone somewhere in the ranks of the lothian and borders police was probably listening in to caffertys telephone conversations rebus felt like he was in a corridor with doors locking behind him all the time he saw a gas chamber in his mind and shivered changing the picture six oclock wasnt very far away and at least in dentists waiting rooms they gave you magazines to pass the time morris gerald cafferty lived in a mansion house in the expensive suburb of duddingston duddingston was a suburb by dint of having arthurs seat and salisbury crags between it and central edinburgh cafferty liked living in duddingston because it annoyed his neighbours most of whom were lawyers doctors and bankers and also because it wasnt far from his actual and spiritual birthplace craigmillar craigmillar was one of the tougher edinburgh housing schemes cafferty grew up there seeing his first trouble there and in neighbouring niddrie hed led a gang of craigmillar youths into niddrie to sort out their rivals there was a stabbinwith an uprooted iron railing police discovered that the teenage cafferty had already been in trouble at school for accidentally jamming a ballpoint pen into the corner of a fellow pupils eye it was the quiet start to a long career the wrought iron gates at the bottom of the driveway opened automatically as rebus approached he drove his car along a wellgritted private road with mature trees either side you caught a glimpse of the house from the main road nothing more but rebus had been here before to ask questions to make an arrest he knew there was another smaller house behind the main house linked by a covered walkway this smaller house had been staff quarters in the days when a city merchant might have lived here the gravel road forked to the front and back of the main house a man directed rebus towards the back the servants entrance the man was very big with a biker helmet haircut cut high at the fringe but falling over the ears where did cafferty get them these throwbacks the man followed him to the back of the house rebus knew where to park there were three spaces two vacant and one taken up by a volvo estate rebus thought he recognised the volvo though it wasnt caffertys caffertys collection of cars was kept in the vast garage he had a bentley and a cherryred tbird neither of which he ever drove for daily use there was always the jag an xjshe and for weekends there was a dependable roller which cafferty had owned for at least fifteen years the man opened rebuss door for him and pointed towards the small house rebus got out vidal sassoon was booked up then he said uh the man turned his head rightside towards rebus never mind he was about to walk away but paused ever been in a fight with a man called dougary nane i your business rebus shrugged the big man closed the car door and stood watching rebus walk away so there was no chance to check the tax disc or anything else about the volvo nothing to do except memorise the number plate rebus pulled open the door to the small house and was greeted by a wave of heat and steam the whole structure had been gutted so that a swimming pool and gymnasium could be installed the pool was kidneyshaped with a small circular pool off ita jacuzzi presumably rebus had always hated kidney pools it was impossible to do laps in them not that he was much of a swimmer strawman about bastardin time he didnt see cafferty at first though he had no trouble seeing who was standing over him cafferty lay on a massage table head resting on a pile of towels his back was being kneaded by none other than the organ grinder who just happened to own a volvo estate the organ grinder sensibly pretended not to know rebus and when cafferty wasnt looking rebus nodded almost imperceptibly his agreement with the pretence cafferty had spun around on his backside and was now easing himself into a standing position he tested his back and shoulders thats magic he said he removed the towel from around his loins and padded towards rebus on bare feet see strawman no concealed weapons his laughter was like an apprentice with a raspfile rebus looked around i dont see the but suddenly there it was pulling itself massively out of the swimming pool rebus hadnt even noticed it in there retrieving a bone not a plastic bone either the black beast dropped the bone at caffertys feet sniffed at rebuss legs then shook itself dry onto him good boy kaiser said cafferty the parking attendant had joined them in the sticky heat rebus nodded nowhere in particular i hope you got planning permission for this all above board strawman come on youd better get changed changed for what laughter again dont worry youre not staying to dinner im going for a run and so are youif you want to talk to me a run jesus cafferty turned and walked away towards what looked like a changing cubicle he slapped the organ grinder as he passed him magic same time next week he was hairily muscular with a chest a borders farmer would be proud to own there was flab of course but not as much as rebus would have guessed there was no doubt big ger had got himself in shape the backside and upper thighs were pockmarked but the gut had been tightened rebus tried to remember when hed last seen cafferty probably in cour rebus would have enjoyed a quiet word with the organ grinder but now that the parking attendant gorilla was in spying distance it just wasnt feasible you couldnt be sure how much the oneeared man could hear theres some stuff here it should fit the stuff consisted of sweatshirt running shorts socks and trainerand a headband there was no way rebus was going to wear a headband but when cafferty emerged from his cubicle he was wearing one along with a white running vest and immaculate white shorts he started to limber up while rebus entered the cubicle to change what the hell am i doing he asked himself he had imagined a lot of things but not this some things might be painful in life but this he had no doubt was going to be torture where to he asked when they emerged from the overheated gym into the cool twilit evening he wasnt wearing the headband and he had put the sweatshirt on inside out the legend across its front had read kick me if i stop he supposed it represented caffertys idea of a joke sometimes i run to duddingston loch sometimes up to the top of the seat you choose big ger was bouncing on the spot the loch right said big ger and off they set rebus spent the first few minutes checking that his body could take this sort of thing which was why he was slow to spot the car following them it was the jag driven by the parking attendant at a steady mph remember the last time you gave evidence against me big ger said as a conversational opening it had its merits rebus merely nodded they were running side by side the pavements being all but deserted he wondered if any undercover officers would be snapping photographs of this over in glasgow it was i remember not guilty of course big ger grinned he looked like hed had his teeth seen to as well rebus remembered them being greyishgreen now they were a brilliantly capped white and his haiwas it thicker one of those hairweaves maybe anyway i heard afterwards you went back down to london and had a bit of a time you could say that they ran another minute in silence the pace wasnt exactly taxing but then neither was rebus in condition his lungs were already passing him warnings of the red hot and burning varieties youre getting thin at the back cafferty noticed a hair weave would sort that out it was rebuss turn to smile you know damned fine i got burned aye and i know who burned you too still rebus reckoned his own guess about the hair weave had been confirmed actually he said i wanted to talk to you about another fire oh aye at the central the central hotel rebus was pleased to notice that the words werent coming so easily from big ger either now thats prehistory not as far as im concerned but whats it to do with me two of your men were there that night playing in a poker game cafferty shook his head that cant be right i wont have gamblers working for me its against the bible everything you do from waking till sleeping is against somebodys bible cafferty please strawman call me mr cafferty ill call you what i like and ill call you the strawman the name jarreevery time it had been at the glasgow trial a sheet of notes wrongly glanced at by the prosecution mistaking rebus for the only other witness a pub landlord called stroman now then inspector stroma oh cafferty had laughed at that laughed from the dock so hard that he was in danger of contempt his eyes had bored into rebus like fat woodworm and hed mouthed the word one final time the way hed heard it strawman like i say rebus went on two of your hired heidthebas eck and tam robertson they had just passed the sheeps heid pub rebus sorely tempted to veer inside cafferty knowing it therell be herbal tea when we get back watch out there his warning saved rebus from stepping in a discreet dog turd thanks rebus said grudgingly i was thinking of the shoes cafferty replied know what flowers of edinburgh are a rock band keech they used to chuck all their keech out of the windows and onto the street there was so much of it lying around the locals called it the flowers of edinburgh i read that in a book rebus thought of alister plower and smiled makes you glad youre living in a decent society so it does said cafferty with no trace of irony eck and tam robertson eh the bruheid brothers i wont lie to you they used to work for me tam for just a few weeks eck for longer i wont ask what they did cafferty shrugged they were general employees covers a multitude of sins look i didnt ask you to come out here but now that you are im answering your questions all right i appreciate it really you say you didnt know they were at the central that night no do you know what happened to them afterwards they stopped working for me not at the same time tam left first i think tam then eck tam was a dunderheid strawman a real loser i cant abide losers i only hired him because eck asked me to eck was a good worker he seemed lost in thought for a minute youre looking for them thats it sorry i cant help rebus wondered if caffertys cheeks were half as red as his felt he had a piercing stitch in his side and didnt know how he was going to make the run back you think they had something to do with the body rebus merely nodded what makes you so sure im not sure but if they did have something to do with it im willing to bet you werent a hundred miles behind me cafferty laughed again but the laugh was strained as i recall i was on holiday in malta with some friends you always seem to be with friends when anything happens im a gregarious man i cant help it if im popular know something else i read about scotland the pope called it the arse of europe cafferty slowed to a stop theyd come to near the top of duddingston loch the city just visible down below them hard to believe isnt it the arse of europe it doesnt look like one to me oh i dont know said rebus bent over with hands on knees if this is the ars he looked up id know where to stick the enema caffertys laughter roared out all around he was breathing deeply trying to slow things down when he spoke it was in an undertone though there was no one around to hear them but were a cruel people strawman all of us you and me and were ghouls his face was very close to rebuss both of them bent over rebus kept his eyes on the grass below him when they killed the graverobber burke they made souvenirs from his skin ive got one in the house ill show it to you the voice might have been inside rebuss own head we like to watch and thats the truth i bet even youve got a taste for pain strawman youre hurting all over but you ran with me you didnt give up why because you like the pain its what makes you a calvinist its what makes you a public menace me a simple businessman who has managed to survive this disease called recession no youre more than that said rebus straightening up youre the disease cafferty looked like he might throw a punch but instead he pounded rebus on the back come on time to go rebus was about to plead another minutes rest but saw cafferty walking to the jag what cafferty said you think id run it both ways come on now your herbal tea is waiting and herbal tea it was served up poolside after rebus had showered and changed back into his clothes he had the feeling someone had been through his wallet and diary in his absence but knew they wouldnt have found much there for one thing hed tucked his id and credit cards into the front of his running shorts for another hed about as much cash as would buy an evening paper and a packet of mints sorry i couldnt be more help said cafferty after rebus had sat himself down you could if you tried rebus replied he was trying to stop his legs from shaking they hadnt had this much exercise since the last time hed flitted cafferty just shrugged he was now wearing baggy and wildly coloured swimming trunks and had just had a dip as he dried himself off he showed enough anal cleavage to qualify as a construction worker the devil dog meantime sat by the pool licking its chops of the bone it had been chewing there was not the slightest trace rebus suddenly placed the dog do you own a x cafferty nodded i saw it parked across from bones the butcher on south clerk street this mutt was in the back cafferty shrugged its my wifes car and she often takes the dog into town she gets kaisers bones there besides hes cheaper than a car alarm cafferty smiled fondly at the dog and ive never known anyone bypass him maybe sausages would do it but this was lost on cafferty rebus decided he was getting nowhere it was time to try one final tactic he finished the brew it tasted like spearmint chewing gum a colleague of mine was trying to track down the robertson brothers someone put him in hospital really cafferty looked genuinely surprised what happened he was attacked behind a restaurant called the heartbreak cafe dear me did he find them tam and eck if hed found them i wouldnt have had to come here i thought maybe it was just an excuse for a blether about the good old days what good old days true enough you look about as bad as ever not me though my wild days are behind me he sipped his tea to prove the point im a changed man rebus nearly laughed you tell that line so often in court youre beginning to believe it no its true then you wouldnt be trying to put the frighteners on me cafferty shook his head he was crouching beside the dog rubbing its head briskly oh no strawman the days long past when id take a set of sixinch carpentry nails and fix you to the floorboards in some derelict house or tickle your tonsils with jumpleads connected to a generator he was warming to his subject looking almost as ready to pounce as his dog rebus stayed nonchalant indeed he had one to add to the list or hang me over the forth rail bridge there was silence except for the hum of the jacuzzi and the snuffling of the dog then the door swung open and a womans head smiled heedlessly towards them morris dinner in ten minutes thanks mo the door closed again and cafferty got up so did the dog well strawman its been lovely chatting away like this but i better take a shower before i eat mos always complaining i smell like chlorine i keep telling her we wouldnt have to put chlorine in the pool if the visitors didnt piss in it but she blames kaiser shes youe my wife as of four years and three months rebus was nodding he knew cafferty was married of course hed just forgotten the name of the lucky bride shes the one whos changed me if anyone has cafferty was saying she makes me read all these books rebus knew the nazis had read books too just one thing cafferty mr cafferty go on indulge me rebus swallowed hard mr cafferty whats your wifes maiden name morag said cafferty puzzled by the question morag johnson then he padded away towards the shower kicking off his trunks mooning mightily at rebus as he did so morag johnson yes of course rebus would bet that not many people tried the mo johnson gag in front of big ger but thats where hed heard the name before the woman into whose flat aengus gibson had trespassed had soon afterwards married big ger cafferty so soon after in fact that they must have been going out together at the time the breakin had occurred rebus had his link between aengus gibson the bruhead brothers and big ger now all he had to do was figure out what the hell it meant he rose from his chair eliciting a low growl from the devil dog slowly and quietly he made for the door knowing all big ger had to do was call from the shower and kaiser would be on rebus faster than piss on a lamp post as he made his exit he was remembering those scenarios for his painful execution so lovingly described by big ger john rebus was once again grateful he didnt yet have the gun but there was something else the way big ger had seemed surprised when told about holmes as if he really hadnt known about it added to which how keen hed been to find out if holmes had had any success tracking down tam and eck roberston rebus drove away with more mysteries than answers but one question he was sure had been answered cafferty had been behind michaels abduction he was certain of it now you cant have said siobhan clarke and yet i have said peter petrie he had run out of film plenty of spare batteries of batteries there were plenty but film was there none it was first thing thursday morning and the last thing clarke needed so youd better go and fetch some pronto why me because i am in pain this was true he was on painkillers for his nose and had complained about nothing else all day yesterday so much so that the maddening madden had lost all sense of good fun and bad puns and had told petrie to shut the fuck up now they werent talking siobhan wondered if it was a good idea to leave them alone its special film petrie was telling her he rummaged in the camera case and came out with an empty filmbox the flap of which he tore off and handed to her this is the stuff this she said to him grabbing the scrap of card is a pain in the arse try pyles said madden she turned on him are you being funny its the name of a camera shop on morrison street thats miles away take your car petrie suggested siobhan grabbed her bag stuff that ill find somewhere before morrison street however after ten filmless minutes she began to realise that there was no great demand for special highspeed film in gorgie road it wasnt as if you needed highspeed to take a photo of hearts in action she consoled herself with this thought and resigned herself to the walk to morrison street maybe she could catch a bus back she saw that she was nearing the heartbreak cafe and crossed the road to look at it it had looked closed yesterday when she drove past and there was a sign in the window she read now that the place was closed due to convalescence strange though the door was open a couple of inches and was there a funny smell a smell like gas she pushed the door open and peered in hello yes definitely gas and there was no one around a woman on the street stopped to watch awfy smell o gas hen siobhan nodded and walked into the heartbreak cafe without its lights on and with little natural light the place was all darkness and shadows but the last thing she planned to do was flick an electric switch she could see chinks of light through the kitchen door and made towards it yes there were windows in the kitchen and the smell was much stronger here she could hear the unmistakable hiss of escaping gas with a hankie stuffed to her nose she made for the emergency exit and pushed at the bar which should release it but the thing was sticking or elsshe gave a mighty heave and the door grunted open an inch dustbins were being stored right against it on the outside fresh air started trickling in the welcome smells of traffic exhaust and beer hops now she had to find whichever cooker had been left on only as she turned did she see the legs and body which were lying on the floor the head hidden inside a huge oven she walked over and turned off the gas then peered down the body lay on its side dressed in black and white check trousers and a white chefs jacket she didnt recognise the man from his face but the elaborately stitched name on his left breast made identification easy it was eddie ringan the place was still choking with gas so she walked back to the emergency door and gave it another heave this time it opened most of the way scattering clanking dustbins onto the ground outside it was then that a curious passerby pushed open the door from the restaurant to the kitchen his hand went to the lightswitch dont touch tha there was a tremendous blast and fireball the shock sent siobhan clarke flying backwards into the parking lot where her landing was softened by the rubbish shed scattered only seconds earlier she didnt even suffer the same minor burns as the hapless passerby who went crashing back into the restaurant pursued by a blue ball of flame but eddie ringan well he looked like hed been done to a turn inside an oven which wasnt even hot by the time rebus got there aching after last nights exertions the scene was one of immaculate chaos pat calder had arrived in time to see his lover being carted away in a blue plastic bag the bag was deemed necessary to stop bits of charred face breaking off and messing up the floor the bagging itself had been overseen by a police doctor but rebus knew where eddie would eventually end up under the allseeing scalpel of dr curt all right clarke rebus affected the usual inspectorial nonchalance hands in pockets and an air of having seen it all before apart from my coccyx sir and she gave the bone a rub for luck what happened so she filled in the details all the way from having no film yes why not drop petrie in it to the passerby who had nearly killed her he had been seen to by the doctor too frizzled eyebrows and lashes some bruising from the fall rebuss scalp tingled at the thought there was no smell of gas in the kitchen now but there was a smell of cooked meat almost inviting till you remembered its source calder was seated at the bar watching the world move past him in and out of the dream he had built with eddie ringan rebus sat down beside him glad to take the weight off his legs those nightmares calder said immediately looks like he made them come true eh looks like it any idea why hed kill himself calder shook his head he was bearing up but only just i suppose it all got too much for him all what calder continued shaking his head perhaps well never know dont you believe it rebus said trying not to make it sound like a threat he must have failed for suddenly calder turned towards him cant you let it rest the pale eyes were glistening no rest for the wicked mr calder said rebus he slid off the barstool and went back into the kitchen siobhan was standing beside a shelf filled with basic cookery books most chefs she said would rather die than keep this lot out on display he wasnt any ordinary chef look at this one it was a school jotter with ruled red lines about half an inch apart and an inchwide margin the margins were full of doodles and sketches mostly of food and men with large quiffs neatly written in a large hand inside the margins were recipes his own creations she flipped to the end oh look heres jailhouse roquefort she quoted from the recipe with thanks to inspector john rebus for the idea well well she was about to put the book back but rebus took it from her he opened it at the inside cover where hed spotted a copious collection of doodles something had been written in the midst of the drawings some of them gayly rude but it had been scored out again with a darker pen can you make that out they took the jotter to the back door and stood in the parking lot where so recently someone had thumped brian holmes on the head siobhan started things off looks like the first words all and thats turn said rebus of a later word or maybe turn but the rest remained beyond them rebus pocketed the recipe book thinking of a new career sir siobhan asked rebus pondered a suitable comeback line shut up clarke he said rebus dropped the jotter off at fettes hq where they had people whose job it was to recover legibility from defaced and damaged writing they were known as pen pals the sort of boffins who liked to do really difficult crosswords this wont take long one of them told rebus well just put it on the machine great said rebus ill come back in quarter of an hour make it twenty minutes twenty minutes was fine by rebus while he was here and at a loose end he might as well pay his respects to di gill templer hello gill her office smelt of expensive perfume hed forgotten what kind she wore chanel was it she slipped off her glasses and blinked at him john long time no see sit down rebus shook his head i cant stay the labs going to have something for me in a minute just thought id see how youre doing she nodded her answer im doing fine how about you aw not bad you know how it is hows the doctor shes fine aye he shuffled his feet he hadnt expected this to be so awkward its not true she kicked you out then how the hell do you know about that gill was smiling her lipsticked smile a thin mouth made for irony come on john this is edinburgh you want to keep secrets move somewhere bigger than a village who told you though how many people know well if they know here at fettes theyre bound to know at st leonards christ that meant watson knew lauderdale knew flower knew and none of them had said anything its only a temporary thing he muttered shuffling his feet again patience has her nieces staying so i moved back into my flat plus michaels there just now it was gill templers turn to look surprised sincewhen ten days or so is he back for good rebus shrugged depends i suppose gill i wouldnt want word getting roun of course not i can keep a secret she smiled again remember im not from edinburgh me neither said rebus i just get screwed around here he checked his watch are my five minutes up sorry dont be ive got plenty of work to be getting on with he turned to leave john come up and see me again sometime rebus nodded mae west right right bye gill halfway along her corridor rebus recalled that a mae west was also the name for a lifejacket he considered this but shook his head my lifes complicated enough he returned to the lab youre a bit early he was told keens the word youre looking for well speaking of words were looking for come and have a peek he was led to a computer console the scribble had been ocrd and fed into the computer where it was now displayed on the large colour monitor a lot of the overpenning had been erased leaving the original message hopefully intact the pen pal picked up a sheet of paper here are my ideas so far as he read them off rebus tried to see them in the message on the screen ale i did tum on the gum ole i did man term on the gam rebus gazed up at him and the pen pal grinned or maybe this he said all i did was turn on the gas what all i did was turn on the gas rebus stared at the message on the screen yes he could see iwell most of it the pen pal was talking again it helped that you told me hed gassed himself i still had that half in mind when i started working and spotted gas straight off a suicide note maybe rebus looked disbelieving what scored out and surrounded by doodles on the inside cover of a jotter he tucked away on a shelf stick to what you know and youll do fine what rebus knew was that eddie ringan had suffered nightmares during which he cried out the word gas was this scribble the remnant from one of his bad nights but then why score it out so heavily rebus picked up the jotter from the ocr machine the inside cover looked old the stuff there going back a year or more some of the doodles looked more recent than the defaced message whenever eddie had written this it wasnt last night which meant presumably that it had no direct connection to his gassing himself making ia coincidence rebus didnt believe in coincidence but he did believe in serendipity he turned to the pen pal who was looking not happy at rebuss putdown thanks he said youre welcome each was sure the other was being less than sincere brian holmes was waiting for him at st leonards waiting to be welcomed back into the world what the hell are you doing here dont worry said holmes im just visiting ive got another week on the sick how are you feeling rebus was glancing nervously around wondering if anyone had told holmes about eddie he knew in his heart they hadnt of course if they had brian wouldnt be half as chipper i get thumping headaches but that apart i feel like ive had a holiday he patted his pocket and di flower got up a collection nearly fifty quid the mans a saint said rebus i had a present i was going to bring you what a tape the stones let it bleed thanks a lot something to cheer you up after patsy decline at least she can sing rebus smiled youre fired are you at your aunts this quietened holmes as rebus had hoped it would bring him down slowly then drop the real news into his lap for the meantime nellwell she says shes not quite ready yet rebus knew the feeling he wondered when patience would be ready for that drink still he offered things sound a bit brighter between the two of you ach holmes sat down opposite his superior she wants me to leave the police thats a bit drastic so is separation rebus exhaled i suppose so but all the samwhat are you going to do think it over what else can i do he got back to his feet listen id better get going i only came in to brian sit down holmes recognising rebuss tone sat ive got some bad news about eddie chef eddie rebus nodded what about him theres been an accident well sort of eddie was involved there was no mistaking rebuss meaning hed become good at this sort of speech through repetition over the years to the families of car crash victims accidents at work murders hes dead holmes asked quietly rebus lips pursed nodded christ i was going to drop in and see him what happened were not sure yet the postmortem will probably be this afternoon holmes was no fool again he caught the gist accident suicide or murder one of those last two and your moneyd be on murder my money stays in my pocket till ive spoken to the tipster meaning dr curt rebus nodded till then theres not much we can do listen let me get a car to take you hom no no ill be all right he rose to his feet slowly as though checking his bones for solidity ill be fine really its juspoor eddie he was a friend of mine you know i know said rebus after holmes had gone rebus was able to reflect that hed gotten off lightly brian still wasnt operating at full throttle partly the convalescence partly the shock so he hadnt asked rebus any difficult questions questions like does eddies death have anything to do with the person who nearly killed me it was something rebus had been wondering himself last night eddie was missing and rebus had gone to see cafferty today first thing eddie was dead meaning one less person who could say anything about the night the central burnt down one less person whod been there but rebus still had the gut feeling cafferty had been surprised to learn of holmes attack so what was the answer im buggered if i know john rebus said quietly to himself his phone rang he picked it up and heard pub noises then flowers voice thats some team youve got there inspector one gets his face mashed in and now the other falls on her arse the connection was briskly severed and bugger you too flower rebus said all too aware that no one was listening edinburghs public mortuary was sited on the cowgate named for the route cattle would take when being brought into the city to be sold it was a narrow canyon of a street with few businesses and only passing traffic way up above it were much busier streets south bridge for instance they seemed so far from the cowgate it might as well have been underground rebus wasnt sure the area had ever been anything other than a desperate meeting place for edinburghs poorest denizens who often seemed like cattle themselves dullwitted from lack of sunlight and grazing on begged handouts from passersby the cowgate was ripe for redevelopment these days but who would slaughter the cattle a fine setting for the understated mortuary where when he wasnt teaching at the university dr curt plied his trade look on the bright side he told rebus the cowgates got a couple of fine pubs and a few more you could shave a dead man with curt chuckled colourful though im not sure the image conjured actually means anything i bow to your superior knowledge now what have you got on mr ringan ah poor orphan eddie curt liked to find names for all his cadavers rebus got the feeling the orphan prefix had been used many a time before in eddie ringans case though it was accurate he had no living relations that anyone knew of and so had been identified by patrick calder and by siobhan clarke since shed been the one to find the body yes thats the man i found she had said yes thats edward ringan pat calder had said before being led away by toni the barman rebus now stood with curt beside the slab on which what was left of the corpse was being tidied up by an assistant the assistant was whistling those were the days as he scraped miscellany into a bucket of offal rebus was reading through a list hed been through it three times already trying to take his mind off the scene around him curt was smoking a cigarette at the age of fiftyfive hed decided he might as well start since nothing else had so far managed to kill him rebus might have taken a cigarette from him but they were players untipped the smoking equivalent of paint stripper maybe because hed perused the list so often something clicked at last you know he said we never found a suicide note they dont always leave them eddie would have and hed have had elvis singing heartbreak hotel on a tape player beside the oven now thats style curt said disingenuously and now rebus went on from this list of the contents of his pockets i see he didnt have any keys on him no keys eh curt was enjoying his break too much to bother trying to work it out he knew rebus would tell him anyway so rebus obliged how did he get in or if he did use his keys to get in where are they now where indeed the attendant frowned as curt stubbed his cigarette into the floor rebus knew when hed lost an audience he put the list away so what have you got for me well the usual tests will have to be carried out of course of course but in the meantim in the meantime a few points of interest curt turned to the cadaver forcing rebus to do the same there was a cover over the charred face and the attendant had roughly sewn up the chest and stomach now empty of their major organs with thick black thread the face had been badly burnt but the rest of the body remained unaffected the plump flesh was pale and shiny well curt began the burns were superficial merely the internal organs were untouched by the blast that made things easier i would say he probably asphyxiated through inhalation of north sea gas he turned to rebus that north sea is pure conjecture then he grinned again a lopsided grin that meant one side of his mouth stayed closed there was evidence of alcoholic intake well have to wait for the test results to determine how much a lot id guess ill bet his liver was a treat hes been putting the stuff away for years curt seemed doubtful he went to another table and returned with the organ itself which had already been crosssectioned its actually in pretty good shape you said he was a spirits drinker rebus kept his eyes out of focus it was something you learned a bottle a day easy well it doesnt show from this curt tossed the liver a few inches into the air it slapped back down into his palm he reminded rebus of a butcher showing off to a potential buyer there was also a bump to the head and bruising and minor burns to the arms oh id imagine these are injuries often incurred by chefs in their daily duties hot fat spitting pots and pans everywher maybe said rebus and now we come to the section of the programme hamish has been waiting for curt nodded towards his assistant who straightened his back in anticipation i call him hamish curt confided because he comes from the hebrides hamish here spotted something i didnt ive been putting off talking about it lest he become encephalitic he looked at rebus a little pathologists joke youre not so small said rebus you need to know inspector that hamish has a fascination with teeth probably because his own as a child were terribly bad and he has memories of long days spent under the dentists drill hamish looked as though this might actually be true as a result hamish always looks in peoples mouths and this time he saw fit to inform me that there was some damage what sort of damage scarring of the tissues lining the throat recent damage too like hed been singing too loud or screaming but much more likely that something has been forced down his throat rebuss mind boggled curt always seemed able to do this to him he swallowed feeling how dry his own throat was what sort of thing curt shrugged hamish suggesteyou understand this is entirely conjectureusually your field of expertise hamish suggested a pipe of some kind something solid i myself would add the possibility of a rubber or plastic tube rebus coughed not anythiner organic then you mean like a courgette a banana you know damned well what i mean curt smiled and bowed his head of course i do im sorry then he shrugged i wouldnt rule anything out but if youre suggesting a penis it must have been sheathed in sandpaper behind them rebus heard hamish stifle a laugh rebus telephoned pat calder and asked if they might meet calder thought it over before agreeing at the colonies rebus asked make it the cafe im heading over there anyway so the cafe it was when rebus arrived the convalescence sign had been replaced with one stating due to bereavement this establishment has ceased trading it was signed pat calder as rebus entered he heard calder roar do fuck off it was not however aimed at rebus but at a young woman in a raincoat trouble mr calder rebus walked into the restaurant calder was busy taking the mementoes down off the walls and packing them in newspaper rebus noticed three tea chests on the floor between the tables this bloody reporter wants some blood and grief for her newspaper is that right miss rebus gave mairie henderson a disapproving but yes almost fatherly look the kind that let her know she should be ashamed mr ringan was a popular figure in the city she told rebus im sure hed have wanted our readers to know calder interrupted hed have wanted them to stuff their faces here leave a fat cheque then get the fuck out print that quite an epitaph mairie commented calder looked like hed brain her with the elvis clock the one with the kings arms replacing the usual clock hands he thought better of it and lifted the elvis mirror one of several off the wall instead he wouldnt dare smash that seven years bad junk food i think youd better go miss rebus said calmly all right im going she slung her bag over her shoulder and stalked past rebus she was wearing a skirt today a short one too but a good soldier knew when to keep eyes front he smiled at pat calder whose anguish was all too evident bit soon for all this isnt it you can cook can you inspector without eddie this place iits nothing looks like the local restaurants can sleep easy then how do you mean remember eddie thought the attack on brian was a warning yes but whats tha calder froze you think someon it was suicide wasnt it looked that way certainly you mean youre not sure did he seem the type who would kill himself calders reply was cold he was killing himself every day with drink maybe it all got too much like i said inspector the attack on brian affected eddie maybe more than we knew he paused still with the mirror gripped in both hands you think it was murder i didnt say that mr calder who would do it maybe you were behind with your payments what payments protection payments sir dont tell me it doesnt go on calder stared at him unblinking you forget i was in charge of finances and we always paid our bills on time all of them rebus took this information in wondering exactly what it meant if you think you know who might have wanted eddie dead best tell me all right dont go doing anything rash like what like buying a gun rebus thought but he said nothing calder started to wrap the mirror this is about all a newspapers worth he said she was only doing her job you wouldnt have turned down a good review would you calder smiled we got plenty what will you do now i havent thought about it ill go away thats all i know rebus nodded towards the tea chests and youll keep all that stuff i couldnt throw it away inspector its all there is well thought rebus theres the bedroom too but he didnt say anything he just watched pat calder pack everything away hamish real name alasdair mcdougall had more or less been chased from his native barra by his contemporaries one of whom tried to drown him during a midnight boat crossing from south uist after a party two minutes in the freezing waters of the sound of barra and hed have been fit for nothing but fishfood but theyd hauled him back into the boat and explained the whole thing away as an accident which is also what it would have been had he actually drowned he went to oban first then south to glasgow before crossing to the east coast glasgow suited him in some respects but not in others edinburgh suited him better his parents had always denied to themselves that their son was homosexual even when hed stood there in front of them and said it his father had quoted the bible at him the same way hed been quoting it for seventeen years a believers righteous tremble in his voice it had once been a powerful and persuasive performance but now it seemed laughable just because its in the bible hed told his father doesnt mean you should take it as gospel but to his father it was and always would be the literal truth the bible had been in the old mans hand as hed shooed his youngest son out of the door of the croft house never dare to blacken our name hed called and alasdair reckoned hed lived up to this through introducing himself as dougall and almost never passing on a last name he had been dougall to the gay community in glasgow and he was dougall here in edinburgh he liked the life hed made for himself there was never a dull night and hed only been kickedin twice he had his clubs and pubs his bunch of friends and a wider circle of acquaintances he was even beginning to think of writing to his parents he would tell them by the time my boss gets through with a body believe me there isnt very much left for heaven to take he thought again of the plump young man whod been gassed and he laughed he should have said something at the time but hadnt why not was it because he still had one foot in the closet hed been accused of it before when hed refused to wear a pink triangle on his lapel certainly he wasnt sure he wanted a policeman to know he was gay and what would dr curt do there was all sorts of homophobia about an almost medieval fear of aids and its transmission it wasnt that he couldnt live without the job but he liked it well enough hed seen plenty of sheep and cattle slaughtered and quartered in his time on the island this wasnt so very different no he would keep his secret to himself he wouldnt let on that he knew eddie ringan he remembered the evening a week or so back they went to dougalls place and eddie cooked up a chilli from stuff he found in the cupboards hot stuff it really made you sweat he wouldnt stay the night though wasnt that type thered been a long kiss before parting and halfpromises of further trysts yes he knew eddie knew him well enough to be sure of one thing whoever it was on the slab it wasnt the guy whod shared chilli in dougalls bed siobhan clarke felt unnaturally calm and in control the rest of the day shed been given the day off from operation moneybags to get over the shock of her experience at the heartbreak cafe but by late afternoon was itching to do something so she drove out to rory kintouls house on the halfchance it was a neat and quite recent council semi in a culdesac the front garden was the size of a beermat but probably more hygienic she reckoned she could eat her dinner off the trimmed weedless lawn without fear of food poisoning she couldnt even say that of the plates in most police canteens one gate led her down the path and another brought her to kintouls front door it was painted dark blue every fourth door in the street was dark blue the others were plumred custard yellow and battleship grey not exactly a riot of colour but somehow in keeping with the pebbledash and tarmac some kids had chalked a complex hopscotch grid on the pavement and were now playing noisily shed smiled towards them but they hadnt looked up from their game a dog barked in a back garden a few doors down but otherwise the street was quiet she rang the doorbell and waited nobody it seemed was home she thought of the phrase gallus besom as she took the liberty of peering in through the front window a living room stretched to the back of the house the dog was barking louder now and through the far window she caught sight of a figure she opened the garden gate and turned right running through the close separating kintouls house from its neighbour this led to the back gardens kintoul had left his kitchen door open so as not to make a noise he had one leg over his neighbours fence and was trying to shush the leashed mongrel mr kintoul siobhan called when he looked up she waved her hand sitting on the fence i see how about the two of us going inside for a word she wasnt about to spare him any blushes as he slouched towards her across the back green she grinned running away from the police eh whatve you got to hide nuthin you should be careful she warned a stunt like that could open those stitches in your side do you want everyone to hear get inside he almost pushed her through the kitchen door it was exactly the invitation siobhan wanted rebus got the call at sixfifteen and arranged the meeting for ten at eight patience called him he knew he wouldnt sound right to her would sound like his thoughts were elsewhere which they were but he wanted to keep her talking he was filling the time till ten oclock and didnt want any of it left vacant he might start to think about it otherwise might change his mind eventually for want of other topics he told patience all about michael who was asleep in the box room at last they were on the same wavelength patience suggested counselling and was amazed no one at the hospital had mentioned the possibility she would look into it and get back to rebus meantime hed have to watch michael didnt go into clinical depression the problem with those drugs was that they not only killed your fears they could kill your emotions stone dead he was so lively when he moved in rebus said the students are wondering what the hells happened to him i think theyre as worried as i am michaels selfproclaimed girlfriend had spent time trying to talk to him coaxing him out to pubs and clubs but michael had fought against it and she hadnt shown her face for at least a day one of the male students had approached rebus in the kitchen and asked in tones of deepest sympathy if a bit of blaw might help mickey rebus had shaken his head christ it might not be a bad idea though but patience was against it mix the stuff hes on with cannabis and god knows what sort of reaction youd get paranoia or a complete downer would be my guess she was antidrugs anyway and not just the proscribed kinds she knew that the easy way out for doctors was to fill out a form for the pharmacy valium moggies whatever it took people all over scotland and especially the people who needed most help were eating tablets like they were nourishment and the doctors pointed to their workloads and said what else can we do want me to come over she was asking now it was a big step yes rebus wanted her to come over but it was nearly nine no but i appreciate the thought well try not to leave him too long on his own hes sleeping to escape something he needs to confront bye patience rebus put down the phone and made ready to leave the flat why had he chosen the waterfront at north queensferry for the meeting well wasnt it obvious he stood near the same but theyd taken michael to and he got cold hed arrived early and deek naturally was late rebus didnt really mind it gave him time to stare up at the rail bridge wondering how it would feel to be lowered over the side at the dead of night screaming dumbly into your gag as they took the bag from your face looking all the way down thats where rebus was now though he was at sea level he was looking all the way down cold though eh deek torrance rubbed his hands together thanks for setting me up the other night eh sailor for trade or rent oh aye that torrance grinned king of the road thats not the way it goes thoug youve got it deek patted his coat pocket he was jittery with good cause it wasnt every day you sold an illegal firearm to a policeman lets see it then what out here rebus looked around theres nobody here deek bit his lip then resigned himself to lifting the handgun out of his pocket and placing it in john rebuss palm the thing was a lifeless weight but comfortable to hold rebus placed it in his own capacious pocket ammo the bullets shook in their box like a babys toy rebus pocketed them too then reached into the back pocket of his trousers for the cash want to count it deek shook his head then nodded across the road ill buy you a drink though if you like a drink sounded good to rebus ill just get rid of this first he unlocked his car and slipped the gun and ammo underneath the drivers seat he noticed he was trembling and a little dizzy as he stood back up a drink would be good he was hungry too but the thought of food made him want to boak he looked again at the bridge come on then he said to deek torrance minus gun and with money in its place torrance was more relaxed and loquacious they sat in the hawes inn with their drinks torrance was explaining how the guns came into the country see its easy to buy a gun in france they even come around the towns in vans and flog them off the back stick a catalogue through your door to let you know what theyll have i got to meet this french guy not bad to say hes french hes back and forth over the channel some sort of business hes in he brings the guns with him and i buy them he brings mace too if youre interested why didnt you say rebus muttered into his pint i wouldnt have needed the gun eh deek saw he was making a joke and laughed so what have i got asked rebus it was a bit dark out there to see well theyre all copies dont worry i file off any identifiers myself yours is a colt itll take ten rounds eight millimetre deek nodded there are twenty in the box its not the most lethal weapon around i can get replica uzis too christ rebus finished his pint he suddenly wanted to be out of there its a living said deek torrance aye right a living said rebus getting up to go next morning rebus forced himself into the usual routine he checked to see if there had been any sign of andrew mcphail there had not maclean hadnt been too badly hurt by the boiled water most of which hed deflected with his arms nobody was yet treating mcphail like a dangerous criminal his description had been issued to bus and train stations motorway service areas and the like if the manpower were available rebus knew exactly where he would start looking for him a shadow fell over his desk it was the little weed so flower said you lose a ds to a blow on the napper and a dc to a gas explosion whats for an encore rebus saw that they had an audience half the station had been waiting for a confrontation between the two inspectors now more detectives than usual seemed interested in the filing cabinets near rebuss desk its easier if you do a handstand commented rebus what is talking out of your arse there were a few covering coughs from the filing cabinets ive got some throat pastilles if you want them rebus called the cabinet doors slid shut the audience moved away you think youre gods gift dont you flower said you think youre all it takes im better than some and a lot worse than others rebus picked up the previous evenings arrest sheet and started to read it if youre finishe flower smiled rebus i thought your kind went out with the dinosaurs aye but only because they turned you down when you asked them which made it twonil as alister flower walked off the field but rebus knew thered be another leg to the match and another after that he looked again at the arrest sheet checking hed seen the name right then sighed and went down to the cells a cluster of young constables stood outside cell one taking turns at the peephole its that guy with the tattoos one of them explained to rebus the pincushion the constable nodded the pincushion was tattooed from head to foot not an inch unblemished hes been brought in for questioning rebus nodded whenever they had reason to bring the pincushion into a station he always ended up naked its a good name isnt it sir what pincushion its better than my name for him i suppose whats that just another prick said rebus unlocking cell number two he closed the door behind him a young man was sitting on the bunk unshaven and sorryeyed what happened to you then andy steele looked up at him then away the city of edinburgh had not been kind to him during his visit he ran a handful of fingers through his tousled hair did you go see your auntie ena he asked rebus nodded i didnt see your mum and dad though ach well at least i managed that eh i managed to track you down and put you in touch with her so what have you been up to since flakes of scalp were being clawed from the surface of andy steeles head they floated down onto his trousers well i did a bit of sightseeing they dont arrest you for that these days though steele sighed and stopped scratching depends what sights you see i told a man in a pub i was a private detective he said he had a case for me oh aye rebuss attention was momentarily drawn to a crude game of noughts and crosses on the cell wall his wife was cheating him he told me where he thought i could find her and he gave me a description i got ten quid with more when i reported back go on andy steele stared up at the ceiling he knew he wasnt making himself look good but it was a bit late for that anyway it was a ground floor flat i watched all evening i saw the woman she was there all right but no man so i went round the back to get a better look someone must have spotted me and phoned the police you told them your story steele nodded they even took me back to the bar he wasnt there of course and nobody knew him i didnt even know his name but his description of the woman was accurate oh aye probably an exwife or some old flame he wanted to give them a scare and it was worth ten notes to do it except now the womans pressing charges not a very good start to my career is it inspector depends said rebus your career as a private dick may not be much cop but as a peepingtom your star is definitely in the ascendant seeing steeles misery rebus winked cheer up ill see what i can do in fact before he could do anything siobhan clarke was on the telephone from gorgie to tell him about her meeting with rory kintoul i asked him if he knew anything about his cousins heavy betting he wouldnt say but i get the feeling theyre a closeknit family there were hundreds of photos in the living room aunties and uncles brothers and sisters nieces cousins grannie i get the idea did you mention the broken window oh yes he was so interested he had to clamp himself to the chair to stop from jumping out of it not a great talker though he reckoned it must have been a drunk the same drunk who took a knife to his gut i didnt put it quite like that and neither did he i dont know whether its relevant or not but he did say hed driven the butchers van for his cousin what full time yes up until about a year ago i didnt know bones had a van thatll be the next to go sir the van smash the shop window and if that doesnt work torch the van youre saying its all about protection maybe protection more likely money owing on bad bets what do you think well i did raise that possibility with kintoul and he laughed thats strong language coming from him agreed hes not exactly the emotional type so its not betting money ill have another think his son came in while we were talking refresh my memory seventeen and unemployed names jason when kintoul told him i was cid the son looked worried a natural reaction in a teenager on the dole they think were pressganging these days there was more to it than that how much more i dont know could be the usual drugs and gangs well see if hes got a record hows moneybags frankly id rather be sewing mailbags rebus smiled all part of the learning curve clarke he said putting down the phone somehow yesterday hed forgotten to ask pat calder about the message on the inside of the recipe book he didnt like to think it had been jostled from his mind by maines legs or the sight of all those elvises rebus had checked before leaving the station jason kintoul was not on the files somehow the gun beneath the drivers seat helped keep rebuss mind sharp the drive to the colonies didnt take long pat calder seemed quite shocked to see him morning said rebus thought id find you at home come in inspector rebus went in the living room was much less tidy than on hi previous visit and he began to wonder whichof the couple had been the tidier certainly eddie ringan looked and acted like a slob but you couldnt always tell sorry for the mess well youve got a lot on your mind just now the place was stuffy with that heavy male smell you got sometimes in shared flats and lockerrooms but usually it took more than one person to create it rebus began to wonder about the lean young bartender whod accompanied calder to the mortuar ive just been arranging the funeral pat calder was saying its on monday they asked if it would be family and friends i had to tell the eddie didnt have any family he had good friends though calder smiled thank you inspector thank you for that was there something in particula it was just something we found at the scene oh a sort of a message it said i only turned on the gas calder froze christ it was suicide then rebus shrugged it wasnt that kind of note we found it on the inside of a school jotter eddies recipe book yes i wondered where that had got to the message had been heavily scored out i took it away for analysis maybe its something to do with the nightmares thats just what i was thinking depends what he was dreaming about though doesnt it nightmares can be about things you fear or things youve done im no psychologist me neither rebus admitted i take it eddie had keys to the restaurant yes we didnt find any on his body did you come across them when you were packing things up i dont think so but how did he get in without keys you should be in cid mr calder thats what ive been wondering rebus got up from the sofa well sorry i had to come by oh thats all right can you tell brian about the funeral arrangements warriston cemetery at two oclock monday at two ill tell him oh one last thing you keep a record of table bookings dont you calder seemed puzzled of course only id like to take a look there might be some names there that dont mean anything to you but might mean something to a policeman calder nodded i see what youre getting at ill drop it into the station im going to the heartbreak at lunchtime ill pick it up then still clearing stuff away no its a potential buyer one of the pizza restaurants is looking to expan whatever it was pat calder was hiding he was doing only a fair job but rebus really didnt have the heart to start digging there was way too much for him to worry about as it was starting with the gun hed sat with it in his car last night his finger on the trigger just the way his instructor had taught him back in the army firm but not tense like it was an erection one you wanted to sustain he had been thinking too of goodies and baddies if you thought bad thingsdreams of cruelty and lustthat didnt make you bad but if your head was full of civilised thoughts and you spent all day as a tortureit came down to the fact that you were judged by your actions in society not by the inside of your head so hed no reason to feel bad about thinking grim and bloody thoughts not unless he turned thoughts into deeds yet going beyond thought would feel so good more than that it would feel right he stopped his car at the first church he came to he hadnt attended any kind of worship for several months always managing to make excuses and promises to himself that hed try harder it was just that patience had made sunday mornings so good someone had been busy with a markerpen on the wooden signboard in the churchyard turning our lady of perpetual help into our lady of perpetual hell not the greatest of omens but rebus went inside anyway he sat in a pew for a while there werent many souls in there with him he had picked up a prayer book on the way in and stared long and hard at its unjudgmental black cover wondering why it made him feel so guilty eventually a woman left the confessional pulling up her headscarf rebus stood up and made himself enter the small box he sat there in silence for a minute trying to think what it was you were supposed to say forgive me father im about to sin well see about that son came a gruff irish voice from the other side of the grille there was such assurance in the voice rebus almost smiled instead he said im not even a catholic im sure thats true but youre a christian i suppose so i used to go to church do you believe i cant not believe he didnt add how hard hed tried then tell me your problem someones been threatening me my friends and family have you gone to the police i am the police ah and now youre thinking of taking the law into your own hands as they say in the films how did you know youre not the first bobby ive had in this confessional there are a few catholics in the police force this time rebus did smile so what is it youre going to do ive got a gun there was an intake of breath now thats serious oh yes thats serious but you must see that if you use a gun you turn into that which you despise so much you turn into them the priest managed to hiss this last word so what rebus asked so ask yourself this can you live the rest of your life with the memories and the guilt the voice paused i know what you calvinists think you think youre doomed from the start so why not raise some hell before you get there but im talking about this life not the next do you want to live in purgatory before you die no youd be a bloody eejit to say anything else tie that gun to a roc and chuck it in the forth thats where it belongs thank you father youre more than welcome and son yes father come back and talk to me again i like to know what madness you prods are thinking it gives me something to chew on when theres nothing good on the telly rebus didnt spend long at gorgie road they werent getting anywhere the photos taken so far had been developed and some of the faces identified those identified were all smalltimers old cons or upand corners they werent so much small fish as spawn in a corner of the pond it wasnt as if flower was having better luck which was just as well for rebus he couldnt wait for the little weed to put in his reimbursement claim all those rounds of drinks he felt revived by his talk with the priest whose name he now realised he didnt even know but then that was part of the deal wasnt it sinners anonymous he might even grant the priests wish and go back sometime and tonight hed drive out to the coast and get rid of the gun it had been madness all along in a sense buying it had been enough hed never have used it would he he parked at st leonards and went inside there was a package for him at the front deskthe reservations book for the heartbreak cafe calder had put a note in with it well elvis ate pizza didnt he so it looked like the heartbreak was about to go italian while hed been reading the note the desk officer had been phoning upstairs keeping his voice low whats all that about rebus asked he thought hed overheard the distinct words hes here nothing sir said the desk officer rebus tried to stare an answer out of him then turned away just as the inner doors were pushed open in businesslike fashion by the uglybug sisters lauderdale and flower can i have your carkeys lauderdale demanded whats going on rebus looked to flower who resembled a preacher at a burning the keys please lauderdales hand was so steady rebus thought if he walked away and left the two men standing there it would stay stretched out for hours he handed over his keys its a pile of junk if you dont kick it in the right place you wont even get it to start he was following the two men through the doors and into the car park i dont want to drive it lauderdale said he sounded threatening but it was flowers serene silence that most worried rebus then it hit him the gun they knew about the gun and yes it was still under his drivers seat where else was he going to hide itin the flat where michael might find it in his trousers where it would raise eyebrows no hed left it in the car the door of which lauderdale was now opening lauderdale turned towards him his hand out again the gun inspector rebus and when rebus didnt move give me the gun he raised the gun and fired itone two three shots then lowered it again they all took off their earprotectors the forensics man had fired the gun into what looked like a simple wooden crate the bullets would be retrieved from its interior and could then be analysed the scientist had been holding the guns butt with a polythene glove over his hand he dropped the gun into a polythene bag of its own before slipping off the glove well let you know as soon as we can he told chief superintendent watson who nodded the mans dismissal after hed left the room watson turned to lauderdale give it to me again frank lauderdale took a deep breath this was the third time hed told watson the story but he didnt mind he didnt mind at all inspector flower came to me late this morning and told me hed received information what sort of information a phone call anonymous naturally naturally lauderdale took another breath the caller told him the gun that had been used in the central hotel shooting five years ago was in inspector rebuss possession then he rang off and were supposed to believe rebus shot that man five years ago lauderdale didnt know all i know is there was a gun in rebuss car and he says himself itll have his prints all over it whether its the same gun or not well know by the end of play today dont sound so fucking cheerful we both know this is a stitchup what we know sir said lauderdale ignoring watsons outburst is that inspector rebus has been carrying on a little private investigation of his own into the central hotel the files are by the side of his desk he wouldnt tell anyone why so he found something out and now somebodys worried thats why theyve planted the with respect sir lauderdale paused nobody planted anything rebus has admitted he bought the gun from someone he calls a stranger he specifically asked this stranger to get a gun for him what for he says he was being threatened of course he could be lying how do you mean maybe the gun was the clue he found the one that started him back into the central files now hes spinning this story because at least then we cant accuse him of withholding evidence watson took this in what do you think without prejudice sir come on frank we all know you hate rebuss guts when he saw you and flower coming for him he must have thought the lynchmob had arrived lauderdale tried an easy laugh personalities aside sir even if we stick to the bare facts inspector rebus is in serious trouble even supposing he did buy the gun its obviously a nasty piece of goodsits had a file taken to it in the past hes worse than ever watson mused now that his girlfriends kicked him out i had high hopes there sir shed got him wearing decent clothes rebus was beginning to loopromotable lauderdale nearly swallowed his tongue stupid bugger watson went on lauderdale decided he was talking about rebus i suppose id better talk to him do you want me t i want you to stay here and wait for those results wheres flower back on duty sir you mean back in the pub ill want to talk to him too funny how this anonymous deep throat just manages to talk to the one person in st leonards who loves rebus as much as you do loves sir i said loathes but actually as rebus already knew the call had been taken not by flower himself but by a dc who just happened to know how flower felt about inspector john rebus hed called flower at the pub and flower had raced jackie stewartstyle back to st leonards to tell lauderdale rebus knew this because he had time to kill at st leonards while everyone else was up at the forensic lab in fettes and he knew he had to be quick because watson would suspend him as soon as he came back he found some carrier bags and put the central hotel files in them along with the reservations book from the heartbreak cafe then he took the whole lot down to his car and threw them in the booprobably the first place watson would want to look christ hed been planning to get rid of that gun tonight lauderdale had said it was suspected of being the gun used in the central hotel murder well that would be easy enough to prove or disprove they still had the original bullet rebus wished hed given the gun closer scrutiny it had looked shiny new but then maybe it had only ever been fired that one fatal time he didnt doubt that it was the gun he just wondered how the hell theyd managed to set him up the only answer was to work backwards deek had handed him the gun so somehow theyd gotten to deek well rebus himself had put word out that he was looking for deek torrance and word got around someone had heard and been interested enough to track down deek too theyd asked him what his connection was with john rebus and when rebus had then asked deek for a gun deek had reported back to them oh yes that was it all right rebus had set himself up by asking for the gun in the first place because then theyd known exactly what to do with him planting the gun was a bit too obvious wasnt it no one was going to be taken in but it would have to be investigated and investigations like that could take months during which time hed be suspended they wanted him out of the way that was all because he was getting close rebus smiled to himself he was no closer than alaskunless hed stumbled upon something without realising it he needed to go over everything again down to the last detail but this would take time time he was sure watson would unwittingly be about to offer him so when he walked into the chief superintendents office he surprised even watson with his ease john said watson after motioning for rebus to sit how come you always seem to have a banana skin up your sleeve because i say the magic word sir rebus offered and what is the magic word rebus looked surprised watson didnt know abracadabra sir john said watson im suspending you thank you sir said rebus he spent that evening on the trail of deek torrance even driving out to south queensferrythe most forlorn hope of a forlorn night deek would have been paid plenty to get well away from the city by now he might not even be in the western hemisphere then again maybe theyd have silenced him in some other more permanent way some pal you turned out to be rebus muttered to himself more than once and to complete the circle he headed out to his favourite massage parlour he always seemed to be the only customer and had wondered how the organ grinder made his money but now of course he knew the organ grinder would come to your home always supposing you were wealthy enougor had reputation enough how long have you been going out there rebus asked prone on the table he was aware that the organ grinder could break his neck or his back with consummate ease but he didnt think he would he hoped his instincts werent wrong in this at least just a couple of months someone at a health club told his wife about me know her do you not really she thinks im too rough thats droll coming from the wife of big ger cafferty hes a villain then whatever gave you that idea you forget ive not been up here that long true rebus had forgotten the organ grinders north london pedigree when in the mood he told wonderful stories of that city anything about him you want to tell me rebus ventured despite the thick hands on his neck nothing to tell said the organ grinder silence is a virtue inspector and theres too much of it around you ever seen anyone out at his house just his wife and the chauffeur chauffeur you mean the man mountain with the knob of gristle for a left ear that explains the haircut mused the organ grinder precious little else would said rebus after the organ grinder had finished with him rebus went back to he flat michael was watching a late film the glow from the tv set flicking across his rapt face rebus went over to the tv and switched it off michael still stared at the screen not blinking there was a cup of cold tea in his hand gently rebus took it from him mickey he said i need someone to talk to michael blinked and looked up at him you can always talk to me he said you know that i know that said rebus weve got something else in common now whats that rebus sat down weve both been recently suspended chief superintendent watson dreaded these saturday mornings when his wife would try to entice him to go shopping with her dreary hours in department stores and clothes shops not to mention the supermarket where hed be guineapig for the latest microwavable malaysian meal or some rude looking unpronounceable fruit worst of all of course he saw other men in exactly the same predicament it was a wonder one of them didnt lose the rag and start screaming about how they used to be the hunters fierce and proud but this morning he had the excuse of work he always tried to have an excuse either for nipping into st leonards or else bringing work home with him he sat in his study listening to radio scotland and reading the newspaper the house quiet and still around him then the telephone rang annoying him until he remembered he was waiting for just this call it was ballistics at fettes after he took the call he looked up a number in his card index and made another i want you in my office monday morning he told rebus for formal questioning from which i take it said rebus that i bought a lulu of a gun lulu and her backing band they were called the luvvers sir the bullets matched up yes you knew they would said rebus and so did i its awkward john its supposed to be for you as well as me with all respect sir i wasnt thinking of yo when siobhan clarke woke up that morning she glanced at the clock then shot out of bed christ it was nearly nine she had just run water for a bath and was looking for clean underwear in the bathroom when it hit her it was the weekend nothing to rush for in fact quite the opposite the relief team had taken over moneybags just for this first weekend to see if there was any sign of life at dougarys office according to trading standards dougarys weekends were sacrosanct he wouldnt go anywhere near gorgie but they had to be sure so for this weekend only operation moneybags had a relief retinue keeping an eye on the place if nothing happened next weekend they wouldnt bother dougary was blessedly fixed in his ways she hadnt had to hang about too often on the surveillance past fivethirty more often a bit earlier which suited siobhan fine it meant shed managed a couple of useful trips to dundee out of hours shed arranged another trip for this morning but didnt need to leave edinburgh for an hour or so yet and she was sure to be home before the hibees kicked off time now for some coffee the living room was messy but she didnt mind she usually set aside sunday morning for all the chores that was the nice thing about living by yourself your mess was your own there was no one to comment on it or be disturbed by it crisp bags pizza boxes threequartersempty bottles of wine old newspapers and magazines cd cases items of clothing opened and unopened mail plates and cutlery and every mug in the flatthese could all be found in her fourteenbytwelve living room somewhere under the debris there was a futon and a cordless telephone the telephone was ringing she reached under a pizza carton picked up the receiver and yanked up the aerial is that you clarke yes sir the last person shed been expecting john rebus she wandered through to the bathroom terrible interference said rebus i was just turning off the bath christ youre in the no sir not yet cordless phone i hate those things youre talking for five minutes then you hear the toilet flushing well sorry twhat time is it just turned nine really he sounded dead beat sir i heard about your suspension that figures i know its none of my business but what were you doing with a gun in the first place psychic protection sorry thats what my brother calls it he should know he used to be a hypnotist sir are you all right im fine are you going to the game not if you need me for anything else well i was wonderindo you still have the cafferty files she had walked back into the living room oh she still had the files all right their contents were spread across her coffee table her desk and half the breakfast bar yes sir any chance you could bring them over to my flat only ive got the central hotel files here somewhere in them theres a clue im missing you want to crossreference with the cafferty files thats a big job not if two people are working on it what time do you want me there saturday at brian holmes aunts house in barnton was a bit like sunday except that on saturday he didnt have to deny her his company at the local presbyterian kirk was it any wonder that having found the heartbreak cafe such a welcoming spot he should have spent so long there but those days were over he tried to accept the fact that elvis was dead but it was difficult no more king shrimp creole or blue suede choux or in the gateau no more blue hawaii cocktails no more late nights of tequila slammers with jose cuervo gold naturally or jim beam eddies preferred bourbon keep on the beam he used to say there there pet oh great now his aunt had caught him talking to himself shed brought him a cup of ovaltine this stuffs for bedtime he told her its not even noon itll calm you down brian he took a sip ach it didnt taste bad anyway pat had dropped round to ask if hed be a pallbearer on monday itd be an honour holmes had told him meaning it pat hadnt wanted to meet his eyes maybe he too was thinking of the nights theyd all spent slurring afterhours gossip at the bar on one of those nights when theyd been talking about great scottish disasters eddie had suddenly announced that hed been there when the central hotel caught fire i was filling in for a guy cash in the hand and no questions dead on my feet after the dayshift at the eyrie i didnt know youd worked at the eyrie assistant to the head man himself if he doesnt get a michelin recommendation this year hed be as well giving up so what happened at the central holmes head hadnt been entirely befuddled by spirits some poker game was going on up in one of the rooms on the first floor he seemed to be losing it drifting towards sleep tam and eck were looking for player tam and eck tam and eck robertso but what happened its no good brian said pat calder look at him though eddies eyes were open head resting on his arms arms spread across the bar he was asleep a cousin of mine was at ibrox the day of the big crush pat revealed cleaning a pint glass but do you remember where you were the night jock stein died holmes asked more stories had followed eddie sleeping through all of them permanently asleep now and holmes was to be pallbearer number four hed asked pat a few questions funny pat had said your man rebus asked me just the same so brian knew the case was in good hands rebus drove around the lunchtime streets on a saturday providing you steered clear of princes street the city had a more relaxed feel at least until about twothirty when either the east end or the west of the city depending who was playing home would fill with football fans and on derby match days best stay away from the centre altogether but today wasnt a derby match and hibs were at home so the town was quiet you asked about him just the other week a barman told rebus and im asking again he was again on the lookout for deek torrance a seek and destroy mission he doubted deek would be around but sometimes money and alcohol did terrible things to a man boosting his confidence making him unwary of danger and vengeance rebuss hope was that deek was still mingin somewhere on the money hed paid for the gun as hopes went it was more forlorn than most but he did stumble upon chick muir in a leith social club and was able to tell him the news thats just awfy chick consoled ill keep my nose to the ground rebus appreciated the muddled sentiment in chicks case it wouldnt be hard anyway informers were sometimes called snitches and chicks snitch was about as big as they came onethirty found him leaving a dingy betting shop hed seen more hope and smiles in a hospice and fewer tears too ten minutes later he was sitting down to microwaved haggis neeps and tatties in the sutherland bar someone had left a newspaper on his chair and he started to read it by luck it was open at a piece by mairie henderson youre late he said as maine herself sat down she nearly stood up again in anger i was in here half an hour ago quarter past one we arranged i stayed till half past i thought half past was the agreement he said blithely you werent here at half past youre lucky i came back why did you she tore the newspaper from him i left my paper not much in it anyway he scooped more haggis into his mouth i thought you were buying me lunch rebus nodded towards the food counter help yourself theyll add it to my tab it took her a moment to decide that she was hungrier than she was angry she came back from the food counter with a plate of quiche and bean salad and grabbed her purse they dont have tabs here she informed him rebus winked just my little joke he tried to hand her some money but she turned on her heels low heels funny little shoes like childrens doc martens and black tights rebus rolled the food around with his tongue she sat down at last and took off her coat it took her a moment to get comfortable anything to drink asked rebus i suppose its my round she snapped he shook his head so she asked for a gin and fresh orange rebus got the drinks a half of guinness for himself there was probably more nutrition in the guinness than in the meal hed just consumed so said mairie whats the big secret rebus used his little finger to draw his initials on the thick head of his drink knowing theyd still be there when he reached the bottom ive been shown the red card that made her look up what suspended she wasnt angry with him any more she was a reporter sniffing a story he nodded what happened excitedly she forked up a mouthful of kidney bean and chickpea rebus had had a crashcourse in pulses from his tenants never mind red kids and chicks he could tell a borlotti from a pinto at fifty yards downwind i came into possession of a handgun a colt may or may not have been a copy and she nearly spattered him with pastry in her haste and it was the gun used in the central hotel shooting no her screech caused several drinkers to pause before their next swallow the sutherland was that kind of place riots in the streets would have merited a single measured comment rebus could see mairies head fairly filling to the brim with questions do you still write for the sunday edition he asked her she nodded still busy trying to find an order for all the questions she had what about doing me a favour then ive always wanted to be on the front pag not that hed any intention of seeing his own name in the story they went through it carefully together back at the newspaper office so rebus got his tour of the building at last it was a bit disappointing all stairwell and openplan and not much action what action there was centred exclusively on mairies desk and its uptodate word processor there was even a discussion with the editor of the sunday they needed to be sure of a few things it was always like this with unattributed stories in scots law there was no place for uncorroborated evidence the press seemed to be following suit but rebus had a staunch defender in the woman whose byline would appear with the story after a conference call with the papers wellremunerated lawyer the nod was given and mairie started to hammer the keyboard into submission i cant promise front page the editor warned beware the breaking story as it is youve just knocked a car crash and its three victims to the inside rebus stayed to watch the whole process a series of commands on mairies computer sent the text to typesetting which was done elsewhere in the building soon a laser printer was delivering a rough copy of how the front page might look tomorrow morning and there along the bottom was the headline gun recovered in fiveyearold murder mystery thatll change said mairie the sub will have a go at it once hes read the story why well for one thing it looks like the murder victim is a fiveyearold so it did rebus hadnt noticed mairie was staring at him isnt this going to get you in even more trouble whos going to know it was me gave you the story she smiled well lets start with everyone in the city of edinburgh police rebus smiled too hed bought some caffeine pills this morning to keep him moving they were working fine if anyone asks he said ill just have to tell them the truth which is what exactly that it wisnae me rebus dished out yet more money to the students that afternoon to get them out of the flat until midnight he wondered if it were unique in scottish social history for a landlord to be paying his own tenants there were only two of them there the other two hed now established that he had four permanent tenants whose names he still had trouble with so never tried using having headed home for purposes of cosseting and feedingup michael however stayed put rebus knew he wouldnt be any bother hed either be dozing in the box room or else watching the tv he didnt seem to mind if the sound were turned off just so long as there was a picture to stare at rebus bought a bag of provisions real coffee milk beer soft drinks and snacks back in the flat he remembered siobhan was a vegetarian and cursed himself for buying smoky bacon crisps bound to be artificial flavourings though so maybe it didnt matter she arrived at fivethirty come in come in rebus led her through the long dark hallway to the living room this is my brother michael hello michael mickey this is dc siobhan clarke michael nodded his head blinking slowly here let me take your jacket how was the game by the way goalless siobhan put down her two carrierbags and slipped off her black leather jacket rebus took the jacket into the hall and hung it up when he came back he noticed her studying the living room doubtfully bit of a tip he said though hed spent quarter of an hour tidying it big though she didnt deny it was a tip you could hardly see out of the huge sash window and the carpet looked like it had moulted from a buffalos back as for the wallpapeshe could well understand why the students had tried covering every inch with kd lang and jesus mary chain posters something to drink she shook her head lets get on with it this wasnt quite what shed imagined the zombie brother didnt help of course but he wasnt much of a distraction either they got down to work an hour later they had scraped the surface of the files siobhan was lying on her side on the floor legs curled up one arm supporting her head she was on her second can of cola the file was on the floor in front of her rebus sat near her on the sofa files on his lap and in a heap beside him he had a pen behind his ear just like a butcher or a turf accountant siobhan held her pen in her mouth tapping it against her teeth when she was thinking some bad quiz show was playing to silent hysterics on the tv for all the reaction on his face michael could have been watching a war trial he pulled himself out of the chair im going to take forty winks he informed them siobhan tried not to look surprised when he made not for the livingroom door but for the box room he closed the door behind him id like two things said rebus to identify the murder victim once and for all and to identify the killer siobhan guessed but rebus shook his head to place big ger at the scene theres no evidence he was anywhere near and maybe there never will be but all the samwe still dont know who was at the poker game it cant just have been the bruhead brothers we could talk to all the hotels customers that night yes we could rebus didnt sound enthusiastic or we could find the brothersalways supposing theyre still aliveand ask them their cousin might know where they are who radiator mccallum rebus nodded but then we dont know where he is either eddie ringan was there but he was never on the official list black aengus wasnt on the list and neither were the bruhead brothers im surprised we got any names at all we are talking about a long time ago siobhan sounded more relaxed with michael out of the room were also talking about long memories maybe i should have another go at black aengus not if you know whats good for you siobhan could have said something about dundee but she wanted it to be confirmed first and she wanted it to be a surprise shed know by monday the phone rang rebus picked it up john its patience oh hello there hello yourself i thought maybe wed fix up that date oh right for a drink dont tell me youve forgotten no i know what it is youre just playing hard to get dont push it too far rebus no its not that im just a bit busy right this minute siobhan seemed to take a hint and got up motioning that shed make some coffee in the kitchen rebus nodded well im sorry to interrupt whatever it is youre dont take it the wrong way patience ive just got things on my mind and im not included rebus made an exasperated sound from the kitchen there came the louder sound of a sneeze aye those easter road terraces could be snell john said patience is there a woman in the flat yes he said one of the students he seldom lied to her no a colleague were working through some casenotes i see christ he should have tried lying his head was too full of the central hotel to be able to cope with patiences jousting look he said have you got a time and place in mind for that drink but patience had rung off rebus stared at the receiver shrugged and placed it on the carpet he didnt want any more interruptions coffees on said siobhan great was it something i said what no no jusnothing but siobhan was canny she heard me sneeze and thought you had another woman here i do have another woman here its just the way her mind workshe doesnt exactly trust me and she should trust you rebus sighed tell me about the robertson brothers again siobhan sat down on the floor and started to read from the file from the sofa rebus looked down on her the top of her head the nape of her neck with its fine pale hairs disappearing into her collar small pierced ears we know they get on well it was a close family six kids in a onebedroom cottage what happened to the other brothers and sisters four sisters siobhan read lawabiding wives and mothers these days the boys were the only wild ones both like gambling especially cards and the horses tam is the better card player of the two but eck has more luck on the horseremember this stuff is six years old and all hearsay in the first place rebus nodded he was remembering the old man in that last pub in lochgelly the one whod come cadging drinks from the painters and decorators hed said one of the drawings looked familiar then one of the painters had cut him short with a story about how hed recognise a horse easier than a man so the old guy was keen on the geegees and so were eck and tam maybe he saw him in a bookies rebus wondered aloud sorry so rebus told her its worth a try she conceded what else do we have to go on rebus had one good contact at dunfermline cid detective sergeant hendry it was rumoured that hendry was too good at his job ever to merit promotion only the incompetent were promoted it shuffled them out of the way as a di rebus didnt necessarily agree but he knew hendry should have been an inspector long ago and wondered what or who was blocking him it couldnt be that hendry was too abrasive he was one of the calmest people rebus had ever met his hobby birdwatching reflected his nature theyd exchanged home phone numbers once on a case yes it was worth a try hello there hendry he said its rebus here rebus trust you to disturb a working mans rest been birdwatching i saw a spotted woodpecker this morning i saw a spotted dick once ah but im not a man of the world like you so what do you want i want you to look in your local phone directory im after bookies shops any one in particular no im not picky i need the names and addresses of all of them which towns rebus thought dunfermline cowdenbeath lochgelly cardenden kelty ballingry thatll do for starters this could take a bit of time can i phone you back aye sure and ponder on two names for me tom and eck robertson theyre brothers okay youre at arden street i hear what you got the heave from the doctor what was it your bedside manner who told you word gets around isnt it true then no its not its just that my brothers here fo ach forget it talk to you later rebus put down the phone would you credit that every bugger seems to know about patience and me was there a notice in the papers or something siobhan smiled what now hendrys going to get back with the details meantime we could nip out and get a curry or something what if he phones while were out hell try again havent you got an answering machine i could never get it to work so i chucked it out besides there are that many bookies shops in fife hendryd be on it for hours they walked to tollcross siobhan insistent that she could do with some fresh air i thought youd have had enough of that at the game are you joking fresh air between the smoking and the smells of dead beer and piegreas youre putting me off my curry i bet youre the vindaloo type too strictly madras said rebus during the meal he reasoned that siobhan might as well toddle off home afterwards it wasnt as if they could do anything tonight with the list of betting shops and tomorrow the shops would be closed but siobhan wanted to stick around at least until hendry phoned we havent covered all the files yet she argued true enough said rebus after the meal while siobhan drank a cup of coffee rebus ordered some takeaway for michael is he all right siobhan asked hes getting better rebus insisted those pills are nearly finished hell be fine once hes shot of them as if to prove the point when they got back to the flat michael was in the kitchen dunking a teabag in a mug of hot milky water he looked like hed just had a shower hed also shaved i fetched you a curry rebus said you must be a mind reader michael sniffed into the brown paper bag rogan josh rebus nodded and turned to siobhan michael is the citys rogan josh expert there was a call while you were out michael lifted the cardboard containers out of the bag hendry that was the name did he leave a message michael unpeeled both cartons meat and rice he said you should get a pen and a lot of paper ready rebus smiled at siobhan come on he said lets save hendrys phone bill im glad you phoned back were hendrys first words for one thing im due at an indoor bowls tourney in half an hour for another this is a big list so lets have it said rebus i could fax it to you at the station no you couldnt im out of the game i hadnt heard funny that you hear about my love life fast enough ready when you are as hendry reeled off the names addresses and phone numbers rebus relayed them to siobhan she claimed to be a fast writer so was given the job of transcribing but after ten minutes they switched over her hand being sore the final list covered three sides of a as well as the basic information hendry dropped in snippets of his own such as licensing wrangles suspected handling of stolen goods hangouts for neerdowells and the like rebus was grateful for all of it a fine institution the bookies he commented when siobhan handed him the receiver you bet said hendry can i go now sure and thanks for everything so long as it helps you get back in the game we need all the flyhalfs we can get those two names didnt click with me by the way and rebus what she sounds a right wee smasher hendry severed the connection before rebus could explain when it came to gossip hendry was a regular sweetiewife rebus dreaded to think what stories hed be hearing about himself in the next week or two what was he saying siobhan asked nothing shed been running through the list for herself well she said no names there that mean anything to me rebus took the list from her me neither next stop fife for me yes on monday i suppose except that on monday hed to report to chief superintendent watson and attend eddie ringans funeral you he said are going to be busy shoring up our side of operation moneybags oh i thought i might go to the funeral thatd give us the excuse for a couple of hours work in fife rebus shook his head i appreciate the thought but youre still on the force im the one with time for this sort of legwork she looked bitterly disappointed and thats an order rebus told her yes sir said siobhan the thought of another interminable sunday bothered rebus so much that after attending mass he drove across the forth road bridge back into fife hed been to our lady of perpetual hell sitting at the back watching and wondering if the priest who led the worship was his priest the accent was scotsirish hard to tell his priest had spoken quietly while this one belted everything out at the top of his voice maybe some of the congregation were deaf but at least there were a fair number of young folk in attendance he was almost alone in not accepting communion westcentral fife could use a spot of communion itself it would drink the wine and pawn the chalice he decided to leave dunfermline till last it was the biggest town with the most locations hed start small he couldnt recall whether it was quicker to get to ballingry by coming off the motorway at kinross but certainly it was a much bonnier drive he was tempted to stop at loch leven site of many a childhood picnic and game of football he still had a lump below his knee where michael had kicked him once the narrow meandering roads were busy with sunday drivers their cars polished like medals there was half a chance hendry would be at the loch leven bird sanctuary but rebus didnt stop soon enough he was in the glummer confines of ballingry he didnt loiter longer than he needed to he wasnt sure what this trip was supposed to accomplish all the betting shops would be tight shut maybe hed find someone he could gossip with about this or that bookies but he doubted it he knew what he was doing he was killing time and this was a good place for it at least here there was the illusion that he was doing something constructive about the case so he parked outside the closed shop and constructively marked a tick against the address on his threepage list of course there was one more reason for his early rise this morning and his early exit from the house in the car with him he had the sunday paper the central hotel story had stuck tenaciously to the front page now with the headline central murder blaze gun found once watson and co saw it theyd be on the phone to each other and naturally to john rebus but for once the students would have to field his calls hed read the story through twice to himself knowing every word by heart he was hoping that somewhere somebody was reading it and starting to panic next stops lochore lochgelly cardenden rebus had been born and raised in cardenden well bowhill actually back when there had been tour parishes auchterderran bowhill cardenden and dundonald the abcd people called it then the post office had termed it all the one town cardenden it wasnt so very much changed from the place rebus had known he stopped the car at the cemetery and spent a few minutes by the grave of his father and mother a woman in her forties placed some flowers against a headstone nearby and smiled at rebus as she passed him when rebus got back to the cemetery gates she was waiting there johnny rebus it was so unexpected he grinned the grin dissolving years from his face i went to school with you the woman stated heather cranston heathe he stared at her face cranny she put a hand to her mouth blocking laughter nobodys called me that in twentyodd years he remembered her now the way she always stifled laughs with her hand embarrassed because her laugh sounded so funny to her now she nodded into the cemetery i walk past your mum and dad most weeks its more than i do aye but youre in edinburgh or someplace now arent you thats right just visiting passing through they had come out of the cemetery now and were walking downhill into bowhill they passed by rebuss car but hed no wish to break off the conversation so they walked aye she said plenty of folk pass through never many stay put i used to ken everybody in the place but not no a yistiken awbdi listening to her rebus realised how much of the accent and the dialect hed lost over the years come round for a cup of tea she was saying now hed looked in vain for an engagement or wedding ring on her hand she was by no means an unlovely woman big whereas at school shed been tiny and shy or maybe rebus wasnt remembering right her cheeks were shining and there was mascara round her eyes she was wearing black shoes with inch and a half heels and teacoloured tights on muscular legsrebus who hadnt had breakfast or lunch would bet that she had a pantry full of cakes and biscuits aye why not he said she lived in a house along craigside road theyd passed one betting shop on the way from the cemetery it was as dead as the rest of the street are you going to take a look at the old house she meant the house hed grown up in he shrugged and watched her unlock her door in the lobby she listened for a second then yelled shug are you up there but there was no sound from upstairs its a miracle she said out of his bed before four oclock he mustve gone out somewhere she saw the look on rebuss face and her hand went to her mouth dont worry its not a husband or boyfriend or anything hughs my son oh she took off her coat away through you go she opened the living room door for him it was a small room choked with a huge threepiece suite diningtable and chairs wallunit and tv shed had the chimney blocked off and central heating installed rebus sank into one of the fireside chairs but youre not married she had slung her coat over the banister never really saw the point she said entering the room she devoured space as she moved first to the radiator to check it was warm then to the mantelpiece for cigarettes and her lighter she offered one to rebus ive stopped he said doctors orders which was in a sense the truth i tried stopping once or twice but the weight i put on you wouldnt credit it she inhaled deeply so hughs fathe she blew the smoke out of her nostrils never knew him really she saw the look on rebuss face have i shocked you johnny just a bit cranny you used to bwel quiet that was a lifetime ago what do you fancy coffee tea or me and she laughed behind her cigarette hand coffees fine said john rebus shifting in his chair she brought in two mugs of bitter instant no biscuits sorry im all out she handed him his mug ive already sugared it hope thats all right fine said rebus who did not take sugar the mug was a souvenir of blackpool they talked about people theyd known at school sitting opposite him she decided at one point to cross one leg over the other but her skirt was too tight so she gave up and tugged at the hem of the garment so what brings you here passing through you said well sort of im actually looking for a bookies shop we passed one on the this is a particular business its probably either new in the past five or so years or else has been taken over by a new operator during that time then youre after hutchys she said this nonchalantly sucking on her cigarette afterwards hutchys but that place was around when we were growing up she nodded named after joe hutchinson he started it then he died and his son howie took over tried changing the name of the place but everybody kept calling it hutchys so he gave up about oh five years ago maybe a bit less he sold up and buggered off to spain imagine same age as us and hes made his pile retired to the sun nearest we get to the sun here is when the toasters on so who did he sell the business to she had to think about this greenwood i think his name is but the place is still called hutchys thats what the sign says above the door aye tommy greenwood tommy youre sure of that not tom or tam she shook her permed head shed had a saltandpepper dye done quite recently rebus supposed it was to hide some authentic grey the style itself could only be termed bouffant junior it took rebus back in time tommy greenwood she said friend of mine used to go out with him had he been around cardenden for long before he bought hutchys no time at all wedidnt know him from adam then in short order hed bought hutchys and the old doctors house down near the river the story goes he paid howie from a suitcase stacked with cash the story goes he still doesnt have a bank account so where did the money come from aye now youre asking a good question she nodded her head slowly a few folk would like to know the answer to that one he asked a few more questions about greenwood but there wasnt more she could tell he kept himself to himself walked between his house and the bookies every day didnt own a flash car no wife no kids didnt do much in the way of socialising or drinking hed be quite a catch for some woman she said in tones that let rebus know shed tried with the rod and line oh aye quite a catch rebus escaped twenty minutes later but not without an exchange of addresses and phone numbers and promises to keep in touch he walked back slowly past hutchysan uninspiring little doublefront with peeling paint and smoky windowsand then briskly up the brae to the cemetery at the cemetery he saw that another car had been parked tight in behind his a cherryred renault he passed his own car and tapped on the window of the renault siobhan clarke put down her newspaper and wound open the window what the hell are you doing here rebus demanded following a hunch i dont have a hunch took me a while did you start with ballingry he nodded thats what threw me i came off the motorway at kelty listen rebus said ive found a contender she didnt seem interested have you seen this mornings paper oh that i meant to tell you about it no not the front page the inside inside she tapped a headline and handed the paper through the window to him three injured in m smash the story told how on saturday morning a bmw left the motorway heading towards glasgow and ended up in a field the family in the car had all been hospitalisedwife teenage son and edinburgh businessman david dougary christ gasped rebus i knocked that off the front page pity you didnt read it at the time whatll happen now rebus read the story through again i dont know itll depend if they shut down or transfer the gorgie operation either we shut down or we follow it we youre suspended remember or else cafferty brings someone else in to take over while dougarys on the mend it would be short notice which means hell hand pick someone or fill in for dougary himself i doubt it said rebus but wouldnt it be just magic if he did the only way of knowing is to keep the surveillance going till something happens one way or the other and meantime meantime weve got a ton more bookies shops to check rebus turned and gave bowhill a smiling glance but something tells me weve already had a yankee come up whats a yankee siobhan asked as rebus unlocked and got into his car when they stopped for a bite to eat and some tea in dunfermline rebus told her the story of hutchys and the man with the case full of cash her face twitched a little as though her tea were too hot or the egg mayonnaise sandwich too strong what was that name again she asked tommy greenwood but hes in the cafferty file what it was rebuss turn to twitch tommy greenwood im sure it is hehe was one of caffertys associates years ago then he disappeared from the scene like so many others theyd quarrelled about equal shares or something sounds like a boulder round the balls and the old heaveho off a bridge as you say its a mobile profession glub glub glub all the way to the bottom siobhan smiled so is it the real tommy greenwood or not rebus shrugged if the buggers had plastic surgery it could be hard to tell all the same there are ways he was nodding to himself oh yes there are ways ways which started with a friendly taxman more than one person that sunday read the story on the front page of their morning paper with a mixture of anguish fear guilt and fury telephone calls were made words were exchanged like bullets but being sunday there wasnt much anyone could do about the situation except if they were of a mind pray if the offlicences had been open or the supermarkets and grocers shops allowed to sell alcohol they might have drowned their sorrows or assuaged their anger as it was the anger just built and so did the anguish block by block the structure neared completion a roof that was all it lacked something to keep the pressure in or natures forces out and it was all because of john rebus this was more or less agreed john rebus was out there with a battering ram and more than one person was of a mind to unlock the door and let him inlet him into their lair and then lock the door after him the meeting in farmer watsons office had been arranged for nine in the morning presumably they wanted rebus at his groggiest and most supine he might growl loudly in the morning but he didnt normally start biting till afternoon that everyone from watson to the canteen staff knew he was being fitted up didnt make things any less awkward for a start the investigation into the central hotel murder wasnt official and watson still wasnt keen to sanction it so rebus had been working rogue anyway give the farmer his due he looked after his team they managed between them to concoct a story whereby rebus had been given permission to do some digging into the files on his own time with a view towards the case perhaps being reopened at a later date as fresh evidence allowed said the farmer his secretary a smart woman with a scary taste in hair colourants copied down these closing words and date it a couple of weeks ago yes sir she said when shed left the room rebus said thank you sir hed been standing throughout the proceedings there being space for just the one chair the one the secretary had been seated on he now stepped gingerly over piles of files and placed his bum where hers had latterly been im covering my hide as well as yours john and not a word to anyone understand yes sir what about inspector flower wont he suspect hes bound to complain to chief inspector lauderdale at least good him and lauderdale can have a chinwag theres something youve got to understand john watson clasped his hands together on the desk his head sinking into huge rounded shoulders he spoke softly i know lauderdales after my job i know i can trust him as far as id trust an irish scooroot he paused do you want my job inspector no fear watson nodded thats what i mean now i know youre not going to be sitting on your hands for the next week or two so take some advice the law cant be tinkered with the way you tinker with an old car think before you do anything and remember stunts like buying a gun can get you thrown off the force but i didnt buy it sir said rebus reciting the story theyd thought up it came into my possession as a potential piece of evidence watson nodded quite a mouthful eh but it might just save your bacon im vegetarian sir rebus said a statement which caused watson to laugh very loudly indeed they were both more than a little interested in what was happening in gorgie the initial news had not seemed promising nobody had turned up at the office nobody at all an extra detail was now keeping a watch on the hospital where dougary lay in traction if nothing happened at the gorgie end theyd switch to the hospital until dougary was up and about maybe hed keep working from his bedside stranger things had happened but at eleventhirty a brightly polished jag pulled into the taxi lot the chauffeur a huge man with long straight hair got out and when he opened the back door out stepped morris gerald cafferty got you you bastard hissed ds petrie firing off a whole roll of film in the excitement siobhan was already telephoning st leonards and after talking with ci lauderdale as instructed though not by lauderdale she phoned arden street rebus picked up the phone on its second ring bingo she said caffertys come calling make sure the photographs are dated and timed yes sir how did the meeting go i think the farmers in love with me theyre both going in said petrie at last lifting his finger from the shutter release the camera motor stopped madden who had come over to the window to watch asked who they were at the same time rebus was asking a similar question whos with big ger his driver man mountain with long hair thats him thats also the guy who got his ear eaten by davey dougary no love lost there then except now the man mountains working for big ger he thought for a moment knowing big ger id say he put him on the payroll just to piss off dougary why would he do that his idea of a joke let me know when they come out again will do she phoned him back half an hour later caffertys taken off again he didnt stay long but listen the chauffeur stayed put what cafferty drove off alone well ill be buggered hes putting the man mountain in charge dougarys accounts he must trust him i suppose he must but i cant see the big chap having much experience running a book hes strictly a guard dog meaning meaning big ger will have to nurse him along meaning big ger will be down at that office practically every day it couldnt be better wed better get in some more film then aye dont let that stupid bugger petrie run out again hows his face by the way itchy but it hurts when he scratches petrie glanced over so she told him inspector rebus was just asking after you was i buggery said rebus i hope his nose drops off and falls in his thermos ill pass your good wishes on sir said siobhan do that replied rebus and dont be shy about it either right im off to a funeral i was talking to brian he said hes a pallbearer good said rebus that means ill have a shoulder to cry on warriston cemetery is a sprawling mix of graves from the ancient and sometimes desecrated to the brand new there are stones there whose messages have been eroded away to faint indents only on a sunny day it can be an educational walk but at nights the local hells angels chapter have been known to party hard recreating scenes more like new orleans voodoo than scottish country dancing rebus felt eddie would have approved the ceremony itself was simple and dignified if you ignored the wreath in the shape of an electric guitar and the fact that he was to be buried with an elvis lp cover inside the casket rebus stood at a distance from proceedings and had turned down an invitation by pat calder to attend the reception afterwards which was to be held not in the hollow heartbreak cafe but in the upstairs room of a nearby hostelry rebus was tempted for a momentthe chosen pub served gibsonsbut shook his head the way hed shaken calders hand with regrets poor eddie for all that rebus hadnt really known him for all that the chef had tried scalping him with a panful of appetisers rebus had liked the man he saw them all the time people who could have made so much of their lives yet hadnt he knew he belonged with them the losers but at least im still alive he thought and god willing nobody will dispatch me by funnelling alcohol down my throat before turning on the gas it struck him again why the need for the funnel all you had to do was take eddie to any bar and hed willingly render himself unconscious on tequila and bourbon you didnt need to force him yet dr curt had tossed his liver in the air and proclaimed it a fair specimen that was difficult to accept except that hed seen it with his own eyes or had he he peered across the distance to where pat calder was taking hold of rope number one testing it for tensile strength brian was number four which meant he stood across the casket from calder and sandwiched between two men rebus didnt know the barman toni was number six but rebuss eyes were on calder oh jesus you bastard he thought you didnt did you then again maybe you did he turned and ran back to where his car was parked out on the road outside the cemetery his destination was arden street arden street and the reservations book for the heartbreak cafe as he saw it rebus had two choices he could kick the door down or he could try to open it quietly it was a snib lock the kind a stiff piece of plastic could sometimes open of course there was a mortice deadlock too but probably not engaged when he pushed and pulled the door there was enough give in it to suggest this was probably true only the snib then but the gap where door met jamb was covered by a long strip of ornamental wood this normally wouldnt deter a burglar who would take a crowbar to it until he had access to the gap but rebus had forgotten to pack his crowbar a rap with the doorknocker wouldnt elicit a response would it but he didnt fancy his chances of shouldering or kicking the door down sniblock or not so he crouched down opened the letterbox with one hand put his eyes level with it and reached up his other hand to the black iron ring giving it five loud raps shaveandahaircut some people called it it signalled a friend at least thats what rebus hoped there was neither sound nor movement from the inside of the maisonette the colonies was daytime quiet he could probably crowbar the door open without anyone noticing instead he tried the knocker again the door had a spyhole and he was hoping someone might be intrigued enough to want to creep to the spyhole and take a look movement now a shadow moving slowly from the living area towards the hall moving stealthily and then a head sticking out of the doorway it was all rebus needed hello eddie he called ive got your wreath here eddie ringan let him in he was dressed in a red silk kimonostyle gown with a fierce dragon crawling all down its back on the arms were symbols rebus didnt understand they didnt worry him eddie flopped onto the sofa usually rebuss perch so rebus made do with standing i was lying about the wreath he said its the thought that counts nice suit too i had to borrow the tie said rebus black ties are cool eddie looked like death warmed up his eyes were darkringed and bloodshot and his face resembled a prisoners sunless grey lacking hope he scratched himself under the armpit so how did it go i left just as they were lowering you away theyll be at the reception now wish i could have done the catering myself but you know how it is rebus nodded its not easy being a corpse youd have found that out some people have managed quite nicely in the past like radiator mccallum and the robertson brothers eddie produced a grim smile one of those yes you must be pretty desperate to stage your own death im not saying anything thats fine there was silence for a minute until eddie broke it how did you find out rebus absentmindedly took a cigarette from the pack on the mantelpiece it was pat he made up this unnecessarily exaggerated story thats pat for you amateur fucking dramatics all the way he said willie stormed out of the restaurant after sticking his face in some poor punters plate i checked with a couple of the people who ate there that night a quick phone call was all it took nobody saw anything of the sort then there was the dead mans liver it was in good nick so it couldnt possibly have been yours you can say that again rebus was about to light up he caught himself lifted the cigarette from his mouth and placed it beside the packet then i checked missing persons seems willie hasnt been back to his digs in a few days the whole thing was amateurish eddie if the poor bugger hadnt got his face blown away in the explosion wedve known straight away it wasnt you would you we wondered about that we reckoned with brian off the scene and haymarket not your territory it might just work rebus shook his head for a start we take photographs and id have seen them sooner or later i always do he paused so why did you kill him it was an accident let me guess you came back late to the restaurant after a pretty good bender you were angry as hell to see willie had coped you had a fight he smashed his head then you had an idea maybe theres only one rotten thing about the whole story said rebus eddie shifted on the sofa he looked ridiculous in the kimono and had folded his arms protectively he was staring at the fireplace avoiding rebus altogether what he said finally pat said willie ran out of the cafe on tuesday night his body wasnt found until thursday morning if hed died in a fight on tuesday lividity and rigor mortis would have told the pathologist the body was old but it wasnt it was fresh which means you didnt booze him up and gas him until early thursday morning you mustve kept him alive all day wednesday knowing pretty well what you were going to do with him im not saying anything no im saying it like i say a desperate remedy eddie about as desperate as they come now come on what were taking a drive where to down to the station of course get some clothes on rebus watched him try to stand up his legs took a while to lock upright yes murder could do that to you it was the opposite of rigor mortis it was liquefaction the jelly effect it took him a long time to dress rebus watching throughout there were tears in eddies eyes when he finished and his lips were wet with saliva rebus nodded youll do he said he fully intended taking eddie to st leonards but theyd be taking the scenic route where are we going a little drive nice day for it eddie looked out of the windscreen it was a uniform grey outside buildings and sky with rain threatening and the breeze gaining force he started to get the idea when they turned up holyrood park road heading straight for arthurs seat and when rebus took a right away from holyrood and in the direction of duddingston eddie started to look very worried indeed you know where were going rebus suggested no oh well he kept driving drove all the way up to the gates of the house and signalled with his indicator that he was turning into the drive christ nor yelped eddie ringan he tucked his knees in front of him wedging them against the dashboard like he thought they were about to crash instead of turning in at the gates rebus cruised past them and stopped kerbside you caught a glimpse of caffertys mansion from here presumably if someone up at the house were looking out of the right window they could see the car no no eddie was weeping you do know where we are rebus said voicing surprise you know big ger then he waited till eddie nodded the chef had assumed a foetal position feet on the seat beneath him head tucked into his knees are you scared of him eddie nodded again why slowly eddie shook his head is it because of the central hotel why did i have to tell brian it was a loud yell all the louder for being confined by the car why the fuck am i so stupid theyve found the gun you know i dont know anything about that you never saw the gun eddie shook his head damn rebus had been expecting more so what did you see i was in the kitchens yes this guy came running in screaming at me to turn on the gas he looked crazy spots of blood on his facin his eyelashes eddie was calming as the exorcism took effect he started to turn on all the gas rings not lighting them he looked so crazy i helped him i turned on the gas just like he told me to and then i got out of there i wasnt sticking around i thought the same as everybody else it was for the insurance money till they found the body a week later i got a visit from big ger a painful visit the message was never say a word not a word about what happened was big ger there that night eddie shrugged damn him again i was in the kitchens i only saw the crazy guy well rebus knew who that wassomeone whod seen the state of the central kitchens black aengus he asked eddie didnt say anything for a few minutes just stared blearily out of the windscreen then big gers bound to find out i said something every now and then he sends another warning nothing physicanot to me at least just to let me know he remembers hell kill me he turned his head to rebus hell kill me and all i did was turn on the gas the man with the blood it was aengus gibson wasnt it eddie nodded slowly screwing shut his eyes and wringing out tears rebus started the car as he was driving off he saw the x coming towards him from the opposite direction it was signalling to pull into the gates and the gates themselves were opening compliantly the car was driven by a thug whose face was new to rebus in the back seat sat mo cafferty it bothered him during the short drive back to st leonards with eddie bawling and huddled in the passenger seat it bothered him could mo cafferty drive at all that would be easy enough to check a quick chat with dvlc if she couldnt if she needed a chauffeur then who was driving the x that day rebus had seen it parked outside bones and wasnt that quite a coincidence anyway john rebus didnt believe in coincidences the heartbreak cafe didnt get its meat from bones did it he asked eddie who misinterpreted the question i mean bones the butchers shop rebus explained but eddie shook his head never mind said rebus back at st leonards the very person he wanted to see was waiting for him why arent you out at gorgie he asked why arent you on suspension siobhan clarke asked back thats below the belt besides i asked first i had to come and pick up these she waved a huge brown envelope at him well listen ive got a little job for you several in fact first we need to have eddie ringans casket back up out of the ground what its not eddie inside ive just put him in the cells youll need to interview and book him ill tell you all about it im going to need to write all this down no you wont your memorys good enough not when my brains in shock you mean that wasnt eddie in the oven thats what i mean next check and see if mo cafferty has a driving licence what for just do it and do you remember telling me that when bone won his merc he put up his share of the business to cover the bet your words his share i remember his wife told me rebus nodded i want to know who owns the other half is that all sir rebus thought no not quite check bones merc see if anyone owned it before him that way well know who he won it from he looked at her unblinking quick as you can eh quick as i can sir now do you want to know whats in the envelope its for the man who has everything go on then surprise me so she did rebus was so surprised he bought her coffee and a doughring in the canteen the xrays lay on the table between them i dont believe this he kept saying i really dont believe this i put out a search for these ages ago they were in the records office at ninewells but i asked them but did you ask nicely siobhan had explained that shed been able to take a few trips to dundee chatting up anyone who might be useful and especially in the chaotic records department which had been moved and reorganised a few years before leaving older records an ignored shambles it had taken time more than that shed had to promise a date to the young man whod finally come up with the goods rebus held up one of the xrays again broken right arm siobhan confirmed twelve years ago while he was living and working in dundee tam roberston rebus said simply that was that then the dead man the man with the bullet wound through his heart the bullet from rebuss colt was tam robertson difficult to prove in a court of law siobhan suggested true enough youd need more than hearsay and an xray to prove identity to a jury there are ways said rebus we can try dental records again now weve got an idea who the corpse is then theres superimposition for the moment its enough for me that im satisfied he nodded well done clarke he started to get up sir yes she was smiling merry christmas sir he phoned gibsons brewery only to be told that mr aengus was attending an ale competition in newcastle due back later tonight so he called the inland revenue and spoke for a while to the inspector in charge of his case if he was going to confront tommy greenwood hed need all the ammo he could gathebad metaphor considering but true all the same he left his car at st leonards while he went for a walk trying to clear his head everything was coming together now aengus gibson had been playing cards with tam robertson and had shot him then set fire to the hotel to cover up the murder it should all be tied up but rebuss brain was posing more questions than answers was it likely aengus carried a gun around with him even in his wild days why didnt eck also present seek revenge for his brother wouldnt aengus have had to shut him up somehow was it likely that only three of them were involved in the poker game and who had delivered the gun to deek torrance so many questions as he came down onto south clerk street he saw that a van was parked outside bones a new plateglass window was being installed in the shop itself and the van door was open at the back rebus walked over to the van and looked in the back it had been a proper butchers van at one time and nobody had bothered changing it you climbed a step into the back where there were counters and cupboards and a small fridgefreezer the van would have had its usual rounds of the housing schemes in the city housewives and retired folk queuing for meat rather than travelling to a shop a man in a white apron came out of bones with an expig hoisted on his shoulder excuse me he said carrying the carcass into the van you use this for deliveries rebus asked the man nodded just to restaurants i remember when a butchers van used to come by our way rebus reminisced aye its not economic these days though everything changes said rebus the man nodded agreement rebus was examining the interior again to get behind the counter you climbed into the van pulled a hinged section of the counter up and pushed open a narrow little door narrow thats what the back of the van was he remembered michaels description of the van hed been shunted about in a narrow van with a smell as the man came out of the van he disturbed something with his foot it was a piece of straw straw in a butchers van none of the animals carried in here had seen straw for a while rebus looked into the shop a young assistant was watching the glass being installed open for business sir he informed rebus cheerily i was looking for mr bone hes not in this afternoon rebus nodded towards the van do you still do runs what housetohouse the young man shook his head just general deliveries bulk stuff yes rebus would agree with that he walked back up to st leonards and caught siobhan again forgot to sa more work not much more pat calder youll need to bring him in for questioning too hell be back home by now and getting frantic wondering where eddies sloped off to im just sorry i wont be around for the reunion i suppose i can always catch it in cour it had been quite a day already and it wasntyet six oclock back in the flat the students were cooking a lentil curry while michael sat in the living room reading another book on hypnotherapy it had all become very settled in the flat verwell the word that came to mind was homely it was a strange word to use about a bunch of teenage students a copper and an excon yet it seemed just about right michael had finished the tablets and looked the better for it he was supposed to arrange a checkup but rebus was dubious theyd probably only stick him on more tablets the scars would heal over naturally all it took was time hed certainly regained his appetite two helpings of curry after the meal they all sat around in the living room the students drinking wine michael refusing it rebus supping beer from a can there was music the kind that never went away the stones and the doors janis joplin very early pink floyd it was one of those evenings rebus felt absolutely shattered and blamed it on the caffeine tablets hed been taking here hed been worrying about michael and all the time hed been swallowing down his own bad medicine theyd seen him through the weekend sleeping little and thinking lots but yo couldnt go on like that forever and what with the music and the beer and the relaxed conversation hed almost certainly fall asleep here on the sofa what was that sounds like somebody smashed a bottle or something the students got up to look out of the window cant see anything no look theres glass on the road they turned to rebus someones broken your windshield someone had indeed broken his windshield as he found when he wandered downstairs and into the street other neighbours had gathered at doors and windows to check the scene but most of them were retreating now there was a chunk of rock on the passenger seat surrounded by jewels of shattered glass nearby a car was reversing lazily out of its parking spot it stopped in the road beside him the passenger side window went down what happened nothing just a rock through the windscreen what the passenger turned to his driver wait here a second he got out to examine the damage who the hell would want to do that how many names do you want rebus reached into the car to pull out the rock and felt something collide with the back of his head it didnt make sense for a moment but by then he was being dragged away from the car into the road he heard a car reverse and stop he tried to resist clawing at the unyielding tarmac with his fingernails jesus he was going to pass out his head was trying to close all channels each thud of his heart brought intense new pain to his skull someone had opened a window and was shouting something some warning or complaint he was alone in the middle of the road now the passenger had run back to the car and slammed the door shut rebus pushed himself onto all fours a baby resisting gravity for the first time he blinked trying to see out of cloudy eyes he saw headlights and knew what they were going to do they were going to drive straight over him sucker punch and hed fallen for it the offer of help from your attacker routine older than arthurs seat itself the cars engine roared and the tyres squealed towards him dragging the body of the car with them rebus wondered if hed get the licence number before he died a hand grabbed the neck of his shirt and hauled pulling him backwards out of the road the car caught his legs tossing one shoe up off his foot and into the air the car didnt stop or even slow down just kept on up the slope to the top of the road where it took a right and disappeared are you okay john it was michael you saved my life there mickey adrenalin was mixing with pain in rebuss body making him feel sick he threw up undigested lentil curry onto the pavement try to stand up said michael rebus tried and failed my legs hurt he said christ do my legs hurt the xrays showed no breaks or fractures not even a bone chipped just bad bruising inspector said the woman doctor at the infirmary you were lucky a hit like that could have done a lot of damage rebus nodded i suppose i should have known he said ive been due a visit here as a patient christ knows ive been here enough recently as a visitor ill just fetch you something said the doctor wait a second doctor are your labs open in the evening she shook her head why do you ask nothing she left the room michael came closer how do you feel i dont know which hurts worse my head or my left leg no great loss to association football rebus almost smiled but grimaced instead any movement of his face muscles sent electric spurts through his brain the doctor came back into the room here you are she said this should help rebus had been expecting painkillers but she was holding a walking stick it was an aluminium walking stick hollow and therefore lightweight with a large rubberised grip and adjustable height courtesy of a series of holes in its shaft into which a lockingpin could be placed it looked like some strange wind instrument but rebus was glad of it as he walked out of the hospital back at the flat however one of the solicitous students said he had something better and came back from his bedroom with a black wooden cane with a silver and bone handle rebus tried it it was a good height for him i bought it in a junk shop the student said dont ask me why looks like it should have a concealed sword said rebus he tried twisting and pulling at the handle but nothing happened so much for that the police who had talked to rebus at the infirmary had also spoken to the students this constable related the walkingstick owner whose name rebus was sure was ed i mean he was looking at us like we were squatters and he was asking was inspector rebus in here with you and we were nodding yes he was and the constable couldnt figure it out at all he started laughing even michael smiled someone else made a pot of herbal tea great thought rebus another story that would be doing the rounds rebus fills his flat with students then sits around with them of an evening with wine and beer at the infirmary theyd asked if hed recognised either of the men the answer was no it was a mobile profession after alone of the neighbours had caught the cars number plate it was a ford escort stolen only an hour or so before from a car park near the sheraton on lothian road they would find it abandoned quite soon probably not far from marchmont there wouldnt be any fingerprints they mustve been crazy michael said on the way home rebus having got them a lift in the back of a patrol car thinking they could pull a stunt like that it wasnt a stunt michael somebodys desperate that story in yesterdays paper has really shaken them up after all wasnt that exactly what hed wanted hed sought a reaction and here it was from the flat he telephoned an emergency windscreen replacement firm it would cost the earth but he needed the car first thing in the morning he just prayed his leg wouldnt seize up in the night which of course it did he was up at five practising walking across the living room trying to unstiffen the joints and tendons he looked at his left leg a spectacular bloodfilled bruise stretched across his calf wrapping itself around most of the front of the leg too if the bony front of his leg had taken the impact rather than the fleshy back there would have been at the very least a clean break he swallowed two paracetamolrecommended for the pain by the infirmary doctorand waited for morning proper to arrive hed needed sleep last night but hadnt got much today hed be living on his wits he just hoped those wits would be sharp enough at sixthirty he managed the tenement stairs and hobbled to his car now boasting a windscreen worth more than the rest of it put together traffic wasnt quite heavy yet coming into town and nonexistent heading out so the drive itself was mercifully shortened pressing down on the clutch hurt all the way up into his groin he took the coast road out to north berwick letting the engine labour rather than changing gears too often just the other side of the town he found the house he was looking for well an estate actually and not a housing estate it must have been about thirty or forty acres with an uninterrupted view across the mouth of the forth to the dark lump of bass rock rebus wasnt much good at architecture georgian hed guess it looked like a lot of the houses in edinburghs new town with fluted stone columns either side of the doorway and large sash windows nine panes of glass to each half broderick gibson had come a long way since those days in his garden shed pottering with homebrew recipes rebus parked outside the front door and rang the bell the door was opened by mrs gibson rebus introduced himself its a bit early inspector is anything wrong if i could just speak to your son please hes eating breakfast why dont you wait in the sittingroom and ill bring you its all right mother aengus gibson was still chewing and wiping his chin with a cloth napkin he stood in the diningroom doorway come in here inspector rebus smiled at the defeated mrs gibson as he passed her whats happened to your leg gibson asked i thought you might know sir oh why aengus had seated himself at the table rebus had been entertaining an image of silver servicetureens and hotplates kedgeree or kippers wedgewood plates and tea poured by a manservant but all he saw was a plain white plate with greasy sausage and eggs on it buttered toast on the side and a mug of coffee there were two newspapers folded beside aengusmairies paper and the financial times and enough crumbs around the table to suggest that mother and father had eaten already mrs gibson put her head round the door a cup of coffee inspector no thank you mrs gibson she smiled and retreated i just thought rebus said to aengus you might have arranged it i dont understand trying to shut me up before i can ask a few questions about the central hotel that again aengus bit into a piece of toast yes that again rebus sat down at the table stretching his left leg out in front of him you see i know you were there that night long after mr vanderhyde left i know you were at a poker game set up by two villains called tam and eck robertson i know someone shot and killed tam and i know you ran into the kitchens covered in blood and screaming for all the gas rings to be turned on that mr gibson is what i know gibson seemed to have trouble swallowing the chewed toast he gulped coffee and wiped his mouth again well inspector he said if thats what you know i suggest you dont know very much maybe youd like to tell me the rest sir they sat in silence aengus toyed with the empty mug rebus waiting for him to speak the door burst open get out of here roared broderick gibson he was wearing trousers and an opennecked shirt whose cuffs flapped for want of their links obviously his wife had disturbed him halfway through dressing i could have you arrested right this minute he said the chief constable tells me youve been suspended rebus stood up slowly making much of his injured leg but there was no charity in broderick gibson and stay away from us unless you have the authority ill be talking to my solicitor this morning rebus was at the door now he stopped and looked into broderick gibsons eyes i suggest you do that sir and you might care to tell him where you were the night the central hotel burnt down your sons in serious trouble mr gibson you cant hide him from the fact forever just get out gibson hissed you havent asked about my leg what nothing sir just wondering alou as rebus walked back across the large hallway with its paintings and candelabra and fine curving stairwell he felt how cold the house was it wasnt just its age or the tiled floor either the place was cold at its heart he arrived in gorgie just as siobhan was pouring her first cup of decaf of the day what happened to your leg she asked rebus pointed with his stick to the man stationed behind the camera what the hell are you doing here im relieving petrie said brian holmes i wonder what any of us is doing here said siobhan rebus ignored her youre off sick i was bored i came back early i spoke to the chief super yesterday and he okayed it so here i am holmes looked fine but sounded dour there was an ulterior motive though he said i wanted to hear from siobhan herself the story of eddie and pat it all sounds sincredible i mean i cried at that cemetery yesterday and the bastard i was crying for was sitting at home playing with himself hell be playing with himself in jail soon said rebus then to siobhan give me some of that coffee he drank two scalding swallows before passing the plastic cup back thanks any progress no ones arrived yet not even our trading standards companion i meant those other things what did happen to your leg holmes asked so rebus told them all about it its my fault holmes said for getting you into this in the first place thats right it is said rebus and as penance you can keep your eyes glued to that window he turned to siobhan so she took a deep breath so i interviewed ringan and calder yesterday afternoon theyve both been charged i also checked and mrs cafferty doesnt have a driving licence not under her married or her maiden name bones mercedes belonged to big ger cafferty you already knew i guessed said rebus what about the other half of bones business owned by a company called geronimo holdings which in turn is owned by big ger and sweetly the word geronimo includes both his and his wifes names so what do you make of it looks to me like ger probably won his half of the business in a bet with bone either that added holmes or he got it in lieu of protection money bone couldnt afford maybe said rebus but the bets more likely after all said siobhan bone won the car in a bet with cafferty theyve gambled together in the past rebus nodded well it all adds up to a tight connection between the two of them and theres a tighter connection too though i cant prove it just yet hang on said siobhan if the stabbing and the smashed window are to do with protection or gambling then theyre to do with cafferty which means since cafferty owns half the business that cafferty smashed his own window rebus was shaking his head i didnt say they were to do with protection or gambling and where does the cousin fit in holmes interrupted my my commented rebus you are keen to be back arent you im not sure exactly where kintoul fits in but im getting a fair idea hold on said holmes here we are they all watched as a battered purple mini drove up to the taxi offices when the drivers door opened the man mountain squeezed himself out like toothpaste from the tube said rebus christ added holmes he mustve taken out the front seats all alone today siobhan noted ill bet cafferty drops in sometime though said rebus just to check hes been ripped off badly in the past he wont want it happening again ripped off badly siobhan echoed how do you know that rebus winked at her its an oddson bet he said he had to wait till after lunch for the information he needed he had it faxed to him at a local newsagents during the long wait in gorgie hed discussed the case with holmes and siobhan they both were of the same mind in one particular nobody would testify against cafferty and of like minds in another they couldnt even be sure cafferty had anything to do with it ill find out this afternoon rebus told them heading out to pick up the fax he was getting used to walking with the cane and as long as he kept moving the leg itself didnt stiffen up but he knew the drive to cardenden wouldnt do him much good he considered the train but ruled it out in short order he might want to escape from fife in a hurry and scotrails timetables just didnt fit the bill it was just after twothirty when he pushed open the door of hutchys betting shop the place was airless smelling old and undusted the cigarette butts on the floor were probably last weeks there was a twothirtyfive race and a few punters lined the walls waiting for the commentary rebus didnt let the look of the place put him off nobody wanted to bet in a plush establishment it meant the bookie was making too much money these tawdry surroundings were all psychology you might not be winning the bookmaker was saying but look at me im not doing any better except that he was rebus noticed a halffamiliar face studying the form on one of the newspapers pinned to the wall but then this town was full of halffamiliar faces he approached the glasspartitioned desk id like a word with mr greenwood please do you have an appointment but rebus was no longer talking to the woman his attention was on the man whod looked up from a desk behind her mr greenwood im a police officer can we have a word greenwood thought about it then got up unlocked the door of the booth and came out round here he said leading rebus to the rear of the shop he unlocked another door letting them into a much cosier and more private office any trouble he asked immediately sitting down and reaching into his desk drawer for a bottle of whisky not for me sir rebus said he sat down opposite greenwood and stared at him christ it was difficult after all these years but midges portrait wasnt so far off the mark a chess player would be making ready to play a pawn rebus decided to sacrifice his queen so eck he said getting comfortable howve things been greenwood looked around are you talking to me i suppose i must be my names not eck do you want to keep playing games fine then lets play games greenwood was pouring himself a large whisky your name is eck robertson you fled from the cafferty gang taking with you quite a lot of big gers money you also took another mans identitythomas greenwood you knew tommy wouldnt complain because he was dead another one of big gers incredible disappearing acts you took his name and his identity and you set up for yourself in the arseend of fife living out of a suitcase full of money till you got this place in profit rebus paused how am i doing greenwood aka eck robertson swallowed loudly and refilled his glass you took too much of greenwoods identity though when you set up here inland revenue got onto you for an unpaid income tax bill you wrote to them and eventually you paid up rebus brought the faxed sheets from his pocket ive got a copy of your letter here along with some earlier stuff from the real thomas greenwood wait till a handwriting expert gets hold of them in court have you ever seen those guys work on a jury its like perry mason even i can see the signatures arent the same i changed my writing style rebus smiled changed your face too dyed hair shaved off your moustache contact lensetinted your eyes used to be hazel didnt they eck i keep telling you my names rebus got up whatever you say im sure big ger will recognise you quick enough wait a minute sit down rebus sat and waited eck robertson tried to smile he flicked on his radio for a moment and listened to the race then flicked it off again a sixtoone shot had romped home another win for the bookies rebus said always liked the horses didnt you not as much as tam though tam just loved betting he bet you he could screw money out of big ger without ger noticing creaming it off just a little at a time but it all mounted up here rebus tossed the drawing of tam robertson onto the desk heres what he might look like these days if big ger hadnt found out eck robertson stared at the drawing tracing a finger over it you had to do a runner before big ger caught you so you took the money then radiator ran too after all hed introduced the two of you into the gang hed be in for punishment too rebus paused again or did big ger catch up with him robertson eyes still on the drawing shrugged well whatever said rebus i think ill have that whisky now his leg was hurting like blazes his knuckles white on the handle of the cane it took robertson a while to pour the drink so rebus asked him anything you want to add how did you find me somebody spotted you robertson nodded the chef whats his name ringan i saw him in some pub in cowdenbeath he looked like he was on a bender so i got out fast i didnt think hed seen me and if he had i didnt think hed recognise me i was wrong eh you were wrong rebus sipped the whisky like it was medicine on a spoon it was aengus gibson robertson said suddenly aengus gibson had the gun and then he told the rest of the story tam had been cheating at poker as usual but aengus was on to him and drew the gun shot tam dead we scarpered what rebus was disbelieving no thoughts of revenge that young drunk had just killed your brother nobody touched black aengus he was big gers pal they got friendly after some misunderstanding a breakin at mos flat big ger had plans for him what sort of plans robertson shrugged just plans youre right about the money i knew i had to run while i could why here though robertson blinked it was the last station on the line big gers never had much interest in fife it would mean tackling the italians and the orangemen rebus was doing some quick thinking so what did ger do when aengus shot tam how do you mean eck i know big ger was at the poker game so what did he do he scarpered the same as the rest of us so big ger had been there robertsons eyes were on his brothers portrait again rebus had a very good idea too what caffertys plans for aengus must have been imagine having such a hold over someone whod one day control the gibson brewing business such a hold all these years who took away the gun eck eck shrugged again rebus got the idea hed stopped listening he rapped the edge of the desk with his cane you went to a lot of trouble eck eddie ringan appreciated that he learned from you that its possible to disappear a handy lesson when big gers after you he really makes people disappear doesnt he dumping them at sea like that thats what he does isnt it after a while aye rebus frowned at this but then eck robertsons next words hit him nobody notices a butchers van rebus nodded smiling youre right about that he wet his lips eck would you testify against him in closed court keep your new identity secret would you but eck robertson was shaking his head he was still shaking it when the door burst open ah the halfremembered face from the form sheets it was the pool player from the midden all right tommy fine sharky fine but tommy greenwood didnt look it out you go son said rebus mr greenwood and me have got business sharky ignored him want me to chuck him out tommy tommy greenwood never got a chance to answer rebus pushed the handle of his cane hard up under sharkys nose and then whipped it harder still against his knees the young man crumpled rebus stood up handy thing this he said he pointed it at eck robertson you can keep the picture as a reminder eck meantime ill be back i want you to testify against cafferty not now not yet sometime after ive got him firm on a charge and if you wont testify i can always resurrect eck robertson think about it one way or the other big gerll know he was crossing the forth road bridge when he heard the news on the radio aw christ he said stepping on the accelerator rebus showed his id as he drove through the brewery gates there was only the one police car left at the scene and no sign of an ambulance workers stood around in huddled lowtalking groups passing round cigarettes and stories rebus knew the detective sergeant he worked out of edinburgh west and his unfortunate name was robert burns this burns was tall and bulky and redhaired with freckles on his face on sunday afternoons he could sometimes be found at the foot of the mound where he would lambast the strolling heathens rebus was glad to see burns you might get fire and brimstone with him but youd never get waffle burns pointed to the huge aluminium tank he climbed to the top yes rebus could see all too clearly the metal stairwell which reached to the top of the tank with walkways circling the tank every thirty feet or so and when he got to the top he jumped a lot of the workers saw him and they all said the same thing he just climbed steadily till there were no more stairs and then he threw himself off arms stretched out one of them said the dive was better than anything hed seen in the olympics that good eh they werent the only ones staring at the tank some of the workforce glanced up from time to time then traced aengus gibsons descent hed hit the tarmac and crumpled like a concertina there was a dent in the ground as though a boulder had been lifted from the spot his father tried chasing after him burns was saying didnt get very far old boy like that its a wonder his heart didnt give out they had to help him down from the third circle rebus counted up three walkways a bit of dante eh he said winking at burns the old boys saying it was an accident of course he is it wasnt though of course it wasnt ive got a dozen witnesses who say he jumped a dozen witnesses rebus corrected wholl change their minds if their jobs are on the line aye right enough rebus breathed in hed always liked that smell of hops but from now on he knew it would smell differently to him it would smell like this moment played over time and time again the lord giveth and the lord taketh away said burns what happened to your leg by the way ingrown toenails said rebus the lord gave them the infirmary took them away burns was shaking his head at this easy blasphemy when a window in the building behind them opened you shouted broderick gibson you killed him you did it his crooked finger a finger he seemed unable to straighten was mostly pointed at rebus his eyes were like wet glass his breathing strained someone was trying to coax him gently back into the office hands on his shoulders therell be a reckoning he called to rebus mark my words therell come a reckoning the old man was finally pulled inside the window falling shut after him the workers were looking over towards the two policemen he must be one of yours said rebus making for his car that was that then aengus gibson had shot and killed tam robertson and now aengus was dead end of story rebus could think of one person not in aenguss family who was going to be very upset big ger cafferty cafferty had protected black aengus maybe even blackmailed him all the time waiting for the day when the young man would take over the brewery with aengus dead the whole edifice fell and good riddance to it still there was no comeback for cafferty no punishment back at the flat michael had some news the does been trying to get you which one ive seen so many recently dr patience aitken she seems to think youre avoiding her sounds like the ploys working too its not a ploy ive just had a lot on my plate and if you dont finish it you wont get afters michael smiled she sounds nice by the way she is nice im the arsehole so go see her rebus flopped onto the sofa maybe i will what are you reading michael showed him the cover another book on hypnotherapy you must have exhausted the field ive just been scratching the surface michael paused im going to take a course oh im going to become a hypnotherapist i mean i know i can hypnotise people you can certainly get them to take their trousers off and bark like dogs exactly its about time i put it to better use they say laughter is the best medicine shut up john im trying to be serious and im moving back in with chrissie and the kids oh ive talked with her weve decided to try again sounds romantic well one of us has got to have some romance in his soul michael picked up the telephone and handed it to rebus now phone the doctor yes sir said rebus broderick gibson had clout there was no denying it on wednesday morning the newspapers reported the tragic accident at the gibson brewery near fountainbridge edinburgh there were photos of aengus some in his black aengus days others showing the later model at charity events there wasnt a whisper of suicide it was another coverup by aenguss father another distortion of the truth it had become just something broderick gibson did a part of the routine at tenfifteen rebus received a phone call it was chief superintendent watson theres someone here to see you he said i told him youre under suspension but hes bloody insistent who is it asked rebus some blind old duffer called vanderhyde vanderhyde was still waiting when rebus arrived he looked quite at ease concentrating on the sounds around him chatter and phone calls and the clacking of keyboards he was seated on a chair facing rebuss desk rebus tiptoed painfully around him and sat down he watched matthew vanderhyde for a couple of minutes he was dressed in a dark suit white shirt and black tie mourning clothes he carried a blue cardboard folder which he rested on his thighs his walkingstick rested against the side of his chair well inspector said vanderhyde suddenly seen enough rebus gave a wry smile good morning mr vanderhyde what gave me away youre carrying a cane of some kind it hit the corner of your desk rebus nodded i was sorry to hear no sorrier than his parents theyve worked hard over the years with aengus he has been hard work devilish hard at times now its all gone to waste vanderhyde leaned forward in his chair had he been sighted his eyes would have been boring into rebuss as it was rebus could see his own face reflected in the double mirror of vanderhydes glasses did he deserve to die inspector he had a choice did he rebus was remembering the priests words can you live the rest of your life with the memories and the guilt vanderhyde knew rebus wasnt about to answer he nodded slowly and sat back a little in his chair you were there that night werent you rebus asked where at the card game blind men make poor cardplayers inspector a sighted person could help them rebus waited vanderhyde sat stiff and straight like the wax figure of a victorian maybe someone like broderick gibson vanderhydes fingers played over the blue folder gripped it and passed it over the desk broderick wanted you to have this what is it he wouldnt say all he did say was he hoped youll think it was worth it though he himself doubts it vanderhyde paused of course i was curious enough to study it in my own particular way its a book of some kind rebus accepted the heavy folder and vanderhyde took his own hand away finding his walkingstick and resting the hand there some keys were found on aengus they didnt seem to match any known lock last night broderick found some bank statements detailing monthly payments to an estate office he knows the head of the office so he phoned him aengus it seems had been leasing a flat in blair street rebus knew it a narrow passage between the high street and the cowgate balanced precariously between respectability and low living nobody knew about it vanderhyde shook his head it was his little den inspector a real rats nest according to broderick mouldering food and empty bottles pornographic video a regular bachelor pad vanderhyde ignored his levity this book was found there rebus had already opened the folder inside was a large ringbound notebook it bore no title but its narrow lines were filled with writing a few sentences told rebus what it was aengus gibsons journal rebus sat at his desk reading nobody bothered him despite the fact that he was supposed to be suspended the day grew sunless and the office emptied slowly he might as well have been in solitary confinement for all the notice he took his phone was off its hook and his head bowed over the journal was hidden by his hands a clear sign that he did not want to be disturbed he read the journal quickly first time through after all only some of the pages were germane the early entries were full of wild parties illicit coitus in country mansions with married women who were still names even today and more often with the daughters of those women arguments with father and mother usually over money money there was a lot of money in these early entries money spent on travel cars champagne clothes however the journal itself opened quite strangely sometimes mostly when im alone but occasionally in company i catch a glimpse of someone from the corner of my eye or think i do when i look properly theres nobody there there may be some shape there some interesting unconscious arrangement of the edge of an open door and the window frame beyond it or whatever which gives the hint of a human shape i mention the door and the window frame because it is the most recent example i am becoming convinced however that i really am seeing things and what i am seeingbeing shown to be more accurateis myself that other part of me i went to church when i was a child and believed in ghosts i still believe in ghosts rebus skipped to the start of the next entry i can write this journal safe in the knowledge that whoever is reading ityes you dear readerdoes so after my death nobody knows it is here and since i have no friends no confidants or confidantes it is unlikely that anyone will sneak a look at it a burglar may carry it off of course if so shame on you it is the least valuable thing in this flat though it may become more valuable the longer i write there were huge gaps in the chronology a single year might garner half a dozen dated entries black aengus it seemed was no more regular in keeping a diary than he was in anything else five years ago though there had been a spate of entries the accidental breakin at mo johnsons flat aengus becoming friendly with mo and being introduced by her to a certain morris cafferty after a while cafferty became simply big ger as aengus and he met at parties and in pubs and clubs by far the longest entry however belonged to the one day rebus was really interested in this isnt a bad place really the nursing staff are understanding and ready with jokes and stories they carry me with all gentleness back to my room when i find ive wandered from it the corridors are long and mazey i thought i saw a tree once in one corridor but it was a painting on the window a nurse placed my hand on the cold glass so i could be sure in my mind like the rest of them she refused to smuggle in any vodka from my window i can see a squirrela red squirrel i thinkleaping between trees and beyond that hills covered with stunted foliage like a bad school haircut but im not really seeing this pastoral scene im looking into a room a room where i think ill be spending a great deal of my time even after ive left this hospital why did i ever try to talk my father into going to the poker game i know the answer now because cafferty wanted him there and father was keen enoughtheres still a spark in him a spark of the wildness that has been his legacy to me but he couldnt come had he been there i wonder if things would have turned out differently i met uncle matthew in the bar god what a bore he thinks that because he has dabbled with demons and the hobgoblins of nationalism he has some import in the world i could have told him men like cafferty have import they are the hidden movers and shakers the dealmakers simply they get things done and god what things tam robertson suggested that i join the poker game which was happening upstairs the stake money required was not high and i knew i could always nip over to blair street for more cash if needed of course i knew tam robertsons reputation he dealt cards in a strange manner elbow jutting out and up though i couldnt fathom how some people reckoned he was able to see the underside of the cards as he dealt his brother eck explained it away by saying tam had broken his arm as a young man well im no card sharp and i expected to lose a few quid but i was sure id know if anyone tried to cheat me but then the other two players arrived and i knew i would not be cheated one was cafferty he was with a man called jimmy bone a butcher by trade he looked like a butcher toopuffyfaced redcheeked with fingers as fat as link sausages he had a justscrubbed look too you often get that with butchers surgeons workers in the slaughterhouse they like to look cleaner than clean now that i think of it cafferty looked like that too and eck and tam tam was always rubbing his hands giving off an aroma of lemon soap or he would examine his fingernails and pick beneath them to look at his clothes you would never guess but he was pathologically hygienic i realise nowblessed hindsight that the robertson brothers were not pleased to see cafferty nor did the butcher look happy at having been cajoled into playing he kept complaining that he owed too much as it was but cafferty wouldnt hear of it the butcher was a dreadful poker player he mimed dejection whenever he had a bad hand and fidgeted shuffling his feet when he had a good one as the game wore on it was obvious there was an undercurrent between cafferty and the robertsons cafferty kept complaining about business it was slow money wasnt what it was then he turned to me abruptly and slapped his palm against the back of my hand how many dead men have you seen in caffertys company i affected more bravado even than usual an effect achieved in most part by seeming preternaturally relaxed not many i said or something offhand like that any at all he persisted he didnt wait for an answer ive seen dozens yes dozens whats more black aengus ive killed my fair share of them he lifted his hand away sat back and said nothing the next hand was dealt in silence i wished mo were around she had a way of calming him down he was drinking whisky from the bottle sloshing it around in his mouth before swallowing noisily sober he is unpredictable drunk he is dangerous thats why i like him i even admire him in a strange sort of way he gets what he wants by any means necessary there is something magnetic about that singularity of mind and of course in his company i am someone to be respected respected by people who would normally call me a stuckup snob and as one person did a pissedup piece of shite cafferty took exception when i told him id been called this he paid the man responsible a visit what makes him want to spend time with me before that night id thought maybe we saw fire in one anothers eyes but now i know differently he spent time with me because i was going to be another means to an end a final bitter end i was drinking vodka at first with orange later neatbut always from a glass and always with ice the robertsons drank beer they had a crate of bottles on the floor between them the butcher drank whisky whenever cafferty deigned to pour him some which wasnt often enough for the poor butcher i was twenty quid down within a matter of minutes and sixty quid down after a quarter of an hour cafferty placed his hand on mine again if id not strayed along he said theyd have had the shirt off your back and the breeks off your arse i never cheat said tam robertson i got the feeling cafferty had been wanting him to say something all along robertson acknowledged this by biting his lip cafferty asked him if he was sure he didnt cheat robertson said nothing his brother tried to calm things down putting our minds back onto the game but cafferty grinned at tam robertson as he picked up his cards later he started again ive killed a lot of men he said directing his eyes at me but his voice at the robertsons but not one of those killings wasnt justified people who owed me people whod done me wrong people whod cheated the way i look at it everybody knows what hes getting into doesnt he for want of any other answer i agreed and once youre into something there are consequences to be faced arent there i nodded again black aengus he said have you ever thought about killing someone many a time this was true though i wish now id held my tongue id wanted to kill men wealthier than me more handsome than me men possessing beautiful women and women who rejected my advances id wanted to kill people who refused me service when drunk people who didnt smile back when i smiled at them people who were paged in hotels and made movies in hollywood and owned ranches and castles and their own private armies so my answer was accurate many a time cafferty was nodding hed almost finished the whisky i thought something must be about to happen some act of violence and i was prepared for itor thought i was the robertsons looked ready either to explode or implode tam had his hands on the edge of the table ready to jump to his feet and then the door opened it was someone from the kitchens bringing us up the sandwiches wed ordered earlier smoked salmon and roast beef the man waited to be paid go on tam said cafferty quietly youre the one with the luck tonight pay the man grudgingly tam counted out some notes and handed them over and a tip said cafferty another note was handed over the waiter left the room a very nice gesture said cafferty it was his turn to deal how much are you down now black aengus im not bad i said i asked how much about forty id been a hundred down at one stage but two decent hands had repaired some of the damage plusthere could be no doubt about itthe best card players around the table by which i mean the robertson brothers were finding it hard to concentrate the room was not warm but there was sweat trickling down from ecks sideburns he kept rubbing the sweat away youre letting them cheat you out of forty cafferty said conversationally tam robertson leapt to his feet his chair tipping over behind him ive heard just about enough but eck righted the chair and pulled him down into it cafferty had finished dealing and was studying his cards as though oblivious to the whole scene the butcher got up suddenly announcing that he was going to be sick he walked quickly out of the room he wont be back cafferty announced i said something lame to the effect that i was thinking of an early night myself when cafferty turned to me he looked and sounded unlike any of his many personalities the many id encountered so far you wouldnt know an early night if it kicked you in the cunt he had started to gather up the cards for a redeal i could feel blood tingling in my cheeks hed spoken with something close to revulsion i told myself that hed just drunk too much people often said thingetc look at me i was one to be upset about the nasty things drunks could say he dealt the hand again when it came time for him to make his initial bet he threw a note into the pot then laid his cards face down on the table he reached into the waistband of his trousers hed worn a suit throughout he always looks smart he says the police are warier of picking up people wearing good clothes and certainly more wary about punching or kicking them they dont like to see good material ruined he told me canny scots you see now when he withdrew his hand from the waistband it was holding a pistol of some kind the robertsons started to object while i just stared at the gun id seen guns before but never this close and in this kind of situation suddenly the vodka which had been having little or no effect all night swam through me like waste through a sewerpipe i thought i was going to be sick but swallowed it down i even thought i might pass out and all the time cafferty was talking calm as you like about how tam had been cheating him and where was the money and youve been cheating black aengus too he said i wanted to protest that this wasnt true but still thought i might be sick if i opened my mouth so i just shook my head after which i felt even dizzier you cant know the pain and frustration im feeling as i try to write this down candidly and exactly fourteen weeks have passed since that night but every night it comes back to me waking and sleeping theyre giving me drugs here and strictly no alcohol during the day i can walk in the grounds there are encounter groups where im supposed to talk my way out of my problem christ if it were only that easy the first thing my father did was get me out of the way i am tempted to say his way his answer was to send me on holiday mother chaperoned me around new england where an aunt has a house in bar harbor i tried talking to mother but didnt seem to make much sense she had that stupid sympathetic smile pasted onto her face i digress not that it matters back to the poker game youve perhaps guessed what happened next i felt caffertys hand on mine only this time he lifted my hand up in his then he placed the gun in my hand i can feel it now cold and hard half of me thought the gun was fake and he was just going to scare the robertsons the other half knew the gun was real but didnt think he would use it then i felt his fingers pushing mine until my index finger was around the trigger his hand now fully enclosed mine and aimed the gun he squeezed his finger against mine and there was an explosion in the room and wisps of acrid powder blood freckled us all it was warm for a moment then cold against my skin eck was leaning over his brother speaking to him the gun clattered onto the table though i didnt take it in at the time cafferty proceeded to wrap the gun in a polythene bag i know that any prints on it must be mine i flew up from the table panicking hysterical cafferty was seated still and looking pacified his calm had the opposite effect on me i threw the vodka bottle against the wall where it smashed dousing wallpaper and curtains in alcohol seeing an idea i grabbed a lighter from the table and ignited the vodka only now did cafferty get up he was swearing at me and tried to douse the flames but they were licking up the curtains out of our reach scudding across the fabric wallcovering on the ceiling he saw the fire was moving quicker than we could i think eck had already forsaken his brother and fled before i ran out of the room i took the stairs three at a time and burst into the kitchens demanding that all the gas be turned on if the central was going to burn let it take the evidence with it i must have looked crazy enough for the chef followed my instructions i think he was the same person who served us the sandwiches only hed changed jackets it was late and he was alone in the kitchen writing something down in a book i told him to get out he left by the back way and i followed keeping my head low as i jogged back to blair street i think thats everything it doesnt feel any better for the writing down theres no exorcism or catharsis maybe there never will be you see theyve found the body more than that they know the man was shot i dont see how the devil they can know but they do maybe someone told them eck robertson would have reason to hes the only one who could tell its all my fault i know that cafferty started swearing at me because id mucked things up by setting fire to the room if i hadnt he would have seen to it that tam robertsons body disappeared in the usual way no one would have known we would have gotten away with murder but getting away with it isnt always getting away with it the corpse haunts me last night i dreamt it came back to me charred smouldering pointing a finger towards me and squeezing the trigger oh christ this is agony and they think im here for alcoholism i still havent told father all of it not yet he knows though he knows i was there but hes not saying anything sometimes i wish hed hit me more as a child and not let me misbehave he liked me to misbehave well make a man of you he used to say father i am made that was that rebus sat back in his chair and stared at the ceiling eddie ringan knew a little more than hed been telling hed been a witness at the card game and could place cafferty there no wonder hed been running scared cafferty probably hadnt known him back then hadnt paid attention to a waiter who was moonlighting anyway and not one of the regular staff rebus rubbed his eyes and returned to the journal there was a bit about a holiday then about the hospital again and then a few months later i saw cafferty today sunday not my idea he must have been following me he caught up on blackford hill id come through the hermitage climbing the steep face of the hill he must have thought i was trying to get away from him he pulled on my arm swinging me around i think i nearly jumped out of my skin he told me i had to keep my nose clean from now on he said it was a good idea going into that hospital i think he was trying to let me know that he knew everything id been up to i think i know what hes doing hes biding his time watching me as i take instructions in the business waiting for the day when i take over from my father i think he wants it all body and soul yes body and soul there was a lot more the style and substance of the entries changing as aengus too tried to change hed found it hard work the public face the charity face masked a yearning for some of that wild past rebus flipped to the final entry undated you know dear friend or foe i liked the feel of that gun in my hand and when cafferty put my finger on the triggehe did squeeze it im certain of that but supposing he hadnt would i still have fired with his strong unfailing hand on mine after all these years all the bad dreams the cold sweats and sudden surges something has happened the case is being reopened ive spoken with cafferty who tells me not to worry he says i should concentrate my energies on the brewery he seems to know more about our finances than i do father is talking of retiring next year the business will be all mine and all caffertys ive seen him at charity functions accompanied by mo and at various public occasions weve talked but never since that night have we enjoyed one anothers company i lost my usefulness that night perhaps i just showed my weakness by smashing the bottle or perhaps that had been the plan all along he always gives me a wink when he sees me but then he winks at just about everyone but when he winks at me when he closes his eye for that second its as if hes taking aim setting me in his sights christ is there no end in sight if i werent so scared id be praying the police would find me but cafferty wont let them he never will let them never rebus closed the journal his heart was beating fast hands trembling you poor bugger aengus when you read wed got the gun you thought wed fingerprint it and then wed come looking for you but instead cafferty had blown his trump trying to incriminate rebus just to keep him out of the picture for a while and the irony of it all was with the prints messed up black aengus was in the clearin the clear for a murder he didnt really commit again though it was all uncorroborated rebus imagined the field day the defence would have if he walked into the royal mile courts with nothing more than the journal of a recovering dipsomaniac the edinburgh law courts were notoriously tough at the best of times with the sort of advocate cafferty could afford it was a definite loser from the word go yet rebus knew he had to do something about cafferty the man deserved punishment a million punishments let the punishment fit the crime he thought but he shook the notion away no more guns he didnt go home not right away he walked out of the nowempty office and got into his car and sat there in the car park the key was in the ignition but he let it sit there his hands rested lightly on the steeringwheel after almost an hour he started the engine mostly because he was getting cold he didnt go anywhere except inside his head and slowly but surely with backtracking and rerouting along the way the idea came to him let the punishment fit the crime yes but not caffertys punishment no not caffertys andrew mcphails rebus didnt go near st leonards for a couple of days though he did get a message from farmer watson that broderick gibson was considering bringing an action against him for harrying his son hes been harrying himself for years was rebuss only comment but he was waiting in his car when they released andy steele the fisherman cum private eye blinked into the sun rebus sounded his horn and steele approached warily rebus wound down his window oh its you said steele there was disappointment in his voice rebus had said hed see what he could do for the young man then had left him to languish never coming near they let you out then said rebus aye on bail thats because someone put up the money for you steele nodded then started you me said rebus now get in ive got a job for you what sort of job get in and ill tell you there was a bit more life in steele as he walked round to the passenger side and opened the door you want to be a private eye stated rebus fair enough ive got a job for you steele seemed unable to take it in for a moment then cleared his head by shaking it briskly rubbing his hands through his hair great he said so long as its not against the law oh its nothing illicit all i want you to do is talk to a few folk theyre good listeners too shouldnt be any problem what am i going to tell them rebus started the car that theres a contract out on a certain individual a contract come on andy youve seen the films a contract a contract andy steele mouthed as rebus pulled into the traffic there was still no sign of andrew mcphail alex maclean rebus discovered was back in circulation though not yet back at work when rebus visited mrs mackenzie she said she hadnt seen a man with bandaged hands and face hanging around but one of the neighbours had well it didnt matter mcphail wouldnt be coming back here again he would probably write or telephone with a forwarding address asking his landlady to send on his stuff rebus looked towards the school as he got back into his car the children were in their own little worland safe he did a lot of driving visiting schools and playparks he knew mcphail must be sleeping rough maybe he was well away from edinburgh by now rebus had a vision of him climbing up onto a coal train headed slowly south a hand reached out and helped mcphail into the wagon it was deek torrance the opening credits began to roll it didnt matter if he couldnt find mcphail it would just be a nice touch a nicely cruel touch wester hailes was a good place to get lost meaning it was an easy place to get lost sited to the far west of the city visible from the bypass which gave edinburgh such a wide berth wester hailes was somewhere the city put people so it could forget about them the architecture was unenthusiastic the walls of the flatblocks finished off with damp and cracks people might leave wester hailes or stay there all their lives surrounded by roads and industrial estates and empty green spaces it had never before struck rebus that it would make a good hiding place you could walk the streets or the kingsknowe golf course or the roads around sighthill and as long as you didnt look out of place you would be safe there were places you could sleep without being discovered and if you were of a mind there was a school a school and quite a few playparks this was where on the second day he found andrew mcphail never mind watching the bus and railway stations rebus had known where to look he followed mcphail for threequarters of an hour at first in the car and then when mcphail took a pedestrian shortcut awkwardly on foot mcphail kept moving his gait brisk a man out for a walk that was all a bit shabby maybe but these days with unemployment what it was you lost the will to shave every morning didnt you mcphail was careful not to draw attention to himself he didnt pause to stare at any children he saw he just smiled towards them and went on his way when rebus had seen enough he gained quickly and tapped him on the shoulder he might as well have used a cattleprod jesus its you mcphails hand went to his chest you nearly gave me a heart attack that would have saved alex maclean a job how is he minor burns hes up and about and on the warpath christs sake were talking about something that happened years ago and its not going to happen again no and it was an accident you ended up living across from a primary school yes and i was wrong to think id find you somewhere near a school or a playgroun mcphail opened his mouth then closed it again he shook his head no you werent wrong i still like kids but i neveid never do anything to them i wont even speak to them these days he looked up at rebus im flying inspector everyone wanted a second chance michael mcphail even black aengus sometimes rebus could help tell you what he said there are programmes for past offenders you could go into one of them not in edinburgh somewhere else you could sign on for social security and look for a job mcphail looked ready to say something i know it takes money a wee bit of cash to get you on your feet but i can help with that too mcphail blinked one eye staying half closed why because i want to and afterwards youll be left alone i promise i wont tell anyone where you are or whats happened to you is it a deal mcphail thought about itfor two seconds a deal he said fine then rebus put his hand on mcphails shoulder again drawing him a little closer theres just one small thing id like you to do for me firs it had been quiet in the social club and chick muir was thinking of heading home when the young chap at the bar asked if he could buy him a drink chick readily agreed i dont like drinking on my own the young man explained who can blame you said chick agreeably handing his empty glass to the barman not from round here aberdeen said the young man a long way from home is it still like dallas up there chick meant the oilboom which had actually disappeared almost as quickly as it had begun except in the mythology of those people not living in aberdeen maybe it is said the young man but that didnt stop them sacking me sorry to hear it chick really was too hed been hoping the young man was off the oil rigs with cash to burn he was planning to tap him for a tenner but now shrugged away the idea im andy steele by the way chick muir chick placed his cigarette in his mouth so he could shake andy steeles hand the grip was like a rubbishcrusher the money didnt bring much luck to aberdeen you know steele was reminiscing just a load of sharks and gangsters ill believe it muir was already halfway through his drink he wished hed been drinking a whisky instead of the halfpint when hed been asked about another it didnt look good exchanging a halfpint for a nip so he was stuck with a half thats mostly why im here said steele what gangsters muir sounded amused in a way im visiting a friend too but i thought while i was here i might pick up a few bob hows that chick was beginning to feel uncomfortable but also distinctly curious steele dropped his voice though they were alone at the bar theres word going around aberdeen that someones out to get a certain individual in edinburgh the barman had turned on the tape machine behind the bar the lowceilinged room was promptly filled with a folk duet theyd played the club last week and the barman had made a tape of them it sounded worse now than it had then in the name of auld nick turn that down chick didnt have a loud voice but no one could say it lacked authority the barman turned the sound down a bit and when chick still glared at him turned it even lower what was that he asked andy steele andy steele who had been enjoying his drink put down the glass and told chick muir again and a little while later mission accomplished he bought chick a final drink and then left chick muir didnt touch this fresh half pint he stared past it at his own reflection in the mirror behind the row of optics then he made a few phone calls again roaring at the barman to turn that shite off the third call he made was to st leonards where he was informed a bit too lightheartedly he thought that inspector rebus had been suspended from duty pending enquiries he tried rebus at his flat but no joy there either ach well it wasnt so important what mattered was that hed talked to the big man now the big man owed him and that was quite enough for the penniless chick muir to be going on with andy steele gave the same performance in a meanly lit pub and a betting shop and that evening was at powderhall for the greyhound racing he recited to himself the description rebus had given him and eventually spotted the man tucking into a meal of potato crisps at a windowseat in the bar are you shuggie oliphant he asked thats me said the huge thirtyish man he was poking a finger into the farthest corner of the crispbag in search of salt somebody told me you might be interested in a bit of information ive got oliphant still hadnt looked at him the bag emptied he folded it into a thin strip then tied it in a knot and placed it on the table there were four other granny knots just like it in a row you dont get paid till i do oliphant informed him sucking on a greasy finger and smacking his lips andy steele sat down across from him thats okay by me he said on sunday morning rebus waited at the top of a blustery calton hill he walked around the observatory as the other sunday strollers were doing his leg was definitely improving people were pointing out distant landmarks broken clouds were moving rapidly over a pale blue sky nowhere else in the world he reckoned had this geography of bumps and valleys and outcrops the volcanic plug beneath edinburgh castle had been the start of it too good a place not to build a fortress and the town had grown around it grown out as far as wester hailes and beyond the observatory was an odd building if functional the folly on the other hand was just that and served no function at all save as a thing to clamber over and a place to spray paint your name it was one side of a projected greek temple edinburgh after all being the athens of the north the alltooeccentric brain behind the scheme had run out of money after completion of this first side and there it stood a series of pillars on a plinth so tall kids had to stand on each others shoulders to climb aboard when rebus looked towards it he saw a woman there swinging her legs from the plinth and waving towards him it was siobhan clarke he walked over to her how long have you been here he called up not long wheres your stick i can manage fine without it this was true though by fine he meant that he could hobble along at a reasonable pace i see hibs got a result yesterday about time no sign of himself but siobhan pointed to the car park here he comes now a mini metro had climbed the road to the top of the hill and was squeezing into a space between two shinier larger cars give me a hand down said siobhan watch for my leg rebus complained but she felt almost weightless as he lifted her down thanks she said brian holmes had watched the performance before locking his car and coming towards them a regular baryshnikov he commented bless you said rebus so whats this all about sir siobhan asked why the secrecy theres nothing secret rebus said starting to walk about an inspector wanting to talk with two of his junior colleagues trusted junior colleagues siobhan caught holmes eye holmes shook his head he wants something from us as if she didnt know they leaned against a railing enjoying the view rebus doing most of the talking siobhan and holmes added occasional questions mostly rhetorical so this would be off our own bats of course rebus answered just two keen coppers with a little bit of initiative he had a question of his own will the lighting be difficult holmes shrugged ill ask jimmy hutton about that hes a professional photographer does calendars and that sort of thing its not going to be wee kittens or a highland glen replied rebus no sir said holmes and you think thisll work asked siobhan rebus shrugged lets wait and see we havent said well do it sir no said rebus turning away but you will off their own initiative then holmes and siobhan decided to spend monday evening doing a surveillance shift on operation moneybags without heating the room they crouched in was cold and damp and dark enough to attract the odd mouse holmes had set the camera up after taking advice from the calendar man hed even borrowed a special lens for the occasion telephoto and nightsighted he hadnt bothered with his walkman and his patsy cline tapes in the past thered always been more than enough to talk about with siobhan but tonight she didnt seem in the mood she kept gnawing on her top and bottom lips and got up every now and then to do stretching exercises dont you get stiff she asked him not me said holmes quietly ive been in training for thisyears of being a couch potato i thought you kept pretty fit he watched her bend forward and lay her arms down the length of one leg and you must be doublejointed not quite you shouldve seen me in my teens holmes grin was illuminated by the street lights diffuse orange glow down rover said siobhan there was a scuttling overhead a rat said holmes ever cornered one she shook her head they can jump like a tummel salmon my parents took me to the hydro dam when i was a kid at pitlochry she nodded so youve seen the salmon leaping she nodded again well said holmes imagine one of those with hair and fangs and a long thick tail id rather not she watched from the window do you think hell come i dont know john rebus isnt often wrong is that why everyone hates him holmes seemed a little surprised who hates him she shrugged people ive talked to at st leonardand other places they dont trust him he wouldnt have it any other way why not because hes thrawn he was remembering the first time rebus had used him in a case hed spent a cold frustrating evening watching for a dogfight that never took place he was hoping tonight would be better the rat was moving again to the back of the room now over by the door do you think hell come siobhan asked again hell come lass they both turned towards the shape in the doorway it was rebus you two he said blethering like sweetie wives i could have climbed those stairs in pit boots and youd not have heard me he came over to the window anything nothing sir rebus angled his watch towards the light i make it five to the display on siobhans digital watch was backlit ten to sir bloody watch muttered rebus not long now therell be some action by the top of the hour unless that daft aberdonians put the kibosh on it but the daft aberdonian wasnt so daft big ger cafferty paid for information even if it was information he already knew he tended to pay it was a cheap way of making sure everything got back to him for example even though hed already heard from two sources that the teuchters were planning to muscle in on him he still paid shug oliphant a few notes for his effort and oliphant who liked to keep his own sources sweet handed over ten quid to andy steele this representing twofifths of oliphants reward there you go he said cheers said andy steele genuinely pleased found anything you like oliphant was referring to the videotapes which surrounded them in the small rental shop which he operated the area behind the narrow counter was so small oliphant only just squeezed in there every time he moved he seemed to knock something off a shelf onto the floor where it remained since there was also no room for him to bend over ive got some bits and pieces under the counter he went on if youre interested no i dont want a video oliphant grinned unpleasantly im not sure the gentleman really believed your story oliphant told andy but ive heard the rumour a few times since so maybe theres something in it there is said andy steele rebus was right if you told a deaf man something on monday by tuesday it was in the evening paper theyve got a watch on his hangouts including the operation in gorgie oliphant looked mightily suspicious how do you know luck really i bumped into one of them i knew him in aberdeen he told me to get out if i didnt want to get mixed up in it but youre still here im on the mail train tomorrow morning so somethings happening tonight oliphant still sounded highly sceptical but then that was his way steele shrugged all i know is theyre keeping watch i think maybe they just want to talk oliphant considered running his fingers over a videobox there were two pubs last night got their windows smashed steele didnt blink pubs where the gentleman drank could be a connection steele shrugged could be if he were being honest hed have told how he acted as getaway driver while rebus himself tossed the large rocks through the glass one of the pubs had been the firth at tollcross the other the bowery at the bottom of easter road but instead he said loon called mcphail hes the one watching gorgie hes in charge oliphant nodded you know the way it works come back in a day or two therell be money if the gens on the nail but steele shook his head im off up to aberdeen so you are said oliphant tell you what he tore a sheet from a pad give me your address and ill send on the cash andy steele had fun inventing the address cafferty was playing snooker when he got the message he had a quarter share in an upmarket snooker hall and leisure complex in leith the intended market had been yuppies working class lads scraping their way up the greasy pole but the yuppies had vanished in a puff of smoke so now the complex was shifting cannily downmarket with video bingo happy hour an arcade full of electronic machines and plans for a bowling alley teenagers always seemed to have money in their pockets they would carve the bowling alley out of the littleused gymnasium the restaurant next to it and the aerobics room beyond that staying in business cafferty had found was all about remaining flexible if the wind changed you didnt try to steer in the opposite direction mooted future plans included a soul club and a s ballroom the latter complete with tea dances and blackout nights groping nights cafferty called them he knew he was crap at snooker but he liked the game his theory was fine it was the practice that was lacking vanity prevented him taking lessons and his renowned lack of patience would have dissuaded all but the most foolhardy from giving them on mos advice hed tried a few other sportstennis squash even skiing one time the only one hed enjoyed was golf he loved thwacking that ball all over the place problem was he didnt know when to hold back he was always overshooting if he hadnt split at least a couple of balls after nine holes he wasnt happy snooker suited him it had everything tactics ciggies booze and a few sidebets so here he was again in the hall overhead lights flooding the green tables dusk everywhere else quiet too therapeutic just the clack of the balls the occasional comment or joke a floorstomp with the cue to signal a worthy shot then jimmy the ear was coming towards him phone call from the house he told cafferty then he gave him oliphants message andrew mcphail trusted rebus about as far as he could toss a caber into a gale he knew he should be running for cover right now let the caber land where it might there were several ways it could go rebus might be setting up a meeting between mcphail and maclean well mcphail could prepare himself against this or it might be some other kind of ruse probably ending up with a beating and the clear message to get the fuck out of edinburgh or it could be straight aye if the spiritlevel was bent rebus had asked mcphail to deliver a message a letter hed even handed over the envelope the message was for a man called cafferty who would be leaving the taxi office on gorgie road around ten so whats the message never you mind rebus had said why me it cant come from me thats all you need to know just make sure its him and give him the envelope this stinks i cant make it any simpler well meet afterwards and fix up your new future the balls already rolling aye said mcphail but where the fucks the net yet here he was walking up gorgie road a bit cold threatening rain rebus had taken him to st leonards this afternoon let him shower and shave even provided some clean clothes which hed picked up from mrs mackenzies i dont want a tramp delivering my post hed explained ah the letter mcphail wasnt donnert hed torn the envelope open earlier this evening inside was a smaller brown envelope with some writing on the front no peeking now mcphail hed thought about opening it anyway it didnt feel like there was much inside a single sheet of paper but something stopped him a pale spark of hope the hope that everything was going to be all right he didnt have a watch but was a good judge of time it felt like ten oclock and here he was in front of the taxi office there were lights on inside and cabs ready and waiting outside their busiest shift would be starting soon the rides home after closing time the night air smelt like ten oclock diesel from the railway lines rain close by andrew mcphail waited he saw the headlights and when the cara jagswerved and mounted the pavement his first thought was drunk driver but the car braked smoothly stopping beside him almost pinning him to the wire fence the driver got out he was big a gust of wind flapped his long hair and mcphail saw that one ear was missing you mcphail he demanded the back door of the jag was opening slowly another man getting out he wasnt as big as the driver but he somehow seemed larger he was smiling unkindly the letter was in mcphails pocket cafferty he asked forcing the word from his lungs the smiling man blinked lazily in acknowledgement in mcphails other pocket was the broken neck of a whisky bottle hed found beside an overflowing bottle bank it wasnt much of a weapon but it was all he could afford even so he didnt rate his chances his bladder felt painfully full he reached for the letter the driver pinned his arms to his side and swung him around so he was face to face with cafferty who swung a kick into his groin the butt of a threesection snooker cue slipped expertly from caffertys coat sleeve into his hand as mcphail doubled over the cue caught him on the side of the jaw fracturing it dislodging teeth he fell further forwards and was rewarded with the cue on the back of his neck his whole body went numb now the driver was pulling his head up by the hair and cafferty was forcing his mouth open with the cue working it past his tongue and into his throat hold it there two of them a man and a woman running from across the street and holding open their ids police officers cafferty lifted both hands away raising them head high he had left the cue in mcphails mouth the driver released the battered man who remained upright on his knees shakily andrew mcphail started to pull the snooker cue out of his throat there were sirens close by as a police car approached its nothing officer cafferty was saying a misunderstanding some misunderstanding said the male police officer his sidekick slipped her hand into mcphails pocket she felt a broken bottle wrong pocket from the other pocket she produced the letter crumpled now she handed it to cafferty open this please sir she said cafferty stared at it is this a setup but he opened it anyway inside was a scrap of paper which he unfolded the note was unsigned he knew who it was from anyway rebus he spat that bastard rebus a few minutes later as cafferty and his driver were being taken away and the ambulance was arriving for andrew mcphail siobhan picked up the note which cafferty had dropped it said simply i hope they sell your skin for souvenirs she frowned and looked up at the surveillance window but couldnt see anyone there had she seen anything it would have been the outline of a man making the shape of a gun from his fist lining up the thumb so cafferty was in its sights and pulling the imaginary trigger bang nobody at st leonards believed holmes and siobhan were there that night simply out of an exaggerated sense of duty the more credible version had them meeting for a clandestine shag and just happening upon the beating lucky there was film in the surveillance camera and didnt the photos come out well with cafferty in custody they got the chance to take away his things and have yet another look at theincluding the infamous coded diary watson and lauderdale were poring over xeroxed sheets from it when there was a knock at the chief supers door come called watson john rebus walked in and looked around admiringly at the sudden floorspace i see you got your cabinets sir lauderdale pulled himself up straight what the hell are you doing here youre suspended from duty its all right frank said watson i asked inspector rebus to come in he turned the xeroxed pages towards rebus take a look it didnt take long the problem with the code in the past was that they hadnt known what to look for but now rebus had a more than fair idea he stabbed one entry there he said tub scs yes it means the butcher on south clerk street owes three thousand hes abbreviated butcher and written it backwards lauderdale looked disbelieving are you sure rebus shrugged put the experts at fettes onto it they should be able to find at least a few more latepayers thank you john said watson rebus turned smartly and left the room lauderdale stared at his superior i get the feeling he said somethings going on here i dont know about well frank said watson why should today be different from any other which as the saying went put ci lauderdales gas at a very low peep it was siobhan clarke who came up with the most important piece of information in the whole case it was a case now rebus didnt mind that the machine was in operation without him holmes and clarke reported back to him at the end of each day the codebreakers had been hard at work as a result of which detectives were talking to caffertys black book victims it would only take one or two of them in court and cafferty would be going down so far though no one was talking rebus had an idea of one person who given enough persuasion might then siobhan mentioned that caffertys company geronimo holdings held a seventynine per cent share in a large farm in the southwest borders not so very far from the coastline where the bodies had been washing up until recently a party was sent to the farm they found plenty for the forensic scientists to start working oespecially the pigsties the sties themselves were clean enough but there was an enclosed area of storage space above each ramshackle sty most of the farm had turned itself over to the latest in hightech agriculture but not the sties it was this which initially alerted the police above the pigsties in the dark enclosures strewn with rank straw there was a tangible reek of something unwholesome something putrid strips of cloth were found in one corner there lay a mans trouserbelt the area was photographed and picked over for its least congruous particles upstairs in the farmhouse meanwhile a man who claimed initially to be an agricultural labourer eventually admitted to being derek torrance better known as deek at the same time rebus was driving out to dalkeith to duncton terrace to be precise it was early evening and the kintoul family was at home mother father and son took up three sides of a folddown table in the kitchen the chippan was still smouldering and spitting on the greasy gas cooker the vinyl wallpaper was slick with condensation most of the food on the plates was disguised by brown sauce rebus could smell vinegar and washingup liquid rory kintoul excused himself and went with rebus into the living room kitchen and living room were connected by a serving hatch rebus wondered if wife and son would be listening at the hatch rebus sat in one fireside chair kintoul opposite him sorry if its a bad time rebus began there was a ritual to be followed after all what is it inspector youll have heard mr kintoul weve arrested morris cafferty hell be going away for quite a while rebus looked at the photos on the mantelpiece snapshots of gaptoothed kids nephews and nieces he smiled at them i just thought maybe it was time you got it off your chest he kept silent for a moment still examining the framed photos kintoul said nothing only said rebus i know youre a good man i mean a good man you put family first am i right kintoul nodded uncertainly your wife and son youd do anything for them same goes for your other family parents sisters brothers cousin rebus trailed off i know caffertys going away said kintoul and kintoul shrugged its like this said rebus we know just about all there is to know we just need a little corroboration that means testifying rebus nodded eddie ringan would be testifying too telling all he knew about the central hotel in return for a good word from the police come his own trial mr kintoul youve got to accept something youve got to accept that youve changed youre not the same man you were a year or two ago why did you do it rebus asked the way a friend would just curious kintoul wiped a smear of sauce from his chin it was a favour jim always needed favours so you drove the van yes i did his rounds but you were a lab technician kintoul smiled and i could earn more on the butchers round he shrugged again like you say inspector i put family first especially where moneys concerned go on how much do you know we know the van was used to dump the bodies nobody ever notices a butchers van except a poor constable in northeast fife he ended up with concussion that was after my time i was shot of it by then he waited till rebus nodded agreement then went on only when i wanted out cafferty didnt want me out he was putting pressure on thats how you got stabbed it was that bodyguard of his jimmy the ear he lost the head knifed me as i was getting out of the car crazy bastard kintoul glanced towards the servinghatch you know what cafferty did when i said i wanted to stop driving the van he offered jason a job driving for him jasons my son rebus nodded but why all this fuss cafferty could get a hundred guys to drive a van for him i thought you knew him inspector caffertys like that hes particular about his flesh hes off his head commented rebus how did you get sucked in in the first place i was still driving fulltime when cafferty won half the business from jimmy one evening one of caffertys men turned up all smarmy told me wed be taking a run to the coast early next morning via some farm in the borders you went to the farm so thats why there was straw in the van the colour was seeping from kintouls face like blood from a cut of meat oh aye there was something in the pigsties tied up in fertiliser bags stank to high heaven id been working in a butchers long enough to know it had been rotting in that sty for a good few weeks months even a corpse easy to tell isnt it i threw my guts up caffertys man said what a waste i shouldve done it into the trough kintoul paused he was still wiping at his chin though the sauce mark had long ago been erased cafferty liked the bodies to be rotten less chance of them washing ashore in any recognisable state christ i havent come to the worst part yet in the next room kintouls wife and son were speaking in undertones rebus was in no hurry and merely watched as kintoul got up to stare from his back window there was a patch of garden out there he could call his own it was small but it was his he came back and stood in front of the gas fire not looking at rebus i was there one day when he killed someone he said baldly then he screwed shut his eyes rebus was trying to control his own breathing this guy would make a gem of a witness killed them how still not pressing still the friend kintoul tipped his head back feeding tears back where they had come from how with his bare hands wed arrived late the van had broken down in the middle of nowhere it was about ten in the morning mist all around the farm like driving into brigadoon they were both wearing business suits thats what got me and they were up to their ankles in glaur rebus frowned not quite comprehending they were in the pigsty kintoul nodded theres a fenced run cafferty was in there with this man there were other people watching through the fence he swallowed i swear cafferty looked like he was enjoying it there with the mud lapping at him and the pigs squealing in their boxes wondering what the hell was happening and all the silent onlookers kintoul tried to shake the memory away probably a daily event they were fighting the other man looked like hed been roughed up beforehand nobodyd call it a fair fight and eventually after caffertyd beaten the living shite out of him he grabbed him by the neck and forced him down into the muck he stood on the mans back balancing there and holding the face down with his hands he looked like it was nothing new then the man stopped strugglin rebus and kintoul were silent blood pounding through them both trying to cope with the vision of an early morning pigstafterwards said kintoul his voice lower than ever he beamed at us like it was his coronation then in complete grimacing silence he started to weep rebus was visiting the infirmary so often he was considering taking out a season ticket but he hadnt expected to see flower there checking in the psychiatric sections down the hall ha ha said flower what are you doing here anyway i could ask you the same question i live here what about you i came to ask some questions of andrew mcphail flower nodded did nobody tell you his jaws wired shut flower twitched producing a good wide grin from rebus how come its your business anyway it involves cafferty flower said oh aye so it does id forgotten looks like weve got him this time looks like it but you never know with cafferty rebus stared unblinking at flower as he spoke the reason hes lasted so long is hes clever hes clever and hes got the best lawyers plus hes got people scared of him and hes got people in his pockemaybe even a copper or three flower had stared out the gaze now he blinked you think i was in caffertys pocket rebus had been pondering this he had cafferty marked down for the attack on michael and the scam with the gun as for the clumsy hitandrun attempt that was so amateurish he guessed at broderick gibson for its architect quite simply cafferty would have used better men hed been silent long enough so he shook his head i dont think youre that smart cafferty likes smart people but i do think you had a word with the inland revenue about me i dont know what youre talking about rebus grinned i do like a cliche then he walked on down the hall andrew mcphail was easy to find you just looked for the broken face he was wired up like somebodys first attempt at a junction box rebus thought he could see where theyd used two wires where one would have sufficed but then he was no doctor mcphail had his eyes closed hello there said rebus the eyes opened there was anger there but rebus could cope with it he held up a hand no he said dont bother to thank me then he smiled its all set up for when they let you out up north for rehabilitation maybe a job and bracing coastal walks man i envy you he looked around the ward every bed had a body in it the nurses looked like they could use a holiday or at the very least a gin and lime with some dryroast peanuts i said id leave you alone rebus went on and i keep my word but a piece of advice he rested his hands on the edge of the bed and leaned towards mcphail caffertys the biggest villain in town youre probably the only bugger in edinburgh who didnt know that now his men know a guy called mcphail set their boss up so dont ever think of coming back will you mcphail still glared at him good said rebus he straightened up turned and walked away then paused and turned oh he said and i meant to say something he returned to the bed and stood at its foot where charts showed mcphails temperature and medicaments rebus waited till mcphails wet eyes were on his then he smiled sympathetically again sorry he said this time when he turned he kept on walking andy steele had been the necessary gobetween it was too dangerous for rebus to put the story out firsthand the source of the tale might have got back to cafferty and that would have ruined everything mcphail hadnt been necessary but hed been useful rebus explained the ruse twice to andy steele and even then the young fisherman didnt seem to take it all in he had the look of a man with a dozen unaskable questions so what are you going to do now rebus asked hed been hoping in fact that steele might already have left for home oh im applying for a grant said steele you mean like university but steele hooted not likely its one of those schemes to get the unemployed into business oh aye steele nodded im eligible so whats the business a detective agency of course where exactly edinburgh ive made more money since i came here than i made in six months in aberdeen you cannot be serious said rebus but andy steele was he had one last meeting planned and wasnt looking forward to it he walked from st leonards to the university library at george square the indifferent security man on the door glanced at his id and nodded him towards the front desk where nell stapleton tall and broadshouldered was taking returned books from a duffelcoated student she caught his eye and looked surprised pleased at first but as she went through the books rebus saw her mind wasnt wholly on the job at last she came over to him hello john nell what brings you here can we have a word she checked with the other assistant that it was okay to take a fiveminute break they walked as far as a booklined corridor brian tells me youve closed the case the one he was so worried about rebus nodded thats great news thanks for your help rebus shrugged she tilted her head slightly is something the matter im not sure said rebus do you want to tell me me rebus nodded again i dont understand youve lived with a policeman nell you know we deal in motives sometimes there isnt much else to go on ive been thinking about motives recently he shut up as a female student pulled open a door came out into the corridor smiled briefly at nell and went on her way nell watched her go rebus thought she would like to swop bodies for a few minutes motives she said she was leaning against the wall but rebus got no notion of calmness from her stance remember he said that night in the hospital the night brian was attacked you said something about an argument and him going off to the heartbreak cafe she nodded thats right we met that night to talk over a drink but we argued i dont see only ive been thinking about the motive behind the attack there were too many at first but ive narrowed them down theyre all motives youd have nell what you told me you were scared for him scared because he was scared and he was scared because he was poking into something that could nail big ger cafferty wouldnt it be better if there was another body on the case someone else to attract the fire me in other words so you got me involved now wait a minute but rebus held his hand up and closed his eyes begging silence then he said there was dc clarke they were getting along so famously together jealousy maybe always a good motive i dont believe this rebus ignored her and of course the simplest motive the two of you had been rowing about whether or not to have kids that and the fact that he was overworking not paying you enough attention did he tell you that rebus did not sound unkind you told me yourself youd had a row that evening you knew where he was headedsame place as always so why not wait near his car and brain him when he came out a nice simple revenge rebus paused how many motives does that make ive lost count enough to be going on with eh i dont believe this tears were rising into her eyes every time she blinked more appeared she ran a thumb and forefinger down her nose clearing it breathing in noisily what are you going to do she asked at last im going to lend you a hankie said rebus i dont want your fucking hankie rebus put a finger to his lips this is a library remember she sniffed and wiped away tears nell he said quietly i dont want you to say anything i dont want to know i just want you to know all right you think youre so fucking smart he shrugged the offer of a hankie still stands get stuffed do you really want brian to leave the force but she was walking away from him head held high shoulders swinging just a little exaggeratedly he watched her go behind the desk where her coworker saw something was wrong and put a comforting arm around her rebus examined the shelves of books in front of him in the corridor but saw nothing to delay his leavetaking he sat on a bench in the meadows the back of the library rising up behind him he had his hands in his pockets as he watched a hastily arranged game of football eight men against seven theyd come over to him and asked if he fancied making up the numbers you must be desperate hed said shaking his head the goalposts comprised one orange and white traffic cone one pile of coats one pile of folders and books and a branch stuck in the ground rebus glanced at his watch more often than necessary no one on the field was worrying too much about the time taken to play the first half two of the players looked like brothers though they played on opposing sides mickey had left the flat that morning taking the photo of their dad and uncle jimmy with him to remind me hed said a woman in a burberry trenchcoat sat down on the bench beside him are they any good she asked theyd give hibs a run for their money how good does that make them she asked rebus turned towards dr patience aitken and smiled reaching out to take her hand in his what kept you so long he asked just the usual she said work i tried phoning you so often put my mind at rest then she said how she moved closer tell me im not just a number in your little black boo the end
