anne perry paragon walk one inspector pitt stared down at the girl and an overwhelming sense of loss soaked through him he had never known her in life but he knew and treasured all the things that now she had lost she was slight with fair brown hair a childish seventeen lying on the white morgue table she looked brittle enough to have snapped if he had touched her there were bruises on her arms where she had fought she was expensively dressed in lavender silk and there was a gold and pearl chain around her throatthings he could never have afforded they were pretty trivial enough in the face of death and yet he would like to have been able to give such things to charlotte thoughts of charlotte safe and warm at home brought a sickness tightening in his stomach had some man loved this girl as he loved charlotte was there someone right now for whom everything clean and bright and gentle had gone all laughter snatched away with the breaking of this fragile body he forced himself to look at her again but his eyes avoided the wound in her chest the stream of blood now congealed and thick the white face was expressionless all surprize or horror ironed out of it it was a little pinched she had lived in paragon walk very rich and very fashionable and no doubt also idle he had nothing in common with her he had worked ever since leaving the estate that had employed his father possessing nothing but a cardboard box with a comb and a change of shirt and an education shared with the son of the great house he had seen the poverty and the despair that teemed just behind the elegant streets and squares of london things this girl had never dreamed of he pulled a face as he remembered with a twist of humor how horrified charlotte had been when he had first described them to her when he was merely the policeman investigating the cater street murders and she a daughter of the ellison house her parents had been appalled even to have him in the establishment let alone to address him socially it had taken courage for charlotte to marry him and at the thought of it the warmth burst up inside him again and his fingers clenched on the edge of the table he looked down at the girls face again furious at the waste the wealth of experience she would never know the chances gone he turned away last night after dark the constable beside him said glumly ugly business do you know paragon walk sir very igh class neighborhood that most of it is around there yes pitt said absently of course he knew it it was part of his district he did not add that he knew paragon walk especially because charlottes sister had her town house there and so it had remained in his mind as charlotte had married socially beneath her so emily had married above and was now lady ashworth not the sort of thing youd expect the constable went on not in a place like that he made a slight click of disapproval with his tongue i dont know what things is coming to what with general gordon killed by that there dervish or whatever in january and now we got rapists loose in a place like paragon walk shockin i call it poor young girl like that looks as innocent as a lamb dont she he stared down at her mournfully pitt turned round did you say raped yes sir didnt they tell you that at the station no forbes they did not pitt was sharper than he meant to be to cover the new misery they just said murder oh well shes been murdered too forbes added reasonably poor creature he sniffed i suppose youll be wanting to go to paragon walk now its morning like and talk to all them people yes pitt agreed turning to leave there was nothing more he could do here the means of death was obvious a long sharpbladed knife at least an inch broad there was only one wound which had to have been fatal right forbes followed him up the steps his heavy feet loud on the stone outside pitt gulped at the summer air the trees were in full leaf and already at eight oclock it was warm a hansom cab clopped by at the end of the road and an errand boy whistled about his business well walk pitt said striding out coat flapping hat jammed on the top of his head forbes was obliged to trot to keep up with him and long before they were at paragon walk the constable was distressingly out of breath and wishing fervently his duty had landed him with anybody but pitt paragon walk was a regency road of great elegance facing an open park with flowerbeds and ornamental trees it curved gently for about a thousand yards this morning it looked white and silent in the sunlight and there was not even a footman or a gardeners boy to be seen word of the tragedy would have spread of course there would be huddles in kitchens and pantries and embarrassed platitudes over the breakfast tables upstairs fanny nash forbes said catching his breath for the first time as pitt stopped pardon fanny nash sir forbes repeated that was er name oh yes the sense of loss returned for a moment this time yesterday she would have been alive behind one of those classic windows probably deciding what to wear telling her maid what to lay out for her planning her day whom to call on what gossip to tell what secrets to keep it was the beginning of the london season what dreams had crowded through her mind such a little while ago number four forbes prompted at his elbow inwardly pitt cursed forbes for his practicality though he knew that was unfair this was a foreign world to forbes stranger than the back streets of paris or bordeaux would have been he was used to women in plain stuff dresses who worked from waking to sleeping large families living in a few overfurnished rooms with the smell of cooking everywhere and the intimate usage of faults and pleasures he could not think of these people as the same under their silks and their rigid stylized manners without the discipline of work they had invented the discipline of etiquette and it had become just as ruthless a master but forbes could not be expected to understand that as a policeman pitt knew it was customary for him to present himself at the tradesmans entrance but he would not now begin something he had refused all his life the footman who came to the front door was grim and stifffaced he stared at pitt with unaffected dislike although the superciliousness of the look was somewhat spoiled by the fact that pitt was several inches taller inspector pitt of the police pitt said soberly may i speak with mr and mrs nash he assumed assent and was about to go in but the footman stood his ground mr nash is not at home i will see if mrs nash will receive you he said with distaste then backed half a step you may wait in the hall pitt looked around him the house was larger than it had appeared from outside he could see a wide stairway with landings leading from it on either side and there were half a dozen doors in the hall he had learned something of art from working on the recovery of stolen goods and he judged the pictures on the walls to be of considerable value if too stylized for his own taste he preferred the modern more impressionistic school with blurred lines sky and water merging in a haze of light but there was one portrait after the manner of burnejones that caught his attention not for its artist but for its subject a woman of exceptional beautyproud sensuous and dazzling cor forbes let out his breath in amazement and pitt realized he had not been inside a house such as this before except perhaps in the servants hall he was afraid forbess gaucheness would embarrass them both and perhaps even handicap his questioning forbes why dont you go and see what you can learn from the servants he suggested perhaps a footman or a maid was out people dont realize how much they notice forbes was torn part of him wanted to stay and examine this new world not to be shut out of anything but a larger part wanted to escape to the more familiar and do something he was confident in his hesitation was brief and came to a natural end right sir yes ill do that might try some of the other houses too like you say never know what theyve seen till you try like when the footman returned he conducted pitt into the morning room and left him it was five minutes before jessamyn nash appeared pitt knew her immediately she was the woman from the portrait in the hall with those wide direct eyes that mouth that radiant hair thick and soft as summer fields she was dressed in black now but it did nothing to dim her brilliance she stood very straight her chin high good morning mr pitt what is it you wish to ask me good morning maam im sorry to have to disturb you in such tragic circumstances i appreciate the necessity you do not need to explain she walked across the room with exquisite grace she did not sit nor did she invite him to do so naturally you must discover what happened to fanny poor child her face froze for just an instant stiff she was only a child you know very innocent veryyoung it was the same impression he had had extreme youth im sorry he said quietly thank you he had no idea from her voice whether she knew he meant it or if she took it as a simple courtesy the automatic thing to say he would like to have assured her but then she would not care about the feelings of a policeman tell me what happened he looked at her back as she stood at the window she was slender shoulders delicately soft under the silk her voice when it came was expressionless as though she were repeating something rehearsed i was at home yesterday evening fanny lived here with my husband and myself she was my husbands half sister but i presume you know that she was only seventeen she was engaged to marry algernon burnon but that was not to be for three years at least when she became twenty pitt did not interrupt he seldom interrupted the slightest remarks that seemed irrelevant at the time could turn out to mean something betraying a feeling if nothing else and he wanted to know all he could about fanny nash he wanted to know how other people had seen her what she had meant to them that may seem a long engagement jessamyn was saying but fanny was very young she grew up alone you see my fatherinlaw married a second time fanny iswastwenty years younger than my husband she seemed forever a child not that she was simple she hesitated and he noticed that her long fingers were fiddling with a china figurine from the table twisting it around and around just she fumbled for the word ingenuousinnocent and she was living here with you and your husband until her marriage yes why was that she looked round at him in surprize her blue eyes were very cool and there were no tears in them her mother is dead naturally we offered her a home she gave a tiny icy smile young girls of good family do not live alone mrim sorryi forget your name pitt maam he said with equal chill he was ruffled surprised that he was still capable of feeling slighted after all these years he refused to show it he smiled within himself charlotte would have been furious her tongue would have spoken as quickly as the words came to her mind i thought she might have remained with her father something of his humor must have softened his face she mistook it for a smirk the color rose in her exquisite cheeks she preferred to live with us she said tartly naturally a girl does not wish to enter the season without a suitable lady preferably of her own family to advise and accompany her i was happy to do so are you sure this is relevant mrpitt are you not merely indulging your curiosity i appreciate our way of life is probably quite unknown to you an acid reply came to his mind but anger was irrevocable and he could not yet afford to commit himself to her enmity he pulled a face perhaps it has nothing to do with it please continue with your account of yesterday evening she took a breath to speak then apparently changed her mind she crossed over to the mantel shelf piled with photographs and began again in the same flat voice she had spent a perfectly usual day she had no household affairs to attend to of coursei do all that she wrote letters in the morning consulted her diary and kept an appointment with her dressmaker she lunched here at home and then in the afternoon she took the carriage and went calling she did tell me upon whom but i forget it is always the same sort of people and as long as one remembers oneself it really hardly matters i dare say you can find out from the coachman if you wish we dined at home lady pomeroy called a most tiresome person but a family obligationyou wouldnt understand pitt controlled his face and regarded her with continued polite interest fanny left early she went on she has very little social ability as yet sometimes i think she is too young for a season i have tried to teach her but she is very artless she seems to lack any natural ability to invent even the simplest prevarication is a trial to her she went on some small errand a book for lady cumminggould at least that is what she said and you do not think it was so he inquired a slight flicker crossed her face but pitt did not understand it charlotte might have interpreted it for him but she was not here to ask i should think it was precisely so jessamyn replied as i have tried to explain to you mrer she waved her hand irritably poor fanny had no art to deceive she was a guileless as a child pitt had seldom found children guileless tactless perhapsbut most he could remember were possessed of the natural cunning of a stoat and the toughness in a bargain of a moneylender although certainly some were blessed with the blandest of countenances it was the third time jessamyn had referred to fannys immaturity well i can ask lady cumminggould he replied with what he hoped was a smile as guileless as fannys she turned away from him sharply lifting one slender shoulder as if his face had somehow reminded her who he was and that he must be recalled to his proper position lady pomeroy had gone and i was alone when her voice wavered and for the first time she seemed to lose her composure when fanny came back she made an effort not to gulp and failed she was obliged to fumble for a handkerchief and the clumsiness of it brought her back fanny came in and collapsed in my arms i dont know how the poor child had had the strength to come so far it was amazing she died but a moment afterward i am sorry she looked at him her face devoid of expression almost as if she were asleep then she moved one hand to brush at her heavy taffeta skirt perhaps in memory of the blood on her the night before did she speak at all he asked quietly anything no mr pitt she was nearly dead by the time she got so far he turned slightly to look at the french doors she came in through there it was the only possible way without having passed the footman and yet it seemed natural to ask she shivered minutely yes he walked over toward them and looked out the lawn was small a mere patch surrounded by laurel bushes and a herbaceous walk beyond there was a wall between this garden and the next no doubt by the time he had closed this case he would know every view and corner of all these housesunless there was some pathetic easy answer but none presented itself yet he turned back to her is there any way your garden connects with the others along the walk a gate or door in that wall her face looked blank yes but it is hardly the way she would choose to come she was at lady cumminggoulds he must send forbes to all the gardens to see if there was any sign of blood a wound such as that must have left some stain and there might even be broken plants or footprints in gravel or grass where does lady cumminggould live he asked with lord and lady ashworth she replied she is an aunt i believe and is visiting for the season with lord and lady ashworthso fanny nash had been to emilys house the night she was murdered memories came rushing back of charlotte and emily as he had first known them in cater street when he was investigating the hangman murders everyone had been afraid looking with new eyes at friends even at family suspicions had been born that could otherwise have lain silent all life long old relationships had faltered and broken under the weight now violence and obscene and ugly secrets were close again perhaps inside the very house all the nightmares would return the cold questions one was afraid even to think and yet could not shut out is there access between all the gardens he asked carefully forcing the fog and terror of cater street from his mind might she have returned that way it was a pleasant summer evening she looked at him with light surprize i hardly think it likely mr pitt she was wearing a dinner dress not pantaloons she went and returned by the road she must have been accosted by some lunatic there a ridiculous thought flashed through his mind to ask her how many lunatics lived in paragon walk but perhaps she would not know there had been coachmen lounging around at one end waiting for their masters and mistresses to leave a party and a constable on the beat at the other he eased his weight from one foot to the other and stood a little straighten then i had best go and see lady cumminggould thank you mrs nash i hope we will be able to clear up the matter quickly and not need to distress you for long i hope so she agreed with formal coolness good day at the ashworth house he was shown into the withdrawing room by a butler whose face mirrored his social dilemma here was a person who admitted to being of the police and therefore undesirable and should not be allowed to forget he was here on sufferance only a most unpleasant necessity due to the recent tragedy yet on the other hand he was quite extraordinarily also lady ashworths brotherinlaw which is what comes of marrying beneath one in the end the butler settled for a pained civility and withdrew to fetch lord ashworth pitt was too entertained by the mans predicament to be annoyed but when the door opened it was not george but emily herself who came in he had forgotten how charming she could be and at the same time how utterly different from charlotte she was fair and slight dressed at the height of fashion and expense where charlotte was disastrously forthright emily was far too practical to speak without thinking and could be exquisitely devious when she chose in a good cause of course and she usually considered society to be an excellent cause she could lie without a tremor she came in now and closed the door behind her looking straight at him hello thomas she said wanly you must be here about poor fanny i didnt dream we should have the good fortune that it should be you to investigate it ive been trying to think if i knew anything that would be of help as we did in callander square her voice lifted for a moment charlotte and i were rather clever there then her tone dropped again and her face took on a pinched unhappy look but that was different we didnt know the people to start with and the ones who were dead were dead before we ever knew of them when you didnt know people alive it doesnt hurt the same way she sighed please sit down thomas you tower there sort of flapping cant you do up your coat or something i must speak to charlotte she lets you come out without she looked him up and down and gave up the whole idea pitt ran his hands through his hair and made it worse did you know fanny nash well he asked sitting on the sofa and seeming to spread over it all coattails and arms no and im ashamed to say it now but i didnt especially like her either she made an apologetic little face she was ratherdull jessamyns enormous fun at least half of me cant bear her and im constantly diverted by thinking what i might do next to annoy her he smiled there were so many echoes of charlotte in her that he could not help warming to her but fanny was too young he finished the sentence for her too naive quite she was almost insipid then her face changed filling with pity and embarrassment because she had momentarily forgotten death and the manner of it thomas she was the last kind of creature in the world to invite such an abominable thing whoever did it must be quite insane you must catch him for fannys sakeand for everyone elses all sorts of answers ran through his mind reassurance about strangers and vagrants long gone now and they all died on his tongue it was quite possible that the murderer was someone who lived or worked here in paragon walk neither the constable on duty at one end nor the servants waiting at the other had seen anyone pass it was not the sort of area where people wandered unremarked the probability was that it had been some coachman or footman from the party inflamed with drink and with time on his hands allowing a foolish impulse perhaps when she threatened to cry out to become suddenly an ugly and appalling crime but it was not the crime itself it was the attendant investigation that frightened and the haunting fear that it might not be a footman but some man on the walk one of themselves with a violent and obscene nature lying under the mannered surface they knew and police investigations uncovered not only the major crimes but so often the smaller sins the meannesses and deceits that hurt so much but there was no need to tell her that for all her title and her assurance she was still the same girl who had been so vulnerable in cater street when she had seen her father frightened and stripped of his pretenses you will wont you her voice cut across his silence demanding an answer she was standing in the middle of the floor staring at him we usually do it was the best thing he could say and be honest and even if he had wished to it was not much use lying to emily like many practical and ambitious people she was disastrously perceptive she was well accomplished in the art of polite lies and she read them like a book in others he recalled himself to the purpose of his visit she came to see you that evening didnt she fanny her eyes widened a little yes she returned a book or something to aunt vespasia do you want to speak to her he took the chance immediately yes please perhaps you had better stay in case she is distressed you would be of comfort to her he imagined an elderly female relative of excessively gentle birth with a correspondingly tender susceptibility to the vapors for the first time emily laughed oh my dear she put her hand over her mouth you cant imagine aunt vespasia she picked up her skirts and swept to the door but i shall most certainly stay it is precisely what i need george ashworth was handsome enough with bold dark eyes and a fine head of hair but he could never have been an equal for his aunt she was over seventy now but there were still the remnants of a startling beauty in her facethe strength of the bones the high cheeks and long straight nose bluewhite hair was piled on her head and she wore a dress of deep lilac silk she stood in the doorway and looked at pitt for several minutes then moved into the room picking up her lorgnette and studied him more closely cant really see without the damn thing she said irritably she snorted very gently like an extremely wellbred horse extraordinary she breathed out so you are a policeman yes maam for an instant even pitt was at a loss for words over his shoulder he saw emilys face alight with amusement what are you looking at vespasia said sharply i never wear black it doesnt suit me always wear what suits you regardless tried to tell emily that but she doesnt listen the walk expects her to wear black so she does very silly dont let other people expect you into doing something you dont wish to she sat down on the sofa opposite and stared at him her fine gray eyebrows arched a little fanny came to see me the night she was killed i assume you knew that and that is why you have come pitt swallowed and tried to compose his face yes maam at what time please ive no idea you must have some idea aunt vespasia emily interrupted it was after dinner if i say i have no idea emily then i have no idea i dont watch clocks i dont care for them when one gets to my age one doesnt it was dark if that is of any help a great help thank you pitt calculated quickly it must have been after ten at this time of the year and jessamyn nash had sent the footman for the police at a little before quarter to eleven what did she come for maam he asked to get away from an excessively boring dinner guest vespasia replied immediately eliza pomeroy knew her as a child and she was a bore even then talks about other peoples ailments who cares ones own are tedious enough pitt hid a smile with difficulty he dared not look at emily she told you that he inquired vespasia considered whether to be patient with him because he was foolishand decided against it the thought was plain in her face dont be ridiculous she said smartly she was a child of quite moderate breeding neither good enough nor bad enough to be frank she said she was returning some book or other you have the book he did not know what made him ask except habit to check every detail it was almost certainly immaterial i should imagine so she replied with slight surprize but i never lend books i expect to require again so i couldnt say she was an honest child she hadnt the imagination to lie successfully and she was one of those comfortable people who know their own limitations she would have done quite nicely had she lived no pretensions and no spite poor little creature the humor and the pleasantness vanished as suddenly as winter sun leaving a chill in the room behind it pitt felt obliged to speak but his voice was remote and it sounded trivial meaningless did she make any remark about calling upon anyone else vespasia seemed to have been touched by the same coldness no she said solemnly she had stayed here long enough to serve her purpose if eliza pomeroy had chanced still to be at the nashes she could quite easily have excused herself and gone straight up to bed without discourtesy from her conversation before leaving here i gathered she intended to go straight home she took her leave of you some time after ten pitt confirmed how long do you judge she was here a little above a half an hour she came in the early dusk and left when it was fully dark that would be roughly quarter to ten until about quarter past he thought she must have been attacked somewhere in the short journey down paragon walk they were large houses with broad frontages carriageways and shrubbery deep enough to hide a figure but even so there were only three between emilys and the nashes she could not have been on the street for more than minutesunless she had called somewhere else after all she was engaged to marry algernon burnon his mind searched for possibilities very suitable vespasia agreed a pleasant enough young man of quite adequate means his habits are sober and his manners good if a trifle boring so far as i know altogether a suitable choice pitt wondered inwardly how much good sense appealed to seventeenyearold fanny do you know maam he said aloud if there was anyone else who especially admired her he hoped his meaning was plain under such genteel disguise she looked at him with a slight puckering of her eyebrows and over her shoulder he could see emily wince i can imagine no one mr pitt who held such feelings for her as to precipitate last nights tragedy which i presume is what you are trying to say emily shut her eyes and bit her lip to stop herself from laughing pitt was aware he had fallen into precisely the strain of language he despised and both women knew it now he must avoid overcompensating thank you lady cumminggould he stood up im sure if anything comes to your mind that you believe could help us you will let us know thank you lady ashworth vespasia nodded slightly and permitted herself a faint smile but emily came around the table from the back of the sofa and held out both her hands please give my love to charlotte i shall be calling upon her directly but not until the worst of this is over but perhaps that wont be long i hope not he touched her hand gently but he had no belief that it would be so brief or so easy investigations were not pleasant and things were seldom the same afterward there was always hurt he visited several of the other houses along the walk and found at home algernon burnon lord and lady dilbridge who had held the party mrs selena montague a very handsome widow and the misses horbury by half past five he left its quiet dignity and made his way back to the scruffy heelworn utility of the police station by seven he was at his own front door the facade of the house was narrow tidy but there was no carriageway no trees only a scrubbed and whitened step and the wooden gateway through to the back yard he opened the door with his key and at once the same little bubble of pleasure that rose inside him every time burst in warmth and he found himself smiling violence and ugliness slipped away charlotte there was a clatter in the kitchen and his smile broadened he went down the passage and stopped in the doorway she was on her knees on the scrubbed floor and two saucepan lids were still rolling just out of her reach under the table she was in a plain dress with a white apron over it and her shining mahogany hair was coming out of its knot in long trailing strands she looked up and pulled a face grabbing at the lids and missing he bent and picked them up for her holding out his other hand she took it and he pulled her up and toward him as she relaxed in his arms he dropped the lids on the table it was good to feel her the warmth of her body of her answering mouth on his who have you been chasing today she asked after a moment he pushed the hair off her face murder he said quietly and rape oh her face stiffened a little perhaps memory im sorry it would have been easy to have left it at that not to have told her that it was someone emily knew living in emilys street but she would have to know sometime emily would be bound to tell her perhaps they would solve it quickly after alla drunken footman but she had already noticed his hesitation who was it she asked her first guess for his concern was wrong was she someone with children he thought of little jemima asleep upstairs now she saw the easing of his face the shadow of relief who thomas she repeated a young woman a girl she knew that was not all you mean a child nono she was seventeen im sorry love she lived in paragon walk just a few doors from emily i saw emily this afternoon she sent her love memories of cater street came back of the fear that had ultimately reached into everything touching and tainting everyone she spoke the first fear that came to her mind you dont think george washad anything to do with it his face fell good heavens no of course not she went back to the stove she skewered the potatoes savagely to see if they were cooked and two of them fell apart she would like to have sworn at them but she would not in front of him if he still cherished her as a lady let him keep his illusions her cooking was enough of a hurdle to overcome at one time she was still enough in love with him to hunger for his admiration her mother had taught her how to govern a house most excellently and see that all the tasks were properly performed but she had never foreseen that charlotte would marry so far beneath her as to require that she actually do the cooking herself it had been an experience not without its difficulties it was to pitts credit that he had laughed at her so little and only once lost his temper your dinner is nearly ready she said carrying the pan to the sink was emily all right she seemed to be he sat on the edge of the table i met her aunt vespasia do you know her no we dont have an aunt vespasia she must be georges she ought to be yours he said with a sudden grin she is exactly as you might be when you get to be seventy or eighty she let the pan go in her surprize and turned to stare at him his body like some enormous flightless bird coattails trailing and the thought didnt appall you she asked im surprized you still came home she was marvelous he laughed made me feel a complete fool she said precisely what she thought without a qualm i dont do it without a qualm she defended herself i cant help it but i feel awful afterward you wont by the time youre seventy get off the table im going to put the vegetables on it he moved obediently who else did you see she continued when they were in the dining room and the meal was begun emily has told me something of the people in the walk although ive never been there do you really want to know of course i do why on earth did he need to ask if someone has been raped and murdered next door to emily i have to know about it it wasnt jessamyn somethingorother was it no why emily cant abide her but she would miss her if she were not there i think disliking her is one of her main entertainments although i shouldnt speak like that of someone who might have been killed he was laughing at her inside himself and she knew it why not he asked she did not know why not except she was quite sure her mother would have said so she decided not to answer attack was the best form of defense then who was it why are you avoiding telling me it was jessamyn nashs sisterinlaw a girl called fanny suddenly gentility seemed irrelevant poor little child she said quietly i hope it was quick and she knew little of it not very im afraid she was raped and then stabbed she managed to make her way to the house and died in jessamyns arms she stopped with a forkful of meat halfway to her mouth suddenly sick he saw it why the hell did you ask me in the middle of dinner he said angrily people die every day you cant do anything about it eat your food it was on the tip of her tongue to point out that that did not make it any better then she realized that he had been hurt by it himself he must have seen the bodyit was part of his dutyand talked with those who had loved her to charlotte she was only imaginary and imagination could be denied while memory could not obediently she put the food in her mouth watching him his face was calm the anger entirely gone but his shoulders were tense and he had forgotten to take any of the gravy she had so carefully made was he so moved by the death of the girlor was it something far worse fear that the investigations would uncover things uglier close to him something about george two the following morning pitt went first to the police station where forbes was waiting with a lugubrious face morning forbes pitt said cheerfully whats the matter police surgeons been looking for you forbes replied with a sniff got a message about that corpse from yesterday pitt stopped fanny nash what message i dont know e wouldnt say well where is he pitt demanded what on earth could the man have to say beyond the obvious was she with child it was the only thing he could think of gone to ave a cup of tea forbes shook his head i suppose were going back to paragon walk of course we are pitt smiled at him and forbes looked glumly back you can see a little more of how the gentry live try all the staff at that party lord and lady dilbridge precisely now im going to find that surgeon he swung out of the office and went to the little eating house on the corner where the police surgeon in a dapper suit was sitting over a pot of tea he looked up as pitt came in tea he inquired pitt sat down never mind the breakfast what about fanny nash ah the surgeon took a long gulp from his cup funny thing that may mean nothing at all but thought i should mention it she has a scar on her buttock left buttock low down looks pretty recent pitt frowned a scar healed so what does that matter probably not at all the surgeon shrugged but its sort of crossshaped long bar with shorter cross bar toward the lower end very regular but the funny thing about it is that its not a cut he looked up his eyes very brilliant its a burn pitt sat perfectly still a burn he said incredulously what on earth could burn her like that i dont know the surgeon replied so help me i dont even care to think pitt left the tea house puzzled unsure if it meant anything at all perhaps it was no more than a perverse and rather ridiculous accident meanwhile he must continue the dreary task of establishing where everyone had been at the time the murder was committed he had already seen algernon burnon the young man engaged to marry fanny and found him pale but as composed as was proper in the circumstances he claimed to have been in the company of someone else all that evening but refused to say whom he implied it was a matter of honor that pitt would not understand but was too delicate to phrase it quite so plainly pitt could get no more from him and for the present was content to leave it so if the wretched man had been indulging in some other affair at the very time his fiancee was being ravished he would hardly care to admit it now lord and lady dilbridge had been with company since seven oclock and could be written off the household of the misses horbury contained no men at all selena montagues only manservant had been either in the servants hall or in his own pantry in view of the kitchen all the relevant time that left pitt with three more houses to call on and then the distressing duty of going back to the nashes to see jessamyns husband the half brother of the dead girl lastly there was the personally awkward necessity of asking george ashworth to account for his time pitt hoped above anything else in the case that george could do so he wished he could have got that interview over with first but he knew that george would not be available so early in the morning more than that there was a foolishness in him that hoped he might discover some strong clue before he came to the necessity something so urgent and pointed he could avoid asking george at all he began at the second house in the walk immediately after the dilbridges at least this unpleasant task could be put behind him there were three nash brothers and this was the house of the eldest mr afton nash and his wife and the youngest mr fulbert nash as yet single the butler let him in with weary resignation warning him that the family was still at breakfast and he must oblige him to wait pitt thanked him and when the door was closed began slowly to walk around the room it was traditional expensive and yet made him feel uncomfortable there were numerous leatherbound volumes in the bookcase in such neat order as to look unused he ran his finger along them to see if there was dust on them but they were immaculate more to the credit of the housekeeper he guessed than of any reader the bureau held the usual clutter of family photographs none of them smiled but that was usual one had to hold a pose for so long that smiling was impossible a sweetness of expression was the best that could be hoped for and it had not been achieved here an embroidered sampler hung above the mantel a single baleful unblinking eye and underneath it in cross stitch god sees all he shivered and sat down with his back to it afton nash came in and closed the door behind him he was a tall man becoming portly with strong straight features but for a certain heaviness and a tightening in the mouth it should have been a handsome face curiously it was not even pleasing i dont know what we can do for you mr pitt he said coldly the poor child lived with my brother diggory and his wife her moral welfare was their concern perhaps on hindsight it would have been better if we had taken her but it appeared a perfectly adequate arrangement at the time jessamyn cares for society more than we do and therefore was more suitable to introduce fanny pitt should have been used to it the defensive drawing together the protestations of innocence even of noninvolvement they came in some form or other every time and yet this was peculiarly repellent to him he remembered the girls face so unmarked by life she had hardly begun and she was destroyed so quickly here in the comfortless room her brother was talking about moral welfare and looking to exonerate himself from whatever blame there turned out to be one cannot make arrangements against murder pitt could hear the edge in his own voice one can surely make arrangements against rape afton answered tartly young women of virtuous habits do not court such an end have you some reason to suppose your sister was not of virtuous habits pitt had to ask although everything in him already knew the answer afton turned round and regarded him with a curl of distaste she was raped before she was murdered inspector you must know that as well as i please do not be coy it is disgusting you would be better employed speaking to my brother diggory he has some curious tastes though i would have expected even he would not infect his sister with them but i could be mistaken perhaps one of his less salubrious friends was in the walk that night i assume you will do your best to ascertain precisely who was here of course pitt agreed with equal coolness we shall be determining the whereabouts of everyone we can aftons eyebrows rose a little the residents of the walk can hardly interest youthe servants perhaps although i doubt it i for one am most particular about the type of manservant i employ and i do not allow my women servants to have followers pitt felt a twinge of pity for the servants and the bleak joyless lives they must lead a person might be in no way involved he pointed out and yet possibly have seen something of significance the smallest observation may help afton grunted in irritation that he had not seen the point for himself he flicked a nonexistent crumb from his sleeve well i was at home that night i remained in the billiard room most of the evening with my brother fulbert i neither saw nor heard anything pitt could not afford to give up so easily he must not let his dislike of the man show he had to struggle perhaps you noticed something earlier in the last few weeks he began again if i had noticed such a thing inspector do you not imagine i should have done something about it aftons heavy nose twitched minutely apart from the unpleasantness for all of us of such a thing happening here fanny was my sister of course sirbut with the perception of hindsight pitt finished the question afton considered again not that i can recollect he said carefully but if something does occur i shall inform you was there anything else yes please i would like to speak to the rest of your family i think if they had observed anything they would have spoken to me of it afton said with impatience nevertheless i would like to see them pitt persisted afton stared at him he was a tall man and they looked eye to eye pitt refused to waver i suppose it is necessary afton conceded at last his face sour i do not wish to set a bad example one must consider ones duty i would ask you to be as delicate as you are capable with my wife thank you sir i shall do my best not to distress her phoebe nash was as different from jessamyn as possible if there had ever been fire in her it long since had been damped she was dressed in tired black and there was no artificial color in her pale face at another time she might have been pleasing enough but now she looked very much the recently bereaved eyes a little pink nose puffed her hair orderly but far less than elegant she refused to sit and stood staring at him holding her hands tightly together i doubt i can help you inspector i was not even at home that evening i was visiting an elderly relative who had been unwell i can give you her name if you wish i do not doubt you for a moment maam he said smiling as much as he dared without appearing to show undue levity in the face of death he felt a nameless sad pity for her he wanted to put her at ease and did not know how she was a sort of woman he did not understand all her feelings were inward tightly governed gentility was everything i wondered if perhaps miss nash might have confided in you he began being her sisterinlaw if perhaps someone had paid her unwelcome attention or passed an offensive remark even if she had seen a stranger in the neighborhood he kept on trying or if you have yourself her hands jerked into a knot and she stared at him appalled oh dear heaven you dont imagine hes still here do you he hesitated wanting to take away her fear which at least was a familiar emotion and yet he knew it was foolish to lie if hes a vagrant i dont doubt hell have moved on by now he settled for a truth that was without meaning only a fool would stay when the police are here and looking for him she relaxed visibly even permitting herself to sit down on the edge of one of the bulging chairs thank goodness youve made me feel so much better of course i should have thought of that for myself then she frowned drawing her light brows together but i dont recall seeing any strangers in the walk at least not of that type had i done so i should have sent the footman to get rid of them he would only terrify and confuse her if he tried to explain that rapists did not necessarily appear different from anyone else crime so often surprised people as if it were not merely an outward act born from the inward selfishness greed or hate that had grown too big inside the dishonesties suddenly without restraint she expected it to be recognizable different nothing to do with the people she knew it would be pointless and hurtful to try to change her he wondered why after so many years he even noticed it still less allowed it to disturb him perhaps miss nash confided in you he suggested if anyone had distressed her or made improper remarks she did not even bother to consider it certainly not if such a thing had happened i should have spoken to my husband and he would have taken steps her fingers were winding round a handkerchief in her lap and she had already torn the lace pitt could imagine what afton nashs steps might have been still he could not quite give up she expressed no anxieties at all mentioned no new acquaintance no she shook her head vehemently he sighed and stood up there was nothing more to be gained from her he had a feeling that if he frightened her with the truth she would simply banish it from her mind and dissolve all reason and memory in blind fear thank you maam im sorry to have had to distress you with the matter she smiled with something of an effort im sure it is perfectly necessary or you would not have done so inspector i suppose you wish to see my brotherinlaw mr fulbert nash but im afraid he was not at home last night i dare say if you call this afternoon he may have returned thank you i shall do that oh he remembered the peculiar burn the surgeon had remarked do you happen to know if miss nash had had an accident recently a burn he did not wish to describe the place of the injury if it was avoidable he knew it would embarrass her exquisitely burn she said with a frown quite a small burn he described its shape as the police surgeon had described it to him but fairly deep and recent to his amazement every vestige of color fled from her face burn her voice was faint no i cannot imagine im sure i know nothing of it perhapsperhaps she had she coughed had taken some interest in the kitchen you must ask my sisterinlaw ii really have no idea he was puzzled she was plainly horrified was it simply that she knew the site of the injury and was agonized with embarrassment by it because he was a man and an infinitely inferior person in her social hierarchy he did not understand her well enough to know thank you maam he said quietly perhaps it is of no importance and with further polite murmurings he was shown out by the footman into the light and sun again he stood for several minutes before deciding whom to call upon next forbes was somewhere in the walk talking to the servants relishing his new importance in investigating a murder and indulging a long cherished curiosity about the precise workings of the households of a social order beyond all his previous experience he would be a mine of information tonight most of it useless but in all the welter of trivial habit there might be some observation that led to anotherand another he smiled broadly as he thought of it and a passing gardeners boy stared at him with amazement and a little awe for one who was obviously not a gentleman and yet could stand idle in the street and grin at himself in the end he tried the central house belonging to one paul alaric and was told very civilly that monsieur alaric was not expected home until dark but if the inspector would care to call then no doubt monsieur would receive him he had not yet composed in his mind what he meant to say to george so he shelved it and tried the house further on belonging to a mr hallam cayley cayley was still at a very late breakfast but invited him in offering him a cup of strong coffee which pitt declined he preferred tea anyway and this looked as thick as the oiled water in the london docks cayley smiled sourly and poured himself another cupful he was a goodlooking man in his early thirties although excellent somewhat aquiline features were spoiled by a deeply pocked skin and already there was a shade of temper a slackness marking itself around his mouth this morning his eyes were puffed and a little bloodshot pitt guessed at a heavy engagement with the bottle the evening before perhaps several bottles what can i do for you inspector cayley began before pitt asked i dont know anything i was at the dilbridges party most of the night anyonell tell you that pitts heart sank was everyone going to be able to account for themselves no that was foolish it did not matter it was almost certainly some servant who had had too much to drink got above himself and then when the girl had screamed he had knifed her in fear to keep her quiet perhaps not even meaning to kill forbes would probably find the answers he himself was merely asking the masters because someone had to as a matter of form so they would know the police were doing their jobsand better he than forbes with his awkward tongue and his glaring curiosity do you happen to recall who you were with about ten oclock sir he recalled himself to his questions actually i had a row with barham stephens cayley helped himself to yet more coffee and shook the pot irritably when it did no more than halffill his cup he slammed it down rattling the lid fool said he didnt lose at cards cant stomach a bad loser no one can he glared at his crumb strewn plate you had this disagreement at ten oclock pitt asked cayley remained staring at the plate no bit before and it was more than a disagreement it was a bloody row he looked up sharply no not what you would call a row i suppose no shouting he may not behave like a gentleman but were both sufficiently wellbred not to brawl in front of women i went outside for a walk to cool off into the garden cayley looked down at the plate again yes if you want to know if i saw anythingi didnt there were loads of people milling around dilbridges have some peculiar social tastes but i suppose youve got a guest list youll probably find it was some footman hired for the evening some people do hire carriages you know especially if theyre only up for the season his face was suddenly very grave and he looked at pitt unblinkingly i honestly havent an idea who could have murdered poor fanny his face crumpled a little with a strange pain subtler than simple pity i know most of the men on the walk i cant say i care for all of them but neither can i honestly believe any of them capable of sticking a knife into a woman a child like fanny he pushed his plate away with repugnance i suppose it could be the frenchman odd sort of fellow and a knife sounds a french kind of thing but it doesnt really seem likely murder often isnt pitt said softly then he thought of the filthy teeming rookeries squatting just behind stately streets where crime was the road to survival infants learned to steal as soon as they could walk and only the cunning or the strong made it to adulthood but all that was irrelevant in paragon walk here it was shocking alien and naturally they sought to disown it cayley was sitting quite still eaten up with some inner moil of emotions pitt waited outside carriage wheels crunched on the gravel and passed at last cayley looked up who on earth would want to do that to a harmless little creature like fanny he said quietly its so bloody pointless pitt had no answer for him he stood up i dont know mr cayley presumably she recognized the rapist and he knew it but why he assaulted her in the first place only god knows cayley banged a hard tight fist on the table not loudly but with tremendous power or the devil he put his head down and did not look up again even when pitt went out of the door and closed it behind him outside the sun was warm and clear birds chattered in the gardens across the walk and somewhere out of sight beyond the curve a horses hooves clattered past he had seen the first open grief for fanny and although it was painful a reminder that the mystery was trivial the tragedy realthat long after everyone knew who had killed her and how and why she would still be deadyet he felt cleaner for it he went to see diggory nash it was the middle of the afternoon when he could no longer put off going back to emily and george he had learned nothing that would allow him to avoid asking the question diggory nash had offered nothing positive either he had been away from home gambling so he said at a private party and was reluctant to name the other players pitt was not prepared at this stage to insist now he must see george not to do so would be as obvious and thereby as offensive as any questions he could ask vespasia cumminggould was taking tea with emily and george when pitt was announced emily took a deep breath and asked the parlormaid to have him shown in vespasia looked at her critically really the girl was wearing her corset far too tightly for one in her stage of pregnancy vanity was all very well in its place but childbearing was not its place as every woman should know when the opportunity arose she must tell her what apparently her own mother had neglected to or was the poor girl so fond of george and so unsure of his affection as to be trying still to capture his interest if she had been a little better bred she would have been brought up to expect the weaknesses of men and take them in her stride then she could have treated the whole thing with indifference which would have been far more satisfactory and now this extraordinary creature the police inspector was coming into the withdrawing room all arms and legs and coattails with hair like the scullery maids mop falling in every direction good afternoon maam pitt said courteously good afternoon inspector she replied extending him her hand without rising he bent over and brushed it with his lips it was a ridiculous gesture from a policeman who after all was more or less a tradesman but he did it without an iota of selfconsciousness even a kind of odd grace he was not as uncoordinated as he appeared really he was the oddest creature please sit down thomas emily offered i shall send for more tea she rang the bell as she spoke what is it you wish to know this time vespasia enquired surely the fellow could not be paying a social call he turned a little to face her he was uncommonly plain and yet she found him not displeasing there was great intelligence in his face and a better humor than she had observed in anyone else in paragon walk except perhaps that marvelously elegant frenchman all the women were making such fools of themselves about surely that could not be why emily was tying herself in could it pitts reply cut across her thoughts i was not able to see lord ashworth when i called before maam he answered of course suppose the wretched man had to see george it would appear odd if he did not quite she agreed i suppose you want to know where he was yes please she turned to george sitting a little sideways on the arm of one of the easy chairs wish he would sit properly but he never had since he was a child always fidgeted even on a horse only saving grace was that he had good hands didnt haul an animal about got it from his mother his father was a fool well she said sharply turning to him where were you george you werent here i was out aunt vespasia obviously she snapped where at my club there was something in the way he was sitting that made her feel uncomfortable and distrust his answer it was not a lie and yet it was somehow incomplete she knew it from the way he shifted his bottom a little his father had done exactly the same as a child when he had been in the butlers pantry trying the port the fact that the butler had imbibed the majority of it himself was immaterial you have several clubs she pointed out tartly which were you at on that occasion do you wish to send mr pitt scouring all the gentlemens clubs in london asking after you george colored no of course not he said with irritation i was at whytes i think most of the evening anyway teddy aspinall was with me although i dont suppose he kept time any more than i did but i suppose you could ask him if you have to he twisted to look at pitt although id rather you didnt press him he was pretty well soaked and i dont suppose he can remember much rather embarrassing for him his wife is a daughter of the duke of carlisle and a bit straitlaced make things rather unpleasant the old duke of carlisle was dead and anyway daisy aspinall was as used to her husbands drinking as she had been to her fathers however vespasia forbore from saying so but why did george not want pitt to ask was he nervous that pitt would let fall that he was georges brotherinlaw no doubt george would get ragged about it but one was not accountable for the peculiar tastes of ones relatives as long as they were discreet about it and so far emily had been excellently discreet as much as loyalty to her sister would allow vespasia admitted to a rapidly mounting curiosity about this sister she had never seen why had emily not invited her since they were sisters surely the girl had been tolerably well brought up emily certainly knew how to behave like a lady only someone of vespasias immense and subtle experience would have known she was notnot quite she had missed some of the conversation hope to heavens she was not becoming deaf she could not bear to be deaf not to hear what people were saying would be worse than being buried alive time you came home pitt finished george scowled she could remember the same expression on his face when doing sums as a child he always chewed the ends of his pencils disgusting habit she had told his mother to soak them in aloes but the softhearted woman had refused im afraid i didnt look george answered after a few moments i think it was pretty late i didnt disturb emily what about your valet pitt enquired ohyes george seemed uncertain i doubt hell remember hed fallen asleep in my dressing room had to waken him up his face brightened so it must have been pretty late sorry i cant help you looks as if i was miles away at the time that matters didnt see a thing were you not invited to the dilbridges party pitt asked with surprize or did you prefer not to go vespasia stared at him really he was a most unexpected person he was sitting now on the couch taking up more than half of it in pure untidiness none of his clothes seemed to fit him properly poverty no doubt in the hands of a good tailor and barber he might even have looked quite well but there was a suppressed energy about him that was hardly decent he looked as if he might laugh at any time any inappropriate time actually when she thought about it he was quite entertaining pity it had taken a murder to bring him here on any other occasion he would have been a distinct relief from the boredom of eliza pomeroys ailments lord dilbridges excesses as recited by grace dilbridge jessamyn nashs latest gown selena montagues current involvement or the general decay of civilization as monitored by the misses horbury and lady tamworth the only other diversion was the rivalry between jessamyn and selena as to who should attract the beautiful frenchman and so far neither of them had made any progress that she had heard about and she would have heard what was the point in making a conquest if one could not tell everybody about it preferably one by one and in the strictest confidence success without envy was like snails without sauceand as any cultivated woman knew the sauce is everything i preferred not to go george said his brow wrinkled he also failed to see the relevance of the question it was not the sort of occasion to which i would wish to take emily the dilbridges have somesome friends of decidedly vulgar tastes oh do they emily looked surprised grace dilbridge always looks so tame she is vespasia said impatiently she does not write the guest list not that i think she would object to it she is one of those women who like to suffer she has made a career of it if frederick were to behave properly she would have nothing to talk about it is the sole source of her importanceshe is put upon thats terrible emily protested its not terrible vespasia contradicted she is perfectly happy with it but it is extremely tedious she turned to pitt no doubt that is where you will find your murderer either among frederick dilbridges guests or among their servants some of the most reprehensible persons can drive a carriageandpair extraordinarily well she sighed i can remember my father had a coachman who drank like a sot and bedded every girl in the village but he could drive better than jehubest hands in the south of england gamekeeper shot him in the end never knew whether it was an accident or not emily looked helplessly at pitt anxiety driving the laughter out of her eyes thats where youll find him thomas she said urgently no one in paragon walk would have done it there was still time for pitt to see fulbert nash the last brother and he was fortunate to find him at home a little before five apparently to judge from fulberts face he had been expected so you are the police fulbert looked him up and down with undisguised curiosity as one might regard some new invention but without the desire to purchase it good afternoon sir pitt said a little more stiffly than he had intended oh good afternoon inspector fulbert mimicked the tone very slightly obviously you are here about fanny poor little creature do you want her life history its pathetically short she never did anything of note and i dont suppose she ever would have nothing in her life was as remarkable as her death pitt was angered by his flippancy although he knew how often people covered grief they could not bear with apparent indifference or even laughter i have no reason yet sir to suppose she was anything but a chance victim and therefore her life story need not be inquired into so far perhaps if you would tell me where you were on that evening and if you saw or heard anything that might help us i was here fulbert replied with slightly raised eyebrows he was more reminiscent of afton than of diggory having something of aftons faintly supercilious expression features that should have been handsome but were not diggory on the other hand was less well constructed but there was a pleasingness in the irregularity character in the stronger darker brows something altogether warmer all evening fulbert added in company or alone pitt asked fulbert smiled didnt afton say i was with him playing billiards were you sir no as a matter of fact i wasnt aftons several inches taller than i am as i dare say youve noticed it irritates the hell out of him that he cant beat me and afton in a bad temper is more than i care to put up with why dont you let him beat you the answer seemed obvious fulberts lightblue eyes opened wide and he smiled his teeth were small and even too small for a mans mouth because i cheat and hes never been able to work out how its one of the few things i do better than he does he answered pitt was a little lost he could not imagine any pleasure in a competition to see who could cheat the best but then he did not enjoy games himself he had never had time in his youth when he might have learned the skills now it was too late were you in the billiard room all evening sir no i thought i just told you that i wandered round the house a bit library upstairs into the butlers pantry and had a glass of port or two he smiled again long enough for afton to have nipped out and raped poor fanny and since she was his sister youll be able to add incest to the charge he saw pitts face oh ive offended your sensibilities i forgot how puritanical the lower classes are its only the aristocracy and the guttersnipes who are frank about everything and on reflection perhaps we are the only ones who can afford to be we are so arrogant we think no one can shift us and the guttersnipes have nothing to lose do you really imagine my painfully selfrighteous brother crept out between billiard balls and raped his sister in the garden she wasnt stabbed with a billiard cue was she no mr nash pitt said coldly and clearly she was stabbed with a long knife sharp point and probably singleedged fulbert shut his eyes and pitt was glad he had hurt him at last how revolting he said quietly i didnt go out of the house which is what you want to know nor did i see or hear anything odd but you can be damned sure that if i do ill look a good deal harder i suppose youre working on the hypothesis it is some lunatic do you know what a hypothesis is yes sir and so far i am merely collecting evidence it is too early for hypotheses he deliberately used the plural to show fulbert that he knew it fulbert observed and smiled ill lay you odds two to one it is not ill lay you its one of us some nasty grubby little secret that snapped through the civilized veneerand rape she saw him and he had to kill her look into the walk inspector look at us all very very carefully sift us through a small sieve and comb us with a finetooth comband see what parasites and what lice you turn up he giggled very lightly with amusement and met pitts angry eyes squarely brilliantly believe me youll be amazed what there is charlotte was waiting anxiously for pitt all afternoon from the time she had put jemima upstairs for her afternoon sleep she found herself repeatedly glancing at the old brown clock on the dining room shelf going up to it to listen for the faint tick to make sure it was still going she knew perfectly well it was foolish because he could not return before five at the very earliest and more likely six the reason for her concern was emily of course emily was newly with child her first and as charlotte could remember only too well those first months could be very trying not only did one feel a natural unsureness at ones new condition but there were nausea and the most unreasonable depressions to overcome she had never been to paragon walk emily had invited her naturally but charlotte was not sure if she had really wished her to go ever since they were girls when sarah had been alive and they had lived in cater street with mama and papa charlottes lack of tact had been a social liability mama had found umpteen suitable young men for her but charlotte had had no ambitions like the others to make her curb her tongue and seek to impress of course emily loved her but she was also aware that charlotte would not be comfortable in the walk she could not afford the clothes nor the time from her household tasks she knew none of the gossip and her life would soon be seen to be utterly different now she wished she could go to see for herself that emily was quite well and not afraid because of the appalling crime of course her sister could always remain at home go out only with a servant and in daylight but that was not the real terror charlotte refused to remember or think of that it was after six when she finally heard pitt at the door she dropped the potatoes she was straining in the sink and knocked over the salt and pepper on the edge of the table running out to meet him hows emily she demanded have you seen her have you discovered who killed that girl he closed her in a hard hug no of course i havent ive barely begun and yes i saw emily and she seemed quite well oh she pulled away you havent discovered anything but you know at least that george had nothing to do with it dont you he opened his mouth to answer but she saw the indecision in his eyes before he found the words you dont it came out as an accusation she was aware even as she said it and she was sorry but there was no time to apologize now you dont know why havent you found out where he was he moved her aside gently and sat down at the table i asked him he said i havent had time to check yet check she was at his elbow why dont you believe him then she knew that was unfair he did not have the choice of belief and anyway belief was not what she needed not what emily needed im sorry she touched his shoulder with her hand feeling the hardness of it under his coat then she moved away back to the sink and picked up the potatoes again she tried to keep her voice casual but it came out ridiculously high where did he say he was at his club he replied most of the time he cant remember how long he was there or precisely which other clubs he went to she went on mechanically dishing the potatoes the finechopped cabbage and the fish she had been so careful to bake in cheese sauce it was something she had only just learned how to make successfully now she surveyed its perfection without interest perhaps it was foolish to be afraid george might be able to prove exactly where he had been all the time but she had heard about mens clubs the games the conversations people sitting around drinking or even asleep how could anyone remember who had been there at a particular time or even a particular evening how was one evening different from another to recall it with surety it was not that she thought george might have killed the girl nothing so appalling as that but she knew from the past what damage even suspicion can do if george was telling the truth he would resent it if emily did not utterly and immediately believe him and if he had evaded the truth left out something like a flirtation a foolish party some excess in drink then he would feel guilty one lie would lead to another and emily would become confused and in the end perhaps suspect him even of the crime itself the truth could be full of so many uglinesses it was unforeseeably painful to strip away the small deceits that made life comfortable and allowed you not to see what you preferred to pretend you did not know charlotte pitts voice came from behind her she forced the fear out of her mind and served the food she set it on the table in front of him yes she said innocently stop it it was no use trying to deceive him even with a thought he read her too easily she sat down with her own plate you will prove it wasnt george as soon as you can wont you she asked he stretched out his hand across the table to touch hers of course i will as soon as i can without making it look as if i suspect him she had not even thought of that of courseif he pursued george first of all it would make it even worse emily would thinkoh goodness only knew what emily would think i shall go and call on emily she speared a potato with her fork and sliced it hard unconsciously making the pieces smaller than usual as if she were already dining in paragon walk she is often inviting me she started to think which of her dresses she could possibly make suitable for the occasion if she called in the morning her dark gray would be well enough it was a good muslin and not too obviously last years cut after all one of us should go and mama is busy with grandmamas illness i think it is an excellent idea pitt did not answer her he knew that she was talking to herself three charlotte had already worked out in her mind exactly what she meant to do and as soon as pitt had gone she tidied the kitchen and then dressed jemima in her secondbest clothes cotton trimmed with lace charlotte had carefully salvaged from one of her own old petticoats when she was all ready charlotte picked her up and took her out into the warm dusty street and over to the house opposite the net curtains were twitching behind a dozen windows but she refused to turn her head and betray that she knew it balancing jemima on one arm she knocked on the door it opened almost immediately and a gaunt little woman in a plain stuff pinafore stood on the mat just inside good morning mrs smith charlotte said with a smile i just heard yesterday evening that my sister is unwell and i feel i should go and see her perhaps i can help she did not want to lie so directly as to imply that emily had no one else to care for her as might have been her own situation but she did want to suggest a certain urgency her feelings conflicted she was faintly ashamed on this womans doorstep looking at the shabby hall and knowing that emily could ring a bell and have a maid come if she were ill or send a footman for a doctor yet she needed to make the summons seem important would you be good enough to look after jemima for me today the womans face lit in an answering smile and she held out her arms jemima hesitated for a moment drawing back a little but charlotte had no time for tears or cajolings today she gave her a quick kiss and passed her over thank you very much i expect i shall not be long but if things are worse than i fear i may not be home until the afternoon dont you worry love the woman cuddled jemima easily setting her weight on her bony hip as she had done with countless bundles of laundry and with all eight of her own children except the two who had died before they were old enough to sit at all ill take care of er give er er dinner you just go and see to your sister poor soul i ope as it isnt anything bad i always reckons this ot weathers to blame for a lot aint natural no charlotte agreed hastily i like the autumn best myself more like furrin weather i should think mrs smith went on leastways from what one ears i ad a brother what was a sailor terrible places es bin to well you go and see to yours sister dear ill take care o jemima till you comes back charlotte gave her a dazzling smile it had taken her a long time to learn any sort of ease with these people who were so different from those she had known before her marriage of course there had been working people before but the only ones she had known personally had been servants as familiar in the house as the furniture or the pictures as much accommodated to the familys ways and as easy to regard or ignore they had brought nothing of their own lives into the drawing room or upstairs their families were known of naturally as part of their references but they were no more than names and reputations there were no faces and still less any ambitions or tragedies and feelings now she had to accommodate herself to them learn to cook to clean to shop wiselyabove all to need and be needed neighbors were everything through the long days while pitt was away they were laughter the sound of voices help when she did not know how to manage things when jemima was cutting teeth and she had no idea what to do there were no nursery maids to call no nanny only mrs smith with her old womans remedies and years of practice her ordinariness her passive resignation to hardship and obedience infuriated charlotte and yet her patience soothed her that and her sureness of what to do in the daily small crises that charlotte had never been taught to handle to begin with the whole street had thought charlotte arrogant aloof to the point of coldness not realizing she was as shy of them as they of her it had taken nearly two years for them to accept her the annoying thing was that in their own way they were just as prim as mama and her friends just as full of genteel expressions to avoid a truth that offended and every whit as conscious of social differences in all the subtlest of shades charlotte had quite unintentionally outraged them with her opinions spoken in total innocence mamas withdrawing room seemed a long time ago the afternoon teas the polite visits exchanging gossip trying to learn something about eligible young men other peoples social and financial affairs always in the most circumlocutory manner of course now she must try to recapture at least the semblance of grace again sufficient not to embarrass emily she hurried home and changed into the gray muslin with white spots last year she had saved from the housekeeping for it and the style was so plain as to have dated little of course that was why she had chosen it that and so as not to seem above herself to the rest of the street the day was already hot by ten oclock when she dismounted from the cab in paragon walk thanked the cabbie and paid him then crunched her way slowly up the gravel to emilys door she was determined not to stare someone would see her there was always someone about a housemaid bored with dusting daydreaming out of a window a footman or coachman on an errand a gardeners boy the house was large and after her own street it seemed positively palatial of course it was built for a full staff of servants as well as the master and mistress their children and whatever relatives might care to come up for the season she knocked on the door and then suddenly felt terribly afraid that she would let emily down that their lives had become so separate since cater street that they would be strangers even that business at callander square was more than a year ago now they had been close then sharing danger horror even a sort of excitement but that had not been in emilys home among her friends she was wrong to have thought the gray muslin was all right it was dull and there was a tear near the hem that showed where she had mended it she did not think her hands were red but she had better keep her gloves on just in case emily would be bound to notice charlottes hands had always been beautiful one of the things she had been proud of the maid opened the door surprise in her face at seeing a stranger good morning maam good morning charlotte stood very straight and forced herself to smile she must speak slowly it was idiotic to be nervous calling upon ones own sister and ones younger sister at that good morning she repeated will you be good enough to inform lady ashworth that her sister mrs pitt has called oh the girls eyes widened oh yes maam if youd like to come in maam im sure as her ladyshipll be pleased to see you charlotte followed her in and waited in the morning room for only a few minutes before emily came bursting in oh charlotte how marvelous to see you she threw her arms around charlottes neck and hugged her then stood back her eyes glanced over the gray muslin then at charlottes face you look well i have been meaning to come and see you but you must know what an awful thing has happened here thomas will have told you all about it thank heaven it is nothing to do with us this time she shuddered and shook her head in a little gesture of denial does that sound terribly callous she turned back to charlotte again with a wide slightly guilty look charlotte was honest as always i suppose it does but it is the truth if we would all but admit it there is a sort of thrill in horror as long as it is not too close people will talk about how dreadful it is and how the mere mention of it distresses them beyond conceivable opportunity emilys face relaxed in a smile im so glad youre here i dare say it is quite irresponsible of me but i shall love to hear your opinions of the walk although i shall never be able to view them in the same way afterward they are all so very careful they bore me terribly at times ive an awful feeling i have forgotten how to think frankly myself charlotte linked her arm in emilys and they walked through the french doors and onto the lawn at the back the sun was hot on their faces and dazzled from a peerless sky i doubt it charlotte answered you were always able to think one thing and say another i am a social catastrophe because i cant emily giggled as memories came back to her and for a few moments they talked together over disasters of the past that had made them blush at the time but were only bonds of laughter and shared affection now charlotte had even forgotten her real reason for coming when sudden mention of sarah their older sister who had been a victim of the cater street hangman made her remember murder its close suffocating terror and the corroding acid of suspicion it brought in its wake she had never been able to be subtle least of all with emily who knew her so well what was fanny nash like she wanted a womans opinion thomas was clever but so often men missed the real things in a woman things that were perfectly obvious to another woman the number of times she had seen men taken in by a pretty girl who chose to seem vulnerable when charlotte knew really she was as strong and as hard as a kitchen pot the laughter died out of emilys face are you going to play detective again she said warily charlotte thought of callander square emily had wanted to detect then she had even insisted on it and there had been times when it was a kind of adventurebefore the frightening horrifying end no she said immediately then well yes i cant help caring can i but im not going to go around asking questions of course not dont be foolish i mean that would be most unseemly you should know i wouldnt do that to you i can be tactless i admit but i am not quite stupid emily relented probably because she also was curious and the whole thing was not close enough to be ugly yet of course i know that im sorry i am a little highly strung at the moment she colored very faintly at her reference to her condition she had not yet become accustomed to it and it was not a subject one discussed fanny was rather ordinary really i suppose you do want the truth she was the last person in the world i would have thought to provoke such a passion in anyone i can only presume he was quite mad poor creature oh she tightened her lip caught in a social gaffe herself she took pride that since her marriage she had made herself immune to such things charlottes influence must be contagious i suppose one shouldnt sympathize with him she corrected that is quite wrong except that if he is mad of course he cannot help it will thomas catch him charlotte did not know how to reply she could say simply that she did not know but that was no answer at all what emily was really asking was did thomas have any knowledge was it inside or outside the walk could they all dismiss it as a tragedy but something beyond their own affairs a brief intrusion now entirely of the past something that had happened in the walk but could as easily have occurred anywhere else in the mad creatures path its too early to say she temporized if he is quite mad he could be anywhere by now and since there was no reason for selecting fanny except that she was there he will be very hard to recognizeeven when we find him emily looked directly at her are you saying it is possible it was not someone mad charlotte avoided her eyes emily how can i know you say fanny was very ordinary not in the least a flirt no no one less so she was not plain exactly but you know charlotte the older i get the more i believe beauty is not so much a matter of what your features or your coloring may be but the way you behave and what you believe of yourself fanny behaved as though she were plain whereas jessamyn if you look at her dispassionately is not really so very beautiful and yet she behaves as if she were quite marvelous therefore everyone sees her so she believes itand so we do too it was very perceptive of emily to know that charlotte wished she could have known it herself when she was younger and cared desperately she could recall with painful clarity how wretched she had felt at fifteen when sarah and emily seemed so pretty and she felt plain all elbows and feet she was already the tallest and still growing she might become perfectly gigantic and no man would ever care for her she would look over the tops of their heads she thought young james fortescue so attractive but she knew she was at least two inches taller than he was and found herself unable to say anything at all in his presence he had ended up by admiring sarah instead you are not listening emily accused im sorry what did you say that thomas has been up and down the walk asking questions of all the men he even asked george where he was of course charlotte said reasonably this was the part she had been fearing since the beginning he has to after all george may have seen something that appeared quite usual at the time but now that we know what happened he would recognize it as important she was pleased with the way she had phrased that it was immediate and yet completely rational it did not sound contrived to make emily comfortable i suppose so emily conceded actually george wasnt even here that evening he was in town at his club so he couldnt be any help charlotte was saved the necessity of answering by the arrival of the most magnificent old lady she had ever seen with hair piled immaculately and back as straight as a ramrod her nose was a shade too long and her eyes a little hooded and yet the remnant of beauty was unmistakable and her intimate knowledge of it and its power even more so emily got to her feet with a trifle more haste than dignity it was a long time since charlotte had seen her the least out of composure and it was telling she hoped it was not anxiety that she would not know how to behave and thus let her down aunt vespasia emily said quickly may i present my sister charlotte pitt she looked at charlotte penetratingly my great auntinlaw lady cumminggould charlotte had no need of warning how do you do maam she inclined her head very slightly enough for courtesy and too little for obsequiousness vespasia extended her hand and her eyes regarded charlotte frankly from toe to top ending with a direct stare from her flittering old eyes how do you do mrs pitt she answered levelly emily has often spoken of you i am pleased that you have been able to call she did not add at last but it was in her voice charlotte doubted that emily had spoken of her at all still less that it had been often it would have been most injudiciousand emily had never been injudicious in her lifebut she could hardly argue neither could she think of a suitable answer thank you seemed so foolish it is kind of you to make me welcome she heard herself saying i hope you are staying to luncheon it was a question oh yes emily rushed in quickly before charlotte had time to flounder of course she will stay and this afternoon we shall go calling charlotte drew breath to make some excuse she could not possibly go around paragon walk with emily dressed in gray muslin momentarily she was angry with emily for putting her in such a position she turned to glare at her aunt vespasia cleared her throat sharply and who precisely did you have it in mind to call upon emily looked at charlotte realized her mistake and fished herself out of it with aplomb i thought selena montague she admires herself in plum pink and charlotte will look so much better in it i should enjoy putting her in my new silk and obliging selena to look at her i do not care for selena she added as an aside to charlotte quite unnecessarily and the dress will fit you excellently the foolish dressmaker got her fingers muddled and made it much too long for me aunt vespasia allowed her a small smile of admiration i thought it was jessamyn nash you disliked she remarked casually i like irritating jessamyn emily waved a hand that is not really the same thing i have never thought whether i like her or not whom do you like charlotte inquired wanting to know more about the walk now that she was freed from the immediate problem of dress her mind went back to fanny nash and the fear that the others seemed to have forgotten oh emily considered for a moment i quite like phoebe nash jessamyns sisterinlaw if she would be a little more definite and i like albertine dilbridge although i have no patience with her mother and i like diggory nash but i do not know why i can think of nothing in particular to say about him that is good luncheon was announced and the three of them departed for the dining room charlotte had not seen a meal of such simple grace for a long time perhaps not ever it was all cold and yet of such delicacy that it must have taken hours to prepare in the still heat it was delicious just to contemplate the cold soups fresh salmon with minute cold vegetables ices sherbets and fruit she was halfway through eating it elegantly as if she ate such things every day when she remembered pitt would probably be chewing through heavy bread sandwiches with a little cold meat in them if he was fortunate if not then cheese dry and clogging in the mouth she put her fork down the peas rolling away neither emily nor vespasia noticed it took half an hour much critical surveying by emily and a least a dozen pins before charlotte was satisfied that she looked acceptable in the plum silk and could go calling to the walk actually she was rather more than satisfied it was a very good quality silk indeed and the color was remarkably flattering to her the warmth of it against the honey of her skin and the richness of her hair was enough to carry her away in a flight of vanity it was going to hurt to take it off and give it back to emily at the end of the afternoon the gray muslin had lost all its appeal it no longer looked smart merely drab and very much last years aunt vespasia complimented her with dry humor as she came down the stairs but she met the old ladys eyes without a flicker and hoped she had no idea how many pins there were in it or how hard she had relaced her stays to get into emilys old waist she thanked vespasia and walked with emily out into the sunlight on the carriageway head high and back very straight actually it was more than a little uncomfortable to hold herself in any other way and she would have to sit with care it was only a hundred yards or so to selena montagues house and emily said very little on the way they knocked at the door and were let in immediately by a smart maid in black and lace obviously poised to expect callers apparently mrs montague was in the garden at the back and they were invited to join her the house was elegant and expensive although charlottes practiced eye could see tiny economies a mend in the fringe of a lampshade a cushion whose upholstery had obviously been turned the new piece from the underside darker against the faded wings she had done the same herself and knew the signs selena was sitting in a wicker chaise lounge her arms dangling over the sides her face lifted upward but protected from the harsh sun by a floppy flowerdecked hat she had excellent features although her nose was perhaps a trifle sharp her eyes were wide and brown long lashed and she opened them with intense interest when she saw charlotte my dear selena emily began in her best voice how charming you look and so cool may i present my sister charlotte pitt who has called upon me selena did not move but surveyed charlotte with barely disguised curiosity charlotte had an unpleasant feeling that nothing had been missed from her rather worn best boots to every pin in her dress how delightful selena said at last so she glanced down at charlottes boots again considerateof you to have come i am sure we shall all enjoy your company charlotte felt her temper rise instantly above all things she hated to be patronized i hope i shall also enjoy yours she said with a cool smile the implication was not missed by selena and from the pressure of emilys fingers on her arm charlotte knew that she too had taken the point you must come and dine with us sometime selena went on these summer evenings are so warm we frequently eat out here the strawberries are quite delicious this year dont you think so strawberries were utterly beyond charlottes budgeting very sweet she agreed perhaps it is the sun no doubt selena was not interested in where they came from she looked up at emily please sit down im sure you would like some refreshment you must be dreadfully hot charlotte saw emilys face tighten at the implication and her cheeks did look flushed perhaps a sherbet selena smiled and you mrs pitt something cooling whatever you care for yourself mrs montague charlotte put in before emily could speak i would not wish to put you to inconvenience i assure you it is no inconvenience selena said with a touch of tartness she reached out and rang a small bell on the table and its sharp sound was answered by a maid in starched white selena gave elaborate orders then she turned to emily again have you seen poor jessamyn emily sat in a white wroughtiron chair and charlotte perched on another beside her carefully so as not to burst a pin no emily replied i did leave my card of course and a small letter to express my condolences selena struggled to hide her disappointment and failed pour soul she murmured she must be feeling quite dreadful one simply cannot imagine it i hoped perhaps you had seen her and could tell me something emily knew immediately that selena had not seen her either and was consumed with curiosity one doesnt even wish to try she shivered im sure she has the sympathy of absolutely everyone i have no doubt each of us will call upon her in the next weeks it would be inhuman not to even gentlemen will call im sure it would be the least they could do to comfort her the nostrils flared on selenas sharp little nose i would not have thought any comfort possible after ones sisterinlaw has been violated practically on ones doorstep and has staggered in to die literally in ones arms there was an unspecified criticism of emily in her tone i think i should retire altogether if such a thing happened to me i might even become quite deranged she said it very certainly as if she were in no doubt that such a thing had already happened to jessamyn good gracious emily affected horror surely you dont imagine it will happen again do you i didnt even know you had a sisterinlaw i dont selena snapped i was merely saying how i sympathize with poor jessamyn and that we must not expect too much of her we must be understanding if she seems a little oddat least i am sure i shall be im sure you will my dear emily leaned forward her voice cooing im sure you would never intentionally be unkind to anyone charlotte wondered if emily were not giving her credit for rather many accidents it must be very difficult to know what to say charlotte suggested i should not know whether avoiding the subject might seem as if i were indifferent to her loss or then on the other hand discussing it might appear like curiosity which would be so vulgar selenas face hardened taking the inference perfectly how very frank of you she said with wideeyed surprise as if she had discovered something alive in the salad are you always socandidabout your thoughts mrs pitt im afraid so it is my greatest social disadvantage now let her find a civil answer to that oh well i dare say it cannot be too serious selena replied cooly your sister does not appear even to be aware of it i am inured to it emily smiled dazzlingly at her i have suffered disaster upon disaster now i only bring her to call upon friends i know i can trust she met selenas brown eyes squarely charlotte nearly choked trying to maintain a sober face selena was outmaneuvered and she knew it how kind she murmured pointlessly she took the tray from the maid do have some sherbet there was a natural silence after this for a little while as they dipped their spoons into the cool delicacy charlotte wanted to use the opportunity to learn something more about the people perhaps something that pitt as an obvious policeman could not observe but all the questions in her head were too clumsy and she had not decided precisely what she needed to know she sat with the sherbet dish in her hand and stared at the roses on the far wall it reminded her a little of cater street and her parents home only this was grander lusher it seemed such an unlikely place for a sordid crime like rape embezzlement or fraud she could have understood or of course burglary but did men who lived in houses like these ever rape anyone surely no matter how eccentric their tastes or even pervertedshe had heard that there were such thingsmen from paragon walk could afford to pay to indulge them and there were always people who catered everywhere from the teeming rookeries to the expensive brothels even boys and children unless of course some particular woman was tormenting them teasing and flaunting herself but from everyones descriptions fanny nash had been anything but a flirtin fact decidedly gauche thomas had said jessamyn made as much a point of it as was only just short of unkindness and emily had borne her out she was still thinking about it convincing herself it had been some drunken coachman from the dilbridges party and nothing to touch emily when she was distracted by voices across the lawn she turned to see two elderly ladies dressed in identical turquoise muslin and lace although the styles were different as suited their vastly different figures one was tall and gaunt flatchested the other small and rotund with a high overstuffed bosom and plump little hands and feet miss lucinda horbury selena introduced the small one and miss laetitia horbury she turned to the taller i am sure you have not met lady ashworths sister mrs pitt greetings were exchanged with elaborately concealed curiosity and more sherbet was brought when the maid had left miss lucinda turned to charlotte my dear mrs pitt how good of you to call of course you have come to comfort poor emily after the dreadful happening isnt it too appalling charlotte made polite noises scrambling to think of something useful to ask but miss lucinda did not really require a reply i really dont know what things are coming to she went on warming to the subject im sure when i was young such things never occurred in decent society although of course she glanced at her sister we did have those among us whose morals were not without fault indeed miss laetitias faint eyebrows rose i dont recall that i knew any but perhaps you had a wider circle than i miss lucindas plump face tightened but she ignored the remark lifting her shoulder slightly and looking toward charlotte i expect you have heard all about it mrs pitt poor dear fanny nash was vilely assaulted and then stabbed to death we are all quite shattered the nashes have lived in the walk for years i dare say for generations a very good family indeed i was talking to mr afton thats the eldest of the brothers you know only yesterday he has such dignity dont you think she flushed and looked at selena then emily and returned to charlotte he is such a sober man she continued one can hardly imagine his having a sister who would meet with such an end of course mr diggory is a good deal moremore liberal she pronounced the word carefully in his tastes but i always say there are things a man may acceptably do even if they are not very pleasant which would be quite unthinkable in a womaneven of the loosest order again she lifted her shoulder a little and glanced momentarily at her sister are you saying that fanny somehow invited her attack charlotte asked frankly she felt the ripple of amazement in the others and ignored it keeping her eyes on miss lucindas pink face miss lucinda sniffed well really mrs pitt one would hardly expect such a nature of thing to happen to a woman who waschaste she would not allow herself to be put in such a circumstance i am sure that you have never been molested and neither have any of us perhaps that is no more than our good fortune charlotte suggested then added lest she embarrass emily too much if he were a madman he might imagine all sorts of things that were entirely false might he not utterly without reason i have no acquaintance with madmen miss lucinda said fiercely charlotte smiled nor i with rapists miss horbury everything i say is only a surmise miss laetitia flashed her a smile so quick it was gone almost as soon as it had appeared miss lucinda sniffed harder naturally mrs pitt i hope you did not imagine for a moment that anything i said was from any kind of personal knowledge i assure you i was no more than sympathizing with poor mr nashto have such a disgrace within his family disgrace charlotte was too angry even to try to control her tongue i see it as a tragedy miss horbury a terror if you like but hardly a disgrace well miss lucinda bridled well really is that what mr nash said charlotte pressed ignoring a sharp nudge from emilys boot did he say it was a disgrace really i do not recall his words but he was most certainly aware of thethe obscenity of it she shuddered and snorted down her nose i am quite terrified at the mere thought myself i believe mrs pitt if you lived in the walk you would feel as we do why our maid poor child fainted clean away this morning when the next door bootboy spoke to her thats another three of our best cups gone perhaps you could reassure her that the man is probably miles away from her now charlotte suggested after all with the police investigating and everyone looking for him this is the last place he would be likely to remain oh one must not lie mrs pitt even to servants miss lucinda said sharply i dont see why not miss laetitia put in with mildness if it is for their good i always said you had no sense of morals miss lucinda glared at her sister who can say where the creature is now i am sure mrs pitt cannot he is obviously possessed by uncontrollable passions abnormal hungers too dreadful for a decent woman to contemplate charlotte was tempted to point out that miss lucinda had done little else but contemplate them since she had arrived and it was only sensibility for emily that prevented her selena shivered perhaps he is some depraved creature from the underworld excited by women of quality satins and laces cleanliness she said to no one in particular or perhaps he lives here in the walk and naturally chooses his own to prey uponwho else it was a gentle light voice but distinctly masculine they all whirled round as one to see fulbert nash only two yards from them on the grass a dish of sherbet in his hand good afternoon selena lady ashworth miss lucinda miss laetitia he looked at charlotte with raised eyebrows my sister mrs pitt emily said tightly and that is an appalling thing to say mr nash it is an appalling crime maam and life can be appalling have you not observed not mine mr nash how charming of you he sat down opposite them emily blinked charming that is one of the most restful qualities of women he replied the ability to see only what is pleasant it makes them so comfortable to be with dont you think so mrs pitt i should think it would make for extreme insecurity charlotte replied with candor one would never know whether one was dealing with the truth or not personally i should be forever wondering what it was i did not know and so like pandora you would open the box and let disaster loose upon the world he looked over the sherbet at her he had very fine hands how unwise of you there are so many things it is safer not to know we all have our secrets his eyes flickered round the small group even in paragon walk if any man says he is without sin he deceives himself you didnt expect to hear me quote from the good book did you lady ashworth if you stroll along the walk mrs pitt your naked eye will see perfect houses stone upon stone but your spiritual eye if you have one will see a row of whited sepulchers is that not so selena before selena could reply there was a slight clatter as a maid jiggled yet more sherbet on her tray and they turned to see a most beautiful woman coming across the grass seeming almost to gloat as the faint warm air moved the white and watergreen silk of her dress selenas face hardened jessamyn how charming to see you i had not expected you to have such fortitude to be about how i admire you my dear do join us and meet mrs pitt emilys sister from she lifted her eyebrows but no one answered her there were brief acknowledgements what an attractive gown selena went on looking at jessamyn again only you could get away with wearing such aan anaemic color on me i swear it would look quite disastrous so so washed out charlotte turned to jessamyn and observed from her expression that she understood selenas meaning perfectly her composure was exquisite dont be depressed my dear selena we cannot all wear the same things but im sure there must be some colors which will suit you excellently she looked at the gorgeous gown selena was wearing lavender appliqued with plumpink lace not that maybe she said slowly had you thought of something a little cooler perhaps blue so flattering to the higher complexion in this trying weather selena was furious her eyes spat something that looked as deep as hatred charlotte was surprised and a little taken aback to see it we go to too many of the same places selena said between her teeth and i should dislike above all things to be thought to ape your tastesin anything one should at all costs be original do you not agree mrs pitt she turned to charlotte charlotte acutely conscious of emilys madeover dress full of pins could not summon a reply she was still shaken by the hatred she had seen and fulbert nashs ugly remark about whited sepulchers oddly it was fulbert who rescued her up to a point he said casually originality can so easily become outlandish and one can end up a positive eccentric dont you think so miss lucinda miss lucinda snorted and declined to reply emily and charlotte excused themselves shortly afterward and as emily obviously did not feel like making any further calls they went home what an extraordinary man fulbert nash is charlotte commented as they climbed the stairs whatever did he mean about whited sepulchers how should i know emily snapped perhaps he has a guilty conscience over what fanny ive no idea he is a thoroughly horrible person all the nashes are except diggory afton is perfectly beastly and whenever people are horrible themselves they tend to think everyone else is too charlotte could not leave well enough alone do you think he really does know something about all the people in the walk didnt miss lucinda say the nashes had lived here for generations shes a silly old gossip emily crossed the landing and went into her dressing room she took charlottes old muslin dress off its hanger you should have more sense than to listen to her charlotte began searching for the pins in the plum silk taking them out slowly but if the nashes have lived here for years then maybe mr nash does know a lot about everyone people do when they live close to each other and they remember well he doesnt know anything about me because there isnt anything to know at last charlotte was silent the real fear was out of course mr nash did not know anything about emily but then no one would suspect emily of rape and murder but what did he know about george george had lived here every summer of his life i wasnt thinking of you she slipped the plum dress to the floor of course not emily picked it up and passed her the gray muslin you were thinking of george just because im with child and george is a gentleman and doesnt have to work like thomas you think hes out gambling and drinking at his club and having affairs and that he could have taken a fancy to fanny nash and refused to be put off i dont think anything of the kind charlotte took the muslin and put it on slowly it was more comfortable than the plum and she had let her stays out an inch but it looked inexpressibly drab but it seems that you are afraid of it emily whirled around her face red rubbish i know george and i believe in him charlotte did not argue the fear was too high in emilys voice the sharp corrosive poison of anxiety eating away in weeks perhaps days it would turn to question doubt or even actual suspicion and george was bound to have made some mistakes somewhere said or done something foolish something better forgotten of course she said softly and hopefully thomas will soon find whoever did it and we can begin to forget the whole thing thank you for lending me your dress four emily spent a miserable evening george was at home but she could think of nothing to say to him she wanted to ask him all sorts of questions but they would have betrayed her doubts so openly that she dared not and she was afraid of his answers even if he kept his patience with her and was neither hurt nor angry if he told her the truth would there be something she would wish with all her heart she had never known she had no illusions that george was perfect she had accepted when she had first determined to marry him that he gambled and occasionally drank more than was good for him she even accepted that from time to time he would flirt with other women and normally she regarded it as harmless enough the same sort of game she indulged in herself just a sort of practice a refining of ones skills so as not to become too domestic and taken for granted it had been hard at times even confusing but she had accommodated to his manner of life with great skill it was only that lately she had been most unlike herself upset over trivialities and even inclined to weep which was appalling she had never had patience with weepy women or those given to fainting for that matterand this last month she had done both she excused herself and went to bed early but although she fell asleep straight away she awoke several times through the night and in the morning felt miserably sick for over an hour she had been most unfair to charlotte and she knew it charlotte wanted to learn all she could about the walk because she wished to protect emily from the very things that gnawed at the back of her mind now part of her loved charlotte for it and for a hundred other reasons but there was a loud strident voice in her just now that hated her because even in her oldfashioned dull gray muslin she was secure and comfortable with no ugly fears at the back of her mind she knew perfectly well that thomas was not out flirting with anyone else no social behavior of charlottes would ever make him wonder if he had been wise to marry beneath him or if charlotte could maintain his social position and be a credit to him there was no pressure to produce a son to carry on the title admittedly thomas was a policeman of all things and quite the oddest creature as homely as a kitchen pot and wildly untidy but he knew how to laugh and emily had a knowledge inside her she kept unspoken that he was cleverer than george perhaps he was clever enough to find out who murdered fanny nash before suspicions uncovered all kinds of old guilts and wounds in the walk and they could keep up the small chosen masks no one really wanted to see behind she could not stomach any breakfast and it was luncheon before she saw aunt vespasia you look very peaked emily vespasia said with a frown i hope you are eating sufficiently in your condition it is most important yes thank you aunt vespasia indeed she was hungry now and took herself a very liberal portion hmph vespasia picked up the tongs and helped herself to half the amount then you are worrying you must not mind selena montague emily looked up at her sharply selena why should you think i am worrying about selena because she is an idle woman who has neither husband nor child to concern herself with vespasia said tartly she has set her cap unsuccessfully so far at the frenchman selena does not care for failure she was her fathers favorite child you know and she has never got over it she is perfectly welcome to monsieur alaric as far as i am concerned emily replied i have no interest in him vespasia gave her a sharp look nonsense child every healthy woman has an interest in a man like that when i look at him even i can remember what it was like to be young and believe me when i was young i was beautiful i would have made him look at me emily felt the laughter inside her im sure you would aunt vespasia i wouldnt be surprized if he preferred your company even now dont flatter me child im an old woman but i havent lost my wits emily remained smiling why didnt you tell me about your sister before vespasia demanded i did i told you about her the day after you came and later i told you she had married a policeman you said she was not conventional i grant you her tongue is a disaster and she walks as though she thought herself a duchess but you did not say that she was so handsome emily suppressed a desire to giggle it would be most unfair to mention the pins or the stays oh yes she agreed charlotte was always striking for better or worse but many people find her too striking to be comfortable only traditional beauty is admired by most people you know and she does not know how to flirt unfortunate vespasia agreed it is one of the arts that cannot possibly be taught either you have it or you have not charlotte hasnt i hope she calls again it should prove most entertaining i am bored with everyone here unless jessamyn and selena improve their battle over the frenchman we shall have to create some diversion of our own or the summer will become intolerable are you well enough to go to the funeral of that poor child have you remembered it is the day after tomorrow emily had not remembered i expect i shall be fine but i think i shall ask charlotte if she will accompany me it is bound to be trying and i should like to have her there also it would be an opportunity to apologize to her for yesterdays unfairness i shall write straightaway and ask her you will have to lend her something black vespasia warned or perhaps you had better find something of mine i believe we are more of a height get agnes to alter that lavender for her if she starts now she should have it quite acceptable by then thank you that is very kind of you nonsense i can always have another one made if i wish you had better find her a black hat and shawl as well i havent got any cant bear black wont you wear black to the funeral yourself havent got any i shall wear lavender then your sister will not be the only one no one will dare criticize her if i wear lavender also charlotte received the letter from emily with surprise and then when she opened it a wave of relief spread through her the apology was simple not a matter of good manners but a genuine expression of regret she was so happy she nearly missed the part about the funeral and not to worry about a dress but would she please come because emily would greatly value her presence at such a time a carriage would be sent in the morning to collect her if she would prepare herself by having someone take care of jemima of course she would go not only because emily wanted her to but also because all the walk surely would be there and she could not resist the opportunity of seeing them she told pitt about it that evening as soon as he was through the door emily asked me to go to the funeral with her she said her arms still round him in welcome its the day after tomorrow and i shall leave jemima with mrs smithshe wont mindand emily will send a carriage and she has a dress organized for me pitt did not question how one organized a dress and as she was wriggling to free herself in order the better to explain he let her go with a wry smile are you sure you want to he asked it will be a grim affair emily wants me to be there she said it as if it were a complete answer he knew immediately from the luminous rationality in her eyes that she was evading the issue she wanted to go out of curiosity she saw his wide smile and knew she had not fooled him in the least she shrugged and relaxed into a smile herself all right i want to see them but i promise i shall do no more than look i shant interfere what have you discovered i have a right to ask because it involves emily his face closed over and he sat down at the table leaning his elbows on it he looked tired and rumpled suddenly she realized her selfishness in ignoring his feelings and thinking only of emily she had just learned how to make good lemonade without all the quantity of expensive fresh fruit that she would have used before her marriage she kept it in a bucket of cold water on the stones near the back door quickly she poured him some and put the glass in front of him she did not ask the question again he drank the whole glassful and then answered her ive been trying to check where everyone was im afraid no one remembers whether george was at his club on that evening or not i pressed as hard as i dared but they dont recall one evening from another in fact im not honestly sure how much they recall one person from another a lot of them look and sound much the same to me he smiled slowly silly isnt iti suppose most of us look the same to them she sat silent it was the one thing she had been praying for that george would be cleared beyond question quickly completely im sorry he reached out and touched her hand she closed her fingers over his hand im sure you tried did you clear anyone else not really everyone can account for themselves but it cant be proved surely some can not proved he looked up his eyes clouded afton and fulbert nash were at home and together most of the time but not all but they were her brothers she said with a shudder surely you dont think they could possibly be so depraved do you no but i suppose it isnt impossible diggory nash was gambling but his friends are peculiarly reticent about exactly who was where and when algernon burnon implies he was on a matter of honor which he wont divulge i imagine that means he was having an affair and in the circumstances he dares not say so hallam cayley was at the dilbridges party and had a row he went for a walk to cool off again its not likely he left the garden and somehow found fanny but it is possible the frenchman paul alaric says he was at home alone and thats probably true but again we cant prove it how about the servants after all they are far more likely she must keep it in proportion not let fulberts words warp her thinking or the footmen and coachmen from the party she added he smiled slightly understanding her thoughts were working on them but nearly all of them stayed together in groups swapping gossip and bragging or else were inside getting something to eat and servants are too busy to have much time unaccounted for she knew that was true she could remember from the days when she had lived in cater street that footmen and butlers did not have spare time in the evenings to go wandering outside a bell might summon them at any moment to open the door or bring a tray of port or perform any other of a dozen tasks but there must be something she protested aloud its all sonebulous nobodys guilty and nobodys really innocent something must be provable not yet except for most of the servants they can account she did not argue anymore she stood up and began to serve his meal placing it carefully trying to make it look delicate and cool it was nothing like emilys but then she had made it for a twentieth of the price all except for the fruitshe had been a little extravagant to buy that the funeral was the most magnificently somber affair charlotte had ever been to the day was overcast and sultry hot she was collected by emilys carriage before nine in the morning and taken straight to paragon walk she was welcomed quickly emilys eyes warm with relief to see her and to know that the outburst of the other day was forgotten there was no time for refreshments or gossip emily rushed her upstairs and presented her with an exquisite deeplavender dress far more elaborate and formal than anything she had seen emily wear there was a sort of grand dame effect to it she could not reconcile with emily as she knew her she held it up and stared over its regal neckline oh emily sighed with a faint smile its aunt vespasias but i think you will look wonderful in it very stately her smile widened then she flushed with guilt remembering the occasion i think you are very like aunt vespasia in some waysor you might be in fifty years charlotte remembered that pitt had said much the same thing and found herself rather flattered thank you she put the dress down and turned for emily to unbutton her own dress so that she might change she was all prepared to reach for pins again but was amazed to find that none were necessary it fitted her almost as well as any of her own it could have done with an inch more across the shoulder but other than that it was perfect she surveyed herself in the cheval glass the effect was quite startling and really very handsome come on emily said sharply there isnt time to stand there admiring yourself you must put black over it or it will hardly be decent i know lavender is mourning as well but you look like a duchess about to receive theres this black shawl dont fidget its not in the least hot and it darkens the whole thing and black gloves of course and ive found a black hat for you charlotte did not dare ask where she had found it perhaps she would be happier not to know still it was church so it was necessary to wear a hat apart from the obligations of fashion when the hat came it was extravagant broad brimmed feathered and veiled she set it on her head at rather a rakish angle and started emily giggling oh this is awful please charlotte do watch what you say im so nervous about it you make me laugh when i dont mean it at all inside i am doing everything i can not to think of that poor girl im occupying my mind with all sorts of other things even silly things just to keep the thought of her away charlotte put her arm around her i know i know youre not heartless we all laugh sometimes when we really want to cry tell me do i look ridiculous in this hat emily put out both her hands and altered the angle a little she was already in the soberest black herself no no it looks very well jessamyn will be furious because afterward everyone will look at you and wonder who you are bring the veil down a little and then they will have to come closer to see there thats perfect dont fiddle with it the cortege was aweinspiring in the deadest black black horses pulling a black hearse blackcreperibboned coachmen and blackplumed harness the chief mourners followed immediately behind in another black fluttering carriage and then the rest of the attendants everything moved at the most august walk charlotte sat with emily george and aunt vespasia in their carriage and wondered why a people who profess a total belief in resurrection should make a melodrama out of death it was rather like bad theater it was a question she frequently had considered but had never found anyone appropriate to ask she had hoped one day to meet a bishop although there seemed little chance of it now she had mentioned it to papa once and received a very stiff reply which silenced her completely but in no way provided an answerexcept that papa obviously did not know either and found the whole matter grossly distasteful now she climbed out of the carriage taking georges hand to alight gracefully without tipping the black hat to an even more rakish angle then side by side with aunt vespasia followed emily and george through the gate of the churchyard and up the path to the door inside the organ was playing the death march with rather more exuberance than was entirely fitting and with several notes so wrong that even charlotte winced to hear them she wondered if the organist were the regular one or an enthusiastic amateur drafted in ignorance for the occasion the service itself was very dull but mercifully short possibly the vicar did not wish to mention the manner of death in all its worldly reality in such an unworldly place it did not belong with stainedglass windows organ music and little sniffles into lace handkerchiefs death was pain and sickness and terror of the long blind last step and there had been nothing resigned or dignified in it for fanny it was not that charlotte did not believe in god or the resurrection it was the attempt to soothe away the ugly truths with ritual that she hated all this elaborate expensive mourning was for the conscience of the living so that they might feel they had paid due tribute and now could decently forget fanny and continue with the season it had little to do with the girl and whether they had cared for her or not afterward they all went out to the graveyard for the interment the air was hot and heavy as if it had already been breathed and tasted faintly stale the soil was dry from long weeks without rain and the gravediggers had had to hack at it to break it the only damp spot anywhere was under the yew trees settling lower and lower to the earth and it smelled old and sour as if the roots had fed on too many bodies ridiculous things funerals aunt vespasia whispered sharply from beside her greatest fit of selfindulgence in society its worse than ascot everyone seeing who can mourn the most conspicuously some women look very well in black and know it and youll see them at all the fashionable funerals whether they were acquainted with the deceased or not maria clerkenwell was always doing that met her first husband at the funeral of his cousin he was the chief mourner because he inherited the title maria had never heard of the dead man before she read it in the society pages and decided to go secretly charlotte admired her enterprise it was something emily might have done she stared across the open grave past the pallbearers redfaced and glistening with sweat to jessamyn nash standing erect and pale at the far side the man closest to her was less then handsome but there was something pleasing in his face a readiness to smile is that her husband charlotte asked softly vespasia followed her eye diggory she agreed bit of a rake but always was the best of the nashes not that that is granting him much from what charlotte had heard of afton and seen of fulbert she could not disagree she continued to stare trusting to her veil to disguise the fact really veils were of very practical convenience she had never tried one before but she must remember it for the future diggory and jessamyn were standing a little apart he made no effort to touch her or support her in fact his attention seemed to be turned rather toward aftons wife phoebe who looked perfectly awful her hair seemed to have slipped to one side and her hat to the other and although she made one or two feeble gestures to readjust it each time she made it worse like everyone else she was in black but on her it seemed dusty the black of the sweep rather than the glossy ravenswing black of jessamyns gown afton stood to attention by her side his face expressionless whatever he felt it was beneath his dignity to display it here the vicar held up his hand for attention the faint whisperings stopped he intoned the familiar words charlotte wondered why they intoned it always sounded so much less sincere than to speak in a normal voice she had never heard people who were really emotionally moved speak in such a fashion they were too much consumed in the content to take such pains with the manner surely god was the last person to be swayed by dressing up and affecting airs she looked up through her veil and wondered if anyone else was thinking the same things or were they all properly impressed jessamyn had her head down she was stiff pale and beautiful as a lily a little rigid but very appropriate phoebe was weeping selena montague was becomingly pale although to judge from her lips she had not altogether left nature unaided and her eyes were as bright as fever she was standing beside the most singularly elegant man charlotte had ever seen he was tall and slender but there was a litheness to him as if his body were hard far from the foppish rather feminine grace of so many fashionable people he was bareheaded as were all the other men and his black hair was thick and smooth she could see when he turned how perfectly it grew in the nape of his neck she did not need to ask vespasia who he was with a little tingle of excitement she knewthat was the beautiful frenchmanthe one selena and jessamyn were fighting over she could not tell who was winning at the moment but he was standing next to selena or perhaps she was standing next to him but it was jessamyn who was the center of attention at least half the heads in the congregation were turned toward her the frenchman was one of the few who was looking at the coffin as it was lowered clumsily into the open grave two men with shovels stood respectfully back accustomed enough to such rituals to fall into the right attitude without conscious thought one of the few others who seemed to be genuinely caught in the turmoil of some emotion was a man on the same side of the grave as charlotte and vespasia she only noticed him at first because of the angle of his shoulders which had a tightness to them as if all his muscles were clenched inside without thinking she moved a little forward to catch sight of his face should he turn when the earth was thrown in the vicars singsong voice went through the old words about earth to earth and dust to dust the man swiveled to watch the hard clay rattle on the lid and charlotte saw his profile and then his full features it was a strong face with skin marred by smallpox and at the moment was in the grip of some deep and twisting pain was it for fanny or for death in general or was it even grief for the living because he knew or guessed something of the whited sepulchers fulbert had spoken of or was it fear charlotte stepped back and touched vespasias arm who is he hallam cayley vespasia replied widower his wife was one of the cardews she died about two years ago pretty woman lot of money but not much sense oh so that explained his tight body and the confusion of pain in his face perhaps she herself was staring around at all these people occupying her mind with questions to keep it from the memory of other funerals personal ones that hurt too much to bear recalling the ceremony was over slowly with extreme decorum they all turned as if on a single pivot and began the walk back to the road and the carriages they would meet at paragon walk again at afton nashs for the obligatory baked meats then the ritual could be considered accomplished i see you remarked the frenchman vespasia observed under her breath charlotte considered feigning innocence and decided it would not work next to selena naturally they walked or rather processed down the narrow path through the gateway and out onto the footpath afton as the eldest brother embarked into his carriage first then jessamyn with diggory a few moments behind her he had been talking to george and jessamyn was obliged to wait for him charlotte saw the flicker of irritation pass across her face fulbert had come in a separate carriage for the occasion and had offered a ride to the misses horbury dressed in ornate and antique black it took them several moments to seat themselves satisfactorily george and emily were next and charlotte found herself moving before she was really ready to leave she looked across at emily emily caught her eye and smiled wearily in return charlotte was happy to see that she had slipped her hand into georges and he was holding it protectively the funeral breakfast was very splendid as she had expected it to be there was nothing ostentatiousone did not draw attention to a death that had come about in such an appalling mannerbut there was enough to feed half of society on the great table and charlotte thought at a quick estimation that every man woman and child on her own street could have lived on it for a month with care people split into little groups whispering together no one wishing to be the first to begin why do we always eat after funerals charlotte asked unconsciously frowning ive never felt less like it convention george replied looking at her he had the finest eyes she had ever seen its the only sort of hospitality everyone understands anyway what else could one do we cant simply stand here and we can hardly dance charlotte suppressed a desire to giggle it was as formal and ridiculous as an oldfashioned dance she glanced around the room he was right everyone was a little awkward and eating eased the tension it would be vulgar to show emotion at least for men women were expected to be frail though weeping was frowned upon because it was embarrassing and no one knew what to do about it but one could always faint that was quite acceptable and gave one the perfect excuse to retire eating was an occupation that covered the hiatus between obvious mourning and the time when one could decently go and leave the whole matter of death behind emily put out her hand to claim charlottes attention she turned to find herself facing a woman in extremely expensive black with a rather heavyset man beside her may i present my sister mrs pitt lord and lady dilbridge charlotte responded with the usual courtesies such a dreadful affair grace dilbridge said with a sigh and such a shock one would never have expected it of the nashes surely one cannot expect such a thing of anyone charlotte rejoined except the most wretched and desperate of people she was thinking of the slums and rookeries pitt had spoken of but even he had told her little of the real horror she had only guessed as much from the hollow look of his face and his long silences as from anything he had said i always thought poor fanny such an innocent child frederick dilbridge went on as if in answer to her poor jessamyn all this is going to be very hard for her and for algernon grace added looking out of the corner of her eye to where algernon burnon was turning away a baked pie and helping himself to another glass of port from the footman poor boy thank god he was not yet married to her charlotte could not entirely see the relevance he must be very grieved she said slowly i cannot imagine a worse way to lose ones fiancee better than a wife grace insisted at least he is now freeafter a decent interval of courseto find himself someone more suitable and the nashes had no other daughter frederick also took a glass as the footman hovered thats something to be thankful for thankful charlotte could hardly believe it of course grace looked at her with raised eyebrows you must be aware mrs pitt how hard it is to get ones daughters married well as it is to have a scandal such as this in the family would make it well nigh impossible i should not wish any son of mine to marry a girl whose sister waswell she coughed delicately and glared at charlotte for obliging her to put into words something so crass all i can say is i am vastly relieved my son is already married a daughter of the marchioness of weybridge a delightful girl do you know the weybridges no charlotte shook her head and mistaking her meaning the footman whisked the tray away and she was left with an empty hand outstretched no one took any notice and she withdrew it no i dont there was no polite reply to this so grace returned to the original subject daughters are such an anxiety until one has them married my dear she turned to emily reaching out her hand i do so hope that you have only sonsso much less vulnerable the world accepts the weaknesses of men and we have learned to put up with them but when a woman is weak all society completely abhors her poor fanny may she rest in peace now my dear i must go and see phoebe she looks quite ill i must see what i can do to comfort her thats monstrous charlotte said as soon as they were gone anyone would think from the way she speaks that fanny went out whoring charlotte emily said sharply for goodness sake dont use words like that here anyway only men go out whoring you know what i mean its unforgivable that girl is dead abused and murdered here in her own street and they are all talking about marriage opportunities and what society will think its disgusting sh emilys hand gripped her hand her fingers digging in painfully people will hear you and they wouldnt understand she smiled with rather more force than charm as selena approached them by her side george breathed in deeply and let it out in a sigh hello emily selena said brightly i must compliment you it must be a most trying experience and looking at you one could hardly tell i do admire your fortitude she was a smaller woman than charlotte had realized fully eight or ten inches shorter than george she looked up at him through her eyelashes george passed some trivial remark there was a faint flush on the bones of his cheeks charlotte glanced at emily and saw her face tighten for once emily seemed to think of nothing to say we must also admire you charlotte stared at selena pointedly you carry it so well indeed if i did not know you must naturally be distressed i would swear you were positively gay there was a sharp intake of breath from emily but charlotte ignored her george shifted from one foot to the other color rushed up selenas face but she chose her words carefully oh mrs pitt if you knew me better you could not imagine me callous i am a most warmhearted person am i not george again she looked at him with her enormous eyes please do not let mrs pitt think i am cold you know it is not so ii am sure she does not believe it george was palpably uncomfortable she only meant thaterthat you comport yourself admirably selena smiled at emily who stood frozen i should not care for anyone to think i was unfeeling she added the last little touch charlotte moved closer to emily wanting to protect her guessing vividly what the threat was feeling it in selenas dazzling eyes i am flattered you care so much what i should think of you charlotte said coolly she would like to have forced a smile but she had never been good at acting i promise you i shall not make any hasty judgments i am sure you are capable of great she looked directly at selena allowing her to see she picked the word intentionally with all its shades of meaning generosity i see your husband is not with you selenas reply was vicious and unhesitating charlotte was able to smile this time she was proud of what thomas was doing even though she knew they would have held it in contempt no he is otherwise engaged he has a great deal to do how unfortunate selena murmured but without conviction the satisfaction was gone out of her it was not long after that that charlotte got her opportunity to meet algernon burnon she was introduced by phoebe nash whose hat was now straight though her hair still looked uncomfortable charlotte knew the sensation all too well a pin or two in the wrong place and it could feel as if all the weight of ones hair were attached to ones head with nails algernon bowed very slightly a courteous gesture charlotte found a little discomposing he seemed more concerned for her comfort than his own she had prepared herself for grief and he was asking her about her health and if she found the heat trying she swallowed the sympathy she had had on the edge of her tongue and made as sensible a reply as she could perhaps he found it all too painful to dwell on and was glad of the chance to speak to someone who had not known fanny how little one could really tell from faces she was floundering too conscious that he had been close to fanny and too busy with her own confusion wondering whether he had loved her or if it had been a very much arranged affair or if perhaps he even was relieved to be free of it she hardly noticed his conversation though part of her brain was telling her it was both literate and easy im sorry she apologized she had no idea what he had just said perhaps mrs pitt finds our baked meats a little diverseas i do charlotte turned sharply to find the frenchman only a few feet away from her his fine intelligent eyes carefully hiding a smile she was not quite sure what he meant he could not possibly have known the wanderings of her mindor was he thinking the same things perhaps even knowing them honesty was the only safe retreat i am not experienced in them she replied i have no idea what they usually are if algernon had any understanding of the ambiguity in her words he did not betray it mrs pitt may i present monsieur paul alaric he said easily i dont believe you have met mrs pitt is lady ashworths sister he added by way of explanation alaric bowed very slightly i am well aware who mrs pitt is his smile removed any discourtesy from his words did you imagine such a person could visit the walk and not be talked of im sorry it is a tragic occasion that has afforded us the opportunity to meet you it was ridiculous but she found herself coloring under his calm gaze for all his grace he was unusually direct as if his intelligence could penetrate the polite rather empty mask of her face and see all the confused feelings behind there was nothing unkind in his stare only curiosity and faint amusement she pulled herself together sharply she must be very tired from the heat and all this mourning to be so stupid how do you do monsieur alaric she said stiffly then because that did not seem enough yes it is unfortunate that it frequently takes tragedy to rearrange our lives his mouth curled in the slightest most delicate smile are you going to rearrange my life mrs pitt the heat scorched up her face please heaven the veil would hide it youyou misunderstand me monsieur i meant the tragedy our meeting can hardly be of importance how modest of you mrs pitt selena drifted up wafting black chiffon behind her her face bright i judged from your marvelous gown that you had imagined otherwise do they always wear lavender for mourning where you come from of course it is easier to wear than black why thank you charlotte forced a smile and feared it might be more like bared teeth she looked selena up and down yes i imagine it is im sure you would find it flattering too i do not go around from funeral to funeral mrs pitt only to those of people i know selena snapped back with tart meaning i dont imagine i shall be requiring it again before this style has gone quite out of fashion sort of one funeral per season charlotte murmured why did she dislike this woman so much was it only an identification with emilys fears or some instinct of her own jessamyn moved toward them pale but entirely composed alaric turned toward her and a look of venom momentarily hardened selenas face before she mastered it and ironed it out she spoke quickly preempting alaric dear jessamyn what a terrible ordeal for you you must be devastated and you have comported yourself so well the whole affair has been so dignified thank you jessamyn took the glass alaric handed her from a waiting footmans tray and sipped at it delicately poor fanny is at rest but i find it hard to accept it as i suppose one should it seems so monstrously unjust she was such a child so innocent she did not even know how to flirt why her of all people her eyelids lowered slightly over her wide cool eyes and she did not quite look at selena but some minute gesture of her shoulder an arch in her body seemed addressed to her there are other people soso much morelikely charlotte stared at her the hatred between the two women was so tangible she could not believe paul alaric was unaware of it he stood elegantly with a slight smile and made some innocuous answer but surely he must feel as uncomfortable as she did or did he enjoy it was he flattered excited to be fought over the thought hurt her she wanted him to be above such a demeaning vanity to be embarrassed by it as she was then another thought occurred to her as jessamyns words sank in other people so much more likely that was a dig at selena of course but could it have been precisely fannys innocence that had attracted the rapist perhaps he was tired and bored with sophisticated women who were only too available he wanted a virgin frightened and unwilling so he could dominate her maybe that was what excited sent his blood racing the touch and the smell of terror it was an ugly thought but then the intimate violence in the dark the humiliation the symbolic stabbing knife the blood the pain life gushing awaythey were all ugly she shut her eyes please dear god it had nothing to do with emily dont let george be anything worse than easygoing a little foolish a little vain they were talking across her and she had not heard them she was conscious only of the prickling hostility and of alarics elegant black head as he half listened to one then the other somehow it seemed to charlotte as if his eyes were on her and there was an understanding in them which was uncomfortable and at the same time stirring emily found her again she was looking very tired and charlotte thought she had already been standing too long she was about to make some suggestion of returning home when she saw behind emily hallam cayley the only man she had observed to be moved by fannys death beyond the usual trappings of observance he was facing toward jessamyn but his expression was vacant as if he were unaware of her indeed the whole room with its shafts of sunlight under the half drawn blinds its glittering table spread with the debris of food its clusters of murmuring figures in black seemed to make no impression on his senses at all jessamyn caught sight of him her face changed the full lower lip came forward and the skin tightened fractionally across her cheeks for a moment it was frozen then selena spoke to alaric smiling and jessamyn turned back charlotte looked at emily havent we paid all respects necessary now i mean surely we could decently go home the heat in here is oppressive and you must be tired do i look it emily asked charlotte lied immediately and without thought not at all but surely better to leave before we do i know i feel it i expected you would be enjoying yourself trying to solve the mystery there was a faint cutting edge in emilys voice indeed she was tired the skin under her eyes looked papery charlotte pretended not to notice i dont think i have learned a thing except what you had already told methat jessamyn and selena hate each other over monsieur alaric that lord dilbridge has very liberal tastes and lady dilbridge enjoys being put upon because of them and that none of the nashes are very pleasant oh and that algernon is behaving himself with great dignity did i tell you all that emily smiled faintly i thought it was aunt vespasia but i suppose we may as well go home i admit i have had enough i find myself much more affected by it than i had thought to be i didnt care much for fanny when she was alive but now i cant help thinking of her this is her funeral and do you know hardly anybody has really spoken of her it was a sad and pathetic observation yet it was true they had spoken of the effect of her death its manner and their own feelings but no one had spoken of fanny herself lost and a little sick charlotte followed emily to where george was half waiting for them he too seemed eager to leave aunt vespasia was deep in conversation with a man about her own age and since it was only a few hundred yards they left her to come when she chose they found afton and phoebe in desultory expression of mutual sympathies with algernon they all three stopped as george approached leaving afton enquired his eyes flickered over emily and then charlotte charlotte felt her stomach curl up and instantly longed to be outside she must control herself and leave with courtesy after all the man must be under great strain george was muttering something to phoebe a ritual politeness about the hospitality how kind of you she replied automatically her voice high and tight charlotte saw that her hands were clenched across the billows of her skirt dont be ridiculous afton snapped a few are here out of courtesy but most are no more than inquisitive rape is a better scandal than mere adultery any day besides adultery has become so common that unless there is something ludicrous attached to it it is hardly worth recounting anymore phoebe colored uncomfortably but she seemed incapable of finding an answer i came out of affection for fanny emily looked up at him coldly and for phoebe afton inclined his head a little im sure shell appreciate it if you are able to call upon her some afternoon she will no doubt regale you with her feelings in the matter she is quite convinced there is some madman lurking around just waiting for the chance to leap upon her and ravish her next please phoebe tugged at his sleeve her face painfully red i do not think so at all did i misunderstand you he inquired not lowering his voice but staring at george i thought from the way you disported yourself that you suspected his presence on the upstairs landing last night you had your gown so wrapped around you i feared you might strangle yourself if you were to turn carelessly what on earth did you call the footman for my dear or should i not ask you such a thing in front of others i didnt call the footman ii merelywell the curtain blew in the wind i was startled and i suppose her face was scarlet now and charlotte could imagine the foolishness she was feeling almost as if the whole company could see her frightened and disheveled in her nightclothes she burned to think of something crushing to say for her to cut at afton with equally lacerating words but nothing came it was fulbert who spoke lazily a slow smile on his face he put his arm around phoebe but his eyes were on afton theres no need for you to be afraid my dear what you were doing is quite your own affair his face softened into amusement some secret laughter inside him i really doubt it is one of your footmen but if it were he would hardly be reckless enough to attack you in your own house and you are more fortunate than any other woman in the walkat least you know perfectly well it wasnt afton we all do he smiled across at george would god the rest of us could be as far beyond suspicion george blinked unsure of his meaning but knowing it held cruelty somewhere charlotte instinctively turned to afton she had no idea what occasioned it but cold irrevocable hatred flared up in his eyes and the shock of it rippled through her leaving her feeling sick she wanted to grip hold of emilys arm touch something warm human and then run out of the glittering blackcrepe room into the air into the green summer and keep on running until she was home in her own narrow dusty little street with its whited steps shouldertoshoulder houses and women who worked all day five charlotte could hardly wait until pitt came home she rehearsed a dozen times in her mind what she meant to tell him and each time it came out differently she completely missed the bookshelves in her dusting and forgot to salt the vegetables she gave jemima two lots of pudding much to the childs delight but at least she did have her changed and sound asleep when pitt finally came he looked tired and the first thing he did was to take his boots off and empty his pockets of the enormous number of things he had shoved into them throughout the day she brought him a cold drink determined not to make the same mistake as last time how was emily he asked after a few minutes well enough she answered almost holding her breath to avoid plunging into the story the whole affair was rather horrible i suppose they felt the same as we would underneath but nothing showed it was allempty did they talk about herfanny no she shook her head no they didnt youd hardly have known whose funeral it was i hope when i die whoevers there talks about me all the time he smiled suddenly a broad grin like a child even if they do absolutely all the time my darling he replied it will still seem quiet without you she looked around for something harmless to throw at him but the only thing to hand was the lemonade jug which would hurt not to mention break the jug which they could ill afford she had to settle for making a face didnt you learn anything he pressed i dont think so only what emily had already told me i got lots of odd impressions but i dont know what they mean or even if they mean anything at all i had umpteen things to tell you before you came but now they seem to have frittered away all the nashes are unpleasant except perhaps diggory i didnt really get to meet him but he has a bad reputation selena and jessamyn loathe each other but that cant be relevant its all to do with the most gorgeous frenchman the only people who seemed to be really upset were phoebeshe really was terribly white and shakyand a man called hallam cayley and i dont know whether he was upset for fanny or because his own wife died only a little while ago it had seemed so much when it was all a tumult of feelings in her mind but now that she wanted to put words to it there was nothing it sounded so silly so ephemeral that she was a little ashamed she was a policemans wife she should have had something concrete to tell him how did he ever solve a case if all witnesses were as woolly as she was he sighed and stood up walking in his socks over to the kitchen sink he ran the cold water and put his hands under it then splashed it up over his face he held out his hands for the towel and she brought it dont worry he took it from her i didnt expect to learn anything there you didnt expect to she was confused you mean you were there he dried his face and looked up at her over the towel not to learn anythingjustbecause i wanted to she felt the tears prickle hot behind her eyes and her throat ache she had not even seen him she had been busy watching everyone else and thinking how she looked in aunt vespasias dress at least fanny had had one real mourner someone who was simply sorry she was dead emily had no one with whom she could discuss her feelings aunt vespasia did not consider it good for her to dwell on such things it would produce a melancholic baby she said and george was unwilling to speak of it at all in fact he went noticeably out of his way to avoid it everyone else in the walk seemed determined to forget the entire subject as if fanny had merely gone away for a holiday and might be expected to return at any time they resumed their lives as much as propriety would permit still wearing sober dress of course as to do anything else would be tasteless but there appeared to be an unspoken consensus that the very indecency of the manner of death made the usual observances of mourning a reminder of it and therefore a little vulgar possibly even offensive to others the only exception was fulbert nash who had never minded giving offense in fact he appeared at times positively to relish it he made sly delicate suggestions about almost everyone there was nothing decisive nothing that one could question him with but the swift color in peoples faces betrayed when he had hit a mark perhaps they were old secrets he was referring to everyone had something of which they were ashamed or at least would very much prefer to keep from their neighbors perhaps the secrets were not witty so much as merely foolish but then no one wished to be laughed at either and some would go to great lengths to prevent it ridicule could be as deadly to ones social aspirations as a report of any of the ordinary sins it was a week after the funeral and still hot when emily finally decided to go and ask charlotte directly what the police were doing there had been a lot more questions put mostly to servants but if anyone were either suspected or totally cleared she had not heard of it having sent a letter the day before to warn charlotte she was coming she put on a muslin from last year and sent for the carriage to take her when she arrived she told the coachman to drive around the corner and wait precisely two hours before returning to pick her up she found charlotte expecting her and busy preparing tea the house was smaller than she had remembered the carpets older but it had an air of being lived in that made it pleasant along with the smell of wax polish and roses it did not occur to her to wonder whether the roses had been bought specially for her jemima was sitting on the floor crooning to herself as she built a precarious tower out of colored blocks thank heaven it seemed as if she were going to look like charlotte rather than pitt after the usual greetings which she meant most sincerelyin fact she was coming to value charlottes friendship more and more latelyshe launched straight into news of the walk no one else even talks of it she said heatedly at least not to me its as if it had never happened its like a dinner table where someone has made a personal noisea moments embarrassed silence then everyone begins to talk again a little bit more loudly to show that they havent noticed dont the servants talk charlotte was busy with the kettle servants usually do among themselves the butler wouldnt know maddock never did she recalled cater street vividly for a moment but ask one of the maids and theyll tell you everything i never thought of asking the maids emily admitted it was a stupid oversight at cater street she would have done so without the need for charlotte to tell her perhaps im getting too old now mama never knew half as much as we did they were all afraid of her i think perhaps my maids are afraid of me and theyre terrified of aunt vespasia that charlotte could well believe quite apart from aunt vespasias personality no social climber was more impressed by a title than the average housemaid there were the exceptions of course those who saw the trivialities and the flaws behind the polished front but these servants were usually not only perceptive but also awake enough to their own advantage not to allow their perception to be known and there was always loyalty a good servant regarded his master or mistress almost as an extension of himself his property the mark of his own status in the hierarchy yes she agreed aloud try your ladys maid shes seen you without your stays or your hair curled shes the least likely to be in awe of you charlotte emily banged the milk jug on the bench you say the most appalling things it was an undignified and uncomfortable reminder especially of her increasing weight in your own way you are as bad as fulbert she drew breath quickly then as jemima began to whimper at the sharp noise she swung around and picked her up jiggling her gently till she began to gurgle again charlotte hes been going around in the most awful way letting out little jibes at people nothing you could exactly say was accusing but you know from their faces that the people hes talking about know what he means and inside himself hes laughing all the time i know he is charlotte poured the water onto the tea and put on the lid the food was already on the table you can put her down now she pointed at jemima shell be all right you mustnt spoil her or shell want holding all the time who is he talking about everyone emily obeyed and put jemima back with her bricks charlotte gave her daughter a finger of bread and butter which she took happily all of the same things charlotte said in surprise that seems a little pointless they both sat down and waited for tea to brew before eating no all different things emily answered even phoebe can you imagine he implied that phoebe had something she was ashamed of and one day all the walk would know who could be more innocent than phoebe shes positively silly at times ive often wondered why she doesnt hit back at afton there must be something she could do on occasions he is quite beastly i dont mean he strikes her or anything her faced paled at least good heavens i hope not charlotte chilled as she remembered him his cold probing eyes the impression he gave of a bitter humor and a contempt if its anybody in the walk she said with feeling i sincerely hope its himand that he is caught so do i emily agreed but somehow i dont think it is fulbert is perfectly sure it isnt he keeps saying so and with great pleasure as if he knew something horrid that amused him perhaps he does charlotte frowned trying to hide the thought and failing it would come out in words perhaps he knows who it isand it is not afton its too disgusting to think of emily shook her head it will be some servant or other almost certainly someone hired for the dilbridges party all those strange coachmen milling about with nothing to do but wait no doubt one of them refreshed himself too much and when he was in liquor he lost control perhaps in the dark he thought fanny was a maid or something and then when he discovered she wasnt he had to stab her to keep her from giving him away coachmen do carry knives quite often you know to cut harness if it gets caught or get stones out of horses hooves if they pick them up and all sorts of things she warmed to her own excellent reasoning and after all none of the men who live in the walk i mean none of us would be carrying a knife anyway would we charlotte stared at her one of her carefully cut sandwiches in her hand not unless they meant to kill fanny anyway emily felt a sickness that had nothing to do with her condition why on earth would anyone want to do that if it had been jessamyn i could understand everyone is jealous of her because she is always so beautiful you never see her put out or flustered or even selena but no one could have hated fannyi meanthere wasnt enough of her to hate charlotte stared at her plate i dont know emily leaned forward what about thomas what does he know he must have told you since it concerns us i dont think he knows anything charlotte said unhappily except that it doesnt seem to have been any of the regular servants they can all pretty well account for themselves and none of them have a past trouble he can find they wouldnt would they or they wouldnt be employed in paragon walk when emily returned home she wanted to talk to george but she did not know how to begin aunt vespasia was out and george was sitting in the library with his feet up the doors open to the garden and a book upside down on his stomach he looked up as soon as she came in and put the book aside how was charlotte he asked immediately well she was a little surprised he had always liked charlotte but in a rather distant absent way after all he very seldom saw her why the keenness today did she say anything about pitt he went on moving to sit upright his eyes on her face so it was not charlotte it was the murder and the walk he was thinking about she felt that intense moment of reality when you know a blow is coming but it has not yet landed the pain is not quite there but you understand it as surely as if it were the brain has already accepted it he was afraid it was not that she thought he had killed fanny even in her worst moments she had never believed that she did not know or sense in him the capability for such violence or to be honest for the fierceness of emotion to ignite such a train of events if she were honest he was not stirred by great tides his worst sins would be indolence the unintentional selfishness of a child his temper was easy he liked to please pain distressed him he would go to much trouble to avoid his own and as much as he had energy for that of others he had always possessed worldly goods without the need to strive for them and his generosity frequently bordered on the profligate he had given emily everything she wanted and taken pleasure in doing so no she would not believe he could have killed fanny unless it were in the heat of panic and he would have given himself away immediately terrified as a child the blow she felt was that he had done something else that pitt would uncover in searching for the killer some thoughtless gratification not intended to hurt emily just a pleasure taken because it was there and he liked it selenaor someone else it hardly mattered who funny when she had married him she had seen all that so clearly and accepted it why did it matter now was it her condition she had been warned it might make her oversensitive weepy or was it that she had come to love george more than she had expected to he was staring at her waiting for her to answer the question no she avoided his eyes it seems as if most of the servants are accounted for but thats all then what in hell is he doing george exploded his voice sharp and high its damn near a fortnight why hasnt he caught him even if he cant arrest the man and prove it he ought at least to know who it is by now she was sorry for him because he was frightened and sorry for herself she was also angry because it was his stupid thoughtlessness that had given him cause to fear pitt selfindulgence he had had no need to take i only saw charlotte she said a little stiffly not thomas and even if i had seen him i could hardly have asked him what he was doing i dont imagine it is easy to find a murderer when you have no idea where to begin and no one can prove where they were dammit he said helplessly i was miles away from here i didnt come home until it was all over finished i couldnt have done anything or seen anything then what are you upset about she still did not face him there was a moments silence when he spoke again his voice was calmer tired i dont like being investigated i dont like half london being asked about me and everyone knowing there is a rapist and murderer in my street i dont like the thought that hes still loose whoever he is and above all i dont like the thought that it could be one of my neighbors someone ive known for years probably even liked that was fair of course he was hurt he would have been callous even stupid not to have been she turned and smiled at him at last we all hate it she said softly and were all frightened but it might take a long time yet if hes one of the coachmen or footmen he wont be easy to find and if its one of ushe will have all sorts of ways of hiding himself after all if weve lived with him all these years and have no idea how can thomas find him in a few days he did not reply indeed there was no argument to make still regardless of tragedy there were certain social obligations to be honored one did not abandon all discipline simply because there had been loss still less if the loss had been accompanied by scandalous circumstances it would be unseemly to be observed at parties quite so soon but afternoon calls discreetly made were an entirely different matter vespasia prompted by interest and justified by duty called upon phoebe nash she had intended to convey sympathy she was genuinely sorry for fannys death although the idea of dying did not appall her as it had in her youth now she was resigned to it as one is to going home at the end of a long and splendid party eventually it must happen and perhaps by the time it did one would be ready for it though doubtless that could hardly have been the case for fanny poor child her real sympathy for phoebe however was for her misfortune in having made an excessively trying marriage any woman obliged to live under one roof with afton nash was deserving at the least of commiseration she found the visit more trying to her patience phoebe was more than ordinarily incoherent she seemed forever on the edge of some confidence which never actually formed itself into words vespasia tried concerned interest and appreciative silence in turn but on every occasion phoebe dived off into some altogether unrelated subject at the final moment twisting her handkerchief in her lap until the thing was not fit to stuff a pincushion vespasia left as soon as duty was fulfilled but outside in the blistering sun she walked very slowly and began to reflect on what might be causing phoebe such distraction of mind the poor woman seemed unable to keep her wits on anything for more than a moment was she so overcome with grief for fanny they had never appeared especially close vespasia could not recall more than a dozen occasions when they had gone calling together and phoebe had never accompanied her to any balls or soirees or held any parties for her even though this was her first season then a new and very unpleasant thought occurred to her so ugly she stopped in the middle of the path quite unaware of being stared at by the gardeners boy was phoebe aware of something from which she guessed who it was that had raped and murdered fanny had she seen something heard something or more likely was it some episode remembered from the past that had led her to understand now what had happened and with whom surely the idiot woman would speak to the police discretion was all very well society would disintegrate without it and everyone naturally disliked having anything to do with something as distasteful as the police still one must recognize the inevitable to fight against it only made the final submission the more painfuland obvious and why should phoebe be prepared to protect any man guilty of such a horrendous crime fear it hardly showed sense the only safety lay in sharing such a secret so it could not die with you love unlikely certainly not for afton duty duty to him or to the nash family perhaps even duty to her own social class paralysis in the face of scandal to be the victim was one thingit could be overlooked in timeto be the offender never vespasia started to walk again head down frowning all this was speculation the reason could be anything even as simple as the dread of investigation perhaps she had a lover but it was beyond doubt in her mind now that phoebe was profoundly frightened to call upon grace dilbridge was unavoidable but it was a dreary task and consisted of the usual almost ritual commiserations over fredericks bizarre friends and their incessant parties and the indignities to which grace felt herself subjected as she was excluded from gambling and whatever else unmentionable went on in the garden room vespasia rather overdid the vehemence of her sympathy and excused herself just as selena montague was arriving brillianteyed and quivering with life she heard paul alarics name mentioned before she was quite out of the door and smiled to herself at the obviousness of youth it was necessary of course to call upon jessamyn vespasia found her very composed and already out of total black her hair shimmered in the sun through the french windows and her skin had the delicate bloom of apple blossom how good of you lady cumminggould she said politely im sure you would like some refreshmenttea or lemonade tea if you please vespasia accepted sitting down i still find it pleasant even in the heat jessamyn rang the bell and gave orders to the maid after she had gone jessamyn walked gracefully over toward the windows i wish it would cool down she stared out at the dry grass and dusty leaves this summer seems to be going on forever vespasia was so practiced in the art of small conversation that she had an appropriate remark for any circumstance but faced with jessamyns composure and delicate stiff body she knew she was in the presence of powerful emotion and yet she did not fathom precisely what it was it seemed far more complex than simple grief or perhaps it was jessamyn herself who was complex jessamyn turned and smiled prophecy she inquired vespasia knew immediately what she meant it was the police investigation she was thinking of not the summer weather jessamyn was not a person with whom to be evasive she was far too clever and too strong you may not have intended it as such when you spoke vespasia looked straight back at her but i dare say it will be the case on the other hand summer may slide quite imperceptibly into autumn and we shall hardly notice the difference until one morning there is a frost and the first leaves fall and it is all forgotten jessamyn came back from the window and sat down just a tragedy from the past that was never fully explained for a while we shall be more careful about the manservants we hire and then presently even that will pass it will be replaced by other storms vespasia corrected there must always be something to talk about someone will make or lose a fortune there will be a society marriage someone will take a lover or lose one jessamyns hand tightened on the embroidered arm of the sofa probably but i prefer not to discuss other peoples romantic affairs i find them a quite private matter and not my concern for a moment vespasia was surprized then she recalled that she never had heard jessamyn gossiping of loves or marriages she could only remember conversation of fashion parties and even on rare occasions matters of weight like business or politics jessamyns father had been a man of considerable property but naturally it had all gone to her younger brother since he was the male it had been said at the time the old man died years ago that the boy had inherited the money and jessamyn the brains he was a young fool so far as she heard jessamyn had the better part the tea came and they swapped polite reminiscences of the previous season and speculations as to what the next turn of fashion might be presently she took her leave and met fulbert at the gateway to the drive he bowed with amused grace and they exchanged greetings hers decidedly cool she had had enough visiting and was about to continue on her way home when he spoke youve been calling upon jessamyn obviously she replied tartly really he was becoming fatuous most entertaining isnt it his smile widened everyone is rushing back to their own private sins to make sure they are still covered if your policeman pitt were the least interested in voyeurism he would find this better than a peepshow it is rather like undoing one of those chinese boxes each comes apart in a different way and nothing is what it seems i have no idea what you mean she said coldly it was plain from his face that he knew she was lying she understood him with exactness even if she had no better than educated guesses as to what the sins in question might be he did not seem to be offended he was still smiling and there was laughter in his face even in the angle of his body there is a great deal goes on in this walk you dont dream of he said softly the carcass is full of worms if you break it open even poor phoebe although shes too frightened to speak one of these days shell die of pure fright unless of course someone murders her first what on earth are you talking about now vespasia hovered between fury at his adolescent pleasure in shocking and a chill of quite real fear that indeed he knew something beyond even the worst imaginings of her own but he simply smiled and turned to walk up the driveway toward the door and she was obliged to proceed on her way without an answer it was nineteen days after the murder that vespasia came to the breakfast table with a frown on her face and an extraordinary wisp of hair trailing across her head completely out of place emily stared at her my maid tells me a most peculiar story vespasia seemed not quite sure where to begin she never ate a heavy breakfast and now her hand hovered over the toast rack then the fruit but could not settle for either emily had never seen her so out of countenance before it was disturbing what sort of story she demanded something to do with fanny ive no idea vespasias eyebrows went up not apparently well what is it emily was growing impatient not sure whether to be afraid or not george had put down his fork and was staring at her his face tight it seems fulbert nash has disappeared vespasia spoke as if she herself could hardly believe what she was saying george breathed out in a sigh and the fork clattered from his hand what on earth do you mean disappeared he said slowly where has he gone if i knew where he had gone george i would hardly say he had disappeared vespasia said with unusual acerbity no one knows where he is that is the point he did not come home yesterday although he had no dinner engagement that anyone knows of and he has not been home all night his valet says he has no clothes with him other than the light suit he was wearing for luncheon are all the coachmen or footmen at home george demanded did anyone take a message or call a cab for him apparently not well he cant simply have vanished he must be somewhere of course vespasia frowned still more and at last took herself a piece of toast and spread it with butter and apricot preserve but no one knows where or if they do they are not prepared to say oh god george gasped at her youre not suggesting hes been murdered emily choked on her tea im not suggesting anything vespasia waved her arm at emily for george to do something about her slap her for goodness sake she waited while george obliged and emily pushed him away finding her breath again i simply dont know vespasia finished but doubtless there will be suggestions all of them unpleasant and that will be one of them and it was although emily did not hear it until the following day she had called upon jessamyn and found selena already there so soon after fannys death social visits were being kept very much within their own immediate circle possibly as a matter of good taste but more likely so that they might be freer to discuss it if they wished i suppose you have heard nothing whatever selena asked anxiously nothing jessamyn agreed it is as if the ground had opened up and swallowed him into it phoebe came this morning and naturally afton has inquired as much as is possible discreetly but he is not at any of his clubs in town and no one else can be found who has spoken to him is there no one in the country he might have visited emily asked jessamyns eyebrows shot up at this time of the year its the height of the season selena added a little disparagingly whoever would leave london now perhaps fulbert emily was stung to reply he seems to have left paragon walk without a word of explanation to anyone if he were in london why should he be anywhere but here that makes sense jessamyn admitted since he is not at any of the clubs and he does not seem to be visiting any other friends up for the season the alternatives are too dreadful to contemplate selena shivered then instantly contradicted herself but we must jessamyn looked at her selena was not going to draw back now we must face it my dear it is possible he has been done away with jessamyns face was very pale very fine you mean murdered she said quietly yes im afraid i do there was a moments silence emilys mind raced who would murder fulbert and why the other possibility was at once worse and also an infinite reliefexcept that she dared not say itsuicide if he had after all been the one who killed fanny maybe he had taken this desperate way to escape jessamyn was still staring in her lap her long slender hands were stiff as if she could neither feel with them nor move them why she whispered why would anyone murder fulbert selena perhaps whoever killed poor fanny killed him also selena replied emily could not say what was in her mind she must lead them to it gently until one of them had to say it for herself but fanny wasmolested she reasoned aloud she was only killed after thatperhaps because she recognized him and he could not then let her go why should anyone kill fulbertif indeed he is dead he is only missing after all jessamyn smiled very faintly something like gratitude warming her pallor you are quite right there is hardly anything to suggest it was the same person in fact there is not really anything to prove they are connected at all they must be selena exploded we could not have two entirely unconnected crimes in the walk in the space of a month that is straining credulity too far we must face iteither fulbert is dead or he has run away jessamyns eyes were very bright her voice came slowly as if from far away are you saying that it was fulbert who killed fanny and he has now run away in case the police find him someone did selena would not be put off perhaps he is mad another thought occurred to emily or perhaps it was not him but he knows who it was and he is afraid she said it before she considered what effect it might have jessamyn sat absolutely still her voice was soft almost sibilant i dont think thats very likely she said slowly fulbert was never very good at keeping a secret nor was he especially brave i dont think that can be the answer its ridiculous selena turned on emily sharply if he knew who it was he would have said so and enjoyed it and why on earth should he protect them after all fanny was his sister perhaps he didnt have the chance to tell anyone emily was growing annoyed at being spoken to as if she were foolish perhaps they killed him before he could get away jessamyn took a deep breath and let it out in a long silent sigh i think you must be right emily i hate to say so her voice faded for a minute and she was obliged to clear her throat but i think it is inescapable that either fulbert killed fanny and has run away or else she shivered and seemed to shrink into herself or else whoever so dreadfully murdered fanny knew that poor fulbert knew too much and killed him before he could speak if that is true then we have a very dangerous murderer living in the walk emily said quietly and i am very glad i have no idea who he is i think we should all be extremely careful whom we speak to what we say and whom we find ourself alone with selena gave a little whimper but her face was flushed and there were very fine beads of sweat on her face her eyes were bright the day seemed darker the heat more suffocating emily rose to go home the visit was no longer any pleasure the day after it was not possible to keep the matter from the police pitt was informed of it and returned to the walk feeling tired and unhappy it was a mark of his failure that something so unforeseen should have happened and he had no explanation to offer for it of course there were volumes of theories he had no niceties to keep his mind from coming first to the most obvious and the most ugly he had seen far too much crime for anything to surprize him even incestuous rape in the rookeries and teeming slums incest was all too common women bore too many children and died young often leaving fathers with elder daughters to bring up a brood of little ones loneliness and reliance slipped easily into something else more intimate more urgent but he had not expected to find it in paragon walk then there was the possibility that it was not escape or suicide but another murder perhaps fulbert had known too much and been foolish enough to say so perhaps he had even tried blackmail and paid the ultimate price for it charlotte had told him something about fulberts remarks the sly cutting cruelty of them the whited sepulchers perhaps he had chanced on a secret more dangerous than he knew and been killed for thatnothing to do with fanny at all it would not be the first time one crime had planted the seed of an idea for another where motives were completely unconnected nothing invites imitation like apparent success the only place he could start was with afton nash the person who had reported fulbert as missing and who had lived in the same house pitt had already sent men to check on the clubs and houses of other sorts where a man might be who was indulging himself had taken more to drink than was good for him or wished to be anonymous for a while he was received with chilly civility at the nash house and conducted to the morning room where a few moments later afton appeared he looked tired and there were harsh lines of irritation around his mouth afflicted by a summer cold that obliged him to keep dabbing at his nose he looked at pitt with disfavor i presume you are now here with reference to my brothers apparent disappearance he said and sniffed i have no idea where he is he gave no indication of intending to leave he pulled his mouth down or of being afraid afraid pitt wanted to allow him room and time to say anything he would afton looked at him with contempt i am not going to avoid the obvious mr pitt in view of what has happened here recently to fanny it is not impossible that fulbert is also dead pitt sat sideways on the arm of one of the chairs why mr nash whoever killed your sister cannot possibly have had the same motive whoever killed fanny did so to keep her silent whoever killed fulbert if indeed he is dead will have done so for the same reason you think fulbert knew who that was dont treat me like a fool mr pitt afton dabbed at his nose again if i knew who it was i would have told you but it is only rational to consider the possibility that fulbert knew and was killed for it we will have to find a body or some trace of it before we can assume murder mr nash pitt pointed out so far there is nothing to indicate that he did not simply choose to go away with no clothes no money and alone aftons pale eyes widened unlikely mr pitt his voice was soft weary with pitts stupidity he may have done quite a few things we had thought unlikely pitt pointed out but he knew that even when people change the major direction of their lives they do not often alter the small thing a man will still keep his personal habits his tastes in food the pleasures that entertain or bore him and he doubted fulbert was careful enough or desperate enough to have left without thought for his creature comfort he had been used to clean clothes all his life and a valet to lay them out for him and if he were leaving london he would assuredly need money still pitt agreed youre probably right who was the last person to see him that you know of his valet price you can speak to the man if you want but ive already questioned him and he cant tell you anything of use all fulberts clothes and personal possessions are still here and he had no engagement that evening that price knew of and i presume he would know because he would be required to set out mr fulberts clothes if he were going out pitt added afton looked slightly surprized that pitt should know such a thing and it irritated him he dabbed at his nose and then winced it was becoming raw with the constant friction pitt smiled not enough for levity but enough to let afton know he had understood quite afton agreed he left here at about six in the evening saying he would be back for dinner but he didnt say where he was going if he had inspector i should have told you and he didnt come back nor did anyone see him again afton glared at him i imagine someone saw him he could have walked to the end of the road and taken a cab pitt pointed out there are quite often hansoms even around here where to for heavens sake well if he is still in the walk mr nash where is he afton looked at him with slow comprehension apparently he had not considered it before but there were no rivers or wells no woods no gardens large enough for one to dig unnoticed no untenanted cellars or sheds there were always gardeners footmen butlers kitchenmaids or bootboys to find something left there was nowhere to hide a body find out whose carriage left the walk that evening or the following morning he ordered waspishly fulbert was not a very big man anyone could have carried him if they had needed toexcept perhaps algernonespecially if he were already unconscious or dead i intend to mr nash pitt answered him and to question cabbies errand boys and send out a directive to every other police station in the force also a description of him to all the railway stations and especially the crosschannel ferry but i shall be surprized if we turn up anything of use i have already begun a search of hospitals and morgues well good god man hes got to be somewhere afton exploded its not as if he could have been eaten by wild animals in the middle of london do all those things by all meansi suppose they are necessarybut youd get furthest by asking a few damned awkward questions right here whatevers happened to him has to do with fanny and much as i would like to imagine it was some drunken coachman from the dilbridges party it would be straining credulity a little too far if it were fulbert would not know of it and so it could be of no conceivable danger to the man unless he saw something pitt pointed out afton looked at him with icy amusement hardly mr pitt fulbert was with me all that evening playing billiards as i believe i told you when you first asked pitt met his eyes perfectly calmly as i understand sir from both of you mr fulbert did leave the billiard room on at least one occasion is it not possible that while passing a window he observed something unusual which afterward he realized to be of significance dull anger crept up aftons face he hated to be in the wrong coachmen are not significant inspector they are about the street all the time if you had one you would know i suggest you press a little more closely on the frenchman for a start he said he was at home all evening perhaps he was not and it was he whom fulbert saw one lie springs from another find out what he was really doing hes far too easy with women hes managed to seduce the minds of nearly every woman in the walk i think he is a great deal older than he pretends spends all his time inside or going out at nightbut see his face in the daylight one expects women to be frail to look no further than a mans features or his manners perhaps monsieur alarics tastes run to something young and innocent like fanny but she was not duped by his charm maybe the loose and sophisticated women like selena montague bored him if fulbert sensed that and was rash enough to let alaric know he had seen him out he sniffed savagely and choked if he did he added pitt listened the flow was poisonous but there might be some germ of truth in it even so afton continued selena always was aa strumpet even when her husband was alive she did not know how to conduct herself lately she has sought after george ashworth and hes been fool enough to dally with her i find it disgusting perhaps it does not offend you he glared at pitt with curled lip nevertheless it is true it was what pitt had been fearing he had already read it through charlottes words although of course he had not told her perhaps he could still keep it from emily he said nothing to afton just looked at him his face attentive as he struggled to keep expression out of it and you should take a good deal closer look at freddie dilbridges party afton went on not only coachmen drink more than they can hold he has some very strange guests i dont know how grace puts up with it except of course it is her place to obey him and good woman that she is she abides by it but good god do you know his daughter is keeping company with some jew and freddie allows it just because the man has money i ask you some moneygrubbing little jew with albertine dilbridge he turned around sharply his eyes narrowed or perhaps you dont understand that although even the lower classes dont usually mix their blood with foreigners to do business with them is one thing even to have them in ones house when one must but that is utterly different from permitting one of them to court ones daughter he snorted and was obliged to blow his nose he flinched in pain as the linen of his handkerchief rubbed the red flesh you had better start doing your job a little more effectively mr pitt everyone here is suffering appallingly as if the heat and the season were not enough i loathe the season with its endless simpering young women dressed by their mothers and taught to parade like cattle at a fat stock show young men gambling away their money whoring around and drinking till they cannot even remember which idiocy they were at the night before do you know i went to see hallam cayley at half past ten on the morning fulbert disappeared to inquire if he had seen him and he was still insensible from the previous night the man is only thirtyfive and hes a dissipated wreck its obscene he looked at pitt without pleasure one thing to be said for your type i suppose at least you are too busy to become drunk and you cannot afford it pitt straightened up and put his hands into his pockets to hide the clenching of his fists he had seen every kind of moral and spiritual wreck thrown up with the flotsam of londons underworld but nothing that offended him as did afton nash without stirring up a modicum of pity there must be some deep and dreadful scar on this man he did not even guess does mr cayley drink a great deal sir he asked with soft voice how the devil should i know afton snapped i do not frequent that sort of place i know he was drunk the other morning when i called and he behaves like a man who has indulged himself beyond the point his stomach can bear he jerked his head up to look at pitt again but look at the frenchman there is something sly and over intimate about him god only knows what foreign aberrations he has there is no one in his house but his own servants he could be doing anything in there women are incredibly foolish for gods sake protect us from thisthis obscenity six emily did not mention fulberts disappearance to charlotte and she heard of it from pitt there was nothing she could do about it so late in the evening or indeed the following day since jemima was grizzly with cutting teeth charlotte did not feel it fair to ask mrs smith to look after her however by midafternoon she was so distracted by jemimas crying that she slipped over the street to ask mrs smith if she had any remedy for it or at least something to ease the pain sufficiently for the child to rest mrs smith clucked with disapproval at charlotte and took herself off into the kitchen a moment later she came back with a bottle of clear liquid you put that on er gums with a piece of cotton an itll soothe er in no time you just see charlotte thanked her for it profusely she did not ask what was in the mixture feeling she would probably prefer not to know as long as it was not gin which she had heard some women gave their babies when they could bear the crying no longer still she imagined she would recognize the smell of that and ows your poor sister mrs smith asked glad of a few moments company and wanting to keep it charlotte seized the chance to prepare the ground to visit emily again not very well she said quickly im afraid the brother of a friend has disappeared quite without trace and it is all very distressing oooh mrs smith was entranced ow dreadful aint that extraordinary wherever can e ave gorn nobody knows charlotte sensed that she had won already but tomorrow if you will be kind enough to look after jemima and i hardly like to ask you when never you mind mrs smith said instantly ill look after er dont you worry shell ave them teeth cut in a week or two and poor little thingll feel the world better you just go and see to your sister love find out what appened are you sure course im sure charlotte gave her a dazzling smile and accepted actually she was going as much for curiosity as in any belief that she could help emily but she might help pitt and perhaps that was what was in her heart after all fulberts disappearance could hardly make anything worse for george and she had a great desire to speak again with aunt vespasia as vespasia frequently pointed out not always at happy moments she had known most of the people in the walk since childhood and had a prodigious memory so often small clues threads from the past could point to something in the present that would otherwise be overlooked she arrived at emilys house at the traditional time for afternoon tea and was shown in by the maid who recognized her now and ushered her in emily already had phoebe nash and grace dilbridge with her and aunt vespasia joined them from the garden almost at the same time as charlotte came in at the other door the usual polite greetings were exchanged emily told the maid she might bring in the tea and a few minutes later it arrived the silver service and bone china cups and saucers minute cucumber sandwiches little fruit tarts and sponge cakes spread with fine sugar and whipped cream emily poured the tea and the maid waited to hand it around i dont know what the police are doing grace dilbridge said critically they dont seem to have found the slightest trace of poor fulbert charlotte had to remind herself that of course grace had no idea that the police in question included charlottes husband the notion of having a social connection with the police was unthinkable she saw a bright spot of color in emilys cheek and surprisingly it was emily who came to their defense if he does not wish to be found it would be extremely difficult even to know where to begin she pointed out i would have no idea where to start would you of course not grace was put out by the question but then i am not a policeman vespasias magnificent face was perfectly calm except for a faint surprise but her eye flickered over charlotte for an instant before fixing on grace are you suggesting my dear that the police are more intelligent than we are she inquired grace was momentarily floored it was certainly not what she had intended and yet somehow she seemed to have said it she took refuge in a sip of tea and then a nibble at a cucumber sandwich a look of confusion passed over her face followed by polite determination but everyone is so appallingly upset phoebe murmured to fill the gap i know i miss poor fanny still and the whole household seems to be at sixes and sevens i jump every time i hear a strange sound i simply cannot help myself charlotte had wanted to see aunt vespasia alone in order to put some questions to her frankly there would be no point at all in trying to be devious but she would have to wait until tea was properly accomplished and the visitors excused themselves she took one of the cucumber sandwiches and bit into it it was unpleasant faintly sweet as if the cucumber were bad and yet is was crisp enough she looked at emily emily had one also she stared at charlotte consternation on her face oh dear i think you had better have a word with your cook vespasia suggested putting down one of the cakes she reached for the bell herself they waited until the maid came and was duly sent to fetch the cook when the cook came she was a buxom woman with a good color who normally might well have been handsome enough but today looked hot and untidy although it was long before time for the preparation of dinner are you feeling unwell mrs lowndes emily began carefully you have put sugar in the sandwiches and i fear salt on the cakes vespasia touched one delicately with her finger if you are emily continued perhaps you would prefer to take to your bed for a while one of the girls can prepare some vegetables and i am sure there is a cold ham or chicken we could eat i cannot have dinner turning out like this mrs lowndes stared at the cake stand in dismay then let out a long wail of anguish rising at the end phoebe looked alarmed its awful mrs lowndes moaned you cant know mlady ow awful it is down there knowing as theres a maniac loose in the walk an decent godfearin people bein a murdered one by one only the good lord knows as wholl be next the scullery maids fainted twice today already and me kitchen maids threatening to leave if e aint found soon always been in decent employment all of us never ad anything like this in all our lives we wont never be the same again none of us aooweee she wailed even more shrilly and tore a handkerchief out of her apron pocket her voice rose higher and louder and the tears streamed down her face everyone looked stupefied emily was aghast she had no idea at all what to do with this enormous woman rapidly nearing the verge of complete hysteria for once even aunt vespasia seemed at a loss aowoo mrs lowndes howled ooooh she began to shake violently and threatened to collapse on the carpet charlotte stood up and seized the vase of flowers from the sideboard she took the blooms out with her left hand and felt a satisfactory weight remaining with all her strength she hurled the water into the cooks face be quiet she said firmly the howl ceased in midbreath there was total silence now control yourself charlotte went on of course it is unpleasant do you not think we all feel distressed but it is up to us to behave with dignity you must set an example to the younger women if you lose control of yourself what on earth can we expect of the maids a cook is not merely someone who knows how to mix a sauce mrs lowndes she is head of the kitchen she is there to keep order and to see that everyone conducts themselves as they ought im surprised at you the cook stared at her the color brightened in her face and slowly she drew herself up to her full height throwing her shoulders back yes maam good charlotte said stiffly now lady ashworth will look to you to stop any silly chatter among the girls if you keep your head and behave with the dignity appropriate to the senior member of the female staff then they will all take courage and follow your example mrs lowndes lifted her chin a little and her bosom swelled remembering her own importance yes mlady ill take it kindly mlady she looked at emily if youd overlook my momentary weakness and not mention it in front of the other servants maam of course not mrs lowndes emily said quickly taking charlottes cue quite understandable its a heavy burden of responsibility you carry for so many girls the less said the better i think perhaps you would have the parlormaid bring us some fresh cakes and sandwiches yes mlady most certainly with great relief she picked up the two plates and sailed out dripping with water and ignoring charlotte still standing with the flowers in one hand and the empty vase in the other after phoebe and grace had gone emily immediately took herself to the kitchen against vespasias advice to make sure that charlottes counsel had been taken and dinner would not be another disaster charlotte turned to vespasia there was no time for subtlety even were she capable of it it seems even the servants are in a turmoil over mr nashs disappearance she said directly do you think he has run away vespasias eyebrows rose in slight surprise no my dear i do not for a moment think so i imagine that his tongue has at last earned him the fate he has so long sought by it you mean someone has murdered him of course it was what she had expected but to hear it spoken so plainly by someone other than pitt was still startling i should think so vespasia hesitated except that i have no idea what they have done with his body her nostrils flared a peculiarly unpleasant thing to think of but ignoring it will not change it i suppose they took him out in a hansom and left him somewhere perhaps the river in that case well never find him it was an admission of defeat with no body there was no proof of murder but that is not the most important thing what matters is who ah vespasia said softly looking at charlotte indeed who naturally i have given the subject a great deal of consideration in fact i have been able to think of little else although i have avoided speaking of it in front of emily charlotte leaned forward she was not sure how to express herself without seeming forward even callous and yet she must delicacy was of no service now you have known these people most of their lives you must know things about them the police could never discover or understand if they did it was not intended as flattery simply fact they needed vespasias helppitt needed it you must have opinions fulbert used to say fearful things about people he said to me once that they were all whited sepulchers i dont doubt most of it was for effect but judging from their reactions there was a germ of truth vespasia smiled and there was dry faraway humor and regret in her face an infinity of memories my dear girl everyone has secrets unless they have lived no life at all and even they poor souls imagine they have it is almost an admission of defeat not to have a secret of some kind phoebe hardly one to kill over vespasia shook her head slowly the poor soul is losing her hair she wears a wig charlotte recalled phoebe at the funeral her hair sliding one way and her hat the other how could she feel so sharply sorry for her and at the same time want to laugh it was so unimportant and yet it would be painful to phoebe unconsciously she touched her own hair thick and shining it was her best feature perhaps if she were losing it it would matter enormously she too would feel insecure belittled somehow naked the laughter vanished oh there was pity in the word and vespasia was looking at her with appreciation but as you say charlotte collected herself and went on hardly a matter to murder over even if she were capable of it she wouldnt be vespasia agreed she is far too silly to do anything so big so successfully i was thinking of the purely physical side charlotte replied she couldnt manage that even if shed a mind to oh phoebe is stronger than she looks vespasia sat back in her chair staring up at the ceiling in recollection she could murder him all right with perhaps a knife if she had lured him somewhere she could simply leave him but she has not the nerve to carry it off afterward i remember when she was a girl about fourteen or fifteen she took her elder sisters lace petticoat and pantaloons and cut them down to fit herself she was as cool as you like doing it but then when she came to wear them she was so stricken with fear she wore her own on top in case anything should catch her skirt and the better ones be seen as a result she looked ten pounds heavier and not in the least attractive no phoebe might do it but she has not the endurance to carry it off charlotte was fascinated how little one guessed of people when one saw them only in the single dimension of a few days or weeks how they lacked all the substance of the past they seemed almost flat like cardboard with all the depth gone what other secrets are there she asked what else did fulbert know vespasia sat up and opened her eyes wide my dear child i wouldnt begin to guess he was unbearably nosy his main preoccupation in life was to acquire uncharitable information about others if at last he found something too big for him i cannot but say he richly deserved it but what else charlotte was not going to give up so easily who else do you think he knew who killed fanny and that was it ah vespasia breathed out slowly that of course is the real question and im afraid i have no idea naturally i have been over and over everything i know to tell the truth i expected you to ask me she looked at charlotte hard her old eyes were very clear very clever and i would warn you my girl to keep your tongue a little stiller than you have done so far if indeed fulbert did know who killed fanny it served him ill at least one of the secrets in paragon walk is a very dangerous matter indeed i dont know which of them brought fulbert nash to his death so leave them all alone charlotte felt the cold ripple through her as if someone had opened an outside door on a winter day she had not thought of personal danger before all her anxieties had been for emily that she might learn of weakness selfishness in george she had not feared violence not even to emily let alone to herself but if there were a secret so dreadful in paragon walk that fulbert had lost his life merely because he knew it then to betray curiosity at all would be dangerous and knowledge itself would be fatal surely the only secret like that must be the identity of the rapist he had killed fanny to protect that there couldnt be two murderers in the walkcould there or had fulbert stumbled on some other secret and his victim already prompted by the one sofarsuccessful murder simply copied the same resolution to his problem thomas had said that crime begot crime people imitated especially the weak and sick in mind the opportunists do you hear me charlotte vespasia said somewhat abruptly yes oh yes i do charlotte recalled herself to the present the sunlit withdrawing room and the old lady in ecrucolored lace sitting opposite her i dont speak to anyone except thomas about it but what else i mean what other secrets do you know vespasia snorted you wont be told will you dont you want to know charlotte met her eyes squarely of course i do vespasia snapped and if i die for it at my time of life it doesnt matter i shall almost certainly die soon anyway if i had anything useful to say dont you think i would have said it not to you but to your extraordinary policeman she coughed george has been dallying with selena i have no proof of it but i know george as a child he played with other childrens toys if he felt like it and ate other childrens sweets he always gave the toys back and he was always generous with his own used to everything being his anyway trouble with an only child you have a child dont you well have another charlotte could think of no adequate reply to this she had every intention of having another when the good lord should so choose anyway her concern was for emily now vespasia guessed it he knows that i know she said gently he is far too frightened at the moment to do anything foolish in fact he turns decidedly green every time selena comes anywhere near him which isnt very often except to try and show the frenchman that she is sought after silly creature as if he cared what other secrets charlotte pressed none of any value i cannot think miss laetitia would harm anyone because they knew she had a scandalous love affair thirty years ago charlotte was stunned miss laetitia laetitia horbury yes quite secret of course but very burning at the time havent you noticed miss lucinda always making cutting little remarks to her about morals and so forth the poor creature is so jealous it is eating her alive now if laetitia had been killed i could understand it i have frequently thought that lucinda would poison her in a shot if she dared except she would be lost without her devising new ways of observing her own moral superiority is her chief enjoyment in life but how can it hurt laetitia knows it is only envy charlotte was fascinated good heavens no they never discuss it they each imagine the other does not know what would be the pleasure or the savor of it if it were all in the open again charlotte was torn between pity and laughter but then as vespasia had said it was hardly a matter over which fulbert could have lost his life even if all society knew it would do miss laetitia little harm in fact it might rather enhance her interest miss lucinda would be the one to suffer by comparison then her jealousy might well be unendurable before she could pursue the matter any further emily returned from the kitchen hurt and in short temper apparently she had had some altercation with the scullery maid who was frightened out of her wits that the bootboy was after her and emily had told her not to be so stupid the girl was as plain as a coal scuttle and the bootboy had his sights set a good deal higher vespasia reminded her she had been advised not to go which only added fuel to the fire of emilys temper charlotte excused herself as soon as she could and in illgrace emily ordered her a carriage to take her home of course charlotte had regaled pitt with everything she had heard plus her own evaluation of it almost as soon as he had come in the door and although he knew that most of it would be irrelevant no more than trivia to the case yet momentous to those concerned still he bore them at the back of his mind when he went out the following day to continue his investigations there had been no trace of fulbert anywhere seven bodies had been found in the river two of women almost certainly prostitutes one child probably fallen in by accident and too feeble to cry out or splash for help probably an unwanted mouth to feed anyway put out to beg as soon as it was old enough to speak intelligently the other four had been men but like the child beggars and outcasts certainly none of them could conceivably have been fulbert however abused or molested it had taken more than a few days to bring them to such a degree of emaciation all the hospitals and morgues had been checked even the workhouses the sector of the police who were most familiar with the opium rooms and the brothels had been asked to keep an eye and an ear opento ask questions would be pointlessbut there had been no glimmer of him at all to search the rookeries of course was impossible as far as every human inquiry could ascertain fulbert nash had disappeared from the face of london so there was nothing to do but go back to the walk and pursue it again from there accordingly nine oclock in the morning found him in lord dilbridges morning room awaiting his lordships pleasure it was some quarter of an hour before he appeared he was extremely neathis valet would have seen to thatbut there was a vague and rather disheveled look about his face obviously he was either unwell or had had a wild night immediately previous he stared at pitt as if he had trouble recalling precisely who the footman had said he was inspector pitt from the police pitt helped him freddie blinked then irritation focused in his eyes oh dear is this still about fanny the poor child is gone and the wretched creature who did it is miles away by now i dont know what on earth you think any of us can do about it the back streets of london are full of thieves and blackguards if you fellows did your jobs properly and cleaned up some of them instead of asking damn fool questions around here this sort of thing wouldnt happen he blinked and rubbed something out of his eye although i suppose to be fair we should be more careful who we hire as servants but really there isnt anything more i can do about it now and certainly not at this time in the morning no sir pitt at last had the opportunity to speak without interrupting it isnt about miss nash i called with regard to mr fulbert nash we still have no trace of him try the hospitals or the morgue freddie suggested we have done so sir pitt said patiently and the doss houses the opium rooms the brothels and the river also the railway stations the port the lighter men as far down the river as greenwich and as far up as richmond and most of the cab drivers no one has told us anything thats ridiculous freddie said angrily his eyes were bloodshot and he kept blinking freddie screwed up his face in an effort to think clearly hes got to be somewhere he cant have vanished quite pitt agreed so having searched everywhere i can to find him i am obliged to come back here to see if i can deduce where he might have gone or if not where at least why why freddies face fell well i suppose he waswellnoi dont know what i suppose never really thought about it didnt owe money did he nashes have always been well off so far as i know but he is the youngest brother so maybe he hadnt so much we thought of that sir and we checked his bank gave us access to their records and he is in good funds and his brother mr afton nash assures us that he had no financial problems we have found no mention of any debt in any of the usual gambling clubs freddie looked worried didnt know you people could get into that kind of thing what a man gambles is his own affair certainly sir but where a disappearance is concerned possibly a murder murder do you think fulbert was murdered well he pulled a terrible face and sat down rather abruptly he looked at pitt through his fingers well i suppose we knew that if we were honest knew too much fulbert always was a bit too clever trouble is he wasnt clever enough to pretend to be a little less clever very well put sir pitt smiled what we need to know is which of all his clever remarks was the one that backfired on him did he know who raped fanny or was it something else possibly even something he didnt actually know but implied he did freddie frowned but the high color in his face fled leaving the broken veins standing out he did not look at pitt dont know what you mean if he didnt actually know it why should anyone kill him bit risky isnt it pitt explained patiently if he were to have said to someone i know your secret or words to that effect he would not need to have spelled it out if there really were something dangerous enough the person would not wait to see if fulbert would tell it or not oh i see you mean just kill him anyway be on the safe side yes sir rubbish few odd affairs maybe but no real harm in that good god lived in the walk for years every season of course not in the winter you understand the perspiration was standing out on his forehead and lip he shook his head as if he might at once clear it and drive out the loathsome idea after a moment his face lit up never thought of anyone like that youd better look at the frenchman hes the only one i dont know he waved his hand as if he could wash pitt away like a petty annoyance seems to have plenty of means and decent enough manners if you like that sort of thing bit too precise for me but no idea where the man comes from could be anywhere a sight too easy with the women and come to think of it he never told us who his family was always be spacious of a fellow when you dont know who his family is look him up thats my advice to you try the french police maybe theyll help you it was something pitt had not thought of and he mentally kicked himself for the oversight the more so because it had taken a fool like freddie dilbridge to point it out to him yes sir we shall do that might have been a rapist in france for all we know freddies own voice lifted as he warmed to the subject pleased with his own sagacity maybe fulbert discovered it now that would surely be worth killing him for wouldnt it yes you find out about monsieur alaric before he came here guarantee youll find the reason for your murder there guarantee it now for heavens sake let me go and have some breakfast i feel perfectly awful grace dilbridge had an entirely different outlook on the subject oh no she said immediately freddie is not himself this morning or im sure he would not have made such a suggestion he is very loyal you know he would not wish to think of any of his friends asas more than a little indelicate but i assure you monsieur alaric is the most charming and civilized man and fanny poor child thought him quite devastating as indeed did my own daughter until quite lately when she has become fond of mr isaacs i really dont know what im going to do about that then she blushed at having mentioned so personal a thing in front of what was after all no more than a tradesman but no doubt it will pass she added hastily this is her first season after all and it is natural she should be admired by a number of people pitt felt he was losing the thread he tried to pull her back monsieur alaric nonsense she repeated firmly my husband has known the nashes for years so naturally he is loath to admit it even to himself but it is quite obvious that fulbert has run away because he himself was guilty of molesting poor fanny i dare say in the dark he mistook her for a maid or something and then when he discovered who she was and she of course saw him there was nothing he could do but kill her to keep her silent it is perfectly awful his own sister but then men are perfectly awful at times it is their nature and has been ever since adam we are conceived in sin and some of us never rise above it pitt searched his mind and found no answer to that and anyway his thoughts were revolving on her earlier words and the thought that had never occurred to him before that fulbert could have mistaken fanny for someone else a maid a kitchen girl someone who would never dare to accuse a gentleman of forcing himself on her or for that matter might not even have minded could possibly have encouraged him and then when he found it was his own sister the horror and the disgrace not only of rape but of incest would have panicked many a man into murder and that applied equally to all three of the nash brothers his brain was in a whirl with the enormity of it the vast new dimensions it opened up vista upon vista swam into his imagination and fell away endlessly the whole problem would have to be started again almost from the beginning grace was still talking but he was not listening anymore he needed time to think to be outside in the sun where he could rearrange all that he knew in this new light he stood up he knew he was cutting across her speech but there was no other way to escape you have been extraordinarily helpful lady dilbridge i am most grateful he smiled at her dazzlingly leaving her a little startled and swept out into the hallway and through the front door coattails flapping sending the maid on the step over backward her broom at her shoulder like a guardsman presenting arms it was a long hot and busy week later when charlotte announced to him that emily was giving a soiree he had very little idea what that was except that it occurred in the afternoon and that she had been invited to it he was preoccupied with waiting for news from paris about paul alaric and with the wealth of detail he had learned about the personal lives in the walk since he had begun with forbess wideeyed and willing assistance to inquire all over again in the totally new light of grace dilbridges suggestion it seemed if everyone was to be believed that there were a great many more relationships of varying natures than he had suspected freddie dilbridge was quite notorious something secret and apparently thrilling to those who partook was assumed to happen at some of his more riotous parties and diggory nash had given way to temptation on more than a few occasions there was much speculation about hallam cayley especially since the death of his wife but he had not yet sorted out the direct lies from the fantasies on that one and had even less idea how much might actually be truth apparently george had at least had the good sense to keep his indulgences out of the servants quarters although it was beyond doubt he had certainly entertained feelings toward selena heartily reciprocated which would deeply hurt emily if she ever had to know but if there were anything but wishful thinking about paul alaric no one was prepared to speak of it he would dearly like to have discovered something to the discredit of afton nash as he found the man incredibly unpleasant however although none of the maids seemed to feel kindly toward him there was not even the barest suggestion he had been in the least familiar with any as for fulbert himself there were whispers suggestions but since his disappearance even the mention of his name produced such hysteria that pitt had no idea what to believe the whole walk seethed in overheated imagination the minddulling monotony of daily chores that stretched from childhood to the grave was made bearable only by the penny romances and the giggling stories swapped in tiny attic bedrooms when the long day was done now murderers and lustcrazed seducers lurked in every shadow and fear halfdesire and reality were hopelessly entangled he did not expect charlotte to learn anything of value at emilys party he was convinced that the answer to the murders lay below stairs far out of charlottes or emilys reach and all he said to her on the matter was in the nature of an exhortation to enjoy herself and a very firm command totally to mind her own business and make no inquiries or comments that might lead to anything but the most trivial of polite conversation she said yes thomas very demurely which had he been less consumed in his own thoughts would have struck him immediately as suspicious the soiree was a very formal affair and charlotte was totally swept off her feet with delight at the gown emily had had made for her as a present it was of yellow silk and it fitted her perfectly and was quite ravishingly beautiful she felt like sunshine itself as she swept in through the doorway head high face glowing she was surprised when no more than half a dozen people turned to look at her she quite expected the whole room to fall silent and stare however she was conscious that paul alaric was one of those few who did look she saw his elegant black head turn from selena to where she stood on the step she knew the color burned up her cheeks and she lifted her chin a little higher emily came over to welcome her straightaway and she was pulled into the crowd which must have numbered fifty or more and drawn into conversation there was no opportunity for any private exchange emily gave her a long straight look which said very plainly that she was to behave herself and think before she spoke and the moment after she was called away to welcome another guest emily has asked a young poet to come and read us some of his work phoebe said with brittle cheerfulness i have heard it is most provoking let us hope we can understand it it will give us food for much discussion i hope it is not vulgar miss lucinda said quickly or erotic have you seen those quite dreadful drawings of mr beardsleys charlotte would like to have commented on mr beardsley but since she had never seen any of his drawings or indeed heard of him she could not i cannot imagine emily choosing someone without doing all that one can to assure that he is neither she replied with an immediate edge to her voice of course she went on one is not able to control what ones guests say or do once they come only to judge to the best of ones ability whom to invite of course lucinda colored faintly i did not mean to imply anything but mischance charlotte remained cool i believe he is political rather than romantic that should be interesting miss laetitia said hopefully i wonder if he has written anything about the poor or social reform i believe so charlotte was pleased to have caught miss laetitias interest she rather liked her especially since vespasia had told her about the long past scandal they are the best things about which to try to stir peoples consciences she added im sure we have nothing to be ashamed of it was a stout elderly lady who spoke her body marvelously corsetted into a peacockblue dress and her face above squarejawed and reminding charlotte of a pekinese dog although vastly larger she guessed her to be the misses horburys permanent guest lady tamworth but nobody introduced her poor fanny was a victim of the times she went on loudly standards are falling everywhere even here do you not think it is up to the church to speak to peoples consciences miss lucinda asked with a slight flaring of the nostrils although it was not clear whether her distaste was for charlottes political views or lady tamworth having brought up the subject of fanny yet again charlotte ignored the remark on fanny at least for the time being pitt had not said she must avoid political discussion although of course papa had outrightly forbidden it but she was not papas problem now perhaps it is the church that has stirred his will to speak in the way he is best equipped she suggested innocently do you not feel he is then usurping the churchs prerogative miss lucinda said with a sharp frown and that those called of god for the purpose would do it far better possibly charlotte was determined to be reasonable but that is not to say others should not do the best they can surely the more voices the better there are many places where the church is not heard perhaps he can reach some of those then what is he doing here miss lucinda demanded paragon walk is hardly such a place he would be better employed somewhere else in a back street or a workhouse afton nash joined them his eyebrows raised in slight surprize at miss lucindas rather heated comment and who are you consigning to the workhouse miss horbury he inquired looking for a moment at charlotte then away again im sure the back streets and the workhouses are already converted to the need for social reform charlotte said with a slight downward curve of her mouth and indeed for the ease of the poor it is the rich who need to give the poor will receive readily enough it is the powerful who can change laws lady tamworths eyebrows went up in surprize and some scorn are you suggesting it is the aristocracy the leaders and the backbone of the country who are at fault charlotte did not even think of retreating for courtesys sake or because it was unbecoming in a woman to be so contentious i am saying there is no purpose in preaching to the poor that they should be helped she replied or to the workless and illiterate that laws should be reformed the only people who can change things are the people with power and money if the church had already reached all of them we would have achieved our reform long since and there would be labor for the poor to earn their own necessities lady tamworth glared at her and turned away affecting to find the conversation too unpleasant to continue but charlotte knew perfectly well it was because she could think of no answer there was a delicate type of pleasure in miss laetitias face and she caught charlottes eye for a moment before also leaving my dear mrs pitt afton said very carefully as if speaking to someone unfamiliar with the language or a little deaf you do not understand either politics or economics one cannot change things overnight phoebe joined them but he disregarded her entirely the poor are poor he continued precisely because they do not have the means or the will to be otherwise one cannot denude the rich to feed them it would be insane and like pouring water into the desert sand there are millions of them what you suggest is totally impractical he managed a smile of condescension for her ignorance charlotte seethed it took all the selfwill she possessed to master her face and affect an air of genuine inquiry but if the rich and the powerful are unable to change things she asked then to whom does the church preach and to what purpose i beg your pardon he could not believe what he had heard charlotte repeated herself not daring to look at phoebe or miss lucinda before afton could form a reply to such a preposterous question another voice answered instead a soft voice with a delicate intonation of accent to the purpose that it is good for our souls to give away a little so that we may enjoy what we have and still sleep easily at night because we can then tell ourselves we have tried we have done our bit never my dear in the hope that anything will actually change charlotte felt the color sweep up her face she had had no idea at all that paul alaric was so close and had heard her opinionated baiting of afton and miss lucinda she did not look at him how very cynical monsieur alaric she swallowed do you believe we are all such hypocrites we his voice rose very slightly do you go to church and feel better for it mrs pitt she was caught in complete indecision certainly she did not sermons in church on the rare occasions she went made her squirm with anger and a desire to argue but she could not say so to afton nash and hope to be even remotely understood and it would only hurt phoebe damn alaric for making a hypocrite of her of course i do she lied watching phoebes face the anxiety ironed out of it and she was immediately rewarded she had nothing in common with phoebe and yet she felt an ache of pity for her every time her plain pale face came to mind perhaps it was only because she imagined all the hurt afton could do with his hard thrusting tongue she turned to face alaric and was shaken all over again by the humor in his eyes and the precise understanding of what she had said and why did he know she was not one of the rich that she was married to a policeman and had barely enough to make ends meet that her beautiful dress was a gift from emily and that the whole argument about giving to the poor was academic for her there was nothing but a charming smile on his face if you will excuse me afton said stiffly he almost pulled away phoebe who walked beside him as if her limbs were bruised and weak a generous lie alaric said gently charlotte was not listening to him her mind was on phoebe and the painful almost distant way in which she walked holding herself in from aftons touch was it just years of hurt the instinctive withdrawal as the burnt hand moves away from fire or did she know something new perhaps only by instinct as yet was some memory stirring within her of a change in afton a lie remembered now maybe something between him and fannyno that was too obscene to think of and yet it was not impossible perhaps in the dark he had not even known who it was simply a woman to hurt and he loved inflicting pain that she knew herself as surely as any animal knows its predator by sight and smell did phoebe know it too was that why she walked afraid on the landing of her own house and called for the footman in the night alaric was still waiting composed but a pucker of question between his brows she had forgotten what he had said and was obliged to ask i beg your pardon a most generous lie he repeated lie to say that you feel better for going to church i cannot believe it was the truth you have not the enchantment of mystery mrs pitt you are an open book all your fascination lies in wondering what devastating truth you will deliver next i doubt you could lie successfully even to yourself what did he mean by that she preferred not to think honesty was her only skill and her only safety against him the success of the lie depends a great deal upon how much the hearer wishes to believe it she replied he smiled very slowly very sweetly and therein lies the entire foundation of society he agreed how terrifyingly perceptive of you you had better not tell anyone else you will ruin the whole game and then what will there be left for them to do she swallowed hard and refused to meet his eyes with great care she took the conversation back to the previous point i lie very well sometimes which returns me to the sermons in church does it not the comfortable lies we repeat over and over again because we wish them to be true i wonder what lady ashworths poet will have to say whether we agree or not i think the faces of the audience will be vastly entertaining dont you probably she answered and i dare say his words will provide fuel for indignation for weeks to come oh indeed we shall have to make a great deal of noise to convince ourselves all over again that we are right and that nothing really can or should be changed charlotte stiffened you are trying to make me seem a cynic monsieur alaric and i find cynicism very unattractive i think it is a rather facile excuse one pretends nothing can be done therefore one can do nothing and feel perfectly justified i think it is only another kind of dishonesty and one i like even less he suddenly surprised her by smiling broadly and quite without disguise i didnt think any woman could disconcert me and you have just done it you are quite appallingly honest there is no way of entangling you in yourself did you wish to why on earth should she feel so pleased it was quite ridiculous before he could reply they were joined by jessamyn nash her face as blemishless as a camellia and her cool eyes sweeping over alaric before settling on charlotte they were wide blazing blue and intelligent how charming to see you again mrs pitt i had no idea you were going to visit us so often is not your own circle of society missing you dreadfully charlotte stared back at her without a flicker smiling into the marvelous eyes i hope so she said lightly but i shall support emily whenever i can until this tragic business is resolved jessamyn had more composure than selena her face softened the full mouth easing into a warm smile how generous of you still i dare say you may enjoy the change charlotte took her point perfectly but kept up her innocence she would match smile for smile if it choked her she had no gift for guile but she had always known that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar oh quite she agreed we have nothing so dramatic where i live i dont think there has been a rape or a murder for years in fact maybe never paul alaric tore out his handkerchief and sneezed into it charlotte could see his shoulders shaking with laughter and the color burned up her face in exhilaration jessamyn was white her voice when it came was as brittle as glass splinters and perhaps not soirees like this either you must permit me to advise you as a friend one should circulate speak to everyone it is considered good manners especially if one is in some degree or other a hostess or connected with the hostess you should not allow it to become obvious that you prefer one guest to another however much you may do so the shot was perfect charlotte had no choice but to leave the heat flaming in her neck and bosom that alaric might already imagine she had sought his company and what was worse her embarrassment now could only confirm it she was furious and swore she would disabuse him of the idea that she was one of those stupid women who spent their time pursuing him with a stiff smile she excused herself and sailed away head so high she nearly fell over the step between the two reception rooms and was still regaining her balance when she collided with lady tamworth and miss lucinda im sorry she stammered in apology i do beg your pardon lady tamworth stared at her obviously noting her high color and the clumsiness of her deportment her thoughts regarding young women who drink too much in the afternoon were apparent in her face miss lucinda was on quite another tack she grasped charlotte fiercely with her plump little hand may i ask you quite confidentially my dear how well does lady ashworth know the jew charlottes eyes followed miss lucindas to a slender young man with olive complexion and dark features i dont know she said immediately glancing at lady tamworth if you like i shall ask her but they were not abashed i should my dear after all she may not be aware who he is no she may not charlotte agreed who is he lady tamworth looked nonplussed for a moment whyhes a jew she said yes so you said lady tamworth snorted miss lucindas face dropped her eyebrows puckered do you approve of jews mrs pitt wasnt christ one really mrs pitt lady tamworth shook with outrage i accept that the younger generation has different standards from our own she stared once more at charlottes still glowing neck but i cannot tolerate blasphemy really i cant that is not blasphemy lady tamworth charlotte said clearly christ was a jew christ was god mrs pitt lady tamworth said icily and god is most certainly not a jew charlotte did not know whether to lose her temper completely or laugh she was glad paul alaric was out of earshot isnt he she said with a slight smile i never really thought about it what is he then a mad scientist hallam cayley said from over her shoulder a glass in his hand a frankenstein who didnt know when to stop his experiment has got a little out of hand dont you think he stared around the room his face mirroring a disgust so deep it hurt him lady tamworth chewed her teeth in impotence her rage too great for words hallam regarded her with contempt do you really imagine this was what he intended he finished his glass and waved it round the room is this bloody lot in the image of any god you want to worship if weve descended from god then weve descended a hell of a long way i think id rather join mr darwin according to him at least were improving in another million years we might be fit for something at last miss lucinda found speech you must speak for yourself mr cayley she said with difficulty as if she too were a little drunk for myself i am a christian and i have no doubts whatever doubts hallam stared into the bottom of his empty glass and turned it upside down a single drop fell out onto the floor i wish i had doubts a doubt would at least include room for a hope wouldnt it seven the soiree was a success the poet spoke brilliantly he knew exactly how much to titillate with excitement to hint at daring and change to provoke thoughts of the wildest criticism of others and yet at the same time never to insist on the truly unpleasant disturbance of conscience in oneself he provided the thrill of intellectual danger without any of its pain he was received rapturously and it was obvious he would be talked about for weeks to come even next summer the affair would be recalled as one of the more interesting events of the season but after it was all over and the last guests had taken their leave emily was too tired to savor her victory it had been more of a strain than she expected her legs were tired from so much standing and her back ached when she finally sat down she found she was shaking a little and it no longer seemed to matter a great deal that she had given a party that was a resounding success the realities had not changed fanny nash was still violated and murdered fulbert was still missing and none of the answers were any kinder or easier to bear she was too weary to delude herself any longer that it was some stranger with no claim on their lives it was someone in the walk they all had their trivial or sordid little secrets the ugly sides of life that most people could continue to hide forever of course they were guessed at no one but a fool thought the surface smile was all there was to anyone but for other people where there was no crime no investigation they could be allowed to fester silently in the dark places where they had lain hidden and no one willfully uncovered them there was a mutual conspiracy to overlook but with the police especially someone like thomas pitt whether the real crime was discovered or not all the other grubby little sins would be turned over sooner or later it was not that he would wish to but she knew from the past from cater street and callander square that people have a habit of betraying themselves often in their very anxiety to conceal it is so easily done only a word or a panicky thoughtless action thomas was clever he sowed seeds and allowed them to grow his subtle humorous eyes saw so very muchtoo much she lay in her chair stretching her back feeling the stiffness in it could the child within her make so much difference already there was a dragging an awkwardness perhaps aunt vespasia was right and she would have to loosen her stays that would make her look thick she was not tall enough to carry the extra weight gracefully funny charlotte had looked all right when she was carrying jemima but then charlotte had not had fashionable clothes anyway across the room george was sitting fiddling with the newspaper he had congratulated her on the party but now he was avoiding looking at her he was not reading it she knew that from the angle of his head the curiously fixed stare he held when he was really reading he moved his expression altered and every so often he would rattle the sheets as if he were having a conversation with them this time he was using the paper as a shield to avoid the necessity of speaking he could at once be both absent and present why there was nothing she wanted so much as to talk even if it was about nothing simply to feel that he wished to be with her he could not possibly know that the solution would be all right that it would not go on hurting and yet she wanted him to say so to tell her all the comforting words then she could repeat them all to herself over and over till they drove out reason and doubt he was her husband it was his child that made her feel so tired and lumpy and strangely excited how could he sit there a few feet away and be totally unaware that she wanted him to speak to say something foolish and optimistic to silence all the clamor inside her george he affected not to have heard george her voice was growing higher and there was a thread of hysteria in it he looked up at first his brown eyes were innocent as if his thoughts were still on the paper then slowly they clouded and understanding could not be denied he knew she was demanding something yes now she did not know what to say reassurance you have to ask for is no reassurance at all it would have been better if she had said nothing her brain told her that but her tongue would not keep still they havent found fulbert yet it was not what she was thinking but it was something to say she could not ask him why he was afraid what it was that pitt might find out would it destroy her marriage not anything like divorce no one divorced at least no one decent but she had seen any number of empty marriages polite arrangements to share a house and a name when she had first determined to marry george she had thought that friendship and acceptance would be enoughbut they were not she had grown used to affection to shared laughter little understanding secrets long comfortable silences even habits that became part of the security and rhythm of life now all this was sliding away like the tide going out leaving stretches of empty shingle i know he replied with a little frown of puzzlement she knew he did not realize why she had made such an obvious and silly remark she had to say something more to justify herself do you think hes run away completely she asked like to france or something why ever should he if he killed fanny his face fell a little obviously he had not really considered that he wouldnt kill fanny he said firmly i should think hes probably dead himself maybe he went into town to gamble or something and had an accident people do sometimes oh dont be so stupid at last she lost her temper completely it surprised and alarmed her that she should so suddenly snap she had never dared speak to him like that before he looked startled and the paper slid to the floor now she was a little frightened what had she done he was staring at her his brown eyes very wide she wanted to apologize but her mouth was dry and her voice would not come she took a very deep breath perhaps you had better go upstairs and lie down he said after a moment he spoke quite quietly youve had a very heavy day parties like that are exhausting maybe in this heat it was too much for you im not sick she said furiously then to her horror the tears started to run down her face and she found herself crying like a silly child there was a second of pain in georges face then suddenly the solution washed over him with a wave of relief of course it was her condition she saw it in him as clearly as if he had spoken it it was not true but she could not explain she allowed him to help her to her feet and gently out into the hallway and up the stairs she was still boiling words falling over themselves inside her and dying before she could make them into sentences but she could not control the tears and it was warm to feel his arm around her and so much better not to have to make all the effort herself but when charlotte called the next morning largely to inquire how she was after the soiree emily was in an unusually sharp temper she had not slept well and lying awake in her bed had thought she had heard george moving around in the next room more than once she considered getting up and going to him to ask him why he was pacing what worried him so much but she did not yet feel she knew him well enough to take the rather forward action of going into his room at two oclock in the morning she knew he would consider it ingenuous even immodest and she was not even sure she wanted to know perhaps most of all she was afraid he would lie to her and she would see through the lies and be haunted by truths she only guessed at so when charlotte appeared looking slender and fresh her hair shining unbearably cool although she was wearing only washcotton emily was in no mood to receive her graciously i suppose thomas still knows nothing she said acidly charlotte looked surprised and emily knew what she was doing but still could not hold her tongue he hasnt found fulbert charlotte answered if thats what you mean i dont really care whether he finds fulbert or not emily snapped if hes dead i cant see that it matters a lot where he is charlotte kept her patience which only irritated emily the more charlotte holding her tongue really was the last straw we dont know that he is dead charlotte pointed out or if he is that he did not take his own life and then hide his body afterward emily said with withering contempt thomas says that many bodies in the river are never found charlotte was still being reasonable or if they are they are unrecognizable emilys imagination conjured revolting pictures bloated corpses with their faces eaten away staring up through murky water it made her feel sick you are perfectly disgusting she glared at charlotte you and thomas may find such conversation acceptable over the tea table but i do not you have not offered me any tea charlotte said with a ghost of a smile if you imagine i shall after that you are mistaken emily snapped you had better have something yourself and try something sweet with it if one more person makes another polite reference to my condition i shall swear emily said fiercely i do not want to sit down or take a refreshing drink or anything else charlotte was beginning at last to become a little acid herself what you want and what you need are not always the same thing she said smartly and losing your temper will not help anything in fact you will say things you will wish afterward you had not and if anyone should know the folly of that i should you were always the one who could think before you spoke for goodness sake dont lose that now when you need it the most emily stared at her coldness in the pit of her stomach what do you mean she demanded explain what you mean charlotte stood perfectly still i mean that if you let your fears drive you into suspicion now or allow george to think you do not trust him you will never be able to replace what you have destroyed no matter how much you may regret it afterward or how trivial it may all seem when you know the truth and you will have to prepare yourself that we may never know who killed her not all crimes are solved emily sat down sharply it was appalling to think they might never know that they might spend the rest of their lives looking at each other and wondering every affection every quiet evening every simple conversation offer of company or help would be marred by the dark stain of uncertainty the sudden thoughtcould it have been he who killed fanny or she who knew about it theyll have to find out she insisted refusing to accept it someone will know if he is really one of us some wife some brother some friend will find a clue not necessarily charlotte looked at her with a little shake of her head if he has been secret so long why not forever perhaps someone does know but they do not have to say so maybe not even to themselves we do not always recognize things when we do not wish to rape emily breathed the word incredulously why in the name of heaven would any woman protect a man who had charlottes face tightened all kinds of reasons she replied who wants to believe their husband or brother is a rapist or a murderer you can prevent yourself from seeing that forever if you want to badly enough or convince yourself that it will never happen again and it was not really his fault youve seen for yourself half the people in the walk have already made up their minds that fanny was a loose woman that she invited her own fate somehow she deserved it stop it emily hauled herself up and faced charlotte angrily youre not the only one who can tell the truth about anything you know youre so smug sometimes you make me sick were not all hypocrites here in the walk just because we have time and money and dress well any more than all of you are in your grubbly little street just because you work all day you have your lies and your conveniences as well charlotte was very pale and instantly emily regretted it she wanted to put her hands out put her arms around charlotte but she did not dare she stared at her frightened charlotte was the only person she could talk to whose love was unquestioned with whom she could share the secret fears and wants in every womans heart charlotte charlotte stood still charlotte she tried again charlotte im sorry i know charlotte said very quietly you want to know the truth about george and youre afraid of it time stopped for motionless seconds emily hesitated then she asked the question she had to ask do you know did thomas tell you charlotte had never been any good at lying even though she was the elder she had never been able to dupe emily whose sharp practiced eye had always seen the reluctance the indecision before the lie you do emily answered her own question tell me charlotte frowned its all over tell me emily repeated wouldnt it be better emily just waited they both knew that truth whatever it was was better than the exhaustion of sweeping from hope to fear the elaborate effort to deceive oneself the indulging in awful imagination was it selena she asked yes now that she knew it was not so bad perhaps she had known before but simply refused to say so to herself was that really all george was afraid of how silly how very silly she would put a stop to it of course she would take that smug look off selenas face and replace it with something far less satisfied she was not sure how yet or even if she would allow george to know that she knew about it she played with the idea of letting him go on worrying allowing the fear to eat into him sufficiently so that he would not in a hurry forget how it hurt perhaps she would never tell him that she knew charlotte was looking at her her eyes anxious watching for her reaction she turned back to the moment smiling thank you she said composedly almost cheerfully now i know what to do emily dont worry she put her hand out and touched charlotte quite softly i shant have a quarrel in fact i dont think i shall do anything at all just yet pitt continued his questioning in paragon walk forbes had dug up some surprizing information about diggory nash yet he should not have been surprized and he was angry with himself for having allowed his prejudice to form his opinions for him he had looked at the outward grace the comfort and the money in the walk and assumed that because they all lived in the same manner came to london for the season frequented the same clubs and parties that they were all the same underneath their uniformly fashionable clothes and behind their uniformly mannered behavior diggory nash was a gambler with wealth he had not earned and a flirt almost by habit with any woman who was pleasant and available but he was also generous pitt was startled and ashamed of his own facile judgment when forbes told him that diggory subsidized a house that gave shelter to homeless women god knew how many pregnant service girls were thrown out of sober and upright employment every year to wander the streets and end up in sweatshops workhouses or brothels how unforeseen that diggory nash of all people should have given a meager protection to a few of them an old wound of conscience speaking perhaps or a simple pity either way it was with a feeling embarrassment that pitt waited in the morning room for jessamyn she could not know what his assumptions had been but he knew himself and that was enough to tie his usually easy tongue and to give him a rare selfconsciousness it was no salve to his mind that it was perfectly possible jessamyn had no idea of diggorys actions when she came in he was amazed again at the emotional impact of her beauty it was far more than a mere matter of color or the symmetry of brow and cheek it was something in the curve of the mouth the challenging blue blaze of her eyes the fragile throat no wonder she grasped for what she wanted knowing it would be given her and no wonder selena could not come to terms with subordinacy to this supreme woman it flickered through his mind the moment before she spoke to him to wonder what charlotte would have made of her if there had ever been a true rivalry between them if perhaps charlotte had also wanted the frenchman did any of them love the frenchman or was he merely the prize the chosen symbol of victory good morning inspector jessamyn said coolly she was dressed in pale summer green and looked as fresh and strong as a daffodil i cannot imagine what more i can do for you but if there is still something left to ask of course i shall try to answer thank you maam he waited until she sat down then he sat also as usual allowing his coattails to fall where they may im afraid we have still found no trace of mr fulbert her face tightened a little a very little and she looked down at her hands i assumed you had not or surely you would have told us you cannot have come only to say that no he did not wish to be caught staring yet both duty and a natural fascination kept his eyes on her face he was drawn to her as one is to a solitary light in a room whether one wills it or not it becomes the focus she looked up her face smooth eyes clear and brilliantly frank what else can i tell you you have spoken to all of us you must know everything we know about his last days here if you have found no trace of him anywhere in the city either he has eluded you and gone to the continent or he is dead it is a painful thought but i cannot escape it before he set out he had ordered in his mind the questions he meant to ask now they seem less ordered even less useful and he must not appear impertinent she could so easily be offended and refuse all answers and from silence he could learn nothing at all neither must he overflatter she was used to compliments and he judged her far too intelligent even too cynical to be gulled by them he began very carefully if he is dead maam it is most probable he was killed because he knew something which his killer could not afford to have him tell that is the obvious conclusion she agreed the only thing we know that is so monstrous as that is the identity of the rapist and murderer of fanny he must still not patronize her or let her once suspect he was leading her her mouth twitched in bitter amusement everyone desires their privacy mr pitt but few of us need it to the point where we will kill our neighbors to preserve it i think it would be ridiculous without evidence to suppose there are two such appalling secrets in the walk exactly he agreed she gave a very small sigh so that brings us back to who raped poor fanny she said slowly naturally we have all been thinking about it we can hardly avoid it of course not especially someone as close to her as you were her eyes widened naturally if you knew anything he went on perhaps a bit hastily you would have told us but maybe you have had thoughts nothing so substantial as a suspicion but as you say he was watching her closely trying to judge exactly how much he could press what could be put into words what must remain suggestion as you say you cannot dismiss the matter from your mind you think i may suspect one of my neighbors her blue eyes were almost hypnotic he found himself unable to look away do you for a long time she said nothing her hands moved slowly in her lap unwinding some invisible knot he waited at last she looked up yes but you must understand it is only a feeling a collection of impressions naturally he did not want to interrupt if it told him nothing of anyone else at worst it would tell him something of her i cannot believe anyone in their right mind in their true senses would do such a thing she spoke as if weighing each word reluctant to speak at all and yet pressed by obligation i have known everyone here for a long time i have gone over and over in my memory all that i know and i cannot believe such a nature could have been hidden from all of us he was suddenly disappointed she was going to come up with some impossible suggestion about strangers her fingers were stiff in her lap white against the green of her dress indeed he said flatly her head came up and there was a flame of color in her cheeks she took in a deep breath and let it out collecting herself i mean mr pitt that it can only have been someone laboring under the influence of a quite abnormal emotion or perhaps intoxicated when they have had too much to drink people sometimes do things that in sobriety they would never dream of and im told that even afterward they do not always recollect what has happened surely that would also account for an apparent innocence now if whoever killed fanny cannot clearly remember it he recalled georges blank about the night algernon burnons reluctance to name his companion diggorys anonymous gambling but it was hallam cayley who had repeatedly been drunk so often lately that he overslept in fact afton had said he had been in an alcoholic sleep at ten oclock on the very morning fulberts disappearance had been discovered it was not a foolish suggestion at all it would explain the lack of lies of any attempt to mislead or cover up the murderer could not even remember his own guilt there must be a black and dreadful void in his mind he must wonder in the night terrors must creep out to fill the space with fragments of violence images the smell and sound of horror but more drink would bring more oblivion thank you he said politely she took a deep breath again is a man to blame for what he does in drunkenness she asked slowly a little frown between her brows if god will blame him i dont know pitt answered honestly but the law will a man does not need to get drunk her face did not change she was continuing with some train of thought that had already begun sometimes to cover pain one drinks too much her words were very careful weighted perhaps pain or illness or pain of the mind perhaps a loss he thought immediately of hallam cayleys wife was that what she meant him to think he looked at her but her face was as smooth now as white satin he decided to be bold do you speak of someone in particular mrs nash her eyes moved away from his for a moment and the brilliant blue clouded i would prefer not to speak plainly mr pitt i simply do not know please do not press me to accuse she looked back at him clear and blazingly frank again i promise you if i should come to learn anything i shall tell you he stood up he knew there would be no more thank you mrs nash you have been most helpful indeed you have given me much to consider he did not make any trite remarks about having an answer soon it would be an insult to her she smiled very slightly thank you mr pitt good day good day maam and he permitted the footman to show him out to the walk he crossed over to the grass on the other side he knew he was not supposed to stand on itthere was a very small notice to that effectbut he loved the live feel of it under the soles of his boots paving stones were insensate unlovely things necessary if a thousand people were to walk over them but hiding the earth what had happened in this graceful orderly walk that night what sudden chaos had erupted and then subsided into so many totally misshapen pieces the emotions eluded his grasp everything he clutched at fragmented and disappeared he must go back to the practical things the mechanics of murder gentlemen such as these in paragon walk did not normally carry knives with them why had the rapist so opportunely had one with him on this occasion was it conceivable that it had not been a blaze of passion at all but something premeditated could it even be that murder had always been the intent and the rape was incidental an impulse or a blind but why should anyone murder fanny nash he had never found anybody more innocuous she was heir to no fortune and was no ones mistress nor as far as he could discover had anyone shown the slightest romantic interest in her apart from algernon burnonand even that seemed a very staid affair could it be that fanny had innocently stumbled on some other secret in the walk and died for that perhaps without even realizing what it was and what had happened to the knife did the murderer still have it was it hidden somewhere possibly by now miles away at the bottom of the river and the other practical questionshe had been stabbed to death he could still see in his minds eye the thick gore of blood down her body why had there been no blood on the road no trail leading back from the withdrawing room to where she had been attacked there had been no rain since then the murderer would have disposed of his clothes they were easily explained although forbes had not been able to findeven with the most diligent questioningany valet whose masters wardrobe was depleted or any signs that charred remains had been found in any boiler or fireplace but why no blood on the road could it have happened here on this grass or in a flower bed where it could have been dug in or in the bushes where it would not be seen but neither he nor forbes had found any sign of struggle no trampled beds no broken branches beyond the usual that were explained by a dog someone stumbling in the dark a clumsy gardeners boy or even a maid and a footman indulging in a little horseplay if there had ever been anything they had not found it or recognized it and by now it was long covered either by the murderer or by others he was back to reasons and characters why why fanny his thoughts were interrupted by a discreet cough a few yards away from him the other side of the roses he looked up an elderly and forlorn butler was standing uncomfortably on the path staring at him did you want me pitt inquired affecting not to realize he was standing on the manicured grass yes sir if you please mrs nash would be obliged if you would call upon her sir mrs nash his mind flew back to jessamyn yes sir the butler cleared his throat mrs afton nash that is sir phoebe yes of course pitt replied immediately is mrs nash at home yes sir if you would care to accompany me pitt followed him back across the roadway and along the footpath to afton nashs house the front door opened before they reached it and they were ushered in phoebe was in a small morning room toward the back a long window looked onto the grass mr pitt she seemed almost startled a little breathless how good of you to come hobson send nellie in with the tray you will take tea wont you yes of course please do sit down the butler disappeared and pitt sat obediently thanking her its still so dreadfully hot she flapped her hands i dont care for the winter but right now i almost feel i should welcome it i dare say it will rain soon and be pleasanter he did not know how to set her at ease she was not really listening to him and she had not looked at him once oh i do hope so she sat down and stood up again this is very trying do you not find you wanted to see me about something mrs nash she was obviously not going to come to the point herself i well she coughed and took some few moments over it have you found trace of poor fulbert yet no maam oh dear do you know something maam it appeared she was not going to speak without being pressed oh no no of course not if i did i should have told you but you did call me here to tell me something he pointed out she looked flustered yes yes i admitbut not as to where poor fulbert is i swear then what mrs nash he wanted to be gentle but it was urgent if she knew something then he needed to hear it he was stumbling around in the dark as much now as when he had first seen fannys body in the morgue you must tell me she froze her hands went to her neck and the rather large crucifix hanging there her fingers wound on round it her nails digging into her palms there is something terrible and evil here mr pitt something truly appalling was she imagining it whipping herself into a hysteria did she know anything at all or was it just vague fears in a frightened and silly mind he looked at her her face her hands what sort of evil mrs nash he asked quietly whether the cause was real or imaginary he would swear the fear was genuine enough have you seen something she crossed herself oh dear god what have you seen he insisted was it afton nash and she knew it but because he was her husband she could not bring herself to betray him or had it been fulbert incestuous rapist and suicide and she knew that he stood up and put his hand toward her not to touch her but in a halfgesture of support what have you seen he repeated she started to shake first her head in little twitches from side to side then her shoulders finally her whole body she made little whimpering sounds like a child so foolish she said furiously between her teeth so very foolish and now its all real god help us what is real mrs nash he said urgently what is it you know oh she lifted up her head and stared at him nothing i think i have lost my wits we will never win against it we are lost and it is our own fault go away and leave us alone you are a decent man in your own station just go away pray if you want to but go now before it reaches out and touches you dont say i didnt warn you you havent warned me you havent told me what to beware of he said helplessly what what is it evil her face closed and her eyes were hard and dark there is a dreadful wickedness in paragon walk go away from it while you can he could not think of anything else to do he was still searching for something more to say when the maid came in with the tray of tea phoebe disregarded it i cant leave maam he answered i have to stay until ive found him but i shall take care thank you for your concern good afternoon she did not reply but stood staring at the tray poor woman he thought outside in the heat the whole incident first her sisterinlaw and now her brotherinlaw had been too much for her she had become hysterical and doubtless she got little sympathy from afton it was a pity she had no work to do and no children to absorb her mind and keep it from fancies there were moments surprizing and disorienting him when he was as sorry for the rich as for any of the poor some of them were as pathetic as imprisoned in the hierarchywelded to their function or lack of function in it it was late in the afternoon when the misses horbury called on emily in fact it was later than was at all suitable for visiting emily was more than a little irritated when the maid came to announce them she even debated with herself whether to say she was unavailable but since they were close neighbors and she was obliged to meet with them regularly it was better not to give offense in spite of this extraordinary behavior they came in in a cloud of yellow which was peculiarly unbecoming on both of them although for entirely different reasons on miss laetitia it was too sallow giving her skin a jaundiced look on miss lucinda it clashed with her sandy yellow hair lending her the appearance of a rather fierce little bird far gone in the process of moulting she trailed bright wisps behind her as she bounced into the room her eyes fixed on emily good afternoon emily my dear she was unusually informal in fact verging on the familiar good afternoon miss horbury emily said coolly what a pleasant surpriseshe emphasized the word surpriseto see you she smiled distantly at miss laetitia who was standing somewhat reluctantly a little further back miss lucinda sat down without being invited emily was not going to offer them refreshment at this time in the afternoon had neither of them any sense of propriety it doesnt look as if the police are going to discover anything miss lucinda remarked settling herself deeper the chair i dont think they have any idea myself they wouldnt tell us if they had miss laetitia said to no one in particular why should they emily sat down resigned to being civil at least for a while ive no idea she said wearily miss lucinda leaned forward i think there is something going on do you emily did not know whether to laugh or be cross yes i do and i mean to discover what it is i have visited this walk every season since i was a girl emily did not know what answer was expected to this indeed she said noncommittally and what is more miss lucinda continued i think it is something perfectly scandalous and it is our duty to put a stop to it yes emily was floundering now it would be i think it is something to do with that frenchman miss lucinda said with conviction miss laetitia shook her head lady tamworth says it is the jew emily blinked what jew why mr isaacs of course miss lucinda was losing patience but that is nonsense nobody would entertain him except for business necessities i think it has to do with those parties at lord dilbridges i dont know how poor grace bears all of it all of what emily asked she was not sure whether there was anything remotely worth listening to in all this all that goes on really emily my dear you must concern yourself with what occurs in your immediate neighborhood you know how else can we control it it is up to us to see that standards are maintained she has always been very concerned about standards miss laetitia put in its as well miss lucinda snapped someone needs to be and there are more than enough of us who are not i have no idea what is going on emily was a little embarrassed by the obvious meaning between them i do not go to the parties at the dilbridges and quite honestly i didnt know that they hold any more than most people do in the summer my dear neither do i actually go to them and i dare say they dont but its not the number it is the nature that matters i tell you emily my dear there is something very strange going on and i mean to uncover it i would be careful if i were you emily felt obliged to caution her remember that there have been very tragic occurrences do not place yourself in danger she was thinking rather more of the sensitivities of those miss lucinda might press with her curiosity than of any peril to lucinda herself miss lucinda stood up thrusting out her bosom i am of dauntless courage when i see my duty clearly before me and i shall expect your help if you discover anything of importance oh indeed emily agreed knowing perfectly well she would consider nothing that entered miss lucindas realm of duty important good now i must call on poor grace and before emily could find suitable words to point out the lateness of the hour she gathered miss laetitia in her wake and swept out emily was standing outside in the garden at dusk her face upward toward the evening breeze the frail sweet scent of roses and mignonette drifting across the dry grass there was a single brilliant star out already although the sky was bluegray and there was still color in the west she was thinking about charlotte knowing she had no garden no room for flowers and feeling a little guilty that chance had given her so much for no effort of her own she determined to find a graceful way of sharing it a little more without making charlotte feel aware of itor pitt apart from the fact that he was charlottes husband emily liked pitt for himself she was standing quite still facing the breeze when it happened a shrill tearing scream that went on and on shattering the night it reverberated in the stillness then came again sickeningly thickthroated emily froze her skin crawling the evening was heavy with silence then somewhere there was a shout emily moved picking up her skirts and running back into the house through the withdrawing room the hall and out of the front door shouting for the butler and the footman out in the front driveway she stopped lights were coming on along the walk and a mans voice was calling out two hundred yards away then she saw selena she was running along the middle of the road her hair ragged down her back and the bosom of her dress ripped open showing white flesh emily started toward her already she knew in her heart what it was there was no need to wait for selenas gasping sobbing words she fell into emilys arms ive been violated hush emily held on to her hard hush she was talking meaninglessly but it was the sound of a voice that mattered youre safe now come on come inside gently she led her weeping across the carriageway and up the stairs inside she closed the withdrawing room door and sat her down the servants were all outside searching for the man any stranger anyone who could not explain themselvesalthough it did occur fleetingly to emily that all the man need do was join in the hunt to pass into virtual invisibility maybe when she had time to think to compose herself selena would say less be embarrassed or unclear emily knelt down in front of her taking her hands what happened she said firmly who was it selena lifted her face flushed her eyes wide and glittering it was awful she whispered violent hunger like nothing ive ever known i shall feel itand smell itas long as i live who was it emily repeated he was tall selena said slowly and slender and god how strong he was who ioh emily you must swear before god you will say nothingswear why because she swallowed hard her body shivering her eyes enormous ii think it was monsieur alaric but but i cannot be sure you must swear emily if you accuse him and you are wrong we shall both be in terrible danger remember fanny i shall swear i know nothing eight pitt was called of course and he left home immediately in the same cab that had brought the message but by the time he reached paragon walk selena was dressed in a discreet gown of emilys and sitting on the big sofa in the withdrawing room she was now much more composed her face was flushed her hands white and knotted in her lap but she told him quite coolly what had happened she had been returning from a brief visit to grace dilbridge hurrying a little to be home before dark when she had been attacked from behind by a man of above average height and quite phenomenal strength she had been thrown to the ground on the grass by the rose bed as near as she could judge the next part was too appalling and surely pitt as a delicate man would not expect her to describe it sufficient to say she had been violated by whom she did not know she had not seen his face nor could she describe anything else about him except his enormous strength and the fierceness of his animal behavior he questioned her as to anything at all she might have noticed without realizing it his clothing was it of good texture or harsh did he have a shirt beneath his jacket white or dark were his hands rough she considered for only a moment oh she said with a little flutter of surprise yes you are right his clothes were good he must have been a gentleman i recall white shirt cuffs and his hands were smooth butshe lowered her eyesvery strong he pressed her further but she could tell him nothing more he had not spoken and presently she grew distressed and became unable to say anything more he was obliged to give up and fall back on the ordinary routine chasing of details in a long and exhausting night he and forbes questioned every man on the walk obliging them to leave their beds angry and frightened as previously everyone could account in a perfectly reasonable way for his whereabouts but none had complete proof that they could not have been outside for those few vital moments afton nash had been in his study but it opened onto the garden and there was no reason why he could not have slipped out without being seen jessamyn nash had been playing the piano and could not say whether diggory was in the room all evening or not freddie dilbridge had been alone in his garden room he had said that he was considering some decorating changes grace was not with him hallam cayley and paul alaric lived alone the only bright aspect was that george had been in town and it really did seem wildly improbable that he could have returned unseen to the walk all the servants were questioned and all the answers compared a few had been occupied in activities they would have preferred to keep secret there were three separate affairs and a card game where money of quite a high order had changed hands possibly there would be dismissals in the morning but most either could account for themselves or were precisely where one would expect them to be at the end of it all in a still warm dawn eyes gritting with sleep his throat dry pitt knew nothing more of any worth it was two days after that that pitt at last received his answer from paris regarding paul alaric he stood in the middle of the police station with it in his hands more confused than ever the paris police could find no trace of him and apologized for the delay in their reply explaining that they had sent to every major center in france inquiring but still they could find no definite news there were of course one or two families of that name but none of their members fitted the description as to age appearance or anything else and their whereabouts were already accounted for most certainly they had no records of such a person accused much less convicted of any indecent assaults upon women pitt wondered why alaric should lie as to his origin then he recalled that alaric had never said anything about his origin everyone else had said he was french but alaric himself had said nothing at all and pitt had never seen reason to ask freddie dilbridges accusation was probably exactly what grace had said it wasa desire to attract attention away from his own friends who easier to accuse than the only foreigner pitt dismissed the paris reply and went back to the practical investigation the investigation proceeded through the long hot days tedious question after question and gradually pitt was obliged to turn his attention to other crimes the rest of london did not suddenly cease from robbery deceit and violence and he could not spend all his hours on one mystery however tragic or dangerous life slowly resumed a more normal pattern in the walk of course selenas ordeal was not forgotten reactions to it varied oddly enough jessamyn was the most sympathetic it was as if the old enmity between them had been entirely swept away it fascinated emily because not only did they show a new friendship toward each other there seemed to be a glow of satisfaction about it in both of them as if each felt in her own way she had won a signal victory jessamyn was all solicitude for selenas appalling experience and coddled her on every reasonable occasion even prompting other people to the same concern of course it did have the byproduct of allowing no one to forget the incident a fact which emily noted with some amusement and passed on to charlotte when visiting her and curiously selena herself did not seem to mind she colored deeply and her eyes were bright when it was referred to always obliquely of courseno one could wish to be vulgar enough to use unpleasant wordsbut she seemed to take no offense at its mention naturally there were others who regarded it quite differently george studiously avoided the subject altogether and emily permitted him to do so for some time she had originally decided to dismiss her knowledge of his involvement with selena provided it never happened again then one morning an opportunity presented itself which was too good to miss and almost without being conscious of it she found herself taking advantage george looked up over the breakfast table aunt vespasia was down early this morning and had helped herself delicately to apricot preserve with walnuts in and a little very thin toast what are you going to do today aunt vespasia george inquired politely i shall endeavor to avoid grace dilbridge she replied which will not be easy since i have certain calls to make as a matter of duty and no doubt she will have the same ones it will require some forethought to see that we do not come across each other at every step and turn george said the automatic thing partially because he was not really listening why do you wish to avoid her shes harmless enough she is excessively tedious aunt vespasia said smartly finishing her toast i used to think that her suffering and the continuous eyesupturned expression of it was the nadir of boredom but that was easy to take compared with her views on the subject of women who are molested the general bestiality of men and certain woman who contribute to everyones misfortune by encouraging them that is more than i can bear emily spoke for once a fraction before she thought her natural feelings for selena stronger than her usual caution i would have thought you might agree with her at least in some respects she said turning to vespasia a little edge to her voice vespasias gray eyes widened to disagree with grace dilbridge and yet have to listen to her with civility is part of the normal trials of society my dear she replied to be obliged by honesty to agree with her and to say so is more than should be asked of anyone it is the first and only time we have agreed about anything of moment and it is intolerable of course selena is no better than she should be even a fool knows that she stood up and dusted an imaginary crumb off her skirt emily lowered her eyes for a long moment then looked up at george he turned from aunt vespasia going out of the door and back at emily poor aunt vespasia emily said carefully it is most trying grace is so very selfrighteous but one has to admit that on this occasion she is right i dislike speaking ill of my own sex especially of a friend but selena has behaved in the past in a way tonot quite invite she hesitated misunderstanding as to her she stopped her eyes holding georges staring across at him his face was pale stiff with apprehension what he asked in the silence well she smiled very brightly a cool wise little smile well she has been a littlefreewith herself hasnt she my dear and that sort of person attracts she let it go she knew from his face that he had understood perfectly there were no more secrets emily he began knocking his teacup with his sleeve she did not wish to discuss it excuses were painful and she did not want to hear him make them she affected to suppose he was going to criticize her oh i dont doubt you are going to say i should not speak of her in that way when she has had such a dreadful experience she reached for the teapot to have something to do but her hand was not as steady as he would have wished but i promise you what aunt vespasia says is quite true and i know it for myself stillim sure after this it will not happen again everything will be quite changed for her from now on poor creature she composed her face sufficiently to smile across at him and hold the teapot with hardly a quiver would you care for some more tea george he stared at her a mixture of incredulity and awe in his eyes she viewed it with a warm delicious tingle of satisfaction for a moment they stayed motionless understanding working through completing itself tea she repeated at last he held out his cup i expect you are right he agreed slowly in fact im sure you are it will definitely be quite different from now on her whole body relaxed she smiled at him dazzlingly and let the tea pour right up the cup far too full for good taste he looked at it with a slight surprise then smiled as well a wide intense smile like one who has been delightfully amazed miss laetitia said nothing about the affair of selena but miss lucinda more than made up for it spilling opinions out like shopping from a burst basket every color and shape but all adding weight to her conviction that there was something incredibly wicked going on in the walk and she would devote every ounce of courage she possessed to discovering what it was lady tamworth reinforced her volubly but took no action afton nash was also of the opinion that the only women who get molested are those who invite such things and therefore deserve little sympathy phoebe wrung her hands and grew even more terrified hallam cayley continued to drink immediately after the next event emily called her carriage in the morning and rushed around unannounced to regale charlotte with the news she almost tumbled out of the door onto the pavement ignoring the footmans help in her excitement and forgot to give him any instructions she thumped on charlottes door charlotte apron up to her chin dustpan in hand answered it her face blank with surprise emily burst in past her leaving the door open are you all right charlotte pushed it shut and followed after her as emily swept into the kitchen and planted herself on one of the kitchen chairs im marvelous emily replied youll never imagine what has happened miss lucinda has seen an apparition a what charlotte stared at her in disbelief sit down emily commanded make me some tea im dying of thirst miss lucinda saw an apparition last night she has taken to the chaise lounge in the withdrawing room in a state of complete collapse and everyone is rushing around to call on her simply aching to know what happened she will be holding court i would love to be there but i had to come and tell you isnt it ridiculous charlotte had put on the kettle the tea things were already prepared as she had intended to have a cup herself in an hour or two she sat down opposite emily and gazed at her flushed face an apparition what do you mean a ghost of fanny or something shes mad does she drink do you think miss lucinda good gracious no you should hear what she says about people who drink that doesnt mean she doesnt do it herself well she doesnt and no not a ghost of anybody but something hideous and evil staring at her through her window its face pressed against the glass she said it was pale green with red eyes and had horns out the top of its head oh emily charlotte burst out laughing she cant have there isnt any such thing emily leaned forward but thats not all she said urgently one of the maids saw something running away sort of loping and it jumped clear over the hedge and hallam cayleys dog howled half the night maybe it was hallam cayleys dog in the first place charlotte suggested and it howled because it was shut up again and maybe beaten for running away rubbish its quite a small dog and it isnt green she could have thought its ears were horns charlotte was not going to give up then she collapsed in laughter but i would love to have seen miss lucindas face ill wager that was as green as anything at the window emily burst into giggles too the kettle was spouting steam all over the kitchen but neither of them took any notice it really isnt funny emily said at last wiping away her tears charlotte saw the kettle and stood up to make the tea sniffing and dabbing at her cheeks with the end of her apron i know she agreed and i am sorry but its so silly i cant listen to it and keep a straight face i suppose poor phoebe will be even more terrified now i havent heard but i wouldnt be surprised if she took to her bed as well she wears a crucifix the size of a teaspoon all the time i cant imagine a man who would attack and molest you in the dark being warded off by that poor creature charlotte brought the teapot to the table and sat down again i wonder if theyll send for thomas for apparitions more like the vicar an exorcism charlotte said with delight i should love to see that do you think they really will emily raised her eyebrows and began to giggle again how else do you get rid of green monsters with horns a little more water and a little less imagination charlotte said tartly then her face softened poor thing i suppose she has little else to do the only events of any meaning in her life are those she dreams up nobody really needs her at least after this shell be famous for a few days emily reached over and poured the tea but she did not reply it was a pathetic and sobering thought at the end of august there was a dinner party at the dilbridges to which emily and george were invited along with the rest of the walk surprisingly the invitation also included charlotte if she would care to come it was only ten days since miss lucindas apparition and charlottes interest was still very much alive she was not even concerned as to how she would present a suitable appearance if emily passed on the invitation she would no doubt also have in mind some gown charlotte could wear as usual curiosity won over pride and without hesitation she accepted yet another of aunt vespasias gowns considerably made over by emilys ladys maid it was a rich oyster shaded satin with a little lace on it though much had been taken off and replaced with chiffon to make it appear younger altogether turning slowly in front of the cheval glass charlotte was very pleased with it and it was marvelous to have someone else to do her hair it was extremely difficult to wind hair elegantly at the back of ones own head her hands always seemed to be at the wrong angle thats fine emily said tartly stop admiring yourself youre becoming vain and it doesnt suit you charlotte smiled broadly it might not but it feels wonderful she picked up her skirts swishing them a little and followed emily down to where george was waiting for them in the hallway it was an event aunt vespasia had chosen not to attend although as a matter of course the invitation had included her it was a long time since charlotte had been to a party at all and in the past she had not enjoyed them much but she felt quite differently about this it was not a case of accompanying mama so that she might be paraded before suitable potential husbands this time she was secure in pitts love not anxious what society should think of her and not especially concerned to impress she could go and be quite naturally herself and there was no effort required since she was essentially a spectator the dramas in paragon walk did not affect her because the main tragedy did not touch emily and if emily wished to become involved in the minor farces that was her own affair it was quite a small dinner by the dilbridges usual standards not more than two or three faces that charlotte did not already know simeon isaacs was there with albertine dilbridge much to lady tamworths obvious disapproval the misses horbury were dressed in pink and it looked surprisingly well on miss laetitia jessamyn nash floated in in silver gray looking quite marvelous only she could have contrived at once to warm the color with life and at the same time leave untarnished its wraithlike essence for a moment charlotte envied her then she saw paul alaric standing next to selena his head bent a little to listen to her elegant and faintly humorous charlotte raised her chin a little higher and approached them with a dazzling smile mrs montague she said brightly im so glad to see you looking so well she did not want to be obvious above all not in front of alaric waspishness might amuse him but he would not admire it selena looked slightly surprised apparently it was not what she had expected i am in excellent health thank you she said with eyebrows raised they swapped polite nothings but as charlotte looked more closely at selena she realized that her initial words had been perfectly true selena did appear in excellent health she looked nothing like a woman who had recently suffered the violence and obscenity of rape her eyes were brilliant and there was a flush on her cheeks that was so high and yet so delicate charlotte was convinced it owed nothing to art she moved a little quickly small gestures of her hands eyes glancing round the room if this was a display of courage a defiance of the tacit consensus that a women ravished was somehow justly despoiled and must remember it all her life then for all her dislike charlotte could only admire it she did not allude to the incident again and the conversation passed to other things small items in the news trivia of fashion presently she drifted away leaving selena still with alaric she looks remarkably well dont you think grace dilbridge observed with a small shake of her head i dont know how the poor creature bears it it must take a great deal of courage charlotte replied it did not come easily to her to praise selena but honesty obliged it one cannot help admiring her admire miss lucinda spun round her face flushed with anger you must admire whom you choose mrs pitt but i call it brazen she is disgracing the whole of womanhood i really think next season i must go somewhere else it will be extremely hard for me but the walk has become defiled beyond endurance charlotte was too surprised to answer immediately and grace dilbridge did not seem to know what to say either brazen miss lucinda repeated staring at selena now walking on alarics arm across the floor toward the open french doors alaric was smiling but there was something in the angle of his head that betrayed courtesy rather than interest he seemed even faintly amused miss lucinda snorted charlotte found her tongue at last i think that is a most unkind thing to say miss horbury and quite unjust mrs montague was the victim not the perpetrator of the crime what utter nonsense it was afton nash palefaced eyes glittering i find it hard to imagine you can really be so naive mrs pitt feminine charms may be considerableto some he raked her up and down with a contempt that seemed to strip her of her gorgeous satins and leave her naked to the prying and derision of everyone but if you imagine they are such as to drive men to force themselves upon the unwilling you overrate your own sex he smiled icily there are enough willing positively eager for titillation who even find a perverse pleasure in violence and submission to it no man need risk his reputation by assaulting the unwilling whatever any given woman may choose to say afterward thats a disgusting thing to say algernon burnon had been close enough to overhear now he stepped forward ashen faced his slight body shaking i demand that you withdraw it and apologize or you willwhat aftons smile did not alter request me to choose between pistols and swords dont be ridiculous man nurse your offense by all means if you must believe whatever you want to about women but dont try to make me believe it too a decent man algernon said stiffly would not speak ill of the dead nor insult another mans grief and whatever anyones most private weaknesses or shame he would not make public mock of it to charlottes amazement afton did not reply his face drained of all blood and he stared at algernon as if no one else existed in the room seconds ticked by and even algernon seemed frightened by the intensity of aftons frozen hatred then afton turned on his heel and strode away charlotte breathed out slowly she did not even know why she was frightened she did not understand what had happened neither apparently did algernon himself he blinked and turned to charlotte im sorry mrs pitt im sure we must have embarrassed you it is not a subject we should have discussed in front of ladies but he took in a deep breath and let it out i am grateful to you for defending selenafor fannys sakeyou charlotte smiled i understand and no person who is worth counting a friend would think otherwise his face relaxed a little thank you he said quietly a moment later she found emily at her elbow what happened emily demanded anxiously it looked dreadful it was unpleasant charlotte agreed but i dont really know exactly what it meant well what did you do emily snapped i praised selena for her courage charlotte replied looking at emily very directly she had no intention of going back on it and emily might as well know emilys brows wrinkled her mood changed in the instant from anger to puzzlement yes isnt it extraordinary she seems almostelated it is as if she had won some secret victory that none of the rest of us know about she is even nice to jessamyn and jessamyn is nice to her too its ridiculous well i dont like selena either charlotte admitted but i am obliged to admire her courage she is defying all the bigoted little people who say she is somehow to blame for what happened to her whoever had the fire to do that would have my regard emily stood staring across the enormous room to where selena was talking to albertine dilbridge and mr isaacs a few feet away from them jessamyn stood with a champagne glass in her hand watching hallam cayley take what must have been his third or fourth rum punch since his arrival her expression was unreadable it could have been pity or contempt or it might have had nothing to do with hallam at all but when her eyes moved to selena there was nothing in them but pure delicious laughter emily shook her head i wish i understood she said slowly perhaps im meanspirited but i really dont think its just courage ive never seen selena in that way maybe its my fault but i dont know thats not defiance shes pleased with herself i swear it you know shes set her cap at monsieur alaric charlotte gave her a withering look of course i know it do you think im blind and deaf too emily ignored the barb promise you wont tell thomas or i shant tell you charlotte promised immediately she could not possibly forego the secret whatever conflicts followed afterward emily pulled a face on the night it happened i was the first person there as you know charlotte nodded well i asked her straightaway who it was do you know what she told me of course i dont she made me swear not to accuse him but she said it was paul alaric she stood back and waited for charlottes amazement charlottes first feeling was one of disgust not for selena but for alaric then she rejected the whole idea thrusting it away thats ridiculous why on earth should he attack her she is chasing him so hard all he would need to do is stop running away and he would have her for the asking she knew she was being cruel and she intended it exactly emily agreed which only makes the mystery greater and why does jessamyn not care if monsieur alaric is really so passionate about selena that he ravished her in the walk surely jessamyn would be beside herself with ragewouldnt she but she isnt she is laughing i can see it in her eyes every time she looks at selena so she doesnt know charlotte reasoned then she thought more deeply but rape is not a matter of love emily it is violence possession a strong man a man who is capable of caring does not force a woman he takes love as it is offered knowing that that which is demanded has no meaning the essence of strength is not in overpowering others but in mastering oneself love is giving as well as receiving and when one has once known love one sees conquest as the act of a weak and selfish person the momentary satisfaction of an appetite and then it is no longer attractive merely rather sad emily frowned and her eyes were clouded you are talking about love charlotte i was only thinking of physical things they can be quite different without any love at all perhaps there is even a little hate in them maybe selena did secretly rather enjoy it to have lain with monsieur alaric willingly would be a sin and even if society did not particularly care her friends and family would but to be the victim excuses her at least in her own mind but if it was not so dreadful and she was excited by it when she knew she should have been revolted then she has had it both ways she is innocent of the guilt and yet she has had the pleasure charlotte thought about it for a few moments then discarded it perhaps not with reason but because she did not wish it to be true i dont think it can be a pleasure and why is jessamyn so amused then i dont know emily gave up but it is not as simple as it seems she moved away going over toward george who was trying unsuccessfully to reassure phoebe muttering something soothing to her and obviously highly embarrassed phoebe had taken to speaking much about religion and was never without a crucifix he had no idea what to say to her and was overwhelmed with relief when emily took over determined to turn the conversation away from salvation to something more trivial such as how to train a good parlormaid charlotte watched in admiration at the skill with which it was done emily had learned a lot since cater street the play amuses you it was a soft voice very beautiful just behind her charlotte spun round a little too quickly for grace paul alaric raised his eyebrows very slightly it hovers between tragedy and farce doesnt it he said with a slow smile i fear mr cayley is destined for tragedy there is a pervading darkness in him that will engulf him altogether before long and poor phoebeshe is so terrified and she has no need charlotte was confused she was unprepared to discuss reality with him in fact she was not sure even now whether he was speaking seriously or merely playing verbal games she searched for an answer that would not commit her he waited his eyes soft latin dark but without the overt sensuality she always associated in her mind with italy they seemed to look inside her without effort to read her how do you know she has no need she asked his smile broadened my dear charlotte i know what she is afraid ofand it does not existat least not here in paragon walk then why dont you tell her so she was angry feeling for phoebes panic he looked at her with patience because she would not believe me like miss lucinda horbury she has convinced herself oh you mean miss lucindas apparition suddenly she was weak with relief he laughed outright oh i dont doubt she saw something after all if she will go poking her virtuous nose into other peoples affairs it is too much temptation for someone to resist putting something there for her to sniff at i imagine it was very real her green monsterat least for the occasion she wanted to disapprove but even more than that she wanted to believe him thats quite irresponsible she said in what she imagined to be a stiff voice the poor woman might have had a seizure with fright he was not fooled for an instant i doubt it i think she is a remarkably durable old lady her indignation will keep her alive even if only to find out what is going on do you know who it was she asked his eyes widened i dont even know that it happened at all i have only deduced it she did not know what else to say she was very aware of him standing close to her he did not need to touch her or to speak for her to be conscious of him above and beyond everyone else in the room had he attacked fanny and then selena or had it been someone else and selena had merely wished herself into believing it was he she could understand that it removed the assault from the realm of the sordid and humiliating to something dangerous but not without thrill to pretend even to herself that his company was not without deep and rather disturbing undertones of excitement a kind of dominance would be dishonest was it unconscious perception of violence in him that fascinated her was it true that women in some primitive depth they must deny actually longed for rape did they all even herself secretly hunger for him woman wailing for her demon lovera line of verse ugly and appropriate intruded into her mind she shook it away forcing herself to smile although it felt artificial and grotesque i cant imagine anyone dressing up in such a ludicrous fashion she said trying to be light i think it was more likely to have been a stray animal or even the branches of some shrub or other in the gaslight perhaps he said gently i wont argue with you indeed they were prevented from continuing with the subject any further by the arrival of the misses horbury themselves and lady tamworth good evening miss horbury charlotte said politely lady tamworth how resolute of you to come alaric added and charlotte could have kicked him miss lucindas face flushed for a moment she disapproved of him and therefore disliked him but she could not refuse praise i knew it to be my duty she replied soberly and i shall not return home alone she looked at him pointedly her pale blue eyes wide i would not be foolish enough to go unaccompanied in paragon walk charlotte saw alarics fine brows rise very slightly and knew precisely what he was thinking she felt a desperate desire to giggle the idea of any man least of all paul alaric willfully accosting miss lucinda was preposterous very wise alaric agreed meeting her challenging look squarely i doubt anything at all would have the temerity to attack three of you the faintest suspicion crossed her face that he was somehow amused by her but since she saw nothing funny herself she dismissed it as a foreign joke and not worthy of attention certainly not lady tamworth agreed enthusiastically there is no limit to what can be accomplished if we band together and there is so much to be done if we are to preserve our society she glanced balefully across at simeon isaacs head bent to albertine dilbridge his face alight and we must act quickly if we are to succeed at least that abominable mr darwin is dead and can do no more harm once an idea is published lady tamworth its originator does not need to survive alaric pointed out anymore than the seed need the sower in order to flourish she looked at him with distaste of course you are not english monsieur alaric you could not be expected to understand the english people we will not take seriously such blasphemies alaric affected innocence was not mr darwin an englishman then lady tamworth shrugged her shoulder sharply i know nothing about him nor do i wish to such men are not a fit subject for the interest of decent people alaric followed the line of her eye im sure mr isaacs would agree with you he said with a faint smile and charlotte was forced to stifle a giggle by pretending to sneeze being a jew alaric continued avoiding her eye he would not countenance mr darwins revolutionary theories hallem cayley drifted up his face heavy another glass in his hand no he looked at alaric with dislike the poor sod believes man is made in the image of god i think the ape far more likely myself you are surely not saying now that mr isaacs is a christian lady tamworth bridled a jew hallam answered carefully and distinctly then took another drink the creation belongs to the old testament or havent you read it i am of the church of england she said stiffly i dont read foreign teachings that is primarily what is wrong with society these days a great deal of new foreign blood these are names now that i never heard of when i was a girl no breeding heaven only knows where they come from hardly new maam alaric was standing so close to charlotte she fancied she could feel the warmth of him through the thick satin of her gown mr isaacs can trace his ancestry back to abraham and he back to noah and so back to adam and so back to god hallam drained his glass and dropped it on the floor impeccable he glared triumphantly at lady tamworth makes the rest of us look like yesterdays bastards doesnt it he grinned broadly and turned away lady tamworth shook with rage her teeth clicked quite audibly charlotte felt a pity for her because her world was changing and she did not understand it it had no place for her she was like one of mr darwins dinosaurs dangerous and ridiculous beyond its time i think he has had too much to drink she said to her you must excuse him i dont suppose he meant to be so offensive but lady tamworth was not mollified she could not forgive he is appalling it must have been associating with men like that that gave mr darwin his ideas if he does not leave then i shall would you care for me to escort you home alaric asked instantly i doubt mr cayley will leave she looked at him with loathing but forced herself to refuse civilly charlotte burst into giggles covering her face with her hands you were quite dreadful she said to him furious with herself for laughing she knew it was the pressure of fear and excitement as much as humor and she was ashamed you do not have the sole prerogative to be outrageous charlotte he said quietly you must allow me a little fun as well a few days later charlotte received a note from emily written in haste and some excitement from something that phoebe had said emily was now perfectly convinced that in spite of her selfrighteous prying miss lucinda was right and there was something going on in the walk she herself had certain more practical ideas as to how its nature could be uncovered especially if it had something to do with fanny and with fulberts disappearance and it was hard to believe it had not of course charlotte made immediate arrangements for jemima and by eleven oclock in the morning she was at emilys door emily was there as soon as the maid she almost scurried charlotte into the morning room lucindas right she said urgently she is dreadful of course and all she wants is to discover some piece of scandal she can tell everyone else and feel thoroughly superior about shell dine out on it for the rest of the season but she wont find out anything because shes going about it all the wrong way emily charlotte took hold of her gripping her arm she could only think of fulbert for heavens sake dont look what happened to fulbert we dont know what happened to fulbert emily said reasonably she shook charlottes arm off with impatience but i want to find outdont you charlotte wavered how emily scented victory she did not push she tried a little honest flattery your suggestioni suddenly realized that was the way thomas cant do it it would have to be casual who charlotte demanded explain yourself emily before i explode maids emily was leaning forward now her face shining maids notice everything between them maybe they dont know what all the different pieces mean but we might but thomas charlotte started although she knew emily was right nonsense emily brushed it aside no maid is going to talk to the police but we cant just go questioning other peoples maids emily was exasperated for goodness sake i shant be so obvious i shall go for some quite different reason a recipe i admire or i could take some old dresses i have for jessamyns maid you cant do that charlotte said in horror jessamyn will give her her own old things she must have dozens you couldnt explain any reason yes i could jessamyn never gives her old dresses away she never gives anything away once it has been hers she keeps it or burns it she doesnt allow anyone else to have her things besides her ladys maid is about the same size as i am i have looked out a muslin from last year that will be perfect she can wear it on her afternoon off we shall go when i know that jessamyn is out charlotte was very dubious about the idea and feared it might prove embarrassing but since emily patently intended going regardless her curiosity obliged her to go as well she had misjudged emily they learned nothing that seemed of any value at jessamyns but the maid was delighted with the dress and the whole interview appeared as natural as a chance conversation with no purpose at all but pleasantry they proceeded to phoebes arriving at the only time of the day when she was to be absent and learned of an excellent mixture for making furniture wax with a most pleasing smell it seemed phoebe had taken to visiting the local church at odd hours lately as often as every other day poor creature emily said as they left i think all these tragedies have quite turned her mind i dont know whether she is praying for fannys soul or what charlotte did not understand the idea of praying for the dead but there was nothing difficult in sympathizing with the need for comfort a quiet place where faith and simplicity had found refuge over the generations she was glad that phoebe had discovered it and if it gave her calm helped hold at bay the terrors that crowded in on her so much the better im going to see hallam cayleys cook emily announced you know the weather is quite different today i am thoroughly cold even though i put on a warmer dress i do hope we arent going to have a wretched spell the season isnt nearly over it was true here was an east wind and it was definitely chill but charlotte was not interested in the weather she pulled her shawl tighter and kept up with emily you cant just walk in and ask to speak to his cook what on earth excuse have you youll make him suspicious or else he will just think you illmannered he wont be in emily said impatiently i told you i have chosen my times with great care she cannot cook pastry to save herself you could shoe horses with it thats why hallam always eats pastry when he is out but she is a genius with sauces i shall beg her for a recipe to impress aunt vespasia that will flatter her and then i can pass on to general conversation i am convinced hallam knows about what is going on he has behaved like a man haunted for the last month or more i think in his own way he is as frightened as phoebe they were almost to the door she stopped to let her shawl fall a little more gracefully adjusted her hat and then pulled the bell the footman opened the door immediately his face fell with surprise when he saw two unaccompanied women ladylady ashworth im sorry maam but mr cayley is not at home he ignored charlotte he was not sure who she was and had more than enough to deal with without her emily smiled disarmingly how unfortunate i was wondering if he might be kind enough to permit me to speak with your cook mrs heath isnt it mrs heath yes mlady emily favored him with a dazzling look her sauces are quite famous and as i have my husbands aunt lady cumminggould staying for the season i wanted to impress her with something special now and then my cook is excellent buti know it is an impertinence but i wondered if mrs heath would be generous enough to share a recipe of course it would not be the same not made by her but it would still be remarkable she smiled hopefully he thawed this was his realm and understandable if you care to wait in the withdrawing room mlady ill ask mrs heath to come up and see you thank you im obliged emily swept in and charlotte followed behind her you see emily said triumphantly when they were seated and the footman had disappeared all it needs is a little forethought when mrs heath arrived it was immediately apparent that she had decided to revel in her moment of glory negotiations were going to be protracted and she would require every possible compliment before parting with the secret of her creations it was equally obvious that she would share them the fame already glittered in her eyes they were about at the point of accomplishment when a small very smutty maid came clattering down the stairs and burst into the withdrawing room mobcap askew and hands black mrs heath was outraged she drew breath to deliver a blast of rebuke but the girl spoke before her mrs heath please mum the chimneys on fire in the green room mum i lit the fire to get rid of that smell like you told me to and now its all smoke everywhere and i cant put it out mrs heath and emily looked at each other in consternation its probably a birdnest in the chimney charlotte said practically since her marriage she had had to learn about such things she had called the sweep more than once for her own house dont open the windows or youll make the draught worse and itll really burn get a long handled broom and well see if we can dislodge it the maid stood unsure whether to obey a strange woman or not well go on girl mrs heath decided she would have given the same advice if good manners had not prevented her from speaking first i dont know why you had to ask me emily seized the chance to reinforce her advantage rather than risk being cut short before her real purpose by an inopportune domestic emergency it may be quite far up perhaps we had better see if we can help if it is not done properly there may be a real fire and without waiting for agreement she marched out of the door and followed the scuttering maid up the stairs charlotte went as well curious to see more of the house and to hear anything that might be said not that she shared emilys expectation of any useful information regarding fulbert or fanny the green bedroom was indeed full of smoke and the fumes caught in their throats as soon as they opened the door oh emily coughed and stepped back oh thats awful it must be a very big nest perhaps youd better get a bucket of water and put the fire out charlotte said sharply to the maid can you fetch a pitcher from the bathroom and be quick then when it is out we can open all the windows yes mum the girl scurried away now thoroughly frightened in case she should be blamed for the whole affair emily and mrs heath stood coughing happy for charlotte to take command the girl came back and offered the pitcher to charlotte eyes wide and alarmed mrs heath opened the door then when she saw no flames decided to reassert herself she took the pitcher and strode in hurling the contents on the billowing fireplace there was a belch of steam and soot flew out covering her white apron she leapt back furious the girl stifled a giggle and turned it into a choke but the fireplace was dead and black running trickles of sooty water into the hearth now mrs heath said with determination she had a personal vendetta with the thing and it was not going to beat her especially not in front of visitors and her own upstairs maid she seized the broom the girl had been using to sweep the floor and advanced on the chimney she launched a brisk swipe up the cavernous hold and struck something unyielding her face fell in surprise its an awful big nest i shouldnt wonder if the birds still there by the feel you were right miss she poked fiercely at it again and was rewarded with a fall of soot she momentarily forgot her language and abused it roundly try poking to one side and see if you can unbalance it charlotte suggested emily was watching closely her nose wrinkled it doesnt smell very pleasant she said unhappily id no idea wet fires were soso sickly mrs heath put the broom in slightly sideways and jabbed hard there was another trickle of soot a scraping noise and then quite slowly the body of fulbert nash slithered down the chimney and fell spreadeagled across the wet fireplace it was blackened with soot and smoke and maggots had infested the flesh the smell was unspeakable nine pitt found no pleasure at all in the discovery of fulberts body not even the satisfaction of solving a mystery he had expected fulbert to be dead but the deep stab wound in his back made suicide impossible even if someone else had disposed of the body by stuffing it up the chimney although he could think of no reason why any innocent person should do so except perhaps afton nash to hide his brothers guilt to everyone else a suicide was the perfect answer to the rape and murder of fanny and fulbert had been dead a long time probably since the night he disappeared the body was decomposed in the heat of summer and riddled with maggots it was not possible he could have been alive to attack selena it was another murder they brought a closed coffin and took him away then pitt turned to the inevitable hallam cayley was waiting he looked appalling his face was gray and running with sweat and his hands shook so badly the glass rattled against his teeth pitt had seen shock before he was used to watching while people came face to face with horror or guilt or overwhelming grief he had never learned to tell one kind of shock from another looking at cayley now he did not know what the man felt except that it was total and appalling pitts mind observed and thought of questions to ask but a feeling of pity drenched him and put reason into a silent background hallam set the glass down i dont know he said hopelessly so help me god i did not kill him why did he come here pitt asked he didnt hallams voice was rising his control was thin slipping away i never saw him i dont know what the hell happened pitt had not expected admission at least not yet perhaps he was one of those who would deny everything even when there was proof or it was conceivable he really did know nothing pitt would have to speak to all the servants as well it would be long and wretched finding guilt was always finding tragedy when he had first joined the police he had thought it would be dispassionate the solution of mysteries now he knew otherwise when did you last see mr nash he asked hallam looked up surprised his eyes bloodshot good god i dont know it was weeks ago i dont remember when i saw him but not the day he was killed i do know that pitt raised his eyebrows slightly you believe he was killed when he disappeared he asked hallam stared at him the color rushed up his face then ebbed away again the sweat stood out on his lip wasnt he i should imagine so pitt said wearily its not possible to tell now i suppose he could have stayed up there indefinitely as long as that room wasnt used the smell would have got worse of course did you give the maids orders to clean in there for heavens sake man i dont care about housekeeping they clean when they want to thats what i have servants fornot to have to think about things like that there was no point in asking him if his servants were acquainted with fulbert in any personal way that had all been gone into already and everyone had denied it which was to be expected it was forbes who elicited a surprising new fact or at least a statement the footman admitted now that he had opened the door to fulbert on the afternoon of his disappearance while hallam was out and fulbert had gone upstairs saying he wished to speak to the valet the footman had assumed that he had let himself out afterward but now it was obvious that he had not he excused himself for the lie in his first account by saying he did not believe it important and had not wished to implicate his master on so flimsy a coincidence being naturally afraid for his employment it ended in an unsatisfactory impasse the valet denied having seen fulbert and nothing could be proven forbes said there had long been all manner of rivalries and old feuds among the household staff and he had no idea whom to believe according to previous testimony either of the manservants could conceivably have killed fanny if one or more were lying and neither of them could have attacked selena finally pitt went back to the station posting a constable to see that none of the cayley servants moved from the walk the whole thing left a sour and unfinished taste in his mouth but he could accomplish no more with questions now fulbert was buried immediately and the funeral was a small and somber affair almost as if the dreadful corpse were in full view instead of discreetly nailed into a polished dark wood box pitt attended this time not out of pity for the dead but because he needed to observe the mourners charlotte had not come and neither had emily they were both still suffering from the horror of discovering the body and in truth charlotte had known him so little her presence might be interpreted not so much as respect but rather as mere curiosity emilys condition gave her ample excuse to remain at home george grim and whitefaced body stiff against the wind was the only representative of the family pitt borrowed a black coat to cover his own rather multicolored clothes and stood discreetly at the back half under the yew trees hoping no one would do more than glance at him possibly even assume him to be part of the undertaking party he waited as the cortege arrived black crepe fluttering in the wind no one spoke except the minister and his singsong voice floated over the hard clay and the withered grass between the gravestones there were no women except the immediate family phoebe and jessamyn nash phoebe looked appalling her skin was ashen and there were dark blotches under her eyes she stood with shoulders hunched from the back she might have been an old woman he had seen abused children with that same resigned look terrified and yet too sure of the blow to bother to run jessamyn was totally different her back was as straight as a soldiers her chin high and even the drifting black veil over her face could not hide the luminosity of her skin and the glittering eyes fixed on the yew branches shifting in the wind at the far side where the walk went down to the lychgate the only betrayal of emotion was the hardclenched hands so hard that but for the gloves surely the nails would have bitten into the skin all the men were there pitt studied them one by one his memory turning over everything he knew about them searching for reasons inconsistencies anything from which to distill an answer fulbert had been murdered because he knew who had raped fanny and then selena surely there could be no other cause no other secret in the walk worth killing for could it have been algernon burnon it would have needed no great strength to strike the blow a single plunge with a knife he was close to the open grave his face sober no passion in it it was unlikely he had cared much for fulbert probably he was thinking of fanny had he loved her whatever grief he had felt had been masked behind generations of careful composure gentlemen did not make exhibitions of their feelings it was unbecoming effeminate to show obvious distress a gentleman managed even to die with dignity who had decided on the long engagement surely if he had felt such violent hunger for her he could have insisted the marriage take place sooner many women married at fannys age or younger there was nothing hasty or improper about it looking at algernons calm face now pitt found it too difficult to believe there lay behind it ungovernable passion of any sort diggory nash was next to him close to jessamyn but not touching her indeed she looked so unlike a woman who needed any supporting arm it would almost have been an impertinence an intrusion to have offered her one she was isolated in whatever feeling gripped her unaware of the rest of them even of her husband did she know something about diggory that they did not pitt stared at him from the discreet shelter of the yews it was a less proportionate face than aftons and yet so much warmer there was no laughter in it now but the lines were there and a gentleness in the mouthperhaps not the power of afton had some weakness of appetite years of easy gratification led him to a mistaken identity in the dark rape of his own sister and murder to hide it surely such a character would have betrayed itself before now guilt and terror would have wracked him haunted his solitude kept him awake ended in some desperate folly and downfall all forbess questions had elicited no complaint from any maid as to diggorys behavior admittedly there had been advances but no unwelcome ones had been pressed refusal had been accepted on the rare occasions it was offered with humor and resignation no pitt could not believe diggory was more than exactly what he seemed and george he knew now why george had been so evasive in the beginning he had simply been too drunk to remember where he had beenand too embarrassed to say so perhaps the fright would have done him good at least for emilys sake freddie dilbridge he had his back to pitt now but pitt had watched him as he walked down the path behind the coffin his face had been anxious confused rather than grieved if there was fear it was of the unknown the inexplicable not the alltooplain fear of one who knows precisely what is wrong and what the vengeance for it will be and yet there was something about freddie that troubled pitt he had not yet discovered what it was dissolute parties were not exceptional there were always those who were bored occupied by no necessity to earn their bread or even to administer their property driven by no ambition who found entertainment in satisfying their own appetites or the more bizarre appetites of others voyeurism was not novel even a little moral blackmail afterward a feeling of superiority although that picture fitted his minds perception of afton nash better there was cruelty in him a delight in the frailty of others especially the sexual frailty he was a man who might well pander to tastes he despised for the pleasure of reveling in his own superiority at the same time pitt could not think of anyone he had disliked as much to be the victim of ones own faults however grotesque he could find a pity for but to delight in and prey upon the weakness of others was beyond the realm of any compassion he could muster afton was standing at the head of the grave his eyes on the minister grim and hard but then he had buried a brother and had a sister murdered in one short summer was it conceivable he was the archhypocrite and had violated and killed his own sister then stabbed to death his brother to keep his secret was that why phoebe was disintegrating in terror before their eyes descending from eccentricity into madness dear god if it were pitt must catch him prove it and have him taken away pitt had never enjoyed hanging it was commonplace a part of societys mechanics to purge itself of a disease but still he found it repellent he knew too much about murder about the fear or the madness that impelled it he had seen and smelled the grinding poverty the unnumbered deaths from and diseases of starvation in the rookeries and he knew there were forms of murder that never soiled the hands longdistance extermination that blind society and profit never looked at death from hunger happened a hundred yards from death from obesity and yet he felt if afton were guilty he could have sent him to the gallows without any personal pity the frenchman paul alaric was there if indeed he were french perhaps he came from one of the african colonies he was far too smooth too wry and subtle to be from the great windandsnowdriven plains of canada there was something incredibly old in him pitt could not conceive of him belonging to the new world everything about him spoke of centuries of civilization roots deep enough to cling to the very core and heart of old cultures and rich dark history he stood now with black head bent and the rising wind sleek and beautiful even in this graveyard he mirrored respect for the dead courteous observance of custom was that all he was here for pitt had discovered no relationship between him and fulbert except that of neighbors could alaric be the supreme actor was there unfulfilled hunger under that intelligent face hunger so violent it had driven him to attack first fanny and then the alltoowilling selena or was selena not really willing when it came to the point he dared not dismiss it it was his duty to consider everything possible however unlikely and yet he could not force himself to believe that alaric was so different from every appearance over years of studying people pitt had become a skilled judge and he had found most people do not hide much of themselves from a careful watcher one who listens to every phrase watches the eyes the hands the small deceptions to build the vanity the tiny exhibitions of greed or ambition the betrayals of essential selfishness the straying eyes the grubby innuendos alaric might be a seducer but a rapist pitt could not believe that left hallam cayley he was standing over the grave from jessamyn staring at her as they at last began to shovel in the earth the hard clay rubble clattered on the lid sounding hollowly almost as if there were no body inside one by one they turned and walked awaythe observances were over now it was the gravediggers duty to finish fill in the earth and stamp it down a fine misty rain hung on the wind slicking the paths and making them dangerous hallam walked behind freddie dilbridge as pitt moved from the yews hurrying to keep pace with them he saw hallams face he looked like a man in a nightmare the pock marks in his skin seemed to have become deeper and he was pallid and sweating his eyes were puffed and even at that distance pitt could see the nervous twitch in one lid was it excess of drink that racked him and if so what torture had driven him to it surely loss of a dead wife would not have ravaged him so from all that he and forbes had learned through questioning neighbors and servants the marriage had been no more than ordinary a fondness for each other but not a passion so consuming as to leave this devastation in its wake in fact the more pitt thought about it the less likely did it seem hallam had only been seen to drink more than most men in the last year certainly not since the time of his wifes death what had happened a year ago he had so far discovered nothing he was level with them now and hallam turned for a moment and saw him his face twisted with fear and recognition as if the gravestone he was passing were his own and he had read his name on it he hesitated staring at pitt then jessamyn caught up with him her face was tight all expression ironed out of it come hallam she said quietly take no notice of him he is here because it is his duty it means nothing her voice was quite flat she had composed herself till every vestige of feeling was suppressed controlled into what she wished it to be she did not touch him keeping herself apart at least a yard from him come she said again dont stand here youre holding everyone up reluctantly hallam moved not that he wished to obey or to leave so much as that there was no purpose in remaining pitt stood still watching their blackcreped backs as they wound up the damp path toward the lychgate and out onto the street could hallam cayley have raped fanny it was possible emily had said fanny was boring nondescript not the sort of girl to excite anyone but pitt remembered the small white body lying on the morgue table it had been very delicate virginal almost childlike the bones small the skin clear perhaps that very innocence had attracted she would demand nothing her own hungers would not have awoken yet there would be no expectations to satisfy no comparisons to be made with other lovers not even with dreams except the most limpid and unformed jessamyn had said she was too guileless to interest too young to be a woman but perhaps fanny had grown tired of being viewed as a child and had secretly started to think as a woman inside while preserving outside the image everyone expected of her perhaps she had seen jessamyns glamour and decided to grasp for a little of it herself had she practiced her budding arts on hallam cayley imagining him safe and found one dark evening that he was not that she had gone too far succeeded in her temptation it was believable more believable than that she had tempted some servant the other possibility of course was that she had been mistaken for someone else a maid there were several kitchen girls and between maids who were not unlike her in build even in face only the clothes were radically different would the fingers of an obsessed man in the dark feel the difference between fannys silk and a servant girls washcotton he had no idea but fulberts body had been found in hallams house the servants had let him in no one denied thatbut why had he gone there if not to see hallam had he waited till hallam came home as he had said he would do and then been killed for his knowledge or could it have been a manservant the footman or the valet again because of what he knew they could have killed fanny it was not impossible he had not forgotten that someone else could have come in it was not likely they had been let in by a servant any servant would tell of it only too glad to widen the circle of suspicion away from themselves but the garden walls were not high a man of average agility could climb over without difficulty his clothes would be marked brick dust moss stains they would be got rid of but pitt should ask valets he must get forbes to check again there were gates of course but he had already ascertained that hallams was kept locked he followed the last of the funeral out of the gate and turned up the street away from the graveyard and back toward the police station he believed it was hallam it was possible and the horror of it was in his face but he had not enough to prove it if hallam were simply to deny it to say someone had followed fulbert and seized the chance to murder him and leave the body in hallams house there was nothing to prove him a liar he could not arrest a man of hallam cayleys social position without a better case than that if he could not prove hallam guilty the next best thing he could do was to disprove any other possibility it was a thin caseand unsatisfactory at the police station one small question was answered why algernon burnon had been so reluctant to name the person in whose company he claimed to have been on the evening fanny was killed forbes had at last run her down a handsome and cheerful girl who in a higher class of society might have called herself a courtesan but from her usual clientele was no more than a tart no wonder algernon had preferred the odd glance of halfhearted suspicion to the surety that he had been paying for such indulgence while his fiancee was struggling for her life the day after pitt and forbes went back to the walk quietly going in by back doors and asking to see valets no ones clothes showed stains of damp or moss and there was no discernible brick dust just the general dust of a dry summer there had been one or two small tears but nothing unaccountable but then one could so easily say one had caught it getting in or out of a carriage or in ones own garden rose thorns tore one knelt on the grass to pick up a fallen coin or handkerchief he even went to hallam cayleys garden and asked permission to look at the walls on both sides and a highly nervous footman escorted him around step by step watching him with increasing tension and unhappiness as no mark or disturbance was found if anyone had climbed over these walls lately they had done it with a padded ladder placed so carefully it had not crushed the moss nor scratched a brick and they had smoothed out the holes left by the feet of the ladder in the ground such care seemed impossible how could he have hauled the ladder after him back to his own side without leaving great runnels in the moss on top of the wall and once back what then of the ladder marks in the ground the summer had been dry but the garden earth was still deep and friable enough to mark easily he tried it with the weight of his own foot and left an unmistakable print there was a door in the farthest wall onto the path beyond the aspen trees at the end but it was locked and the gardeners boy had the key and said it had never left him hallam was out tomorrow pitt would call and ask him about keys if he had ever had another and given or lent it but it was only a formality he did not believe for a moment that anyone else had come along the pathway at the end and let themselves in to keep an appointment with fulbert in hallams houseand still less that it could have been a chance meeting he went home and told charlotte nothing about it he wanted to forget the whole affair and enjoy his own family the peace and sureness of it even though jemima was asleep he demanded that charlotte get her up and then he sat in the parlor with her in his arms while she blinked at him sleepily unsure why she had been roused he talked to her telling her about his own childhood on the big estate in the country exactly as if she understood him and charlotte sat opposite smiling she had some white sewing in her hands he thought it looked like one of his shirts he had no idea if she knew why he was talking like thisthat it was to blot out paragon walk and what must be faced tomorrow if she had she was wise enough not to let him know there was nothing new at the police station he asked to see his superior officers and told them what he intended to do if there were no other explanation no other key to the garden door and no one had seen any other person he would have to assume it was someone in cayleys household and interrogate them in that light not only the footman and the valet but hallam cayley himself they were unhappy with the idea especially of accusing hallam but they conceded that it seemed unavoidable that it was someone in the housemost likely the valet or the footman pitt did not argue with them or give them all the reasons why he thought it was hallam after all most of it was deduction and the misery in the mans face the horror within him that was greater than anything outside they could so easily have said it was simply the terrors of a man who drinks too much and cannot stop himself and he could not have reasoned otherwise he arrived at the walk in the late morning and went straight to the house he rang at the front door and waited incredibly there was no answer he tried again and again there was nothing had some domestic crisis occupied the footman to the neglect of his usual duties he decided to go around to the kitchen door there surely would be servants there there were always maids in a kitchen at any time of the day he was still yards short of the door when he saw the scullery maid she looked up and gave a yelp grabbing at her apron front and staring at him good morning he said trying to force a smile she stood frozen to the spot speechless good morning he repeated i cant make anyone hear at the front may i come in through the kitchen the servants has got the day off she said breathlessly theres just me and cook and polly and mr cayley int up yet pitt swore under his breath had that fool of a constable allowed them all to leave the walkincluding the murderer where have they gone he demanded well oskins thats the valet es in is own room i reckon i aint seen im today but polly took im a tray o toast and a pot o tea and albert thats the footman i reckon as es probably gorn round to lord dilbridges cos es got a fancy for their upstairs maid is anything wrong sir pitt felt a wave of relief this time the smile was real no i shouldnt think so but id like to come in all the same i dare say someone could wake mr cayley for me i need to see him to ask him about one or two things oh i shouldnt sir mr cayley well ese wont like it e int very well in the mornings she looked anxious as if she feared she would be blamed for pitts arrival i dare say not he agreed but this is police business and it cant wait just let me in and ill wake him myself if you prefer she looked very dubious but she knew authority when she heard it and led him obediently through the kitchens and stopped at the baize door to the rest of the house pitt understood very well he said quietly ill tell him you had no choice he pushed the door open and went into the hall he had only got as far as the bottom stair when the barest movement caught his eye just an inch or two as of something unfixed among the straight wooden pillars of the stairway he looked up it was hallam cayley swinging by his neck very very slightly from his dressing gown cord attached to the bannister where it ran along the landing only for the first second was pitt surprised then it all seemed dreadfully tragically inevitable he started to climb up slowly until he reached the landing closer to it was obvious hallam was dead his face was mottled but had not the purplish look of suffocation he must have broken his neck as soon as he jumped he was lucky a man of his weight might easily have snapped the cord and ended up two stories below brokenbacked but still alive pitt could not haul him up alone he would have to send one of the servants for forbes and a police surgeon the whole team he turned around and went down slowly what a sad predictable end to a wretched story there was no satisfaction in it no sense of solution he went through the baize door and told the cook and the girl simply that mr cayley was dead and they were to go next door and ask one of the manservants to send for the police a surgeon and a mortuary coach there were fewer hysterics than he had expected perhaps after the discovery of fulberts body they were not entirely surprised perhaps they had no more emotion left then he went back upstairs to look at hallam again and see if there were any letter any explanation or confession it did not take him long it was in the bedroom on a small writing table the pen and ink were still beside it it was open and not addressed to anyone i did assault fanny i left freddies party and went out into the garden then into the street i found fanny there quite by chance it all began as a flirtation weeks before that she pursued it i realize now she did not understand what she was doing but at the time i was beyond thinking but i swear i did not kill her at least the day afterward i would have sworn it the day after i was stunned as anyone nor did i touch selena montague i would have sworn that i dont even remember what i was doing that night i was drinking but i never cared for selena even drunk i would not have forced myself on her ive thought about it till my mind reeled ive woken in the night cold with terror am i losing my mind did i stab fanny without even knowing what i was doing i didnt see fulbert alive the day he was killed i was out when he called and when i came back my footman told me he had shown him upstairs i found him in the green bedroom but he was already dead lying on his face with the wound in his back but so help me god i dont remember doing it i did hide him i was terrified i did not kill him but i knew they would accuse me i put him up the chimney it was large and i am a great deal bigger than fulbert he was surprisingly light when i picked him up even though he was dead weight it was awkward getting him into the cavern of it but there are niches up there for the sweeps boys and i managed it at last i wedged him in i thought he might stay there forever if i locked the room off i never thought of spring cleaning and of mrs heath having a master key perhaps i am mad maybe i killed both of them and my brain is so clouded with darkness or disease i dont know it i am two people one tormented lonely full of regrets not knowing the other half and haunted by terrors of itthe other god or the devil knows what a savage a madman killing again and again death is the best thing for me life has nothing but forgetfulness in drink between terrors of my other self i am sorry about fanny truly sorry that i know i did but if i killed her or fulbert it was my other self a creature i dont know but he will at least die with me pitt put it down he was used to feeling pity the wrench inside of a pain one could not reach for which there was no balm he walked back onto the landing there were police coming in at the front door now there would be the long ritual of surgeons examination search of his belongings recording of the confession such as it was it gave him no sense of accomplishment he told charlotte about it in the evening when he got home not because he felt any ease over it but because it concerned emily for several moments she said nothing then she sat down very slowly poor creature she let out her breath quietly poor haunted creature he sat down opposite her looking at her face trying to close hallam and everything else to do with paragon walk out of his mind for a long time there was silence and it became easier he began to think of things they might do now that the case was over and he would have some time off jemima was big enough not to take cold they might go for a trip up the river on one of the excursion boats even pack a picnic and sit on the back and eat if the weather stayed so fine charlotte would enjoy that he could picture her now her skirts spread around her on the grass her hair bright as polished chestnuts in the sun perhaps next year if they were careful of every penny they might even go to the country for a few days jemima would be old enough then to walk she could discover all the beautiful things pools of water in the stones flowers under the hedges perhaps a birds nest all the things he had known as a child do you think it was the loss of his wife that started his madness charlottes voice scattered his dream and brought him back rudely to the present what the death of his wife she repeated do you think grief and loneliness preyed on his mind till he drank too much and became mad i dont know he did not want to think about it maybe there were some old love letters among his things they looked as if they had been read several times edges a bit bent one or two tears they were very intimate very possessive i wonder what she was like she died before emily went there so she never knew her what was her name i dont know she didnt bother to sign the letters i suppose she just left them around the house for him charlotte smiled a tight sad little gesture how dreadful to love someone so intensely and then for them to die his whole life seems to have disintegrated since then i hope if i died you would always remember me but not like that the thought was horrible bringing the darkness of the night inside the room void and immense never ending cold as the distance to the stars pity for hallam overwhelmed him there were no words for it just the pain she moved to kneel on the floor in front of him taking his hands gently her face was smooth and he could feel the warmth of her body she did not try to say anything find words to comfort but there was a sureness in her quiet beyond his understanding it was several days before emily called and when she came in with a swirl of dotted muslin she was glowing as charlotte had never seen her before she was quite noticeably heavier now but her skin was flawless and there was a new shine in her eyes you look wonderful charlotte said spontaneously you should have children all the time emily pulled a dreadful face but it was in mock and they both knew it emily sat down on the kitchen chair and demanded a cup of tea its all over she said determinedly at least that part of it is charlotte turned slowly her own thoughts hardening and finding shape even as she swung from the sink to the table you mean youre not happy about it either she asked carefully happy emilys face fell how could i becharlotte dont you believe it was hallam her voice was incredulous her eyes wide i suppose it must have been charlotte said slowly pouring water into the kettle and over the top spilling into the sink without noticing he admitted assaulting fanny and there was no other reason for killing fulbert but emily challenged i dont know charlotte turned off the tap and emptied the excess out of the kettle i dont know what else emily leaned forward ill tell you we never discovered what it was that miss lucinda saw and what it is that is going on in the walk and there is something dont try to tell me it was all something to do with hallam because it wasnt phoebe is still terrified if anything she is even worse as if hallams death were just one more thread in the ghastly picture she can see she said the oddest thing to me yesterday which is partly why i came today to tell you what charlotte blinked somehow all this seemed at once unreal and yet as if it had been inevitable all her vague unease was focused now what did she say that all the things that had happened had concentrated the evil in the walk and there was no way we could exorcise it now she hardly dared to imagine what abominable thing would happen next do you think perhaps she is mad too no i dont emily said firmly at least not mad the way you mean she is silly of course but she knows what shes talking about even if she wont tell anyone well how are we going to find out charlotte said immediately the thought of not trying to discover never occurred to her emily had also taken it for granted ive worked it out from all the things everyone has said she got down to business now decisions made in her mind and im almost certain it is something to do with the dilbridges at least with freddie dilbridge i dont know who is involved and who isnt except that phoebe knows and it terrifies her but the dilbridges are having a garden party in tendays time george doesnt approve but i mean to go and you are coming too we shall break away from the party without being noticed and explore the house if we are clever enough we shall find something if there is real wickedness in that place it will have left something behind maybe well discover whatever it was that miss lucinda saw it has to be there memories of fulberts charred body slithering down the chimney flashed into charlottes mind it would be a long time before she wished to poke into other peoples rooms in search of answers but then on the other hand neither could she possibly leave the question unanswered good she said firmly what shall i wear ten charlotte went to the garden party feeling marvelous emily high on the wave of her own wellbeing had given her a new dress all white muslin and lace with tiny pin tucks at the yoke she felt like daisies in the wind of a summer field or the white foam of a mountain stream inexpressible shimmeringly clean everyone in the walk was there even the misses horbury as though they were making a determined effort to put everything sordid or tragic behind them firmly in the past and for a hot still afternoon totally to forget it emily was gowned in spring green her best color and she positively radiated delight we are going to find out what it is she said softly to charlotte gripping her by the arm as they walked across the grass toward grace dilbridge i havent made up my mind yet whether she knows or not ive been listening very carefully to everyone the last few days and i rather think grace doesnt wish to know so she has made sure not to find out by accident charlotte remembered what aunt vespasia had said about grace and her enjoyment in being put upon perhaps if she discovered the secret it would be too appalling for her to find any pleasure in it anymore after all if ones husband sinned in an average way only slightly more openly than most one could be expected to endure it gracefully and be sympathized with ones social position would not be jeopardized but if the sin were extraordinary something unacceptable then one would be required to take action even perhaps to leaveand that was altogether another matter a woman who leaves her husband for whatever reason is not only financially a disaster but socially quite beyond condoning invitations simply cease they were now in front of grace dilbridge who was looking rather a poor color in a purple that did not suit her it was far too hot a shade for such a heavy day there were tiny thunder flies in the air and it was difficult not to forget ones manners and brush them away quite violently as they itched the skin and caught in ones hair in a most unpleasant sensation how charming to see you mrs pitt grace said automatically im so delighted you were able to come how well you look emily my dear thank you they both replied together then emily went on i had no idea your garden was so large how lovely it is does it extend beyond that hedge also oh yes there is a herbaceous walk and a small rose garden grace waved an arm i have sometimes wondered if we should try growing peaches on that south facing wall but freddie wont hear of it emilys elbow poked charlotte and charlotte knew she was thinking of the garden room it must be somewhere behind that hedge indeed emily said with polite interest i do love peaches i should insist if i had such a place there is nothing like a fresh peach in the season oh i couldnt grace looked uncomfortable freddie would be most angry he gives me so many things he would think me most ungrateful if i were to make an issue of such a small matter this time it was charlotte who poked emily discreetly with her foot under the clouds of her skirt she did not want emily to press too hard and make their interest obvious they had already learned enough the garden room was behind that hedge and freddie did not want peaches anywhere near it they excused themselves after again saying how delighted they were to be there the garden room emily said as soon as they were out of earshot freddie does not want her going there to pick peaches at awkward moments he has his private parties out there ill wager you anything charlotte did not take her up but parties are not much she said slowly unless something quite awful goes on what we need to know is who goes to them do you think miss lucinda recalls with any clarity at all what she saw or will it be so embroidered over with imagination by now that it isnt any use she must have told it umpteen times emily bit her lip in irritation i really should have asked her when it happened but i was so annoyed by her and so delighted that someone had given her a good fright that i deliberately avoided her and i didnt want to pander to her vanity she was sitting up on the chaise lounge you know with smelling salts an embroidered cushion with chinese dragons behind her so aunt vespasia said and a whole jugful of lemonade receiving callers like some duchess and insisting on telling the whole story right from the beginning to every one of them i simply could not have been civil to her i should have burst into laughter now i wish id had more self control charlotte was not in a position to criticize and she knew it without replying she looked around the rosehung garden to see if she could find miss lucinda she was bound to be with miss laetitia and they were always in the same color there emily touched her arm and she turned this time they were in forgetmenot blue and it was far too young for either of them the touches of pink only made it worse like some confection that had become overheated oh dear charlotte said under her breath stifling a gasp of laughter its got to be done emily replied severely come on side by side they attempted to look casual as they drifted over toward the misses horbury hesitating on the way to compliment albertine dilbridge on her gown and exchange a greeting with selena how did she take it charlotte asked the moment they were away from her take what emily was for once confused hallam charlotte said impatiently after all its a bit of a letdown isnt it i mean to be ravished in overwhelming passion by paul alaric is rather romantic in a disgusting sort of way but to be molested by hallam cayley when he was too drunk and wretched to know what he was doing and didnt even remember it afterward is just terribleshe stopped and all the mockery drained out of herand very tragic oh emily obviously had not thought of it i dont know then the idea began to interest her charlotte saw it in her face but now that i consider it she has rather gone out of her way to avoid me ever since then once or twice i have thought she was going to speak to me then at the last moment she had suddenly found something else more pressing do you suppose she knew it was hallam all the time charlotte asked emily screwed up her face im trying to be fair she was finding it an effort and it showed i dont know what i think i dont suppose it matters now charlotte was not satisfied some small doubt a question unresolved gnawed at the back of her mind but she suffered it to remain for the moment they were approaching the misses horbury and she must compose herself to pry discreetly and with grace she fixed an interested smile on her face and plunged in before emily had the opportunity how nice to see you again miss horbury she gazed at miss lucinda with something like awe i do admire your courage after such an appalling experience i am only beginning now fully to appreciate what you must have been through so many of us lead sheltered lives we have no imagination of the dreadful things there are so close to us if only we knew she mentally kicked herself for being a hypocrite the more so because she was rather enjoying it miss lucinda was too steeped in her own convictions to recognize a complete turn of character she puffed herself out with satisfaction reminding charlotte of a pastelcolored pouter pigeon how perceptive of you mrs pitt she said solemnly so many people dont understand what dark forces there are at work and how near to us they are quite for a moment charlottes nerve failed her she caught sight of miss laetitia her pale eyes wide and was not sure whether there was laughter in them or if it was only a reflection of the light she took a deep breath of course she continued you must know better than the rest of us i have been fortunate i have never been brought face to face with pure evil few of us have my dear miss lucinda was warming to this new show of interest and i most sincerely hope you never have the misfortune to be one of us oh so do i charlotte put a great deal of feeling into it she deliberately creased her brow in anxiety but then there is the question of duty she said slowly evil will not go away because we choose not to look at it she took a deep breath and faced miss lucinda squarely meeting her rather round eyes you will never know how much i admire you for your conduct your determination to get to the bottom of the circumstances here whatever they may be miss lucinda flushed with satisfaction how kind of you and how very wise i know few women of such sense especially among the young indeed charlotte continued ignoring a nudge from emily i admire you for coming here today at all she lowered her voice conspiratorially knowing what we have heard about parties here miss lucinda blushed remembering her previous remarks about freddie dilbridge and his dissolute gatherings she struggled for an excuse for her presence with increasing delight charlotte gave it to her it must require a lot of selfsacrifice she said soberly but i do appreciate that you are determined at any cost to yourself in embarrassment or even positive danger that you must discover whatever dreadful thing it was you saw that night yes yes quite miss lucinda fastened onto it eagerly it is a matter of christian duty has anyone else seen it emily managed to say something at last if they have miss lucinda said darkly they have not said so maybe they were too frightened charlotte tried to get to her actual purpose at last what did it look like miss lucinda was surprised she had forgotten the actuality now she tried to picture it again evil she began wrinkling her face most evil it had a green face like a creature half man and half beast and there were horns on its head how appalling charlotte breathed out suitably impressed what manner of horns like a cow or a goat or oh like a goat miss lucinda said immediately curling back and what manner of body charlotte went on did it have two legs like a man or four like a beast two like a man and it ran away and leapt over the hedge leapt over the hedge charlotte tried not to sound disbelieving oh its quite a low hedge just ornamental miss lucinda was not as impractical as she appeared i could have jumped it myself when i was a girl not that i would have of course she added hastily of course not charlotte agreed struggling desperately to keep a straight face the picture of miss lucinda taking a flying leap at the garden hedge was too delicious to be denied which way did it go miss lucinda did not miss the point this way she said firmly down the walk toward this end emily saw charlottes face and rushed to rescue with noises of sympathy and horror it took them some time to break away without obvious discourtesy and when at last they did with an excuse that they must speak to selena emily turned to charlotte pulling her back by the sleeve in case they were upon selena before having an opportunity to speak to each other in private what on earth was it she hissed i thought at first she was inventing most of it but now i really do believe she saw something she isnt lying i would swear to that charlotte had already made up her mind someone dressed up to frighten her she answered under her breath not wanting any passerby to overhear them phoebe was only a few yards away standing with a wan smile listening to graces misfortunes away from what emily smiled dazzlingly at jessamyn as she floated past something here thats what we have to find out charlotte added a gesture of greeting i wonder if selena knows she went on to emily well find out emily sailed forward and charlotte was obliged to follow she still disliked selena in spite of the admiration for her courage she faced the unpleasant possibility that her feeling was mainly provoked because selena had said it was paul alaric who had assaulted her charlotte most intensely did not wish that to be true alaric was here this afternoon she had not spoken to him yet but she knew precisely where he was and that at the moment jessamyn was drifting casually over toward him in a froth of waterblue lace how pleasant to see you again mrs pitt selena said coolly if she was indeed pleased there was nothing of it in her voice and her eyes were as remote and chilly as a winter river and in so much more fortunate circumstances charlotte smiled back really she was getting to be a total hypocrite whatever was happening to her selenas face became even colder i am so happy for you that the entire matter is over charlotte continued goaded on by the profound dislike inside her of course it was a tragedy but at least the fear is past no more mystery she allowed her voice to be as cheerful as was decent no one need fear anyone else from now on all is explained and in the opensuch a relief i had not realized you were afraid miss pitt selena looked at her with a distaste that suggested her fear was quite ungrounded since she could have been in no possible danger charlotte rose to the occasion of course i was and for emily too after all if a woman of decorum and position such as yourself could be molested who on earth could count themselves safe selena struggled to think of an answer that was not blatantly rude and failed and such a relief for the gentlemen charlotte went on relentlessly none of them are under suspicion anymore we know now that not any of them were in the least way guilty it must be a sad and distressing situation to be obliged to suspect ones friends emilys fingers were digging into charlottes arm and she was shaking so hard with suppressed laughter she had to pretend to have a sneezing fit the heat charlotte said sympathetically it really is most oppressive i shouldnt be surprised if the weather breaks soon and we have a thunderstorm i love thunderstorms dont you no selena said flatly i find them vulgar exceedingly so emily sneezed again violently and selena backed away algernon burnon was passing with a sherbet in his hand and she seized the chance to escape emily came up from her handkerchief you are absolutely appalling she said happily ive never seen her better confounded charlottes mind knew at last what it was that troubled her about selena you were the first to see her after she was attacked werent you she asked soberly yes why what happenedexactly emily was slightly surprised i heard her scream i ran out through the front of the house and saw her i went to her naturally and took her inside what do you mean what is it charlotte what did she look like look like like a woman who has been assaulted of course her dress was torn open and her hair was all over the place how was her dress torn charlotte insisted emily tried to picture it in her mind her hand went up to the left side of her own dress and made as if to rip it like that charlotte said quickly and was it muddy no not muddy there was probably dust but i didnt notice it was hardly the time but you told me she said it had happened on the grass charlotte pointed out by the rose beds its a hot dry summer emily waved her hands anyway what does it matter but those flower beds are watered charlotte persisted ive seen the gardeners doing it if she had been thrown to the ground well maybe it wasnt there maybe it was on the path what are you trying to say emily was beginning to understand emily if i tore my dress open and pulled my hair out then came screaming along the road how would i look different from the way selena looked that night emilys eyes were very clear blue not at all different she said as perception dawned i dont think anyone attacked selena charlotte framed her words with deliberation she made it up to draw attention to herself and to get even with jessamyn only jessamyn guessed the truth that was why she pretended to be so sorry for her and yet it didnt trouble her at all she knew paul alaric had never touched selena and neither did hallam emily answered her own question with the tone of her voice poor man tragedy overtook farce again and charlotte felt the chill of real terror and real death no wonder he was confused he swore he didnt attack selena and it was the truth anger hardened inside her for the mischief selena had caused albeit some of it unknowingly still it was a selfish and callous thing to do she was a spoiled woman and part of charlotte wanted to punish her at least to let her know that someone else knew what had really happened emily understood immediately a look passed between them and there was no need for explanations in time emily would allow selena to perceive very precisely both her anger and her contempt weve still got to find out what is going on here emily began again after a few moments that is only one small mystery solved it doesnt tell us what miss lucinda saw well just have to ask phoebe charlotte answered dont you think ive tried that emily was exasperated if it were so easy i would have known the answer weeks ago oh i know she wont tell us intentionally charlotte was not upset but she might let something slip obediently but without any expectations emily led her to where phoebe was sipping a lemonade and talking to someone neither of them knew it took ten minutes of innocuous pleasantries before they could get phoebe on her own oh dear emily said with a sigh what a tedious creature if i hear one more word about her health i shall be positively rude charlotte seized her chance she doesnt realize how fortunate she is she said looking at phoebe if she had been obliged to endure the strain that you have she would not make such an issue of a few sleepless nights she hesitated not quite sure how to phrase the question she intended so as not to be obvious when you know something dreadful has happened and suspicion is directed at those in your own family it must be a nightmare phoebes face was vacant for a moment with unfeigned innocence oh i was not worried over much i did not think diggory would do anything so cruel he is not in the least unkind you know and i knew it could not have been afton charlotte was stunned if ever there was an innately cruel man it was afton nash she would have suspected him still if there were any crime unsolved but of all crimes rape seemed to satisfy his character best how can you know she said without thought he was alone some of that evening i to charlottes amazement phoebe blushed scarlet the color burning painfully up her face to the very roots of her hair i she blinked and her eyes filled with tears and looked away i had confidence it could not be himthatthat is what i meant to say but you do know there is something wrong in the walk emily took advantage of the moment and charlottes sudden silence phoebe stared at her her eyes widening as her mind flooded with a great question you know what it is she breathed emily hesitated unsure which was best to lie or to admit ignorance she compromised i know something and i mean to fight it will you help us it was masterly charlotte looked at her with admiration phoebe took her arm squeezing it till the pressure made her wince oh dont emily you cant realize what you are doing the danger isnt over you know there will be more and worse believe me then we must fight it we cant it is too big and too dreadful just wear a cross say your prayers every night and morning and dont go out at night dont even look out of your windows just stay at home and dont inquire into anything do as i say emily and maybe it wont come after you charlotte wanted to say more but she was hurt inside by such fear she grasped emily perhaps that is good advice she swallowed her feelings if you will excuse us we must speak to lady tamworth we have not even acknowledged her yet of course phoebe murmured but do be careful emily remember what i said emily gave her a weak smile and walked reluctantly toward lady tamworth it was another half hour before they had the opportunity to fade behind the rosebeds and disappear unobserved into the private part of the garden they were in a herbaceous walk backed by an even taller hedge of beach quite impenetrable where now charlotte asked behind that emily answered there has to be a way around it or else a gate i hope it isnt locked charlotte was annoyed at the thought it would stop them completely oddly enough it had not occurred to her before because she never locked doors herself they walked along side by side searching the thick leaves till they found the door almost overgrown it looks as if it isnt used emily said in disbelief this cant be it wait a minute charlotte looked at it more closely studying the hinges it opens the other way it must be all cleared on the other side for it to swing try it emily pushed it did not move charlotte felt her heart sink it was locked emily pulled a pin out of her hair and pushed it into the lock you cant do it with that charlotte let all her disappointment into her voice emily ignored her and went on poking she took the pin out and straightened it making a loop on one end then tried again there she said with satisfaction and pushed the flat surface of the door gently it swung open without a sound charlotte was staggered where did you learn to do that she demanded emily grinned my housekeepers always taking the keys with her even to bed and i hate being obliged to ask her to get into my own linen cupboard i thought it was rather a nice trick come on lets see what is through there they tiptoed through the door and swung it shut behind them at first it was disappointing just a large garden room set out in paved walkways with little plots of green herbs between they went all the way round it but there was nothing else emily stopped disgusted why on earth bother to lock the gate to this she said angrily theres nothing here charlotte bent to touch one of the herb leaves and crush it between her fingers it smelled bitter and aromatic i wonder if it is some sort of drug she said thoughtfully nonsense emily brushed it aside opium comes from poppies and they grow in turkey or china or somewhere there are other things charlotte refused to give up what a peculiar shape this garden is i mean the way the stones are laid out it must have taken someone an awful lot of work its only starshaped emily replied i dont think its very attractive its uneven a star yes the other points are over there and behind the room why how many points altogether something was beginning to form in charlottes mind a memory of a case pitt had been working on more than a year ago and a scar he had spoken of emily counted five why five that means it is a pentacle if thats what you call it emily was not impressed what does it matter emily charlotte turned to her the idea hard frightening inside her pentacles are the shapes people use when they practice black magic maybe thats what they do here at their parties now she remembered when pitt had mentioned the scaron the body of fannyon the buttock the place of most mockery thats why phoebe is so terrified she went on she thinks they have begun by playing but have conjured up real devils emily screwed up her face black magic she said incredulously isnt that a little farfetched i dont even believe in it but it made sense and the more charlotte thought of it the more sense it made you havent got any proof emily went on just because the garden is set out in a star shape lots of people might like stars do you know any charlotte demanded nobut weve got to get inside that room charlotte stared at it thats what miss lucinda saw someone dressed up in black magic robes with green horns thats ridiculous bored people sometimes do ridiculous things look at some of your society friends sometime emily squinted at her you dont believe in black magic do you charlotte i dont knowand i dont want to but that doesnt mean that they dont emily gave in then i suppose we had better see if we can get inside that room if you think miss lucindas monster could be in there she led the way across the bitter herbs and took out her hairpin again but this time there was no need the door was not locked it swung open easily and they stood staring into a large rectangular room with a black carpet and black curtained walls with green designs on them the sun streamed in through a totally glassed roof theres nothing here emily sounded annoyed now that she had come this far and was half convinced charlotte squeezed past her and went in she put her hand to the velvet curtains and brushed them slowly she was more than halfway around before she came to the space behind and saw the black robes and hoods there were crosses embroidered on them in scarlet upside down symbols of mockery like the one on fanny she understood immediately what they were and it was as if they were still alive the evil in them remained after the wearers had gone out of this place stripped to their ordinary faces and their daily lives among other people how many of them carried that scar on their buttock what is it emily asked from just behind her what have you found robes charlotte said quietly disguises what about miss lucindas monster no it isnt here maybe they didnt keep it emilys face was pale her eyes shadowed do you think it really is black magic devil worship and that sort of thing she was struggling to disbelieve it herself now that she actually saw it in its ugliness and absurdity yes charlotte said quietly she reached out and touched one of the hoods can you think of any other reason for all this and the pentacle and the bitter herbs that must be why phoebe wears a cross and keeps going to church all the time and why she thinks we cant ever get rid of the evil now that its here emily started to say something and it died on her tongue they stood staring at each other what can we do emily said at last before charlotte could think of any answer there was a sound at the door and they both froze in horror they had forgotten the possibility of someone else coming there was no conceivable explanation they could make they had unlocked the door in the hedge deliberately there was no way they could have lost their way and no one would believe they did not know or understand what they had found very slowly they turned to face the door paul alaric stood there black outlined against the sun well he said softly stepping in and smiling charlotte and emily stood so close together their bodies touched emily was gripping hard fingers digging in like claws so youve found it alaric observed a little foolhardy wasnt itto come looking for such a thing and alone he seemed amused at the back of her mind charlotte had always known it was foolish but curiosity had driven out awareness of danger and silenced warning in her brain now she stared at alaric and felt for emilys hand beside her was he the head of them the warlock was that why selena found it credible that he should have attacked heror was it why jessamyn knew he had not or could it be that the head was a womanjessamyn herself her mind whirled around all kinds of ugly thoughts alaric was coming toward them still smiling but with a slight furrow between his brows i think we had better get out of this room he said gently its an extraordinarily unpleasant place and i for one do not wish to be found here if one of its regular users should chance to come rregular she stammered his smile broadened into a harsh laugh good heavens you think im one of them im disappointed in you charlotte for one idiotic moment she blushed then who is she demanded defensively afton nash he took her by the arm and led her into the sun emily only inches behind her he pushed the door closed and continued along the path between the bitter herbs no afton is far too bloodless for anything of that sort his form of hypocrisy is much subtler than that then who charlotte was sure enough it was not george to be unafraid of his answer oh freddie dilbridge he said confidently and poor grace studiously turns a blind eye pretending it is just a normal excess of the flesh who else charlotte kept up with him leaving emily behind on the narrow path selena certainly he replied and i should think algernon poor little fanny before she diedat least i would guess so phoebe knows about it of courseshe is not as innocent of nature or people as she seemsand hallam without doubt and naturally fulbert knew from what he said even though he was never invited it all fitted into place what do they do she asked his mouth turned down at the corners rueful a little contemptuous nothing very much play at a little wickedness imagine they conjure demons you dont think it could bereal she hesitated to ask such a question outside in the summer garden with the beach hedge fluttering green above them it was getting hotter and stiller and there was a faint overcast across the sky the thunderflies were worse no my dear he said looking straight at her i dont pheobe thinks so yes i know she imagines a foolish and rather sordid game that has suddenly summoned up real spirits and set them loose in the walk to bring murder and insanity up from the dark regions of the damned his face was wry utterly reasonable dismissing such things to the realms of hysteria she frowned is there no such thing as black magic oh yes he pushed the door open in the hedge and stood back for them to go through most certainly there is but this is not it they emerged into the color and normality of the garden party again no one had seen them leave the beach hedge and pass along the herbaceous walk miss laetitia was listening dutifully to lady tamworth expounding on the evils of marrying beneath ones station and selena was having what appeared to be heated words with grace dilbridge everything was as usual they might only have been gone for moments charlotte had to shake herself to remember what she had seen freddie dilbridge standing so casually with a glass in his hand next to the pink roses dressed up in robes with a hood over his head and holding night parties inside a pentacle pretending to summon devils perhaps holding a black mass stripping the virgin fanny and branding her body with the crooked scar how little one knew of the thoughts writhing behind the facile mask she must make a supreme effort to be civil to him now dont say anything emily warned im not going to charlotte snapped back there isnt anything to say i was afraid you might try to point out how wicked it is i presume that that is why they like it charlotte picked up her skirts and swirled over toward phoebe and diggory nash afton was standing just beyond them before she got there she realized that although he had his back to them they were in the middle of a rather unpleasant conversation damn silly woman with an overheated mind afton said waspishly ought to stay at home and find something useful to do thats easy to say when it isnt you diggorys mouth turned down in contempt its hardly likely to be me aftons eyebrows went up in a sarcastic arch it would be a clever rapist who tackled me diggory raked him with a look of infinite distaste it would be a damn desperate one personally i would sooner try the dog then if the dog is raped we shall know where to look afton said coldly but without apparent surprise you keep some peculiar company diggory your tastes are becoming depraved at least i have tastes diggory snapped back i sometimes think you are so withered up you have no passions left for anything i wouldnt find it hard to believe that all signs of life are repulsive to you and anything that reminds you you have a body is unclean to your mind afton moved fractionally away from him there is nothing unclean in my mind nothing i need to look away from then youve a stronger stomach than i have what goes on in your brain terrifies me looking at you i could believe in those fantasies of the undead that are so popular these days corpses that wont stay buried afton held out his hands palms up as though weighing the sunlight as usual you are not very thorough diggory if i were one of your undead the sun would shrivel me he smiled with slow derision or didnt you read that far dont be so obvious diggorys voice was weary and irritated i was talking about your soul not your flesh i dont know whether it was the sunlight that shriveled you or just life but sure as hell waits something did he moved away heading toward a tray of peaches and sherbet phoebe dithered for a moment and then followed leaving afton to notice charlotte at last his cold eyes looked through her has your overfrank tongue placed you all by yourself again mrs pitt he inquired possibly she replied with equal chill but if so no one else has been blunt enough to tell me so but then to be alone is not always displeasing you seem to be visiting us in the walk rather frequently you did not bother with us before the rapist does it still hold some fascination for you perhaps a titillation an extravagance a wallowing in emotions hot dreams of violence and surrender without guilt his eyes traveled from her bosom down to her thighs charlotte shivered as if his hands had touched her she looked at him with total loathing you seem to imagine that women like to be raped mr nash it is a monstrous piece of arrogance a delusion to feed your vanity and excuse your behavior and it is quite untrue rapists are not magnificent they are pathetic men who are reduced to taking by force that which others can win for themselves if they did not hurt others so much one could pity such a creature itsits a kind of impotence his face froze but there was raw scalding hatred in his eyes as primal as birth and death if they had not been in this civilized garden with its ritual conversations the chink of glasses and polite laughter she felt he would have torn her open hacked at her with the sharp blade of a knife plunged it in hilt deep and torn her open she turned away sick with the taste of fear but not before she knew he had seen the understanding in her eyes no wonder poor phoebe had never even considered him the rapist and now charlotte knew too and that was something for which he would have no forgiveness this side of the grave she moved away unseeing consumed with her knowledge silks hung limp in the still air flawless skins were blackspotted with minuscule thunder flies and it was getting hotter all the time conversation flittered past her and she heard its sound but not its words you let it upset you too much its foolish and i dare say ugly but it need not touch you or your sister it was paul alaric holding out a glass of lemonade for her his eyes concerned but with the same inward gleam of humor as always she remembered the garden room it has nothing to do with that she shook her head i was thinking of something else something real he offered her the lemonade and with his other hand brushed a thunder fly away from her cheek she took the glass glad of it and as she turned slightly her eye caught jessamyn nash with a look of malevolence on her face this time she knew almost beforehand what it wasnothing complex just ordinary jealousy because paul alaric had touched her because his concern was for her and she knew it was real overwhelmingly charlotte wanted to escape from it all the politeness masking the envies the airless garden the silly conversations and the hatreds underneath where is hallam cayley buried she asked suddenly alarics eyes widened in surprise in the same graveyard as fulbert and fanny about a mile away or to be accurate just outside itunhallowed ground for a suicide i think ill go and visit it do you suppose anyone will notice if i pick a few flowers from the front as i go i doubt it but do you care not at all she smiled at him grateful for his not saying the expected and not criticizing her she broke off some daisies some sweet william and a few long heads of lupines already seeding a little at the bottom but still bright and set out along the walk toward the road at the end and the church it was not as far as she had expected but the heat was getting more oppressive all the time the clouds overhead were heavier and the flies were everywhere there was no one else in the graveyard and she passed unnoticed through the lychgate and down the path past the graves with their carved angels and their memories and beyond the yews to the small plot kept for those without the blessing of the church hallams grave was very new the ground still bearing the scars of disturbance she stood looking at it for several minutes before she laid the flowers down she had not thought to bring any kind of container and there was nothing already here maybe they thought no one would want to bring flowers for such a person she stared down at the clay still dry and hard and thought about the walk all the stupidity and the unnecessary pain and the loneliness she was still thinking when she heard another step and looked up jessamyn nash was coming out of the shade of the yew trees carrying lilies when she recognized charlotte she hesitated her face pinched and hard her eyes almost black what did you come here for she said very quietly coming toward charlotte now she held the lilies and their leaves upright and there was a silver gleam of scissors in her hand without knowing why charlotte was afraid as if the thunder and the electricity in the air had ripped through her jessamyn was standing opposite her the grave between them charlotte looked down at the flowers justjust to put these here jessamyn stared at them then slowly raised her foot and trod on them grinding them with the weight of her body till they were crushed and smeared on the stonehard clay she lifted her head and faced charlotte then calmly dropped her own lilies on the same spot above them there was a slow crackle of thunder and the first drops of rain fell huge and wet through their dresses to the skin charlotte wanted to ask her why she had done that the words were quite clear inside her head but her voice remained silent you didnt even know him jessamyn said between her teeth how dare you come here with flowers you are an intruder get out thoughts whirled in charlottes mind wild and amazing like flashes of light she looked at the lilies on the ground and remembered that emily had said jessamyn never gave anything away even when she did not want it anymore herself if she was finished with it she destroyed it but she never let anyone else have it emily had been speaking of dresses what difference does it make to you if i put flowers on his grave she asked as levelly as she could hes dead that doesnt give you any rights jessamyns face was getting whiter and she did not even seem aware of the heavy drops now falling you dont belong in the walk go back to your own society whatever that is dont try to force yourself in here but the thoughts were hardening clearing in charlottes brain all kinds of questions were at last falling into order finding answers the knife why pitt had found no blood on the road hallams confusion fulbert everything at last made a pattern even the love letters hallam had kept they werent from his wife were they she said aloud she didnt sign them because she didnt write them you did jessamyns eyebrows rose in perfect arches what on earth are you talking about the love letters the love letters to hallam that the police found they were yours you and hallam used to be lovers you must have had a key to the garden gate thats how you went to him and thats how you got in the day fulbert was killed of course no one saw you jessamyns lip curled thats idiotic why should i want to kill fulbert he was a miserable little wretch but thats not worth killing for hallam admitted raping fanny jessamyn winced almost as if she had been struck a physical blow charlotte saw it you cant bear that can you that hallam wanted another woman so much he took her by force least of all innocent ordinary little fanny she was guessing now but she believed it you sucked him dry with your possessiveness and when he wanted to let go you clung onto him driving him to escape in drink she took a deep breath of course he didnt remember killing fanny and there was no knife and no blood on the road he didnt kill her you did when she stumbled into your withdrawing room and told you what had happened your rage and jealousy all spilled over you had been put aside rejected for your own insipid little sisterinlaw you took the knifemaybe as easy as the knife from the fruit plate on the sideboardand you killed her right there in your own room the blood was all over your clothes but you could explain that and you just washed the knife and put it back in the fruit no one even looked at that so simple and when fulbert knew you too well with his prying eyes you had to get rid of him too perhaps he threatened you and you told him to go to hallam if he dared knowing you could go there along the back path and surprise him did you even know hallam was out that day you must have what a surprise you must have had when no one found the body you knew hallam must have hidden it and you watched him come apart tormented by fear of his own insanity jessamyns face was as white as the lilies on the grave and they were both wet with the rain their floating muslins clinging to them like shrouds youre very clever jessamyn said slowly but you cant prove any of it if you tell the police that ill just say you are jealous over paul alaric you dont belong in the walk her face narrowed and i know you dont for all your airs your dresses are made over ones of emilys you are trying to crash your way in here you are saying these things out of revenge because i know it oh the police will believe me charlotte felt a surge of power inside her and intolerable anger for jessamyns indifference to all the pain you see inspector pitt is my husband you didnt realize that and there are the love letters they are in your hand and it is very hard to wash all the blood off a knife it gets in the crevices where the handle fits the blade theyll find all these things you know once they know what to look for jessamyns face changed at last the alabaster calm broke and the hatred came flooding through she lifted the scissors and plunged them toward charlotte missing her only by inches as her foot slipped on the wet clay charlotte galvanized to life turning and running back over the rough grass and the great roots of the yews under them and into the graveyard her wet clothes slapping and clinging to her legs she knew jessamyn was behind her the rain was pouring down now guttering in yellow rivers over the baked ground she jumped over graves caught her feet in flowers and banged herself on the wet marble of the gravestones a plaster angel loomed up in front of her and she shrieked involuntarily plunging on only once did she turn back to see jessamyn yards behind her light gleaming on the scissors her corn silk hair in streamers charlotte was bruised now legs spattered arms hurt on the protruding corners of the stones once she fell over and jessamyn was almost on top of her before she scrambled to her feet fighting for breath sobbing if only she could reach the street there might be someone there someone sane and ordinary who would help her she was almost there turning back one more time to make sure jessamyn was not on her when she banged into something hard and arms closed round her she screamed imagination sending the scissor blades lunging through her flesh as they had through fannys and fulberts she struck out kicking and punching stop it it was alaric for a long breathless second she did not know whether she was more afraid of him or less charlotte he said quietly its over you were a fool to have come here alone but its over nowfinished very slowly she turned round and faced jessamyn mudstained and wet jessamyn let the scissors fall she could not fight both of them and she could not hide anymore come on alaric put his arm round charlotte you look appalling i think wed better call for the police charlotte found herself smilingyes send for the policeget pitt more than anything elseget pitt
