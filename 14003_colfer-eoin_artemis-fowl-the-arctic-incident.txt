eoin colfer artemis fowl the arctic incident artemis fowl a psychological assessment extract from the teenage years by the age of thirteen our subject artemis fowl was showing signs of an intellect greater than that of any human since wolfgang amadeus mozart artemis had beaten european chess champion evan kashoggi in an online tournament patented over twentyseven inventions and won the architectural competition to design dublins new opera house he had also written a computer program that diverted millions of dollars from swiss bank accounts to his own forged over a dozen impressionist paintings and cheated the fairy people out of a substantial amount of gold the question is why what drove artemis to get involved in criminal enterprises the answer lies with his father artemis fowl senior was the head of a criminal empire that stretched from dublins docklands to the backstreets of tokyo but he had ambitions to establish himself as a legitimate businessman he bought a cargo ship stocked it with cans of cola and set course for murmansk in northern russia where he had set up a business deal that could have proved profitable for decades to come unfortunately the russian mafia decided they did not want an irish tycoon cutting himself a slice of their market and sank the fowl star in the bay of kola artemis fowl the first was declared missing presumed dead artemis junior was now the head of an empire with limited funds in order to restore the family fortune he embarked on a criminal career that would earn him over fifteen million pounds in two short years this vast fortune was mainly spent financing rescue expeditions to russia artemis refused to believe that his father was dead even though every passing day made it seem more likely artemis avoided other teenagers and resented being sent to school preferring to spend his time plotting his next crime so even though his involvement with the goblin uprising during his fourteenth year was to be traumatic terrifying and dangerous it was probably the best thing that could have happened at least he spent some time outdoors and got to meet some new people its a pity most of them were trying to kill him report compiled by doctor j argon b psych for the lep academy files prologue murmansk northern russia two years ago the two russians huddled around a flaming barrel in a futile attempt to ward off the arctic chill the bay of kola was not a place you wanted to be after september especially not murmansk in murmansk even the polar bears wore scarves nowhere was colder except perhaps norilsk the men were mafiya enforcers and were more used to spending their evenings inside stolen bmws the larger of the two mikhael vassikin checked the fake rolex beneath the sleeve of his fur coat this thing could freeze up he said tapping the diving bezel what am i going to do with it then stop your complaining said the one called kamar its your fault were stuck outside in the first place vassikin paused pardon me our orders were simple sink the fowl star all you had to do was blow the cargo bay it was a big enough ship heaven knows blow the cargo bay and down she goes but no the great vassikin hits the stern not even a backup rocket to finish the job so now we have to search for survivors she sank didnt she kamar shrugged so what she sank slowly plenty of time for the passengers to grab on to something vassikin the famous sharpshooter my grandmother could shoot better lyubkhin the mafiyas man on the docks approached before the discussion could develop into an allout brawl how are things asked the bearlike yakut vassikin spat over the quay wall how do you think did you find anything dead fish and broken crates said the yakut offering both enforcers a steaming mug nothing alive its been over eight hours now i have good men searching all the way down to green cape kamar drank deeply then spat in disgust what is this stuff pitch lyubkhin laughed hot cola from the fowl star its coming ashore by the crateload tonight we are truly on the bay of kola be warned said vassikin spilling the liquid on to the snow this weather is souring my temper so no more terrible jokes its enough that i have to listen to kamar not for much longer muttered his partner one more sweep and we call off the search nothing could survive these waters for eight hours vassikin held out his empty cup dont you have something stronger a shot of vodka to ward off the cold i know you always keep a flask hidden somewhere lyubkhin reached for his hip pocket but stopped when the walkietalkie on his belt began to emit static three short bursts three squawks thats the signal the signal for what lyubkhin hurried down the docks shouting back over his shoulder three squawks on the radio it means that the k unit has found someone the survivor was not russian that much was obvious from his clothes everything from the designer suit to the leather overcoat had obviously been purchased in western europe perhaps even america they were tailored to fit and made from the highestquality material though the mans clothes were relatively intact his body had not faredso well his bare feet and hands were mottled with frostbite one leg hung strangely limp below the knee and his face was a horrific mask of burns the search crew had carried him from a ravine three klicks south of the harbour on a makeshift tarpaulin stretcher the men crowded around their prize stamping their feet against the cold that invaded their boots vassikin elbowed his way through the gathering kneeling for a closer look hell lose the leg for sure he noted a couple of fingers too the face doesnt look too good either thank you doctor mikhael commented kamar drily any id vassikin conducted a quick thiefs search wallet and watch nothing thats odd youd think a rich man like this would have some personal effects wouldnt you kamar nodded yes i would he turned to the circle of men ten seconds then therell be trouble keep the currency everything else i need returned the sailors considered it the man was not big but he was mafiya the russian organizedcrime syndicate a leather wallet sailed over the crowd skidding into a dip in the tarpaulin moments later it was joined by a car tier chronograph gold with diamond studding worth five years of an average russians wages wise decision said kamar scooping up the treasure trove well asked vassikin do we keep him kamar pulled a platinum visa card from the kidskin wallet checking the name oh we keep him he replied activating his mobile phone we keep him and put some blankets over him the way our lucks going hell catch pneumonia and believe me we dont want anything to happen to this man hes our ticket to the big time kamar was getting excited this was completely out of character for him vassikin clambered to his feet who are you calling who is this guy kamar picked a number from his speeddial menu im calling britva who do you think im calling vassikin paled calling the boss was dangerous britva was well known for shooting the bearers of bad news its good news rightyoure calling with good news kamar flipped the visa at his partner read that vassikin studied the card for several moments i dont read angliskii what does it say whats the name kamar told him a slow smile spread across mikhaels face make the call he said chapter family ties the loss of her husband had a profound effect on angeline fowl she had retreated to her room refusing to go outside she took refuge in her mind preferring dreams of the past to real life it is doubtful whether she would have recovered had not her son artemis the second done a deal with the elf holly short his mothers sanity in return for half the ransom gold he had stolen from the fairy police his mother fully recovered artemis junior focused his efforts on locating his father investing large chunks of the family fortune in russian excursions local intelligence and internetsearch companies young artemis had received a double share of fowl guile however with the recovery of his mother a moral and beautiful lady it became increasingly difficult for him to realize his ingenious schemes schemes that were ever more necessary to fund the search for his father angeline distraught by her sons obsession and afraid of the effects of the past two years on his mind signed up her thirteenyearold for treatment with the school counsellor you have to feel sorry for him the counsellor that is st bartlebys school for young gentlemen county wicklow ireland present day doctor po leaned back in his padded armchair eyes flicking across the page in front of him now master fowl lets talk shall we artemis sighed deeply smoothing his dark hair back from a wide pale brow when would people learn that a mind such as his could not be dissected he himself had read more psychology textbooks than the counsellor he had even contributed an article to the psychologists journal under the pseudonym doctor f roy dean schlippe certainly doctor lets talk about your chair victorian po rubbed the leather arm fondly yes quite correct something of a family heirloom my grandfather acquired it at auction at sothebys apparently it once stood in the palace the queens favourite a taut smile stretched artemiss lips perhaps a centimetre really doctor they dont generally allow fakes in the palace pos grip stretched the worn leather fake i assure you master fowl this is completely authentic artemis leaned in for a closer examination its clever i grant you but look here pos gaze followed the youths finger those furniture tacks see the crisscross pattern on the head machine tooled nineteen twenty at the earliest your grandfather was duped but what matter a chair is a chair a possession of no importance eh doctor po scribbled furiously burying his dismay yes artemis very clever just as your file says playing your little games now shall we get back to you artemis fowl the second straightened the crease in his trousers there is a problem here doctor really and what might that be the problem is that i know the textbook replies to any question you care to ask doctor po jotted in his pad for a full minute we do have a problem artemis but thats not it he said eventually artemis almost smiled no doubt the doctor would treat him to another predictable theory which disorder would he have today multiple personality perhaps or maybe hed be a pathological liar the problem is that you dont respect anyone enough to treat them as an equal artemis was thrown by the statement this doctor was smarter than the rest thats ridiculous i hold several people in the highest esteem po did not glance up from his notebook really who for example artemis thought for a moment albert einstein his theories were usually correct and archimedes the greek mathematician what about someone that you actually know artemis thought hard no one came to mind what no examples artemis shrugged you seem to have all the answers doctor po why dont you tell me po opened a window on his laptop extraordinary every time i read this my biography i presume yes it explains a lot such as asked artemis interested in spite of himself doctor po printed off a page firstly theres your associate butler a bodyguard i understand hardly a suitable companion for an impressionable boy then theres your mother a wonderful woman in my opinion but with absolutely no control over your behaviour finally theres your father according to this he wasnt much of a role model even when he was alive the remark stung but artemis wasnt about to let the doctor realize how much your file is mistaken doctor he said my father is alive missing perhaps but alive po checked the sheet really i was under the impression that he has been missing for almost two years why the courts have declared him legally dead artemiss voice was devoid of emotion though his heart was pounding i dont care what the courts say or the red cross he is alive and i will find him po scratched another note but even if your father were to return what then he asked will you follow in his footsteps will you be a criminal like him perhaps you already are my father is no criminal artemis pointed out testily he was moving all our assets into legitimate enterprises the murmansk venture was completely above board youre avoiding the question artemis said po but artemis had had enough of this line of questioning time to play a little game why doctor said artemis shocked this is a sensitive area for all you know i could be suffering from depression i suppose you could said po sensing a breakthrough is that the case artemis dropped his face into his hands its my mother doctor your mother prompted po trying to keep the excitement from his voice artemis had retired half a dozen counsellors from st bartlebys already this year truth be told po was on the point of packing his own bags but now my mother she po leaned forward on his fake victorian chair your mother yes she forces me to endure this ridiculous therapy when the schools socalled counsellors are little better than misguided dogooders with degrees po sighed very well artemis have it your way but you are never going to find peace if you continue to run away from your problems artemis was spared further analysis by the vibration of his mobile phone it was on a coded secure line only one person had the number the boy retrieved it from his pocket flipping open the tiny communicator yes butlers voice came through the speaker artemis its me obviously im in the middle of something here weve had a message yes from where i dont know exactly but it concerns the fowl star a jolt flew along artemis s spine where are you the main gate good man im on my way doctor po whipped off his spectacles this session is not over young man we made some progress today even if you wont admit it leave now and i will be forced to inform the dean the warning was lost on artemis he was already somewhere else a familiar electric buzz was crackling over his skin this was the beginning of something he could feel it chapter crusin for chix west bank haven city the lower elements the traditional image of a leprechaun is one of a small greensuited imp of course this is the human image fairies have their own stereotypes the people generally imagine officers of the lower elements police reconnaissance squad to be truculent gnomes or bulkedup elves recruited straight from their college crunchball squads captain holly short fits neither of these descriptions in fact she would probably be the last person you would pick as a member of the leprecon squad if you had to guess her occupation the catlike stance and the sinewy muscles might suggest a gymnast or perhaps a professional potholer but take a closer look past the pretty face into the eyes and you will see determination so fiery it could light a candle at ten paces and a streetwise intelligence that made her one of recons most respected officers of course technically holly was no longer attached to recon ever since the artemis fowl affair when she had been captured and held to ransom her position as recons first female officer had been under review the only reason she wasnt at home watering her ferns right now was that commander root had threatened to turn in his own badge if holly was suspended root knew even if internal affairs wasnt convinced that the kidnapping had not been hollys fault and only her quick thinking had prevented loss of life but the council members werent particularly interested in loss of human life they were more concerned with loss of fairy gold and according to them holly had cost them a fair chunk from the recon ransom fund holly was quite prepared to fly above ground and wring artemis fowls neck until he returned the gold but that wasnt the way it worked the book the fairy bible stated that once a human managed to separate a fairy from his gold then that gold was his to keep so instead of confiscating her badge internal affairs had insisted holly handle grunt work somewhere that she couldnt do any harm stakeout was the obvious choice holly was farmed out to customs and excise stuck in a cham pod and suckered to the rock face overlooking a pressureelevator chute deadend duty that said smuggling was a serious concern for the lower elements police it wasnt the contraband itself which was generally harmless junk designer sunglasses dvds cappuccino machines and such it was the method of acquiring these items the bwa kell goblin triad had cornered the smuggling market and was becoming increasingly brazen in its overground excursions it was even rumoured that the goblins had constructed their own cargo shuttle to make their expeditions more economically viable the main problem was that goblins were dimwitted creatures all it would take was for one of them to forget to shield and goblin photos would be bouncing from satellites to news stations around the world then the lower elements the last mudmanfree zone on the planet would be discovered when that happened human nature being what it was pollution stripmining and exploitation were sure to follow this meant that whichever poor souls were in the departments bad books got to spend months at a time on surveillance duty which is why holly was now anchored to the rock face outside a littleused chutes entrance e was a pressure elevator that emerged in downtown paris france the european capital was redflagged as a highrisk area so visas were rarely approved lep business only no civilian had been in the chute for decades but it still merited twentyfour seven surveillance which meant six officers on eighthour shifts holly was saddled with chix verbil for a pod mate like most sprites chix believed himself gods greenskinned gift to females and spent more time trying to impress holly than doing his job lookin good tonight captain was chixs opening line that particular night you do something with your hair holly adjusted the screen focus wondering what you could do with an auburn crew cut concentrate private we could be up to our necks in a firefight at any second i doubt it captain this place is quiet as the grave i love assignments like this nice n easy just cruisin holly surveyed the scene below verbil was right the once thriving suburb had become a ghost town with the chutes closure to the public only the occasional foraging troll stumbled past their pod when trolls began staking out territory in an area you knew it was deserted its jus you an me cap and the nights still young stow it verbil keep your mind on the job or isnt private a lowenough rank for you yes holly sorry i mean yes sir sprites they were all the same give him a pair of wings and he thought he was irresistible holly chewed her lip theyd wasted enough taxpayers gold on this stakeout the brass should just call it a day but they wouldnt surveillance duty was ideal for keeping embarrassing officers out of the public eye in spite of this holly was determined to do the job to the best of her ability the internal affairs tribunal wasnt going to have any extra ammunition to throw at her if she could help it holly called up their daily pod checklist on the plasma screen the gauges for the pneumatic clamps were in the green plenty of gas to keep their pod hanging there for four long boring weeks next on the list was thermal imaging chix i want you to do a flyby well run a thermal verbil grinned sprites loved to fly roger captain he said strapping a thermoscan bar to his chest holly opened a hole in the pod and verbil swooped out climbing quickly to the shadows the bar on his chest bathed the area below with heatsensitive rays holly punched up the thermoscan program on her computer the view screen swam with fuzzy images in various shades of grey any living creature would show up even behind a layer of solid rock but there was nothing just a few swear toads and the tail end of a troll shambling off the screen verbils voice crackled over the speaker hey captain should i take er in for a closer look that was the trouble with portable scanners the further away you were the weaker the rays became ok chix one more sweep be careful dont worry holly the chix man will keep himself in one piece for you holly drew a breath to make a threatening reply but the retort died in her throat on the screen something was moving chix you getting this affirmative cap im getting it but i dunno what im getting holly enhanced a section of the screen two beings were moving around on the second level the beings were grey chix hold your position continue scanning grey how could grey things be moving grey was dead no heat cold as the grave nevertheless on your guard private verbil we have possible hostiles holly opened a channel to police plaza foaly the leps technical wizard would undoubtedly have their video feed running in the operations booth foaly you watching yep holly answered the centaur just bringing you up on the main screen what do you make of these shapes moving grey ive never seen anything like it me neither there followed a brief silence punctuated by the clicking of a keyboard two possible explanations one equipment malfunction these could be phantom images from another system like interference on a radio the other explanation its so ludicrous that i hardly like to mention it yeah well do me a favour foaly mention it well ridiculous as it sounds someone may have found a way to beat my system holly paled if foaly was even admitting the possibility then it was almost definitely true she cut the centaur off switching her attention back to private verbil chix get out of there pull up pull up the sprite was far too busy trying to impress his pretty captain to realize the seriousness of his situation relax holly im a sprite nobody can hit a sprite that was when a projectile erupted through a chute window blowing a fistsized hole in verbils wing holly tucked a neutrino into its holster issuing commands through her helmets cornset code fourteen repeat code fourteen fairy down fairy down we are under fire e send warlock medics and backup holly dropped through the hatch rappelling to the tunnel floor she ducked behind a statue of frond the first elfin king chix was lying on a mound of rubble across the avenue it didnt look good the side of his helmet had been bashed in by the jagged remains of a low wall rendering his cornsystem completely useless she needed to reach him soon or he was a goner sprites only had limited healing powers they could magic away a wart but gaping wounds were beyond them im patching you through to the commander said foalys voice in her ear standby commander roots gravelly tones barked across the airwaves he did not sound in the best of moods no surprises there captain short i want you to hold your position until backup gets there negative commander chix is hit i have to reach him holly captain kelp is minutes away hold your position repeat hold your position behind the helmets visor holly gritted her teeth in frustration she was one step away from being booted out of the lep and now this to rescue chix she would have to disobey a direct order root sensed her indecision holly listen to me whatever theyre shooting at you it punched straight through verbils wing your lep vest is no good so sit tight and wait for captain kelp captain kelp possibly the leps most gungho officer famous for choosing the name trouble at his graduation ceremony still there was no officer holly would have preferred to have at her back going through a door sorry sir i cant wait chix took a hit in the wingyou know what that means shooting a sprite in the wing was not like shooting a bird wings were a sprites largest organ and contained seven major arteries a hole like that would have ruptured at least three commander root sighed over the speakers it sounded like a rush of static ok holly but stay low i dont want to lose any of my people today holly drew her neutrino from its holster flicking the setting up to three she wasnt taking any chances with the snipers presuming they were goblins from the bwa kell triad on this setting the first shot would knock them unconscious for eight hours at the very least she gathered her legs beneath her and rocketed out from behind the statue immediately a hail of gunfire blew chunks from the structure holly raced towards her fallen comrade projectiles buzzing around her head like supersonic bees generally in a situation of this kind the last thing you do is move the victim but with gunfire raining down on them there was no choice holly grabbed the private by his epaulettes hauling him behind a rustedout delivery shuttle chix had been out there a long time he was grinning feebly you came for me cap i knew you would holly tried to keep the worry from her voice of course i came chix never leave a man behind i knew you couldnt resist me he breathed i knew it then he closed his eyes there was a lot of damage done here maybe too much holly concentrated on the wound heal she thought and the magic welled up inside her like a million pins and needles it spread through her arms and ran down to her fingers she placed her hands on verbils wound blue sparks tingled from her fingers into the hole the sparks played around the wound repairing the scorched tissue and replicating spilt blood the sprites breathing calmed and a healthy green tinge started to return to his cheeks holly sighed chix would be ok he probably wouldnt fly any more missions on that wing but he would live holly laid the unconscious sprite on his side careful not to put pressure on the injured wing now for the mysterious grey shapes holly upped the setting on her weapon to four and ran without hesitation towards the chute entrance on your very first day in the lep academy a big hairy gnome with a chest the size of a bull troll pins each cadet to a wall and warns them never to run into an unsecured building during a firefight he says this in a most insistent fashion he repeats it every day until the maxim is etched on every cadets brain nevertheless this was exactly what captain holly short of the leprecon unit proceeded to do she blasted the terminals double doors diving through to the shelter of a checkin desk less than four hundred years ago this building had been a hive of activity with tourists queuing for aboveground visas paris had once been a very popular tourist destination but inevitably it seemed humans had claimed the european capital for themselves the only place fairies felt safe was in disneyland paris where no one looked twice at diminutive creatures even if they were green holly activated a motionsensor filter in her helmet and scanned the building through the desks quartz security panel if anything moved the helmets computer would automatically flag it with an orange corona she looked up just in time to see two figures loping along a viewing gallery towards the shuttle bay they were goblins all right reverting to all fours for extra speed trailing a hover trolley behind them they were wearing some kind of reflective foil suits complete with headgear obviously to fox the thermal sensors very clevertoo clever for goblins holly ran parallel to the goblins one floor down all around her ancient advertising hoardings sagged in their brackets twoweek solstice tour twenty gold grams children under ten travel free she vaulted the turnstile gate racing past the security zone and dutyfree booths the goblins were descending now boots and gloves flapping on a frozen escalator one lost his headgear in his haste he was big for a goblin over a metre his lidless eyes rolled in panic and his forked tongue flicked upwards to moisten his pupils captain short squeezed off a few bursts on the run one clipped the backside of the nearest goblin holly groaned nowhere near a nerve centre but it didnt have to be there was a disadvantage to these foil suits they conducted neutrino charges the charge spread through the suits material like fiery ripples across a pond the goblin jumped a good two metres straight up then tumbled unconscious to the foot of the escalator the hover trolley spun out of control crashing into a luggage carousel hundreds of small cylindrical objects spilled from a shattered crate goblin number two fired a dozen rounds hollys way he missed partly because his arms were jittery with nerves but also because firing from the hip only works in the movies holly tried to take a screen shot of his weapon with her helmet camera for the computer to run a match on but there was too much vibration the chase continued down the conduits and into the departure bay itself holly was surprised to hear the hum of docking computers there wasnt supposed to be any power here lep engineering would have dismantled the generators why would power be needed here she already knew the answer power would be needed to operate the shuttle monorail and mission control her suspicions were confirmed as she entered the hangar the goblins had built a shuttle it was unbelievable goblins had barely enough electricity in their brains to power a tenwatt bulb how could they possibly build a shuttle yet there it was sitting in the dock like a usedcraft sellers worst nightmare there wasnt a bit of it less than a decade old and the hull was a patchwork of weld spots and rivets holly swallowed her amazement concentrating on the pursuit the goblin had paused to grab a set of wings from the cargo hold she could have taken a shot then but it was too risky she wouldnt be surprised if the shuttles nuclear battery was protected by nothing more than a single layer of lead the goblin took advantage of his reprieve to skip down the access tunnel the monorail ran the length of the scorched rock to the massive chute this chute was one of many of the natural vents that riddled the earths mantle and crust magma streams from the planets molten core blasted up through these chutes towards the surface at irregular intervals if it wasnt for these pressure releases the earth would have shaken itself to fragments aeons ago the lep had harnessed this natural power for express surface shots recon officers rode the magma flares in titanium eggs in times of emergency for a more leisurely trip shuttles avoided the flares ascending the chutes on hotair currents to the various terminals around the world holly slowed her pace there was nowhere for the goblin to go not unless he was going to fly into the chute itself and nobody was that crazy anything that got caught up in a magma flare got fried right down to subatomic level the chutes entrance loomed ahead massive and ringed by charred rock holly switched on the helmets pa thats far enough she shouted over the howl of core wind give it up youre not going into the chute without science science was lepspeak for technical information in this case science would be flareprediction times accurate to within a tenth of a second generally the goblin raised a strange rifle this time taking careful aim the firing pin dropped but whatever this weapon was firing there wasnt any left thats the problem with nonnuclear weapons you run out of charge quipped holly fulfilling the ageold tradition of firefight banter even though her knees were threatening to fold in response the goblin hefted the rifle in hollys direction it was a terrible throw landing five metres short but it served its purpose as a distraction the triad member used the moment to fire up his wings they were old models rotary motor and a broken muffler the roar of the engine filled the tunnel there was another roar behind the wings a roar that holly knew well from a thousand logged flight hours in the chutes there was a flare coming hollys mind raced if the goblins had somehow managed to hook up the terminal to a power source then all the safety features would have been activated including captain short whirled but the blast doors were already closing the fireproof barriers were automatically triggered by a thermo sensor in the chute when a flare passed by below twometrethick steel doors shut off the access tunnel from the rest of the terminal they were trapped in there with a column of magma on the way not that the magma would kill them there wasnt much overspill from the flares but the superheated air would bake them drier than autumn leaves the goblin was standing on the tunnels edge oblivious to the impending eruption holly realized that it wasnt a question of the fugitive being crazy enough to fly into the chute he was just plain stupid with a jaunty wave the goblin hopped into the chute rising rapidly from view not rapidly enough a sevenmetrelong jet of roiling lava pounced on him like a waiting snake consuming him completely holly did not waste time grieving she had problems of her own lep jumpsuits had thermal coils to disperse excess heat but that wouldnt be enough in seconds a wall of dry heat would roll in there and raise the temperature enough to crack the walls holly glanced up a line of reinforced ancient coolant tanks were still bolted to the tunnel roof she slid her blaster to maximum power and began sinking charges into the belly of the tanks this was no time for subtlety the tanks buckled and split belching out rancid air and a few trickles of coolant useless thev must have bled out over the centuries and the goblins had never bothered replacing them but there was one left untouched a black oblong out of place among the standard green lep models holly positioned herself directly underneath and fired three thousand gallons of coolantenhanced water crashed on to her head at the very moment a heatwave came billowing in from the chute it was a curious sensation being burnt and frozen almost simultaneously holly felt blisters pop on her shoulders only to be flattened by water pressure captain short was driven to her knees lungs starving for air but she couldnt take a breath not now and she couldnt raise a hand to switch on her helmet tank after an eternity the roaring stopped and holly opened her eyes to a tunnel full of steam she activated the demister in her visor and got up off her knees water slid in sheets from her nonfriction suit she released her helmet seals taking deep breaths of tunnel air still warm but breathable behind her the blast doors slid open and captain trouble kelp appeared in the gap along with an lep rapidresponse team nice manoeuvre captain holly didnt answer too absorbed by the weapon abandoned by the recently vaporized goblin this was the prize pig of rifles almost half a metre long with a starlite scope clipped above the barrel hollys first thought had been that somehow the bwa kell was manufacturing its own weapons but now she realized that the truth was far more dangerous captain short pried the rifle from the halfmelted rock she recognized it from her history of law enforcement in service an old softnose laser softnoses had been outlawed long ago but that wasnt the worst of it instead of a fairy power source the gun was powered by a human aaa alkaline battery trouble she called have a look at this darvit breathed kelp reaching immediately for the radio controls on his helmet get me a priority channel to commander root we have class a contraband yes class a i need a full team of techies get foaly too i want this entire quadrant shut down trouble continued spouting orders but they faded to a distant buzz in hollys ears the bwa kell was trading with the mud people humans and goblins working together to reactivate outlawed weapons and if the weapons were here how long could it be before the mud people followed help arrived just after the nick of time in thirty minutes there were so many halogen spotlights buzzing around e that it looked like a golemworld movie premiere foaly was down on his knees examining the unconscious goblin by the escalator the centaur was the main reason that humans hadnt yet discovered the peoples underground lairs a technical genius who had pioneered every major development from flare prediction to mindwiping technology every discovery made him less respectful and more annoying but rumour had it that he had a soft spot for a certain female recon officer actually the only female recon officer good job holly he said rubbing the goblins reflective suit you just had a firefight with a kebab thats it foaly draw attention away from the fact that the bwa kell foxed your sensors foaly tried on one of the helmets not the bwa kell no way too dumb goblins just dont have the cranial capacity these are human manufacture holly snorted and how do you know that recognize the stitching nope replied foaly tossing the helmet to holly holly read the label made in germany id guess that this is a fire suit the material keeps the heat out as well as in this is serious holly were not talking a couple of designer shirts and a case of chocolate bars here some human is doing some serious smuggling with the bwa kell foaly stepped out of the way to allow the technical crew access to their prisoner the techies would tag the unconscious goblin with a subcutaneous sleeper the sleeper contained microcapsules of a sedative agent and a tiny detonator once tagged a criminal could be knocked out by computer if the lep realized he was involved in an illegal situation you know whos probably behind this dont you said holly foaly rolled his eyes oh let me guess captain shorts archenemy master artemis fowl well who else could it be take your pick the people have been in contact with thousands of mud men over the years is that so retorted holly and how many that havent been mindwiped foaly pretended to think about it adjusting the foil hat jammed on his head to deflect any brainprobing signals that could be focused his way three he muttered eventually pardon three ok exactly fowl and his pet gorillas artemis is behind this mark my words youd just love that to be the case now wouldnt you youd finally have the chance to get your own back you do remember what happened the last time the lep went up against artemis fowl i remember but that was last time foaly smirked i would remind you that hell be thirteen now hollys hand dropped to her buzz baton i dont care how old he is one zap with this and hell be sleeping like a baby foaly nodded towards the entrance id save my charges if i were you youre going to need them holly followed his gaze commander julius root was sweeping across the secured zone the more he saw the redder his face grew hence the nickname beetroot commander began holly you need to see this roots gaze silenced her what were you thinking pardon me sir dont give me that i was in ops for the whole thing i was watching the video feed from your helmet oh oh hardly covers it captain roots buzzcut grey hair was quivering with emotion this was supposed to be a surveillance mission there were several backup squads sitting on their welltrained behinds only waiting for you to call but no captain short decides to take on the bwa kell on her own i had a man down sir there was no choice what was verbil doingout there anyway for the first time hollys gaze dropped i sent him out to do a thermal sir just following regulations root nodded ive talked to the paramedic warlock verbil will be ok but his flying days are over therell be a tribunal of course yes sir understood a formality im sure but you know the council holly knew the council all too well she would be the first lep officer in history to be the subject of two simultaneous investigations so whats this i hear about a class a all contraband was classed class a was code for dangerous human technology power sources for instance this way sir holly led them to the rear of the maintenance area to the shuttle bay itself where a restrictedaccess perspex dome had been erected she pressed through the frosted flaps you see this is serious root studied the evidence in the shuttles cargo bay were crates of aaa batteries holly selected a pack pencil batteries she said a common human power source crude inefficient and an environmental disaster twelve crates of them right here who knows how many are in the tunnels already root was unimpressed forgive me for not quaking in my boots so a few goblins get to play human video games so what foaly had spotted the goblins softnose laser oh no he said checking the weapon exactly agreed holly the commander did not appreciate being left out of the conversation oh no i hope youre being melodramatic no chief replied the centaur sombre for once this is deadly serious the bwa kell is using human batteries to power the old softnose lasers theyd only get about six shots per battery but you give every goblin a pocketful of power cells and thats a lot of shots softnose lasers they were outlawed decades ago werent they all recycled foaly nodded supposedly my division supervised the meltdowns not that we considered it priority they were originally powered by a single solar cell with a life of less than a decade obviously somebody managed to sneak a few out of the recycling lockup quite a few by the look of all these batteries thats the last thing i need goblins with softnoses the theory behind the softnose technique involved placing an inhibitor on the blaster which allowed the laser to travel at slower speeds so that it actually penetrated the target initially developed for mining purposes they were quickly adapted by some greedy weapons manufacturer the softnoses were just as quickly outlawed for the obvious reason that these weapons were designed to kill and not incapacitate now and then one found its way into the hands of a gang member but this did not look like smallscale blackmarket trading this looked like somebody was planning something big you know what the worrying thing about this is said foaly no said root with deceptive calmness do tell me what the worrying thing is foaly turned the gun around the way this weapon has been adapted to take a human battery very clever theres no way a goblin figured this out on his own but why adapt the softnoses asked the commander why not just use the old solar cells those solar cells are very rare theyre worth their weight in gold antique dealers use them to power all sorts of old gadgets and it would be impossible to build a powercell factory of any kind without my sensors picking up emissions much simpler just to steal them from the humans root lit one of his trademark fungal cigars tell me thats it tell me theres nothing else hollys gaze flickered to the rear of the hangar root caught the glance and pressed past the crates to the makeshift shuttle in the docking bay the commander climbed into the craft and what the hell is this foaly the centaur ran a hand along the ships hull its amazing unbelievable they put a shuttle together from junk im surprised this thing gets off the ground the commander bit down hard on his fungus cigar when youre finished admiring the goblins foaly maybe you can explain how the bwa kell got a hold of this stuff i thought all outdated shuttle technology was supposed to be destroyed thats what i thought i retired some of this stuff myself this starboard booster used to be in el until captain short blew it out last year i remember signing the destruct order root spared a second to shoot holly a withering glance so now we have shuttle parts escaping the recycling smelters as well as softnose lasers find out how this shuttle got heretake it apart piece by piece i want every strand of wire lasered for prints and dna feed all the serial numbers into the mainframe see if there are any common denominators foaly nodded good idea ill get someone on it no foaly you get on it this is priority so give your conspiracy theories a rest for a few days and find me the inside fairy whos selling this junk but julius protested foaly thats grunt work root took a step closer one dont call me julius civilian and two id say it was more like donkey work foaly noticed the vein pulsing in the commanders temple point taken he said removing a handheld computer from his belt ill get right on it you do that now captain short what is our bwa kell prisoner saying holly shrugged nothing much still unconscious hell be coughing soot for a month when he wakes up anyway you know how the bwa kell works the soldiers arent told anything this guy is just a grunt its a pity the book forbids using the mesmer on other fairies hmm said root his face glowing as red as a baboons behind an even greater pity the atlantis convention outlawed truth drugs otherwise we could pump this convict full of serum until he sang like a drunken mud man the commander took several deep breaths calming down before his heart popped right now we need to find out where these batteries came from and if there are any more in the lower elements holly took a breath i have a theory sir dont tell me groaned root artemis fowl right who else could it be i knew hed be back i knew it you know the rules holly he beat us last year game over thats what the book says yes sir but that was a different game new game new rules if fowl is supplying power cells to the bwa kell the least we can do is check it out root considered it if fowl was behind this things could get very complicated very fast i dont like the idea of interrogating fowl on his turf but we cant bring him down here the pressure below ground would kill him holly disagreed not if we keep him in a secure environment the city is equalized so are the shuttles ok go the commander said at last bring him in for a little chat bring the big one too butler yes butler root paused but remember were going to run a few scans holly thats it i dont want you using this as an opportunity to settle a score no sir strictly business do i have your word on that yes sir i guarantee it root ground the cigar butt beneath his heel i dont want anyone else getting hurt today not even artemis fowl understood well added the commander not unless its absolutely necessary chapter going underground st bartlebys school for young gentlemen butler had been in artemis fowls service since the moment of the boys birth he had spent the first night of his charges life standing guard on the sisters of mercy maternity ward for over a decade butler had been teacher mentor and protector to the young heir the pair had never been separated for more than a week until now it shouldnt bother him he knew that a bodyguard should never become emotionally attached to his package it affects his judgement but in his private moments butler couldnt help thinking of the fowl heir as the son or younger brother hed never had butler parked the bentley arnage red label on the college avenue if anything the eurasian manservant had bulked up since midterm with artemis in boarding school he was spending a lot more time in the gymtruth be told butler was bored pumping iron but the college authorities absolutely refused to allow him a bunk in artemiss room and when the gardener had discovered the bodyguards hideout just off the seventeenth green they had banned him from the college grounds altogether artemis slipped through the college gate doctor pos comments still in his thoughts problems sir said butler noticing his employers sour expression artemis ducked into the bentleys wineleather interior selecting a still water from the bar hardly butler just another quack spouting psychobabble butler kept his voice level should i have a word with him never mind him now what news of the fowl star we got an email at the manor this morning its an mpeg artemis scowled he could not access mpeg video files on his mobile phone butler pulled a portable computer from the glove compartment i thought you might be anxious to see the file so i downloaded it on to this he passed the computer over his shoulder artemis activated the compact machine folding out the flat colour screen at first he thought the battery was dead then realized he was looking at a field of snow white on white with only the faintest shadows to indicate dips and drumlins artemis felt the uneasiness rolling in his gut funny how such an innocent image could be so foreboding the camera panned upwards revealing a dull twilit sky then a black hunched object in the distance a rhythmic crunching issued through the compact speakers as the cameraman advanced through the snow the object grew clearer it was a man sitting on no tied to a chair the ice clinked in artemiss glass his hands were shaking the man was dressed in the rags of a once fine suit scars branded the prisoners face like lightning bolts and one leg appeared to be missing it was difficult to tell artemiss breath was jumpy now like a marathon runners there was a sign around the mans neck cardboard and twine on the sign was scrawled in thick black letters zdmvstvutye syn the camera zoomed in on the message for several seconds then went blank is that all butler nodded just the man and the sign thats it zdravstvuy syn muttered artemis his accent flawless since his fathers disappearance he had been teaching himself the language should i translate for you asked butler also a russian speaker he had picked it up during a fiveyear stint with an espionage unit in the late eighties his accent however was not quite so sophisticated as his young employers no i know what it means replied artemis zdravstvuy syn hello son butler pulled the bentley on to the dual carriageway neither of them spoke for several minutes eventually butler had to ask do you think its him artemis could that man be your father artemis rewound the mpeg freezing it on the mysterious mans face he touched the display sending rainbow distortions across the screen i think so butler but the picture quality is too poor i cant be certain butler understood the emotions battering his young charge he too had lost someone aboard the fowl star his uncle the major had been assigned to artemiss father on that fateful trip unfortunately the majors body had turned up in thetchersky morgue artemis regained his composure i must pursue this butler you know whats coming next of course yes a ransom demand this is merely the teaser to get my attention i need to cash in some of the peoples gold contact lars in zurich immediately butler accelerated into the fast lane master artemis i have had some experience in these matters artemis did not interrupt butlers career before his current charges birth had been varied to say the least the pattern with kidnappers is to eliminate all witnesses then they will generally try to eliminate each other to avoid splitting the ransom your point being my point being that paying a ransom in no way guarantees your fathers safety if indeed that man is your father it is quite possible that the kidnappers will take your money and then kill all of us artemis studied the screen youre right of course i will have to devise a plan butler swallowed he remembered the last plan it had almost got them both killed and could have plunged the planet into a crossspecies war butler was a man who didnt scare easily but the spark in artemis fowls eyes was enough to send a shiver crackling down his spine chute terminal ei tara ireland captain holly short had decided to work a double shift and proceed directly to the surface she paused only for a nutribar and energy shake before hopping on the first shuttle to the terminal at tara one of taras officials was not making her journey any easier the head of security was annoyed that captain short had not only put all chute traffic on hold to take a priority pod from el but had then proceeded to commandeer an entire shuttle for the return journey why dont you check your system again said holly through gritted teeth im sure the authorization from police plaza has arrived by now the truculent gnome consulted his handheld computer no maam i aint got nuthin look mister commandant terryl commandant terryl im on an important mission here national security i need you to keep the arrivals hall completely clear for the next couple of hours terryl made a great show of almost collapsing the next coupla hours are you crazy girly i got three shuttles comin in from atlantis whatm i sposed to tell em tours off cause of some lep secret shenanigans this is high season i cant just shut things down no way no how holly shrugged fine you just let all your tourists catch sight of the two humans im bringing down here therell be a riot i guarantee it two humans said the head of security inside the terminal are you nuts holly was running out of patience and time do you see this she demanded pointing to the insignia on her helmet im lep a captain no rentacop gnome is going to stand in the way of my orders terryl drew himself up to his full height which was about seventy centimetres yeah i heard a you the crazy girly captain caused quite a stir up here last year didnt you my tax ingots gonna be payin for that little screwup for quite some time just ask central you bureaucratic idiot call me what you want missy we have our rules here and without confirmation from below aint nuthin i can do to change em specially not fer some guntotin girly with an attitude problem well get on the blower to police plaza then terryl sniffed the magma flares have just started actin up its hard to get a line maybe ill try again after my rounds just you take yourself a seat in the departure lounge hollys hand strayed towards her buzz baton you know what youre doing dont you what croaked the gnome youre obstructing an lep operation i aint obstructin nuthin and as such it is in my power to remove said obstruction using any force that i deem necessary dont you threaten me missy holly drew the baton twirling it expertly im not threatening you im just informing you of police procedure if you continue to obstruct me i remove the obstruction in this case you and proceed to the next in command terryl was unconvinced you wouldnt dare holly grinned im the crazy girly captain remember the gnome considered it it was unlikely the officer would buzz him but then again who knew with female elves ok he said printing off a sheet on the computer this is a twentyfourhour visa but if youre not back here in that time ill have you taken into custody on your return then ill be the one making the threats holly snatched the sheet whatever now remember make sure arrivals is clear when i get back ireland en route from st bartlebys to fowl manor artemis was bouncing ideas off butler it was a technique he often used when trying to come up with a plan after all if anybody was an expert on covert operations it was his bodyguard we cant trace the mpeg no artemis i tried they put a decay virus in with the email i only just managed to get the film on disk before the original disintegrated what about the mpeg itself could we get a geographical fix from the stars butler smiled young master artemis was starting to think like a soldier no luck i sent a shot to a friend of mine in nasa he didnt even bother putting it into the computer not enough definition artemis was silent for a minute how fast can we get to russia butler drummed his fingers on the steering wheel it depends depends on what on how we go legal or illegal which is quicker butler laughed something you didnt hear very often illegal is usually faster either way is going to be pretty slow we cant go by air thats for sure the mafiya are going to have foot soldiers at every airstrip are we sure its the mafiya butler glanced in the rearview mirror im afraid so all kidnappings go through the mafiya even if an ordinary criminal managed to abduct your father he would have to hand him over once the mafiya had found out about it artemis nodded thats what i thought so we will have to travel by sea and that will take a week at the very least we could really use some help with transport something the mafiya wont expect hows our id situation no problem i thought wed go native well arouse less suspicion i have passports and visas da what is our cover what about stefan bashkir and his uncle constantin perfect the chess prodigy and his chaperone they had used this cover many times before on previous search missions once a checkpoint official himself a chess grandmaster had doubted their story until artemis beat him in six moves the technique had since become known as the bashkir manoeuvre how soon can we leave almost immediately missus fowl and juliet are in nice this week that gives us eight days we can mail the school make up some excuse i dare say st bartlebys will be glad to be rid of me for a while we could go straight to the airport from fowl manor the lear jet is stocked at least we can fly as far as scandinavia and we can try to pick up a boat from there i just have to pick up a few things at the manor first artemis could imagine exactly the kind of things his manservant wished to pick up sharp things and explosive things good the sooner the better weve got to find these people before they know were looking we can monitor email as we go butler took the exit for fowl manor you know artemis he said glancing in the mirror were going up against the russian mafiya ive had dealings with these people before they dont negotiate this could get bloody if we take these gangsters on people are going to get hurt most likely us artemis nodded absently watching his own reflection in the window he needed a plan something audacious and brilliant something that had never been attempted before artemis was not unduly worried on that front his brain had never let him down tara shuttle port the fairy shuttle port at tara was an impressive operation ten thousand cubic metres of terminal concealed beneath an overgrown hillock in the middle of the mcgraney farm for centuries the mcgraneys had respected the fairy forts boundaries and for centuries they had enjoyed exceptional good luck illnesses mysteriously cleared up overnight priceless art treasures unearthed themselves with incredible regularity and mad cow disease seemed to avoid their herds altogether having solved her visa problem holly finally made her way to the security door and slipped through the holographic camouflage she had managed to secure a set of koboi doubledex for the trip the rig ran on a satellitebounced solar battery and employed a revolutionary wing designthere were two sets or decks one fixed for gliding and a smaller set for manoeuvrability holly had been dying to try out the doubledex but only a few rigs had made their way across from koboi labs foaly was reluctant to let them out because he hadnt designed them professional envy holly had taken advantage of his absence from the lab to swipe a set from the rack she soared fifteen metres above the ground allowing unfiltered surface air to fill her lungs though laden with pollutants it was still sweeter than the recycled tunnel variety for several minutes she enjoyed the experience before turning her concentration to the mission at hand how to abduct artemis fowl not from his home fowl manor that was for certain legally she put herself on very shaky ground by entering a dwelling without permission even though technically fowl had invited her in by kidnapping her last year not many lawyers would take your case on the basis of that defence anyway the manor was a virtual fortress and had already seen off an entire lepretrieval team why should she fare any better there was also the complication that artemis could very welt be expecting her especially if he was trading with the bwa kellthe idea of walking into a trap did not appeal to holly she had already been imprisoned once in fowl manor doubtless her cell was still furnished holly activated the computer navigation package calling up fowl manor on her helmet visor a soft crimson light began to blip beside the d plan of the house the building had been redflagged by the lep holly groaned now she would be treated to a video warning just in case there was one recon officer under the world who had not heard of artemis fowl corporal lili fronds face appeared on the screen of course they chose lili for this assignment the bimbo face of the lep sexism was alive and well and living in police plaza it was rumoured that fronds lep scores had been bumped up because of her descendancy from the elfin king you have selected fowl manor said fronds image fluttering her eyelids this is a redflagged building unauthorized access is strictly forbidden do not even attempt a flyover artemis fowl is considered an active threat to the people a picture of fowl appeared beside frond a digitally enhanced scowl on his face his accomplice known only as butler is not to be approached under any circumstances he is generally armed and always dangerous butlers massive head appeared beside the two other images armed and dangerous hardly did him justice he was the only human in history to have taken on a troll and won holly sent the coordinates to the flight computer and let the wings do the steering for her the countryside sped by below even since her last visit the mud people infestation seemed to have taken a stronger hold there was barely an acre of land without dozens of their dwellings digging into its soil and barely a mile of river without one of their factories pouring its poison into the waters the sun finally dipped below the horizon and holly raised the filters on her visor time was on her side now she had the entire night to come up with a plan holly found that she missed foalys sarcastic comments in her ear annoying as the centaurs observations were they generally proved accurate and had saved her hide on more than one occasion she tried to establish a link but the flares were still high and there was no reception nothing but static fowl manor loomed in the distance completely dominating the surrounding landscape holly scanned the building with her thermal bar and found nothing but insect and small rodent life forms spiders and mice nobody home that suited her fine she landed on the head of a particularly gruesome stone gargoyle and settled in to wait fowl manor dublin ireland the original fowl castle had been built by lord hugh fowl in the fifteenth century overlooking lowlying country on all sides a tactic borrowed from the normans never let your enemies sneak up on you over the centuries the castle had been extensively remodelled until it became a manor but the attention to security remained the manor was surrounded by metrethick walls and wired with a stateoftheart security system butler pulled off the road opening the estate gates with a remote he glanced back at his employers pensive face sometimes he thought that in spite of all his contacts informants and employees artemis fowl was the loneliest boy hed ever met we could bring a couple of those fairy blasters he said butler had relieved lepretrieval one of their weaponry during the previous years siege artemis nodded good idea but remove the nuclear batteries and put the blasters in a bag with some old games and books we can pretend theyre toys if were captured yes sir good thinking the bentley red label crunched up the driveway activating the grounds security lights there were several lamps on in the main house these were on randomly alternating timers butler undid his seat belt stepping lithely from the bentley you need anything special artemis artemis nodded grab some caviar from the kitchen you wouldnt believe the muck they feed us in bartlebys for ten thousand a term butler smiled again a teenager asking for caviar hed never get used to it the smile withered on his lips halfway to the recently remodelled entrance a shiver passed across his heart he knew that feeling well his mother used to say that someone had just walked over his grave a sixth sense gut instinct there was peril somewhere invisible but here nevertheless holly spotted the headlights raking the sky from over a mile away optix were no good from this vantage point even when the automobiles windscreen came into view the glass was tinted and the shadows beyond were deep she felt her heart rate increase at the sight of fowls car the bentley wound along the avenue flickering between the rows of willow and horse chestnut holly ducked instinctively though she was completely shielded from human eyes you couldnt be certain with artemis fowls manservant last year artemis had cannibalized a fairy helmet constructing an eyepiece that allowed butler to spot and neutralize an entire crack squad of lepretrieval commandos it was hardly likely that he was wearing the lens at the moment but as trouble kelp and his boys had learned it didnt pay to underestimate artemis or his manservant holly set the neutrino to slightly above the recommended stun setting a couple of butlers brain cells might get fried but she wasnt about to lose any sleep over it the car swung into the driveway crunching across the gravel butler climbed out holly felt her back teeth grinding once upon a time she had saved his life healing him after a mortal encounter with a troll she wasnt sure if shed do it again holding her breath leprecon captain holly short set the doubledex to slow descent she dropped soundlessly skimming past the storeys and aimed her weapon at butlers chest now there was a target a sunblinded dwarf couldnt miss the human couldnt have detected her presence not possible yet something made him pause he stopped and sniffed the air the mud man was like a dog no not a dog a wolf a wolf with a big handgun holly focused her helmet lens on the weapon sending a photo to her computer database moments later a hires rotating d image of the gun appeared in the corner of her visor sig sauer said a recorded byte of foalys voice nine millimetre thirteen in the magazine big bullets one of these hits you and it could blow your head off something even the magic cant fix other than that you should be all right presuming you remembered to wear the regulation aboveground microfibre jumpsuit recently patented by me then again being a recon jock you probably didnt holly scowled foaly was all the more annoying when he was right she had jumped on the first available shuttle without even bothering to change into an aboveground suit hollys eyes were level with butlers now yet she was still hovering over a metre from the ground she released the visor seals wincing at the pneumatic hiss butler heard the escaping gas swinging the sig sauer towards the source fairy he said i know youre there unshield or i start shooting this was not exactly the tactical advantage holly had in mind her visor was up and the manservants finger was creaking on his pistols hair trigger she took a deep breath and shut down her shield hello butler she said evenly butler cocked the sig sauer hello captain come down slowly and dont try any of your put your gun away said holly her voice layered with the hypnotic mesmer butler fought it the gun barrel shaking erratically put it down butler dont make me fry your brain a vein pulsed in butlers eyelid unusual thought holly ive never seen that before dont fight me mud man give in to it butler opened his mouth to speak to warn artemis she pushed harder the magic cascading around the humans head i said put it down a bead of sweat ran down the bodyguards cheek put it down and butler did gradually and grudgingly holly smiled good mud man now back to the car and act as though nothings wrong the manservants legs obeyed ignoring the signals from his own brain holly buzzed up her shield she was going to enjoy this artemis was composing an email on his laptop dear principal guiney it read because of your counsellors tactless interrogation of my little arty i have taken him out of school for a course of therapy sessions with real professionals in the mont gaspard clinic in switzerland i am considering legal action do not attempt to contact me as that would only serve to irritate me further and when irritated i generally call my attorneys sincerely angeline fowl artemis sent the message allowing himself the luxury of a small grin it would have been nice to watch principal guineys expression when he read the electronic letter unfortunately the button camera hed planted in the headmasters office could only be accessed within a mile radius butler opened the drivers door and after a moment slipped into the seat artemis folded his phone into its wallet captain short i presume why dont you stop vibrating and settle into the visible spectrum holly speckled into view there was a gleaming gun in her hand guess where it was pointed really holly is that necessary holly snorted well lets see kidnapping actual bodily harm extortion conspiracy to commit murder id say its necessary please captain short said artemis with a smile i was young and selfish believe it or not i do harbour some doubts over that particular venture not enough doubts to return the gold no admitted artemis not quite how did you know i was here artemis steepled his fingers there were several clues one butler did not conduct his usual bomb check under the car two he returned without the items he went to fetch three the door was left open for several seconds something no good security man would permit and four i detected a slight haze as you entered the vehicle elementary really holly scowled observant little mud boy arent you i try now captain short if you would be so kind as to tell me why you are here as if you dont know artemis thought for a moment interesting i would guess that something has happened obviously something that i am being held responsible for he raised an eyebrow fractionally an intense expression of emotion for artemis fowl there are humans trading with the people very impressive said holly or it would be if we didnt both know that youre behind it and if we cant get the truth out of you im sure your computer files will prove most revealing artemis closed the laptops lid captain i realize there is no love lost between us but i dont have time for this now it is imperative that you give me a few days to sort out my affairs no can do fowl there are a few people below ground who would like a word artemis shrugged i suppose after what i did i cant really expect any consideration thats right you cant well then sighed artemis i dont suppose i have a choice holly smiled thats right fowl you dont shall we go artemiss tone was meek but his brain was sparking off ideas maybe cooperating with the fairies wasnt such a bad idea they had certain abilities after all why not holly turned to butler drive south stay on the back roads tara i presume i often wondered where exactly the entrance to el was keep wondering mud boy muttered holly now sleep all this deduction is wearing me out chapter fowl is fair artemis woke in the lep interrogation room he could have been in any police interview room in the world same uncomfortable furniture same old routine root jumped right in ok fowl start talking artemis took a moment to get his bearings holly and root were facing him across a low plastictopped table a highwatt bulb shone directly into his face really commander is this it i expected more oh theres more just not for criminals like you artemis noted that his hands were shackled to the chair youre not still upset about last year are you after all i won that is supposed to be that according to your own book root leaned forward until the tip of his cigar was centimetres from artemiss nose this is an entirely different case mud boy so dont give me the innocent act artemis was unperturbed which one are you good cop or bad cop root laughed heartily the tip of his cigar drawing patterns in the air good cop bad cop hate to tell you this dorothy but you aint in kansas any more the commander loved quoting the wizard of oz three of his cousins were in the movie a figure emerged from the shadows it had a tail four legs two arms and was holding what looked like a pair of common kitchen plungers ok mud boy said the figure just relax and this might not hurt too much foaly attached the suction cups to artemiss eyes and the boy immediately fell unconscious the sedative is in the rubber seals explained the centaur gets in through the pores they never see it coming tell me im not the cleverest individual in the universe oh i dont know said root innocently that pixie koboi is one pretty sharp female foaly stamped a hoof angrily koboi koboi those wings of hers are ridiculous if you ask me were using far too much koboi technology these days its not good to let one company have all the leps business unless its yours of course im serious julius i know opal koboi from my days at university shes not stable there are koboi chips in all the new neutrinos if those labs go under all wed have left are the dna cannons in police plaza and a few cases of electric stun guns root snorted koboi just upgraded every gun and vehicle in the force three times the power half the heat emission better than the last statistics from your lab foaly foaly threaded a set of fibreoptic cables back to the computer yes well maybe if the council would give me a decent budget quit your moaning foaly i saw the budget for this machine it better do more than unblock the drains foaly flicked his tail highly offended this is a retimager im considering going private with this baby and it does what exactly foaly activated a plasma screen on the holdingcell wall you see these dark circles these are the humans retinas every image leaves a tiny etching like a photo negative we can feed whatever pictures we want into the computer and search for matches root didnt exactly fall to his knees in awe isnt that handy well yes it is actually observe foaly called up an image of a goblin crossreferencing it with the retimagers database for every matching point we get a hit about two hundred hits is normal general shape of the head features and so on anything significantly above that and hes seen that goblin before one eightysix flashed up on the screen negative on the goblin lets try a softnose again the count was under two hundred another negative sorry captain but master fowl here is innocent hes never even seen a goblin much less traded with the bwa kell they could have mindwiped him foaly removed the seals from artemiss eyes thats the beauty of this baby mindwipes dont work the retimager operates on actual physical evidence youd have to scrub the retinas anything on the humans computer plenty replied foaly but nothing incriminating not a single mention of goblins or batteries root scratched his square jaw what about the big one he could have been the gobetween did him already with the retimager nothing face it the lep have pulled in the wrong mud men wipe em and send em home holly nodded the commander didnt wait a minute im thinking about what asked holly the sooner we get artemis fowls nose out of our business the better maybe not since theyre already here hollys jaw dropped commander you dont know fowl like i do give him half a chance and hell be a bigger problem than the goblins maybe he could help us with our mud man problem i have to object commanderthese humans are not to be trusted roots face would have glowed in the dark do you think i like this captain do you think i relish the idea of crawling to this mud boy i do not i would rather swallow live stink worms than ask artemis fowl for help but someone is powering the bwa kells arms and i need to find out who so get with the programme holly theres more at stake here than your little vendetta holly bit her tongue she couldnt oppose the commander not after all hed done for her but asking artemis fowl for help was the wrong course of action whatever the situation she didnt doubt for a minute that the human would have a solution to their problem but at what cost root drew a deep breath ok foaly bring him round and fit him with a translator speaking mud man gives me a headache artemis massaged the puffy skin beneath his eyes sedative in the seals he said glancing at foaly microneedles the centaur was impressed youre pretty sharp for a mud boy artemis touched the crescentshaped nodule fixed above his ear translator foaly nodded at the commander speaking in tongues gives some people a headache artemis straightened his school tie i see now how can i be of service what makes you think we need help from you human growled root around the butt of his cigar the boy smirked i have a feeling commander that if you did not need something from me i would be regaining consciousness in my own bed with absolutely no memory of our encounter foaly hid his grin behind a hairy hand youre lucky youre not waking up in a cell said holly still bitter captain short cant we wipe the slate clean hollys glare was all the answer he needed artemis sighed very well i shall guess there are humans trading with the lower elements and you need butler to track these merchants down close enough the fairies were silent for a moment hearing it from fowl suddenly brought the reality home to them close enough admitted root ok foaly bring mud boy up to speed the consultant loaded a file from the lep central server a series of network news clips flashed up on the plasma screen the reporter was a middleaged elf with a quiff the size of a honolulu roller downtown haven crooned the reporter another contraband seizure by the lep hollywood laser disks with an estimated street value of five hundred gold grams the bwa kell goblin triad is suspected it gets worse said root grimly artemis smiled theres worse the reporter appeared again this time flames billowed from the windows of a warehouse behind him his quiff looked a bit crispy tonight the bwa kell has staked its claim to the east bank by torching a warehouse used by koboi laboratories apparently the pixie with the golden touch refused to pay the triads protection fee the flames were replaced by another news bite this time featuring an angry mob controversy today outside police plaza as the public protest at the leps failure to deal with the goblin problem many ancient houses have been put out of business by the bwa kells racketeering most heavily targeted has been koboi laboratories which has suffered six counts of sabotage in the past month alone foaly froze the image the public did not look happy the thing you have to understand fowl is that goblins are dumb im not insulting them its scientifically proven brains no bigger than rats artemis nodded so whos organizing them root ground out his cigar we dont know but its getting worse the bwa kell has graduated from petty crime to an allout war on the police last night we intercepted a delivery of batteries from the surface these batteries are being used to power outlawed softnose laser weapons and captain short thought that i might be the mud man on the other end of the deal can you blame memuttered holly artemis ignored the comment how do you know the goblins arent just ripping off wholesalers after all batteries are rarely under guard foaly chuckled no i dont think you understand just how stupid goblins are let me give you an example one of the bwa kell generals and this is their top fairy was caught trying to pass off forged credit slips by signing his own name no whoever is behind this would need a human contact to make sure the deals werent fouled up so youd like me to find out who this human contact is said artemis and more importantly how much he knows as he spoke artemiss mind was racing he could work this entire situation to his advantage the peoples powers would be valuable aces to hold in a negotiation with mobsters the seeds of a plan began to sprout in his brain root nodded reluctantly thats it i cant risk putting leprecon agents above ground who knows what technology the goblins have traded i could be walking my men into a trap as humans you could both blend in butler blend in said artemis smiling i doubt it at least he doesnt have four legs and a tail observed foaly point taken and there is no doubt that if any man alive can track down your rogue trader its butler but here we go thought holly artemis fowl does nothing for nothing but prompted root but if you want my help i will require something in return what exactly said root warily i need transport to russia replied artemis the arctic circle to be precise and i need help with a rescue attempt root frowned northern russia is not good for us we cant shield there because of the radiation those are my conditions said artemis the man i intend to rescue is my father for all i know its already too late so i really dont have time to negotiate the mud boy sounded sincere even hollys heart softened for a moment but you never knew with artemis fowl this could all be part of yet another scheme root made an executive decision deal he said holding out his hand they shook fairy and human a historic moment good said root now foaly wake the big one and give that goblin shuttle a quick systems check what about me asked holly back on stakeout duty if root had not been a commander he probably would have cackled oh no captain youre the best shuttle pilot we have youre going to paris chapter daddys girl koboi laboratories east bank haven city the lower elements koboi laboratories was carved from the rock of havens east bank it stood eight storeys high surrounded by half a mile of granite on five sides with access from the front only management had beefed up their security and who could blame them after all the bwa kell had specifically targeted koboi for arson attacks the council had gone so far as to grant the company special weapons permits if koboi went under the entire haven city defence network went under with it any bwa kell goblins attempting to storm koboi laboratories would have been met with dnacoded stun cannons which scanned an intruder before blasting him there were no blind spots in the building no place to hide the system was foolproof but the goblins didnt have to worry about that the laboratories defences were actually designed to keep out any lep officers who might come snooping around at the wrong moment it was opal koboi herself who was funding the goblin triad the attacks on koboi were actually a smokescreen to divert suspicions away from her own personal dealings the tiny pixie was the mastermind behind the battery operation and the increased bwa kell activity well one of the masterminds but why would an individual of almost limitless wealth possibly wish to associate with a goblin tunnel gang since the day of her birth nothing much had ever been expected of opal koboi born to a family of oldmoney pixies on principality hill her parents would have been quite content had young opal done nothing more than attend private school complete some wishywashy arts degree and marry a suitable vicepresident in fact as far as her father ferall koboi was concerned a dream daughter would have been moderately intelligent quite pretty and of course complacent but opal did not display the personality traits ferall would have wished for by the age of ten months she was already walking unaided by a year and a half she had a vocabulary of over five hundred words before her second birthday she had dismantled her first hard drive opal grew to be precocious headstrong and beautiful a dangerous combination ferall lost count of the times he sat his daughter down advising her to leave business to the male pixies eventually opal refused to see him at all her blatant hostility was worrying ferall was right to be worried opals first action in college was to ditch her history of art degree in favour of the maledominated brotherhood of engineers masters no sooner was the scroll in her hand than opal set up shop in direct opposition to her father patents quickly followed an engine muffler that doubled as an energy streamliner a d entertainment system and of course her speciality the doubledex wing series once opal had destroyed her fathers business she proceeded to buy shares in it at rockbottom prices and then incorporated her businesses under the banner of koboi laboratories within five years koboi laboratories held more defence contracts than any other company within ten years opal koboi had personally registered more patents than any fairy alive except the centaur foaly but it wasnt enough opal koboi yearned for the kind of power that hadnt been held by any single fairy since the days of the monarchy luckily she knew someone who might be able to assist her with that particular ambition a disillusioned officer in the lep and a classmate from her college days a certain briar cudgeon briar had good reason to despise the lep after all they had allowed his public humiliation at the hands of julius root to go unpunished not only that but he had been stripped of his commanders acorns after his disastrous involvement in the artemis fowl affair it had been a simple matter for opal to slip a truth pill into cudgeons drink in one of havens swankier eateries to her glee she found that the delightfully twisted cudgeon was already formulating a plan to topple the lep quite an ingenious plan as it happened all he needed was a partner one with large reserves of gold and a secure facility at her disposal opal was happy to supply both opal was curled catlike in her hoverchair eavesdropping on the goingson in police plaza when cudgeon entered the facility she had installed mole cameras in the lep network when her engineers were upgrading their system the units operated on precisely the same frequency as police plazas own surveillance cameras plus they drew power from the heat leaking from the leps fibre optics completely undetectable well demanded cudgeon with customary bluntness koboi didnt bother to turn around it had to be briar only he had the necessary access chip to the inner sanctum implanted in his knuckle we lost the last shipment of power cells a routine lep stakeout bad luck darvit swore cudgeon still no matter we have enough stored and to the lep they are simply batteries after all opal took a breath the goblins were armed dont tell me with softnoses cudgeon pounded a worktop those idiots i warned them not to use those weapons now julius will know something is afoot he may know said opal placatingly but he is powerless to stop us by the time they figure it out it will already be too late cudgeon did not smile he hadnt in over a year instead his scowl grew more pronounced good my time is at hand perhaps we should have simply manufactured the batteries ourselves he mused no just to build a factory would have set us back two years and theres no guarantee that foaly wouldnt have discovered it we had no choice koboi swivelled to face her partner you look terrible have you been using that ointment i gave you cudgeon rubbed his head tenderly it was bubbled with horrific lumps it doesnt work theres cortisone in it im allergic cudgeons condition was unusual perhaps unique the previous year he had been sedated by commander root during the fowl manor siege unfortunately the tranquillizer had reacted badly with some banned mindaccelerating substances the former actingcommander had been experimenting with cudgeon was left with a forehead like melted tar plus a droopy eye ugly and demoted not a great combination you should get those boils lanced i can barely stand the sight of you sometimes opal koboi forgot who she was talking to briar cudgeon was not the usual corporate lackey he calmly drew a customized redboy blaster firing two bursts into the hoverchairs armthe contraption whirled across the stippled rubber tiles coming to rest leaving opal sprawled across a bank of hard drives the disgraced lep elf caught opal by the pointed chin you better get used to looking at me my dear opal because soon this face will be on every view screen under this planet and on top of it the tiny pixie curled her fingers into a fist she was unaccustomed to insubordination not to mention actual violence but at moments like this she could see the madness in cudgeons eyes the drugs had cost him more than his magic and looks they had cost him his mind and suddenly he was himself again graciously helping her up as though nothing had happened now my dear progress report the bwa kell is eager for blood opal smoothed the front of her catsuit captain short is escorting the human artemis fowl to e fowl is here exclaimed cudgeon of course i should have guessed that he would be suspected this is perfect our human slave will take care of him carrere has been mesmerized i still have that power koboi applied a layer of bloodred lipstick there could be trouble if carrere is captured dont worry cudgeon assured her monsieur carrere has been mesmerized so many times that his mind is blanker than a wiped disk he couldnt tell any tales even if he wanted to then once he has done our dirty work for us the french police will lock him up in a nice padded cell opal giggled for someone who never smiled cudgeon had a delicious sense of humour chapter photo opportunity chute e haven city the lower elements the unlikely allies took the goblin shuttle up e holly was none too pleased first of all she was being ordered to work with publicenemy number one artemis fowl and secondly the goblin shuttle was held together by spit and prayers holly hooked a corn rig over one pointy ear hey foaly you there right here captain remind me again why im flying this old slammer leprecon pilots referred to suspect shuttles as slammers because of their alarming tendency to slam into the chute walls the reason youre flying that old slammer captain is that the goblins built this shuttle inside the port and all three of the original access ramps were removed years ago it would take days to get a new rig in there so im afraid were stuck with the goblin ship holly strapped herself into the pilots wraparound seat the thruster toggles almost seemed to jump into her hands for a split second captain shorts natural good humour returned she was an ace pilot top of her class in the academy on her final assessment wing commander vinyaya had written that cadet short could fly a shuttle pod through the gap in your teeth it was a compliment with a sting in the tail on her first tryout in a pod holly had lost control crashlanding the craft two metres from vinyayas nose so for five seconds holly was happy then she remembered who her passengers were i wonder could you tell me said artemis settling into the copilots chair how close the russian terminal is to murmansk civilians behind the yellow line growled holly ignoring the enquiry artemis pressed on this is important to me i am trying to plan a rescue holly grinned tightly theres so much irony here i could write a poem the kidnapper looking for help with a kidnapping artemis rubbed his temples holly i am a criminal its what i do best when i abducted you i was thinking only of the ransom you were never supposed to be in any danger oh really said holly apart from biobombs and trolls true admitted artemis sometimes plans dont translate smoothly from paper to real life he paused cleaning some nonexistent dirt from his manicured nails i have matured captain this is my father i need all the information i can gather before facing the mafiya holly relented it wasnt easy growing up without a father she knew her own father had passed away when she was barely sixty more than twenty years ago now ok mud boy listen up im only saying this once artemis sat up butler stooped as he entered the cockpit he could smell a war story over the past two centuries with the advances in human technology the lep have been forced to shut down over sixty terminals we pulled out of northern russia in the sixties the entire kola peninsula is a nuclear disaster the people have no tolerance to radiation we never built up a resistance in truth there wasnt much to close down just a grade three terminal and a couple of cloaking projectors the people arent very fond of the arctic a bit frosty everybody was glad to be leaving so to answer your question theres one unmanned terminal with little or no aboveground facilities located about twenty klicks north of murmansk foalys voice blurted from the intercom interrupting what was dangerously close to a civil conversation ok captain youve got a clear run to the subway theres still a bit of waffle from the last flare so go easy holly pulled down her mouth mike roger that foaly have the rad suits ready when i get back were on a tight schedule foaly chuckled take it easy on the thrusters holly technically this is artemiss first time in the chutes seeing as he and butler were mesmerized on the way down we wouldnt want him getting a fright holly gunned the throttle quite a bit more than was absolutely necessary no she growled we wouldnt want him getting a fright artemis decided to strap on his restraining harness a good idea as it turned out captain short gunned the makeshift shuttle down the magnetized approach rail the fins shook sending twin waves of sparks cascading past the portholes holly adjusted the internal gyroscopes otherwise thered be mud people vomiting all over the cockpit hollys thumbs hovered over the turbo buttons ok well lets see what this bucket can do dont go trying for any records holly said foaly over the speakers that ship is not built for speed ive seen more aerodynamic dwarfs holly grunted after all what was the point in flying slowly none whatsoever and if you happened to terrify a few mud men along the way well that was just an added bonus the service tunnel opened on to the main chute artemis gasped it was an aweinspiring sight you could drop mount everest down this chute and it wouldnt even hit the sides a deep red glow pulsed from the earths core like the fires of hell and the constant crack of contracting rock smacked the hull like physical blows holly fired up all four flight engines tumbling the shuttle into the abyss her worries evaporated like the eddies of mist swirling around the cockpit it was a flyboy thing the lower you went without pulling out of the dive the tougher you were even the fiery demise of retrieval officer bom arbles couldnt stop the lep pilots core diving holly held the current record five hundred metres from the earths core before dipping the flaps that had cost her two weeks suspension plus a hefty fine not today though no records in a slammer with the gforce rippling the skin on her cheeks holly dragged the joysticks back pulling the nose out of vertical it gave her no small satisfaction to hear both humans sigh with relief ok foaly were on the up n up whats the situation above ground she could hear foaly tapping a keyboard sorry holly i cant get a lock on any of our surface equipment too much radiation from the last flare youre on your own holly eyed the two pale humans in the cockpit on my own she thought i wish paris france so if artemis wasnt the human helping cudgeon in his quest to arm the bwa kell who was some tyrannical dictator perhaps a disgruntled general with access to an unlimited supply of power cells well no not exactly luc carrere was responsible for selling batteries to the bwa kell not that youd know it to look at him in fact he didnt even know it himself luc was a smalltime french private eye who was well known for his inefficiency in pi circles it was said that luc couldnt trace a golf ball in a barrel of mozzarella cudgeon decided to use luc for three reasons one foalys files showed that carrere had a reputation as a wheelerdealer in spite of his ineptness as an investigator luc had a knack for laying his hand on whatever it was the client wanted to buy two the man was greedy and had never been able to resist the lure of easy money and three luc was stupid and as every little fairy knows weak minds are easier to mesmerize the fact that he had located carrere in foalys database was nearly enough to make cudgeon smile of course briar would have preferred not to have any human link in the chain but a chain comprised completely of goblin links is one dumb chain establishing contact with any mud man was not something cudgeon took lightly deranged as he was briar was well aware of what would happen if the humans got wind of a new market below ground they would swarm to the earths core like an army of redbacked flesheating ants cudgeon was not ready to meet the humans head on not yet not until he had the might of the lep behind him so instead cudgeon sent luc carrere a little package first class shielded goblin mail luc carrere had shuffled into his office apartment one july evening to find a small parcel lying on his desk the package was nothing more than a fedex delivery or something that looked very much like a fedex delivery luc slit the tape inside the box cushioned on a nest of hundredeuro bills was a small flat device of some kind like a portable cd player but made from a strange black metal that seemed to absorb light luc would have shouted to reception and instructed his secretary to hold all calls if he had had a reception if he had had a secretary instead the pi began stuffing cash down his greasestained shirt as though the notes would disappear suddenly the device popped open clamlike revealing a microscreen and speakers a shadowy face appeared on the display though luc could see nothing but a pair of redrimmed eyes that was enough to set goose bumps popping across his back funny though because when the face began to speak lucs worries slid away like an old snakeskin how could he have been worriedthis person was obviously a friend what a lovely voice like a choir of angels all on its own luc carrere luc nearly cried poetry oui its me bonsoir do you see the money luc its all yours sixty miles below ground cudgeon almost smiled this was easier than expected he had been worried that the dribble of power left in his brain wouldnt be sufficient to mesmerize the human but this particular mud man seemed to have the willpower of a hungry hog faced with a trough of turnips luc held two wads of cash in his fists this money its mine what do i have to do nothing the money is yours do whatever you want now luc carrere knew that there was no such thing as free cash but that voice that voice was truth in a microspeaker but theres more a lot more luc stopped what he was doing which was kissing a hundredeuro bill more how much more the eyes seemed to glow crimson as much as you want lac but to get it i need you to do me a favour luc was hooked sure what kind of favour the voice emanating from the speaker was as clear as spring water its simple not even illegal i need batteries luc thousands of batteries maybe millions do you thinkyou can get them jor me luc thought about it for about two seconds the banknotes were tickling his chin as a matter of fact he had a contact on the river who regularly shipped boatloads of hardware to the middle east including batteries luc was confident that some of those shipments could be diverted batteries oui certainment i could do that and so it went on for several months luc carrere hit his contact for every battery he could lay his hands on it was a sweet deal luc would crate the cells up in his apartment and in the morning they would be gone in their place would sit a fresh pile of bills of course the euros were fake run off on an old koboi printer but luc couldnt tell the difference nobody outside the treasury could occasionally the voice on the screen would make a special request some fire suits for example but hey luc was a player now nothing was more than a phone call away in six months luc carrere went from a oneroom studio to a fancy loft apartment in st germain so naturally the surete and interpol were building separate cases against him but luc wasnt to know that all he knew was that for the first time in his corrupt life he was riding the gravy train one morning there was another parcel on his new marbletopped desk bigger this time bulkier but luc wasnt worried it was probably more money luc popped the top to reveal an aluminium case and a second communicator the eyes were waiting for him bonjour luc fa ra bien replied luc mesmerized from the first syllable i have a special assignment for you today do this right and you will never have to worry about money again your tool is in the case what is it asked the pi nervously the instrument looked like a weapon and even though luc was mesmerized cudgeon did not have enough magic to completely suppress the parisians nature the pi may have been devious but he was no killer its a special camera luc thats all if you pull that thing that looks like a trigger it takes a picture said cudgeon oh said luc carrere blearily some friends of mine are coming to visit you and i want you to take their picture its just a game we play how will i know your friends asked luc a lot of people visit me they will ask about the batteries if they ask about the batteries then you take their picture sure great and it was great because the voice would never make him do anything wrong the voice was his friend e shuttle port holly steered the slammer through the chutes final section a proximity sensor in the shuttles nose set off the landing lights hmm muttered holly artemis squinted through the quartz windscreen a problem no its just that those lights shouldnt be working there hasnt been a power source in the terminal since the last century our goblin friends i presume holly frowned doubtful it takes half a dozen goblins to turn on a glow cube wiring a shuttle port takes real knowhow elfin knowhow the plot thickens said artemis if hed had a beard he would have stroked it i smell a traitor now who would have access to all this technology and a motive for selling it holly pointed the shuttles cone towards the landing nodes well find out soon enough you just get me a live trader and my mesmer will soon have him spilling his guts the shuttle docked with a pneumatic hiss as the bays rubber collar formed an airtight seal around the outer hull butler was out of his chair before the seatbelt light winked off ready for action just dont kill anyone warned holly thats not how the lep likes to operate anyway dead mud men dont rat on their partners she brought up a schematic on the wallscreen it depicted par iss old city ok she said pointing to a bridge across the seine were here under this bridge sixty metres from notredame the cathedral not the football team the dock is disguised as a bridge support stand in the doorway until i give you a green light we have to be careful here the last thing we need is some parisian seeing you emerging from a brick wall youre not accompanying us asked artemis orders said holly scowling apparently this could be a trap who knows what hardware is pointed at the terminal door lucky for you youre expendable irish tourists on holiday youll fit right in lucky us what leads do we have holly slid a disk into the console foaly stuck his retimager on the goblin prisoner apparently he has seen this human the captain brought up a mugshot on the screen foaly got a match on his interpol files luc carrere disbarred attorney does a bit of pi work she printed off a card heres his address he just moved to a swanky new apartment it could be nothing but at least we have somewhere to start i need you to immobilize him and show him this holly handed the bodyguard what looked like a divers watch what is it asked the manservant just a com screen you put it in front of carreres face and i can mesmerize the truth out of him from down here it also contains one of foalys doodahs a personal shield the safetynet a prototype youll be delighted to know you have the honour of testing it touch the screen and the microreactor generates a twometre diameter sphere of triphased light no good for solids but laser bursts or concussion shocks are ok hmm said butler doubtfully we dont get a lot of laser bursts above ground hey dont use it do i care butler studied the tiny instrument onemetre radius what about the bits that are sticking out holly thumped the manservant playfully in the stomach my advice to you big man is curl up in a ball ill try to remember that said butler cinching the strap around his wrist you two try not to kill each other while im gone artemis was surprised it didnt happen very often while youre gone surely you dont expect me to stay behind butler tapped his forehead dont worry youll see everything on the iriscam artemis fumed for several moments before settling back down into the copilots seat i know i would only slow you down and that in turn would slow down the search for my father of course if you insist no this is no time for childishness butler smiled gently childishness was one thing master artemis was hardly likely to be accused of how long do i have holly shrugged as long as it takes obviously the sooner the better for everybodys sake she glanced at artemis especially his fathers in spite of everything butler felt good this was life at its most basic the hunt not exactly stone age not with a large semiautomatic weapon under his arm but the principle was the same the survival of the fittest and there was no doubt in butlers mind that he was the fittest he followed hollys directions to a service ladder scaling it quickly to the doorway above he waited beside the metal door until the light above changed from red to green and the camouflaged entrance slid noiselessly back the bodyguard emerged cautiously while it was likely that the bridge was deserted he could hardly explain himself away as a homeless person dressed as he was in a dark designer suit butler felt a breeze play across the shaven dome of his crown the morning air felt good even after a few hours below ground he could easily imagine how fairies must feel forced out of their native environment by humans from what butler had seen if the people ever decided to reclaim what was theirs the battle wouldnt last long but luckily for mankind fairies were a peaceloving people and not prepared to go to war over real estate the coast was clear butler stepped casually on to the riverside walkway proceeding west towards the st germain district a riverboat swept past on his right ferrying a hundred tourists around the city butler automatically covered his face with a massive hand just in case some of those tourists had cameras pointed in his direction the bodyguard mounted a set of stone steps to the road above behind him the pointed spire of notredame rose into the sky and to his left the eiffel towers famous profile punctured the clouds butler strode confidently across the main road nodding at several french ladies who stopped to stare he was familiar with this area of paris having spent a month recuperating here after a particularly dangerous assignment for the french secret service butler strolled along rue jacob even at this hour cars and lorries jammed the narrow street drivers leaned on their horns hanging from car windows gallic tempers running wild mopeds dodged between bumpers and several pretty girls strolled past butler smiled paris he had forgotten carreres apartment was on rue bonaparte opposite the church apartments in st germain cost more per month than most parisians made in a year butler ordered a coffee and croissant at the bonaparte cafe settling himself at an outside table according to his calculations it gave him the perfect view of monsieur carreres balcony butler didnt have long to wait in less than an hour the chunky parisian appeared on the balcony leaning on the ornate railing for several minutes he very obligingly presented front and side views of himself hollys voice sounded in butlers ear thats our boy is he alone i cant tell muttered the bodyguard into his handthe fleshtone mike glued to his throat would pick up any vibrations and translate them for holly just a sec butler heard a keyboard being tapped and suddenly the iriscam in his eye sparked the vision in one eye jumped into a completely different spectrum heatsensitive holly informed him hot equals red cold equals blue not a very powerful system but the lens should penetrate an outer wall butler cast a fresh eye over the apartment there were three red objects in the room one was carreres heart which pulsed crimson in the centre of his pink body the second appeared to be a kettle or possibly a coffee pot and the third was a tv ok all clear im going in affirmative watch your step this is a bit too convenient agreed butler crossed the cobbled street to the fourstorey apartment building there was an intercom security system but this structure was nineteenth century and a solid shoulder at the right point popped the bolt right out of its housing im in there was noise on the stairs above someone coming this way butler wasnt unduly concerned nevertheless he slid a palm inside his jacket fingers resting on his handguns grip it was unlikely he would need it even the most boisterous young bucks generally gave butler a wide berth something to do with his merciless eyes being over two metres tall didnt hurt either a group of teenagers rounded the corner excusezmoi said butler gallantly stepping aside the girls giggled the boys glared one a monoeyebrowed rugby type even thought about passing comment then butler winked at him it was a peculiar wink somehow simultaneously cheerful and terrifying no comments were passed butler ascended to the fourth floor without incident carreres apartment was on the gable end two walls of windows very expensive the bodyguard was considering his breaking and entering options when he noticed the door was open open doors generally meant one of two things one nobody was left alive to close it or two he was expected neither of these options appealed to him particularly butler entered cautiously the apartment walls were lined with open crates battery packs and fire suits poked through the styrofoam packing the floor was littered with thick wads of currency are you a friend it was carrere he was slumped in an oversized armchair a weapon of some kind nestling in his lap butler approached slowly an important rule of combat is that every opponent is taken seriously take it easy the parisian raised the weapon the grip was made for smaller fingers a child or a fairy i asked if you were a friend butler cocked his own pistol no need to shoot stand still ordered carrere im not going to shoot you just take your photo maybe the voice told me hollys voice sounded in butlers earpiece get closer i need to see the eyes butler bolstered his weapon taking a step forward you see no one has to get hurt here im going to enhance the image said holly this may sting a bit the tiny camera in his eye buzzed and suddenly butlers vision was magnified by four which would have been just fine had the magnification not been accompanied by a sharp jolt of pain butler blinked back a stream of tears from his eye below in the goblin shuttle holly studied lucs pupils hes been mesmerized she pronounced several times you see how the iris has actually become jagged you mesmerize a human too much and they can go blind artemis studied the image is it safe to mesmerize him again holly shrugged doesnt matter hes already under a spell this particular individual is just following orders his brain doesnt know a thing about it artemis grabbed the mike stand butler get out of there right now in the apartment butler stood his ground any sudden movement might be his last butler said holly listen carefully that gun pointed at you is a widebore lowfrequency blaster we call it a bouncer it was developed for tunnel skirmishes if he pulls that trigger a wide arc laser is going to ricochet off the walls until it hits something i see muttered butler what did you say asked carrere nothing i just dont like having my photo taken a spark of lucs greedy personality surfaced i like that watch on your wrist it looks expensive is it a rolex you dont want this said butler very reluctant to part with the com screen its cheap a piece of trash just give me the watch butler peeled back the strap of the instrument on his wrist if i give you this watch maybe you can tell me about all these batteries it is you say cheese squealed carrere forcing his pudgy thumb into the undersized trigger guard and pumping for all he was worth for butler time seemed to slow to a crawl it was almost as though he were inside his personal timestop his soldiers brain absorbed all the facts and analysed his options carreres finger was too far gone in a moment a widebore laser burst would be speeding his way and would continue to bounce around the room until they were both dead his gun was of no use in a situation like this all he had was the safetynet but a twometre sphere was not going to be enough not for two goodsized humans so in the fraction of a second left to him butler formulated a new strategy if the sphere could stop concussive waves coming towards him perhaps it could stop them coming out of the blaster butler touched the screen of the safetynet and hurled the device in carreres direction not a nanosecond too soon a spherical shield blossomed enveloping the expanding beam from carreres blaster degrees of protection it was a sight to see a fireworks display in a bubble the shield hovered in the air shafts of light ricocheting against the spheres curved planes carrere was hypnotized by the sight and butler took advantage of the distraction to disarm him start the engines grunted the bodyguard into his throat mike the surete are going to be all over this place in minutes foalys safetynet didnt stop the noise roger that what about monsieur carrere butler dumped the dazed parisian flat on the carpet luc and i are going to have a little chat for the first time carrere seemed to be aware of his surroundings who are you he mumbled whats happening butler ripped open the mans shirt placing his palm flat on the pis heart time for a little trick hed learned from madame ko his japanese sensei dont worry monsieur carrere im a doctortheres been an accident but youre perfectly fine an accident i dont remember any accident trauma its quite normal im just going to check your vitals butler placed a thumb on lucs neck locating the artery im going to ask you a few questions to check for concussion luc didnt argue then again whod argue with a twometreplus eurasian with muscles like a michelangelo statue is your name luc carrere yes butler noted the pulse rate one from the heartbeat and a second reference on the carotid artery steady in spite of the accident are you a private eye i prefer the title investigator no increase in pulse rate the man was telling the truth have you ever sold batteries to a mystery buyer no i have not protested luc what kind of doctor are you the mans pulse skyrocketed he was lying answer the questions monsieur carrere said butler sternly just one more have you ever had dealings with goblins relief flooded through luc the police did not ask questions about fairies what are you crazy goblins i dont know what youre talking about butler closed his eyes concentrating on the pounding beneath his thumb and palm lucs pulse had settled he was telling the truth he had never had any direct dealings with the goblins obviously the bwa kell wasnt that stupid butler stood up pocketing the bouncer he could hear the sirens on the street below hey doctor protested luc you cant just leave me like this butler eyed him coldly i would take you with me but the police will want to know why your apartment is full of what i suspect are counterfeit bills luc could only watch with his mouth open as the giant figure disappeared into the corridor he knew he should run but luc carrere hadnt run more than fifty metres since gym class in the nineteen seventies and anyway his legs had suddenly turned to jelly the thought of a long stretch in prison can do that to a person chapter joining the dots police plaza root pointed the finger of authority at holly congratulations captain you managed to lose some lep technology holly was ready for that one not strictly my fault sir the human was mesmerized and you ordered me not to leave the shuttle i had no control over the situation ten out of ten commented foaly good answer anyway the safetynet has a selfdestruct like everything i send into the field quiet civilian snapped the commander but there was no venom in the lep officers rebuke he was relieved they all were the human threat had been contained and without the loss of a single life they were gathered in a conference room reserved for civilian committees generally debriefings of this importance would be held in the operations centre but the lep was not ready to show artemis fowl the nerve centre of its defences just yet root jabbed an intercom button on the desk trouble are you out there yessir ok now listen i want you to stand down the alert send the teams into the deep tunnels see if we cant root out a few goblin gangs there are still plenty of loose ends whos organizing the bwa kell for one and for what reason artemis knew he shouldnt say anything the sooner his side of the bargain was completed the sooner he could be in the arctic but the entire paris scenario seemed suspicious does anyone else think this is too neat its just what you all wanted to happen not to mention the fact that there could be more mesmerized humans up there root did not appreciate being lectured by a mud boy especially this particular mud boy look fowl youve done what we asked the paris connection has been broken off there wont be any more illegal shipments coming down that chute i assure you in fact we have doubled security on all chutes whether theyre operational or not the important thing is that whoever is trading with the humans hasnt told them about the people there will of course be a major investigation but thats an internal problem so dont you worry your juvenile head about it concentrate on growing some bristles foaly interrupted before artemis could respond about russia he said hurriedly placing his torso between artemis and the commander ive got a lead you traced the email said artemis his attention switching immediately to the centaur exactly confirmed foaly launching into lecture mode but its been spiked untraceable foaly chuckled openly spiked dont make me laugh you mud men and your communications systems youre still using wires for heavens sake if its been sent i can trace it so where did you trace it to every computer has a signature as individual as a fingerprint continued foaly networks too they leave microtraces depending on the age of the wiring everything is molecular and if you pack gigabytes of data into a little cable some of that cable is going to wear off butler was growing impatient listen foalytime is of the essence mister fowls life could hang in the balance so get to the point before i start breaking things the centaurs first impulse was to laugh surely the human was joking then he remembered what butler had done to trouble kelps retrieval squad and decided to proceed directly to the point very well mud man keep your hair on well almost directly to the point i put the mpeg through my filters uranium residue points to northern russia now theres a shock im not finished said foaly watch and learn the centaur brought up a satellite photo of the arctic circle on the wallscreen with every keystroke the highlighted area shrank uranium means severomorsk or somewhere within fifty miles the copper wiring is from an old network early twentieth century patched up over the years the only match is murmansk as easy as joining the dots artemis sat forward in his chair there are two hundred and eightyfour thousand landlines on that network foaly had to stop for a laugh landlines barbarians butler cracked his knuckles loudly ah so two hundred and eightyfour thousand landlines i wrote a program to search for hits on our mpeg two possible matches one the hall of justice not likely the other the other line is registered to a mikhael vassikin on lenin prospekt artemis felt his stomach churn and what do we know about mikhael vassikin foaly wiggled his fingers like a concert pianist i ran a search on my own intelligence files archives i like to keep tabs on mud peoples socalled intelligence agencies quite a few mentions of you by the way butler the manservant tried to look innocent but his facial muscles couldnt quite pull it off mikhael vassikin is exkgb now working for the mafiya the official term is khuligany an enforcer not high level but not street trash either vassikins boss is a murmansker known as britvathe groups main source of income is the kidnapping of european businessmen in the past five years they have abducted six germans and a swede how many were recovered alive asked artemis his voice a whisper foaly consulted his statistics none he said and in two cases the negotiators went missing eight million dollars in lost ransom butler struggled from a tiny fairy chair right enough talk i think its time mister vassikin was introduced to my friend mister fist melodramatic thought artemis but i couldnt have put it better myself yes old friend soon enough but i have no wish to add you to the list of lost negotiators these men are smart so we must be smarter we have advantages that none of our predecessors had we know who the kidnapper is we know where he lives and most importantly we have fairy magic artemis glanced at commander root we do have fairy magic dont we you have this fairy at any rate replied the commander i wont force any of my people to go to russia but i could use some backup he glanced at holly what do you think of course im coming said holly im the best shuttle pilot you have koboi laboratories there was a firing range in the koboi labs basement opal had it constructed to her exact specifications it incorporated her d projection system was completely soundproof and was mounted on gyroscopes you could drop an elephant from twenty metres in there and no seismograph under the world would detect so much as a shudder the purpose of the firing range was to give the bwa kell somewhere to practise with their softnose lasers before the operation began in earnest but it was briar cudgeon who had logged more hours on the simulators than anyone else he seemed to spend every spare minute fighting virtual battles with his nemesis commander julius root when opal found him he was pumping shells from his prized softnose redboy into a d holoscreen running one of roots old training films it was pathetic really a fact she didnt bother mentioning cudgeon twisted out his earplugs so who died opal handed him a video pad this just came in on the spy cameras carrere proved as inept as usual everyone survived but as you predicted root has called off the alert and now the commander has agreed to personally escort the humans to northern russia inside the arctic circle i know where northern russia is cudgeon snapped he paused stroking his bubbled forehead thoughtfully for several moments this could turn out to our advantage now we have the perfect opportunity to eliminate the commander with julius out of the way the lep will be like a headless stink worm especially with their surface communications down their communications are down i take it of course replied opal the jammer is linked into the chute sensors all interference with surface transmitters will be blamed on the magma flares perfect said cudgeon his mouth twitching in what could almost be described as glee i want you to disable all lep weaponry now no need to give julius any advantages when koboi laboratories had upgraded lep weapons and transport a tiny dot of solder had been included in each device the solder was actually a mercuryglycerine solution that would detonate when a signal of the appropriate frequency was broadcast from the koboi communications dish lep blasters would be useless while the bwa kell would be armed to the teeth with softnose lasers consider it done said opal are you certain root wont be returning he could upset our entire plan cudgeon polished the redboy on the leg of his uniform dont fret my dear julius wont be coming back now that i know where hes going ill arrange for a little welcome party im certain our scaly friends will be only too eager to oblige the funny thing was that briar cudgeon didnt even like goblins in fact he detested them they made his skin crawl with their reptilian ways their gasburner breath their lidless eyes and their constantly darting forked tongues but they did supply a certain something that cudgeon needed dumb muscle for centuries the bwa kell triad had skulked around havens borders vandalizing what they couldnt steal and fleecing any tourists stupid enough to stray off the beaten path but they were never really any threat to society whenever they got too cheeky commander root would send a team into the tunnels to flush out the culprits one evening a disguised briar cudgeon strolled into the second skin a notorious bwa kell hangout plonked an attache case of gold ingots on the bar and said i want to talk to the triad cudgeon was searched and blindfolded by several of the clubs bouncers when the tape came off his face he was in a damp warehouse walls lined with creeping moss three elderly goblins were seated across the table from him he recognized them from their mugshots scalene sputa and phlebumthe triad old guard the gift of gold and the promise of more were enough to pique their curiosity his first utterance was carefully planned ah generals i am honoured you greet me in person the goblins puffed out their wrinkled old chests proudly generals the rest of cudgeons patter was equally smooth he could help organize the bwa kell streamline it and most importantly arm it then when the time was right they would rise up and overthrow the council and their lackeys the lep cudgeon promised that his first act as governor general would be to free all the goblin prisoners in howlers peak it didnt hurt that he subtly laced his speech with hints of the hypnotic mesmer it was an offer the goblins could not refuse gold weapons freedom for their brothers and of course a chance to crush the hated lep it never occurred to the bwa kell that cudgeon could betray them just as easily as he had the lep they were as dumb as stink worms and twice as shortsighted cudgeon met with general scalene in a secret chamber beneath the koboi labs he was in a foul mood following lucs failure to put a scratch on any of his enemies but there was always plan b the bwa kell was always eager to kill someone it didnt really matter who the goblin was excited thirsty for blood he panted blue flames like a broken heater when do we go to war cudgeon tell us when the elf kept his distance he dreamed of the day when these stupid creatures would no longer be necessary soon general scalene very soon but first i need a favour it concerns commander root the goblins yellow eyes narrowed root the hated one can we kill him can we crack his skull and fry his brains cudgeon smiled magnanimously certainly general all of these things once root is dead the city will fall easily the goblin was bobbing now jiggling with excitement where is he where is root i dont know cudgeon admitted but i know where he will be in six hours wheretell me elf cudgeon heaved a large case on to the table it contained four pairs of koboi doubledex chute take these send your best hit squad and tell them to wrap up warm chute e julius root always travelled in style in this instance he had commandeered the atlantean ambassadors shuttle all leather and gold seats softer than a gnomes behind and drag buffers that negated all but the most serious jolts needless to say the atlantean ambassador hadnt been all that thrilled about handing over the starter chip but it was difficult to refuse the commander when his fingers were drumming a tattoo on the tribarrelled blaster strapped to his hip so now the humans and their two elfin chaperones were climbing e in some considerable comfort artemis helped himself to a still water from the chiller cabinet this tastes unusual he commented not unpleasant but different clean is the word youre searching for said holly you wouldnt believe how many filters we have to put it through to purge the mud people from it no bickering captain short warned root were on the same side now i want a smooth mission now suit up all of you we wont last five minutes out there without protection holly cracked open an overhead locker fowl front and centre artemis complied a bemused smile twitching at his lips holly pulled several cubic packages from the locker what are you about a six artemis shrugged he wasnt familiar with the peoples system of measurement what artemis fowl doesnt know i thought you were the worlds expert on the people it was you who stole our book last year wasnt it artemis unwrapped the package it was a suit of some ultralight rubber polymer antiradiation explained holly your cells will thank me in fifty years if youre still around artemis pulled the suit over his clothes it shrank to fit like a second skin clever material memory latex moulds itself to your shape within reason one use only unfortunately wear it and recycle it butler clinked over he was carrying so much fairy weaponry that foaly had supplied him with a moonbelt the belt reduced the effective weight of its attachments to one fifth of the earth norm what about me asked butler nodding at the rad suits holly frowned we dont have anything that big latex can only go so far forget it ive been in russia before it didnt kill me not yet it hasnt give it time butler shrugged what choice do i have holly smiled and there was a nasty twist to it oh i didnt say there wasnt a choice she reached into the locker pulling out a large pump n spray can and for some reason that little can scared butler more than a bunker full of missiles now hold still she said aiming a gramophonetype nozzle at the bodyguard this may stink worse than a hermit dwarf but at least your skin wont glow in the dark chapter to russia with gloves lenin prospekt mirmansk mikhael vassikin was growing impatient for over two years now hed been on babysitting duty at britvas request not that it had actually been a request the term request implied that you had a choice in the matteryou did not argue with britvayou did not even protest quietly the menidzher or manager was from the old school where his word was law britvas instructions had been simple feed him wash him and if he doesnt come out of the coma in another year kill him and dump the body in the kola two weeks before the deadline the irishman had bolted upright in his bed he awoke screaming a name that name was angeline kamar got such a shock hed dropped the bottle of wine hed been opening the bottle smashed piercing his ferruci loafers and cracking a big toenailtoenails grow back but ferruci loafers were hard to come by in the arctic circle mikhael had been forced to sit on his partner to stop him killing the hostage so now they were playing the waiting game kidnapping was an established business and there were rules first you sent the teaser note or in this case the email wait a few days to give the pigeon a chance to put some funds together then hit him with the ransom demand they were locked in mikhaels apartment on lenin prospekt waiting for the call from britva they didnt even dare to go out for air not that there was much to see murmansk was one of those russian cities that had been poured directly from a concrete mould the only time lenin prospekt looked good was when it was buried in snow kamar emerged from the bedroom his sharp features were stretched in disbelief he wants caviar can you believe it i give him a nice bowl of stroganina and he wants caviar the ungrateful irlanskii mikhael rolled his eyes i liked him better asleep kamar nodded spitting into the fireplace the sheets are too rough he says hes lucky i dont wrap him in a sack and roll him into the bay the phone rang interrupting his empty threats this is it my friendvassikin said clapping kamar on the shoulder we are on our way vassikin picked up the phone yes its me said a voice made tinny by old wiring mister brit shut up idiot never use my name mikhael swallowed the menidzher didnt like to be connected to his various businesses that meant no paperwork and no mention of his name if it could be recorded it was his custom to make calls while driving around the city so that his location could not be triangulated im sorry boss you should be continued the mafiya kingpin now listen and dont talk you have nothing to contribute vassikin covered the handset everythings fine he whispered giving kamar the thumbs up were doing a great job the fowls are a clever outfit continued britva and i have no doubt they are concentrating on tracing the last email but i spiked the last what did i tell you you said not to talk mister brit sir thats right so send the ransom message and then move fowl to the drop point mikhael paled the drop point yes the drop point no one will be looking for you there i guarantee it but again with the talking get yourself a spine man its only for a couple of days so you might lose a year off your life it wont kill you vassikins brain churned searching for an excuse nothing came ok boss whatever you say thats right now listen to me this is your big chance do this right and you move up a couple of steps in the organization vassikin grinned a life of champagne and expensive cars beckoned if this man really is young fowls father the boy will pay up when you get the money dump them both in the kola i dont want any survivors to start a vendetta call me if theres any trouble ok boss oh and one more thing yes dont call me the line went dead vassikin was left staring at the handset as though it were a handful of plague virus well asked kamar we are to send the second message a broad grin split kamars face excellent at last this thing is nearly over then we are to move the package to the drop zone the broad grin disappeared like a fox down a hole what now yes now kamar paced the tiny living room that is crazy completely insane fowl cannot be here for a couple of days at the earliest theres no need for us to spend two days breathing in that poison what is the reasoning mikhael extended the phone you tell him im sure the menidzher will appreciate being told he is a madman kamar sank on to the threadbare sofa dropping his head into his hands will this thing never end his partner fired up their ancient sixteenmegabyte hard drive i dont know for certain he said sending the preprepared message but i do know what will happen if we dont do what britva says kamar sighed i think ill go shout at the prisoner for a while will that help it wont admitted kamar but it will make me feel better e arctic shuttle port the arctic station had never been high on the fairy tourist list sure icebergs and polar bears were pretty but nothing was worth saturating your lungs with irradiated air for holly docked the shuttle in the only serviceable bay the terminal itself resembled nothing more than a deserted warehouse static conveyer belts snaked along the floor and lowlevel heating pipes rattled with insect life holly handed out human overcoats and gloves from an ancient locker wrap up mud boys its cold outside artemis did not need to be told the terminals solar batteries had long since shut down and the ices grip had cracked the walls like a nut in a vice holly tossed butler his coat from a distance you know something butler you stink she said laughing the manservant growled you and your radiation gel i think my skins changed colour dont worry about it fifty years and itll wash right off butler buttoned a cossack greatcoat up to his neck i dont know why youre getting all wrapped upyouve got the fancy suits the coats are camouflage explained holly smearing rad gel on her face and neck if we shield the vibration makes the suits useless might as well dip your bones in a reactor core so for tonight only were all humans artemis frowned if the fairies couldnt shield it would make rescuing his father all the more difficult his evolving plan would have to be adjusted less of the chat growled root pulling a bearskin hat over his pointed ears we move out in five i want everybody armed and dangerous even you fowl if your little wrists can support a weapon artemis selected a fairy handgun from the shuttles arsenal he jacked the battery into its slot flicking the setting up to three dont worry about me commander ive been practising we have quite a stash of lep weaponry at the manor roots complexion cranked up one more notch well theres a big difference between stunning a cardboard cutout and a real person artemis gave his vampire smile if everything proceeds according to plan there will be no need for weapons the first stage is simplicity itself we set up a surveillance post near vassikins apartment when the opportunity arises butler will snatch our russian friend and the five of us can have a little chat im sure that he will tell us everything we need to know under the influence of your mesmer then it will be a simple matter to stun any guards and rescue my father root pulled a heavy scarf over his mouth and what if things dont go according to plan artemiss eyes were cold and determined then commander we will have to improvise holly felt a shiver rattle around her stomach and it had nothing to do with the climate the terminal was buried twenty metres below an ice pack they took the courtesy elevator to the surface and the party emerged into the arctic night looking for all the world like an adult and three children albeit three children with inhuman weaponry clanking under every loose fold of cloth holly checked the gps locator on her wrist were in the rosta district commander twenty klicks north of murmansk whats foaly got on the weather i dont want to be caught in the middle of a blizzard miles from our destination no luck i cant get a line magma flares must still be up darvit swore root well i suppose well have to take our chances on foot butler youre the expert here you take point captain short bring up the rear feel free to boot any human backside if it lags behind holly winked at artemis no need to tell me twice sir ill bet there isnt grunted root with only the barest hint of a smile playing about his lips the motley band trudged southeast by moonlight until they reached the railway line walking along the sleepers was the one place they could be safe from drifts and suck holes progress was slow a northerly wind snaked through every pore in their clothing and the cold attacked any exposed skin like a million electric darts there was little conversation the arctic had that effect on people even if three of them were wearing coilheated suits holly broke the silence something had been nagging at her for a while tell me something fowl she said from behind him your father is he like you artemiss step faltered for an instant thats a strange question why do you ask well youre no friend to the people what if the man were trying to rescue is the man who will destroy us there was a long silence broken only by the chattering of teeth holly saw artemiss chin drop on to his chest you have no cause to be alarmed captain my father though some of his ventures were undoubtedly illegal was is a noble man the idea of harming another creature would be repugnant to him holly tugged her boot from twenty centimetres of snow so what happened to you artemiss breath came over his shoulder in icy sheets i i made a mistake holly squinted at the back of the humans head was this actual sincerity from artemis fowl it was hard to believe even more surprising was the fact that she didnt know how to react whether to extend the hand of forgiveness or the boot of retribution eventually she decided to reserve judgement for the moment they passed into a ravine worn smooth by the whistling wind butler didnt like it his soldiers sense was beating a tattoo on the inside of his skull he raised a clenched fist root doubletimed until he caught up trouble butler squinted into the snow field searching for footprints maybe nice spot for a surprise attack maybe if anyone knew we were coming is that possible could someone know root snorted breath forming clouds in the air before him impossible the chute is totally isolated and lep security is the tightest on the planet and that was when the goblin hit squad soared over the ridge butler grabbed artemis by the collar unceremoniously flinging him into a drift his other hand was already drawing his weapon keep your head down artemis time for me to earn my salary artemis would have responded testily had his head not been under a metre of snow there were four goblins flying in loose formation dark against the starlit sky they quickly rose to three hundred metres making no attempt to conceal their presence they neither attacked nor fled simply hovered overhead goblins grunted root pulling a far shoot neutrino rifle into his shoulder too stupid to live all they had to do was pick us off butler picked a spot spreading his legs for steadiness do we wait until we see the whites of their eyes commander goblin eyes dont have whites responded root but even so holster your weapon captain short and i will stun them no need for anyone to die butler slid the sig sauer into its pouch beneath his arm it was next to useless at that range anyway it would be interesting to see howr holly and root handled themselves in a firefight after all artemiss life was pretty much in their hands not to mention his own butler glanced sideways holly and the commander were pumping the triggers of various weapons without any result their weapons were as dead as mice in a snake pit i dont understand it muttered root i checked these myself artemis naturally was first to figure it out he shook the snow from his hair sabotage he proclaimed tossing aside the useless fairy handgun there is no other alternative this is why the bwa kell needs softnose weapons because it has somehow disabled fairy lasers but the commander was not listening and neither was butler this was no time for clever deductions this was a time for action they were sitting ducks out here dark against the pale arctic glow this theory was confirmed when several softnose laser bursts bored hissing holes in the snow at their feet holly activated her helmet optix zooming in on the enemy it looks like one of them has a softnose laser sir something with a long barrel we need cover fast butler nodded look an overhang under the ridge the manservant grabbed his charge by the collar hoisting him aloft as easily as a child would lift a kittenthey struggled through the snow to the shelter of the overhang maybe a million years ago the ice had melted sufficiently for a layer to slump slightly then freeze up again the resulting wrinkle had somehow lasted through the ages and could now possibly save their lives they dived underneath the lip wriggling backwards against a wall of ice the frozen canopy was easily thick enough to withstand gunfire from any conventional weapon butler shielded artemis with his body risking an upward glance too far i cant make them out holly captain short poked her head from under the frozen ledge and her optix zoomed into focus well what are they up to holly waited a beat until the figures sharpened funny thing she commented theyre all firing now but but what captain holly tapped her helmet to make sure the lenses were working maybe im getting some optix distortion sir but it looks like theyre missing on purpose shooting way over our heads butler felt the blood pounding in his brain its a trap he roared reaching behind him to grab artemis everybody out everybody out and that was when the goblin charges sent fifty tonnes of rock ice and snow tumbling to the ground they nearly made it of course nearly never won a bucket of squid at gnommish roulette if it hadnt been for butler not one of the group would have survived something happened to him an inexplicable surge of strength not unlike the energy bursts that allow mothers to lift fallen trees off their children the manservant grabbed artemis and holly spinning them forward like stones across a pond it wasnt a very dignified way to travel but it certainly beat having your bones pulverized by falling ice for the second time in so many minutes artemis landed nose first in a snowdrift behind him butler and root were scrabbling from beneath the ledge boots slipping on the icy surface the air was rent by avalanche thunder and the pack ice beneath them heaved and split thick chunks of rock and ice speared the caves opening like bars butler and root were trapped holly was on her feet racing towards her commander but what could she do throw herself back underneath the ledge stay back captain said root into his helmet mike thats an order commander holly breathed youre alive somehow came the reply butler is unconscious and were pinned down the ledge is on the point of collapsing the only thing holding it up is the debris if we brush that aside to get out they were alive then at least trapped but alive a plan they needed a plan holly found herself strangely calm this was one of the qualities that made her such an excellent field agent in times of excessive stress captain short had the ability to target a course of action often the only viable course in the combat simulator for her captains exam holly had defeated insurmountable virtual enemies by blasting the projector technically she had defeated all her enemies so the panel had to pass her holly spoke into her helmet mike commander undo butlers moonbelt and strap yourselves on im going to haul you both out of there roger holly do you need a piton if you can get one out to me standby a piton dart jetted through a gap in the icy bars landing a metre from hollys boots the dart trailed a length of finegrade cord holly snapped the piton into the cord receptacle on her own belt making sure there were no kinks in the line meanwhile artemis had dragged himself from the drift this plan is patently ridiculous he said brushing the snow from his sleeves you cannot hope to drag their combined weight with sufficient velocity to break the icicles and avoid being crushed im not going to drag them snapped holly well then who is captain short pointed down the track there was a green train winding its way towards them that is she said there were three goblins left their names were dnall aymon and nyle three rookies vying for the recently vacated lieutenants spot lieutenant poll had handed in his resignation when hed strayed too close to the avalanche and been swatted by a fivehundredkilo pane of transparent ice they hovered at three hundred metres well out of range of course they werent out of fairyweapon range but lep weapons werent operational at the moment koboi laboratories upgrades had seen to that that was some hole in lieutenant poll whistled aymon i could see right through im an i dont mean that like he was a bad liar goblins didnt get too attached to each other considering the amount of backstabbing backbiting and general vindictiveness that went on in the bwa kell it didnt pay to make any special friends what you think asked dnall the handsome one relatively speaking maybe one of you guys should take a spin down there aymon snorted sure thing we go down and get sparked by the big one just how dumb do you think we are the big one is out of the picture i sparked him myself sweet shot my shot set off the avalanche objected nyle the baby of the gang youre always claimin my kills what killsthe only thing you ever killed was a stink worm and that was an accident rubbish sulked nyle i meant to kill that worm he was buggin me aymon swooped between the two all right keep your scales on the pair of you all we gotta do is throw a few rounds into the survivors from up here nice plan genius sneered dnall except it wont work and why not dnall pointed below with a manicured nail because theyre boarding that train four green carriages were winding in from the north dragged along by an ancient diesel engine a maelstrom of snow flurries coiled in its wake salvation thought holly or perhaps not for some reason the mere sight of the clanking locomotive set her stomach bubbling with acid still she was in no position to be choosy its the mayak chemical train said artemis holly glanced over her shoulder artemis seemed even paler than usual the what environmentalists worldwide call it the green machine something of an irony it transports spent uranium and plutonium assemblies to the mayak chemical combine for recycling one driver locked up in the engine no guards fully loaded this thing is hotter than a nuclear submarine and you know about this because artemis shrugged i like to keep track of these things after all radiation is the worlds problem holly could feel it now uranium tendrils eating through the rad gel on her cheeks that train was poison but it was her only chance of getting the commander out alive this just keeps getting better and better holly muttered the train was closer obviously motoring along at about ten klicks an hour no problem for holly on her own but with two men down and one nexttouseless mud boy it was going to take quite a feat to get on board that locomotive holly spared a second to check on the goblins they were holding steady at three hundred metres goblins were no good at improvisation this train was unexpected it would take them at least a minute to work out a new strategy the big hole in their fallen comrade might give them further pause for thought holly could feel the radiation emanating from the carriages burning through the tiniest gap in the radiation gel prickling her eyeballs it was only a matter of time before her magic ran out after that she was living on borrowed time no time to think about it now her priority was the commander she had to get him out of there alive if the bwa kell was brazen enough to mount an operation against the lep there was obviously something pretty big going on below ground whatever it was julius root would be needed to spearhead the counterattack she turned towards artemis ok mud boy weve got one shot at this grab on to whatever you can artemis couldnt hide an apprehensive shiver dont be afraid artemis you can make it artemis bristled its cold fairy humans shiver in the cold thats the spirit said the lep captain and she began to run the piton wire played out behind her like a harpoon cable though it had the approximate grade of fishing line the cable could easily suspend two struggling elephants artemis raced after her as fast as his loafered feet could manage they ran parallel to the tracks feet crunching through the snow behind them the train grew closer pushing a buffer of air before it artemis struggled to keep up this was not for him running and sweating combat for heavens sake he was no soldier he was a planner a mastermind the hurlyburly of actual conflict was best left to butler and people like him but his manservant wasnt there to take care of the physical tasks this time and he never would be again if they didnt manage to board this train artemiss breath came short crystallizing in front of his face blurring his vision the train had drawn level now steel wheels spewing ice and sparks into the air second carriage panted holly theres a runner mind your footing runner artemis glanced behind the second carriage was coming up fast but the noise was blurring his vision was that possible it was terrific unbearable there below the steel doors a narrow board wide enough to stand on barely holly alighted easily flattening herself against the carriage wall she made it look so effortless a simple skip and she was safe from the grab of those pulverizing wheels come on fowl shouted holly jump artemis tried he really did but the toe of his loafer snagged on a sleeper he stumbled forward pinwheeling for balance a painful death came rushing up to meet him two left feet muttered holly grabbing her least favourite mud boy by the collar momentum swung artemis forward slamming him into the door like something out of a cartoon the piton cord was slapping against the carriage only seconds left before holly departed from the train as quickly as shed arrived the lep captain searched for a strongpoint to anchor herself root and butlers weight may have been reduced by the moonbelt but the jerk when it came would be more than sufficient to drag her from the locomotive and if that happened it was all over holly hooked one arm through a rung on the carriages external ladder she noticed magical sparks playing over a rip in her suit they were counteracting the radiation damage how much longer could her magic last under these conditions constant healing really took it out of a girl she needed to complete the powerrestoring ritual and the sooner the better holly was about to unclip the cable and attach it to one of the rungs when it snapped taut pulling hollys legs from beneath her she held on to the rung grimly fingernails digging into her own skin on reflection this plan needed a bit of work time seemed to stretch elastic as the cord and for a moment holly thought her elbow would pop right out of its socket then the ice gave and root and butler were twanged out of their icy tomb like a bolt from a crossbow seconds later they slapped against the side of the train their reduced weight keeping them aloft for now but it was only a matter of time before what little gravity they had pushed them under the steel wheels artemis latched on to the rung beside her what can i do she nodded at a shoulder pocket in there a small vial take it out artemis ripped open thevelcro flap pulling out a tiny spray bottle ok got it good its up to you now fowl up and over artemiss mouth dropped open up and yes its our only hope we have to get this door open to reel in butler and the commandertheres a bend in the track two klicks away if this train slows down even one revolution theyre gone artemis nodded the vial acid for the lock the mechanisms on the inside cover your face and squeeze give it the whole tube dont get any on you it was a long conversation under the circumstances especially since every second was vital artemis did not waste another one on goodbyes he dragged himself to the next rung keeping the length of his body pressed close to the carriage the wind was whipping along the length of the train tiny motes of ice in every gust they stung like bees nevertheless artemis pulled off his gloves with chattering teeth better frostbite than being crushed beneath the wheels upwards one rung at a time until his head poked above the carriage every shred of shelter was now gone the air pounded his forehead forcing itself down his throat artemis squinted through the blizzard along the carriages roof there in the centre a skylight across a desert of steel blasted smooth as glass by the elements not a handhold within five metres the strength of a rhino would be of no use here artemis decided at last an opportunity to use his brain kinetics and momentum simple enough in theory keeping to the front rim of the carriage artemis inched on to the roofthe wind wormed beneath his legs raising them five centimetres from the deck threatening to float him off the train artemis curled his fingers around the rim these were not gripping fingers artemis hadnt gripped anything bigger than his mobile phone in several months if you wanted someone to type paradise lost in under twenty minutes then artemis was your man but as for hanging on to carriage roofs in a blizzard dead loss which fortunately was all part of the plan a millisecond before his finger joints parted company artemis let go the slipstream shot him straight through the skylights metal housing perfect he would have grunted had there been a cubic centimetre of air in his lungs but even if he had said it the wind would have snatched away any words before his own ears heard them he had moments now before the wind dug its fingers beneath his torso flipping him on to the icy steppes cannon fodder for the goblins artemis fumbled the acid vial from his pocket snapping the top between his teeth a fleck of the acid flew past his eye no time to worry about that now no time for anything the skylight was secured by a thick padlock artemis dribbled two drops into the keyhole all he could spare it would have to be enough the effect was immediate the acid ate through the metal like lava through ice fairy technology best under the world the padlock pinged open exposing the hatch to the winds power it flipped upwards and artemis tumbled through on to a pallet of barrels not exactly the picture of a gallant rescuer the trains motion shook him from the cargo artemis landed face up gazing at the tripletriangled symbol for radiation stamped on the side of each container at least the barrels were sealed though rust seemed to have taken hold on quite a few artemis rolled across the slatted floor clambering to his knees alongside the door was captain short still anchored there or was he alone now for the first time in his life truly alone fowl open the door you pastyfaced mud weasel ah well not alone then covering his face with a forearm artemis drenched the carriages triple bolt with fairy acid the steel lock melted instantly dripping to the floor like a stream of mercury artemis dragged the sliding door back holly was hanging on grimly her face steaming where radiation was eating through the gel artemis grabbed her waistband on three holly nodded no more energy for speech artemis flexed his digits fingers dont fail me now if he ever got out of this he would buy one of those ridiculous home gymnasiums advertised on the shopping channels one the bend was coming he could see it out of the corner of his eye the train would slow down or derail itself two captain shorts strength was almost spent the wind rippled her frame like a windsock three artemis pulled with all the strength in his thin arms holly closed her eyes and let go unable to believe she was trusting her life to this mud boy artemis knew a little something about physics he timed his count to take advantage of swing momentum and the trains own forward motion but nature always throws something into the mix that cant be anticipated in this case the something was a slight gap between two sections of the track not enough to derail a locomotive but certainly enough to cause a bump this bump sent the carriage door crashing into its frame like a fivetonne guillotine but it looked like holly had made it artemis couldnt really tell because she had crashed into him sending them both careering into the wooden siding she seemed to be intact from what he could see at least her head was still attached to her neck which was good but she did seem to be unconscious probably trauma artemis knew that he was going to pass out too he could tell by the darkness eating at the corners of his vision like some malignant computer virus he slipped sideways landing on hollys chest this had more severe repercussions than you might think because holly was unconscious her magic was on autopilot and unsupervised magic flows like electricity artemiss face made contact with the fairys left hand diverting the flow of blue sparks and while this was good for him it was most definitely bad for her because although artemis didnt know it holly needed every spark of magic she could muster not all of her had made it inside the train commander root had just activated his piton cord winch when he received a most unexpected poke in the eye the goblin dnall removed a small rectangular mirror from his tunic and checked his scales were smooth these koboi wings are great you think well be allowed to keep em aymon scowled not that youd notice goblin lizard ancestry meant that facial movement was pretty limited quiet you hotblooded fool hotblooded that was a pretty serious insult for one of the bwakell dnall bristled be careful friend or ill tear that forked tongue right out of your head we wont have a tongue between us if those elves escape retorted aymon it was true the generals did not take disappointment well so what do we do i got the looks in this outfit that must make you the brains we shoot at the train interjected nyle simple dnall adjusted his koboi doubledex hovering across to the squads junior member idiot he snapped administering a swift slap to the head that thing is radioactive cant you smell it one stray burst and well all be ash floating on the breeze good point admitted nyle youre not as stupid as you look thank you welcome aymon throttled down descending to a hundred and fifty metres it was so tempting one tightly focused burst to take out the elf clinging to the carriage another to dispatch the human on the roof but he couldnt risk it one degree off target and hed sucked his last stinkworm spaghetti ok he announced into his helmet mike heres the plan with all the radiation in that carriage chances are the targets will be dead in minutes we follow the train for a while just to make sure then we go back and tell the general we saw the bodies dnall buzzed down beside him and do we see the bodies aymon groaned of course not you fool do you want your eyeballs to dry up and fall out duh exactly so are we clear crystal said nyle drawing his softnose redboy handgun he shot his comrades from behind close range point blank they never had a chance he followed their bodies to earth on full magnification the snow would cover them in minutes nobody would be stumbling over those particular corpses until the polar caps melted nyle bolstered his weapon punching in the coordinates for the shuttle terminal on his flight computer if you studied his reptilian face carefully it was just possible to make out a grinthere was a new lieutenant in town chapter no safe haven operations booth police plaza foaly was sitting in front of the lep mainframe waiting for the results of his latest search extensive laser brushing of the goblin shuttle had revealed one complete and one partial thumbprint the complete print was his own easily explicable as foaly personally inspected all retired shuttle parts the partial print could well belong to their traitor not enough to identify the fairy whod been running lep technology to the bwa kell but certainly enough to eliminate the innocent crossreference the remaining names with everybody who had shuttlepart access and the list got considerably shorter foaly switched his tail contentedly genius no point in being humble about it at the moment the computer was crunching through personnel files with the partial print all foaly could do was twiddle his thumbs and wait for contact with the surface team the magma flares were still up very unusual unusual and coincidental foalys suspicious train of thought was interrupted by a familiar voice search complete said the computer in foalys own tones a little vanity three hundred and fortysix eliminated forty possibles remaining forty not bad they could easily be interviewed an opportunity to use the retimager once again but there was another way to narrow the field computer crossreference possibles with level three clearance personnel level three clearance would include everybody with access to the recycling smelters referencing of course the computer would only accept commands from fairies whose voice patterns it was programmed to recognize and as a further security precaution foaly had coded his personal log and other important files in a computer language hed based on the ancient tongue of the centaurs centaurian all centaurs were a touch paranoid and with good reason since there were less than a hundred left the humans had managed to kill off their cousins the unicorns altogether there were probably six centaurs under the earth who could read the language and only one who could decipher the computer dialect centaurian was possibly the oldest form of writing dating back over ten millennia to when humans first began hunting fairies the opening paragraph of the scrolls of capalla the only surviving illuminated centaurian manuscript read fairy creatures heed this warning on earth the human era is dawning so hide fairy lest you be found and make a home beneath the ground centaurs were known for their intellect not their poetry still foaly felt the words were as relevant today as they had been all those centuries ago cudgeon knocked on the booths security glass now technically cudgeon shouldnt be allowed in ops but foaly buzzed him through he could never resist having a crack at the excommander cudgeon had been demoted to lieutenant following a disastrous attempt to replace root as recon head honcho if it hadnt been for his familys considerable political clout he would have been booted off the force altogether all in all he might have been better off in some other line of work at least he wouldnt have had to suffer foalys constant teasing i have some eforms for you to initial said the lieutenant avoiding eyecontact no problem commander chuckled the centaur hows the plotting going any revolutions planned for this afternoon just sign the forms please said cudgeon holding out a digipen his hand was shaking amazing thought foaly this brokendown shell of an elf was once on the lep fast track no but seriously cudgeon youre doing a bangup job on the formsigning thing cudgeons eyes narrowed in suspicion thank you sir a grin tugged at the corner of foalys mouth youre welcome no need to get a swelled head cudgeons hand flew to his misshapen forehead still a touch of the old vanity left oops sore subject sorry about that there was a spark in the corner of cudgeons eye a spark that should have warned foaly but he was distracted by a beep from the computer list complete excuse me for a moment commander important business computer stuff you wouldnt understand it foaly turned to the plasma screen the lieutenant would just have to wait for his signature it was probably just an order for shuttle parts anyway the penny dropped a big penny with a clang louder than a dwarfs underpants hitting a wall shuttle parts an inside job someone with a grudge to settle a line of sweat filled each groove on foalys forehead it was so obvious he looked at the plasma screen for confirmation of what he already knew there were only two names the first bom arbles could be eliminated immediately the retrieval officer had been killed in a corediving accident the second name pulsed gently lieutenant briar cudgeon demoted to recycling crew around the time holly retired that starboard booster it all made sense foaly knew that if he didnt acknowledge the message in ten seconds the computer would read the name aloud he casually punched the delete button you know briar he croaked all those jibes about your head problem its all in fun my way of being sympathetic actually i have some ointment something cold and metallic pressed against the back of the centaurs head foaly had seen too many rock em sock em movies not to know what it was save your ointment donkey boy said cudgeons voice in his ear i have a feeling youll be developing some head problems of your own the mayak chemical train northern russia the first thing artemis felt was a rhythmical knocking jarring along the length of his spine im at the spa in blackrock he thought irina is massaging my back just what my system needs especially after all that horseplay on the train the train obviously they were still aboard the mayak train the jerking motion was actually the carriage jolting over the track joins artemis forced his eyes open expecting gargantuan doses of stiffness and pain but instead he realized he felt fine more than fine great in fact it must be magic holly must have healed his various cuts and bruises while he was unconscious nobody else was feeling quite so chipper especially captain short who was still unconscious root was draping a large coat over his fallen officer oh youre awake are you he said without so much as a glance at artemis i dont know how you can sleep at all after what youve just done done but i saved you at least i helped you helped all right fowl you helped yourself to the last of hollys magic while she was unconscious artemis groaned it must have happened when they fell somehow her magic had been diverted i see what must have happened it was an root raised a warning finger dont say it the great artemis fowl doesnt do anything by accident artemis fought against the trains motion climbing to his knees it cant be anything serious just exhaustion surely and suddenly roots face was a centimetre from his own his complexion rosy enough to generate heat nothing serious spluttered the commander barely able to get the words out in his rage nothing serious she lost her trigger finger the door cut it clean off her career is over and because of you holly barely had enough magic to stop the bleeding shes drained of power now empty she lost a finger echoed artemis numbly not lost exactly said the commander waving the severed digit it poked me in the eye on the way past his eye was already beginning to blacken if we go back now surely your surgeons can graft it on root shook his head if we could go back now i have a feeling that the situation below ground is a lot different from when we left if the goblins sent a hit team to get us you can bet something big is going on below ground artemis was shocked holly had saved all their lives and this was how he had repaid her while it was true that he was not directly to blame for the injury it had been inflicted while trying to save his father there was a debt to be paid here how long he snapped what how long ago did it happen i dont know a minute then theres still time the commander sat up time for what we can still save the finger root rubbed a welt of fresh scar tissue on his shoulder a reminder of his trip along the side of the train with what i barely have enough power left for the mesmer artemis closed his eyes concentrating what about the ritual there must be a way all the peoples magic came from the earth in order to top up their powers they had to periodically complete the ritual how can we complete the ritual here artemis racked his brain he had committed large sections of the fairy book to memory in preparation for the previous years kidnapping operation from the earth thine power flows given through courtesy so thanks are owed pluck thou the magick seed where full moon ancient oak and twisted water meet and bury it far from where it was found so return your gift into the ground artemis scrambled across the flooring and began patting down hollys jumpsuit roots heart nearly shut down then and there in heavens name mud boy what are you doing artemis didnt even look up last year holly escaped because she had an acorn through some miracle the commander managed to restrain himself five seconds fowl talk fast an officer like holly wouldnt forget something like that id be willing to bet root sighed its a good idea mud boy but the acorns have to be freshly picked if it hadnt been for the timestop that seed mightnt have worked youve got a couple of days tops i know foaly and holly put together some proposal for a sealed acorn unit but the council rejected it heresy apparently it was a long speech for the commander he wasnt used to explaining himself but a part of him was hoping maybe just maybe holly had never been averse to bending a few rules artemis unzipped captain shorts tunic there were two tiny items on the gold chain around her neck her copy of the book the fairy bible artemis knew that it would combust if he tried to touch it without hollys permission but there was another item a small plexiglass sphere filled with earth thats against regulations said root not sounding too upset holly stirred halfemerging from her stupor hey commander what happened to your eye artemis ignored her cracking the tiny sphere against the carriage floor earth and a small acorn tumbled into his palm now all we need to do is bury it the commander slung holly over his shoulder artemis tried not to look at the space where her index finger used to be then its time to get off this train artemis glanced at the arctic landscape whipping past outside the carriage getting off the train wasnt as easy as the commander made it sound butler dropped nimbly through the overhead hatch where hed been keeping an eye on the goblin hit squad nice to see youre so limber commented artemis drily the manservant smiled good to see you too artemis well what did you see up there said root interrupting the reunion butler placed a hand on his young masters shoulders they could talk later the goblins are gone funny thing two of them dropped low for reconnaissance then the other one shot them in the back root nodded power play goblins are their own worst enemies but right now weve got to get off this train theres another bend coming up in about half a klick said butler thats our best chance so how do we disembark asked artemis butler grinned disembark is a pretty gentle term for what i have in mind artemis groaned more running and jumping operations booth foalys brain was bubbling like a sea slug in a deepfat fryer he still had options providing cudgeon didnt actually shoot him one shot and it was all over centaurs didnt have magic not a drop they got by on brains alone that and their ability to trample their enemies underfoot but foaly had a feeling that briar wouldnt plug him just yet too busy gloating hey foaly said the lieutenant why dont you go for the intercom see what happens foaly could guess what would happen dont worry briar no sudden moves cudgeon laughed and he sounded genuinely happy briar first name terms now is ityou must realize how much trouble youre in foaly was starting to realize just that beyond the tinted glass lep techs were beavering away trying to track down the mole oblivious to the drama being played out not two metres away he could see and hear them but it was oneway surveillance the centaur had only himself to blame he had insisted that the operations booth be constructed to his own paranoid standards a titanium cube with blastproof windows the entire room was wireless not even a fibreoptic cable to connect operations to the outside world totally impregnable unless of course you opened the door to throw a few insults at an old enemy foaly groaned his mother had always said that his smart mouth would get him into trouble but all was not lost he still had a few tricks up his sleeve a plasma floor for instance so whats this all about cudgeon asked the centaur raising his hooves just off the tiles and please dont say world domination cudgeon continued to smile this was hismoment not immediately the lower elements will suffice for now but why cudgeons eyes were tinged with madness whyyou have the gall to ask me why i was the the councils golden boy in fifty years i would have been chairman and then along comes the artemis fowl affair in one short day all my hopes are dashed i end up deformed and demoted and it was all because of you foaly you and root so the only way to get my life back on track is to discredit both of you you will be blamed for the goblin attacks and julius will be dead and dishonoured and as an added bonus i even get artemis fowl its as close to perfect as i could have hoped foaly snorted do you really think you can defeat the lep with a handful of softnose weapons defeat the lep why would i want to do that i am the hero of the lep or rather i will be you will be the villain of this piece well see about that baboon face said foaly activating a switch sending an infrared signal to a receiver in the floor in fivetenths of a second a secret membrane of plasma would warm up half a second later a neutrino charge would spread across the plasma gel like wildfire hopping anyone connected to the floor off at least three walls in theory cudgeon giggled delightedly dont tell me your plasma tiles arent working foaly was flummoxed momentarily then he lowered his hooves gingerly and pressed another button this one engaged a voiceactivated laser basically the next person to talk got plugged the centaur held his breath no plasma tiles continued cudgeon and no voiceactivated laser you really are slipping foaly not that im surprised i always knew youd be exposed for the donkey you are the lieutenant settled into a swivel chair propping his feet on the computer bank so have you figured it out yet foaly thought who could it be who could beat him at his own game not cudgeon that was for sure a techno fool if ever there was one no there was only one person with the ability to crack the centaurian code and deactivate the booths safety measures opal koboi he breathed cudgeon patted foalys head thats right opal planted a few spy cams during the upgrading work once you were kind enough to translate a few documents for the camera it was a simple matter to crack your code and do a little reprogramming and the funny thing is the council footed the bill she even charged for the spy cameras even now the bwa kell is preparing to launch its attack on the cjty lep weapons and communications are down and the best thing is that you my horsy friend will be held responsible after all you have locked yourself in the operations booth in the middle of a crisis nobody will believe it protested foaly oh yes they will especially when you disengage the lep security including the dna cannons which i wont be doing anytime soon cudgeon twirled a mattblack remote between his fingers im afraid its not up to you any more opal took your little operation apart and wired the whole lot into this little beauty foaly swallowed you mean thats right said cudgeon nothing works unless i press the button he pressed the button and even if foaly had had the reactions of a sprite he would never have had time to draw up all his hooves before the plasma shock blasted him right out of his specially modified swivel chair arctic circle butler instructed everyone to attach themselves to the moonbelt one per link floating slightly in the buffeting wind the group manoeuvred itself to the carriage doorway like a drunken crab its simple physics artemis told himself reduced gravity will prevent us being dashed against the arctic ice in spite of all his logic when root launched the group into the night artemis couldnt hold back a single gasp later when he replayed the incident in his minds eye artemis would edit out the breath the slipstream spun them beyond the railway sleepers into a drift butler turned off the antigravity belt a second before impact otherwise they could have bounced away like men on the moon root was first to detach scooping handfuls of snow from the surface until his fingers reached the compacted ice below its no use he said i cant break through the ice he heard a click behind his shoulder stand back advised butler taking aim with his handgun root obliged shielding his eyes with a forearm ice slivers could blind you just as efficiently as sixinch nails butler put a full clip into a narrow spread blasting a shallow hollow in the frozen surface instant sleet drenched the already sodden group root was checking the results before the smoke cleared he brought butler up to speed they had seconds left before hollys time ran out they needed to complete the ritual after a certain time it mightnt be wise to attempt a graft even if they could the commander jumped into the dip sweeping aside layers of loose ice there was a disk of brown among the white yes he crowed earth butler lowered hollys twitching form into the hole she seemed like a doll in his powerful hands tiny and limp root curled hollys fingers around the illegal acorn thrusting her left hand deep into the shattered soil he pulled a roll of tape from his belt crudely securing the finger to roughly its original position the elf and two humans gathered around and waited it mightnt take muttered root nervously this sealed acorn thing is new never been tested foaly and his ideas but they usually work they usually do artemis laid a hand on his shoulder it was all he could think to do giving comfort was not one of his strong points five seconds ten nothing then look cried artemis a spark a solitary blue spark travelled lazily along the length of hollys arm winding along the veins it crossed her chest climbed her pointed chin and sank into the flesh right between the eyes standback advised root i saw a twominute healing in tulsa one night damn near destroyed an entire shuttle port ive never even heard of a fourminuter they backpedalled to the lip of the crater and not a moment too soon more sparks erupted from the earth targeting hollys hand as the area most in need of assistance they sank into her finger joint like plasma torpedoes melting the plastic tape holly shot upright arms swinging like a puppet her legs began to jerk kicking invisible enemies then the vocal cords a highpitched keening that cracked the thinner sheets of ice is this normal whispered artemis as though holly could hear i think so answered the commander the brain is running a systems check its not like fixing cuts and bruises if you know what i mean every pore in hollys body started to steam venting trace radiation she thrashed and kicked sinking back down into a pool of slush not a pretty sight the water evaporated shrouding the lep captain in mist only her left hand was visible fingers a desperate blur holly suddenly stopped moving her hand froze then dropped through the mist the arctic night rushed in to reclaim the silence they inched closer leaning into the fog artemis wanted to see but he was afraid to look butler took a breath batting aside sheets of mist all was quiet below hollys frame lay still as the grave artemis peered at the shape in the hole i think shes awake he was cut short by hollys sudden return to consciousness she bolted upright icicles coating her eyelashes and auburn hair her chest ballooned as she swallowed huge gulps of air artemis grabbed her shoulders for once abandoning his shell of icy composure holly holly speak to me your finger is it ok holly wiggled her fingers then curled them into a fist i think so she said and whacked artemis right between the eyes the surprised boy landed in a snowdrift for the fourth time that day holly winked at an amazed butler now were even she said commander root didnt have many treasured memories but in future days when things were at their grimmest he would conjure up this moment and have a quiet chuckle operations booth foaly woke up sore which was unusual for him he couldnt even remember the last time hed experienced actual pain his feelings had been hurt a few times by juliuss barbed comments but actual physical discomfort was not something he cared to endure when he could avoid it the centaur was lying on the operations securitybooth floor tangled in the remains of his office chair cudgeon he growled and what followed was about two minutes worth of unprintable obscenity when he had finally vented his anger the centaurs brain kicked in and he hauled himself up from the plasma tiles his rump was singed he was going to have a couple of bald spots on his hind quarters very unattractive in a centaur it was the first thing a prospective mate looked for in a nightclub not that foaly had ever been much of a dancer four left hooves the booth was sealed tighter than a gnomes wallet as the saying went foaly typed in his exit code foaly doors the computer remained silent he tried verbal foaly one two one override doors not a peep he was trapped a prisoner of his own security devices even the windows were set to blackout blocking his view of the operations room completely locked out and locked in nothing worked well that wasnt completely accurate everything worked but his precious computers wouldnt respond to his touch and foaly was only too well aware that there was no way out of the booth without access to the mainframe foaly plucked the tin foil hat from his head crunching it into a ball a lot of good you did me he said tossing it into the waste recycler the recycler would analyse the chemical makeup of the item then divert it to the appropriate tank a plasma monitor crackled into life on the wall opal kobois magnified face appeared plastered with the widest grin the centaur had ever seen hello foaly long time no see foaly returned the grin but his wasnt quite as wide opal how nice to see you how are the folks everyone knew how opal had bankrupted her father it was a legend in the corporate world very well thanks cumulus house is a lovely asylum foaly decided he would try sincerity it was a tool he didnt use very often but he would give it a go opal think about what youre doing cudgeon is insane for pitys sake once he has what he wants he will dispose of you in a heartbeat the pixie shook a perfectly manicured finger no foaly youre wrong briar needs me he really does hed be nothing without me and my gold the centaur looked deep into opals eyes the pixie actually believed what she was saying how could someone so brilliant be so deluded i know what this is all about opal oh you do yes youre still sore because i won the science medal back in university for a second kobois composure slipped and her features didnt seem quite so perfect that medal was mine you stupid centaur my wing design was far superior to your ridiculous iriscam you won because you were a male and thats the only reason foaly grinned satisfied even with the odds so hugely against him he hadnt lost the ability to be the most annoying creature under the world when he wanted to be so what do you want opal or did you just call to chat about our schooldays opal took a long drink from a crystal glass i just called foaly to let you know im watching so dont try anything i also wanted to show you something from the security cameras downtown this is live footage by the way and briar is with the council right now blaming you for it happy viewing opals face disappeared to be replaced by a highangle view of downtown haven a tourist district outside spuds spud emporium generally this area would be thronged with atlantean couples taking photos of each other in front of the fountain but not today because today the square was a battleground the bwa kell was waging open war with the lep and by the looks of things it was a onesided battle the goblins were firing their softnose weapons but the police were not shooting back they just huddled behind whatever shelter they could find completely helpless foalys jaw dropped this was disastrous and he was being blamed for everything of course the thing about scapegoats was that they could not be left alive to protest their innocence he had to get a message to holly and fast or they were all dead fairies chapter trouble and strife downtown haven spuds spud emporium was not a place you wanted to be on the best of days the fries were greasy the meat was mysterious and the milkshakes had gristly lumps nevertheless the emporium did a roaring trade especially during the solstice at this precise moment captain trouble kelp would almost have preferred to be inside the fastfood joint choking down a rubbery burger than outside it dodging lasers almost with root out of the picture field command fell to captain kelp usually this was a responsibility he would have relished but then again usually he would have had the benefit of transport and weapons thankfully they still had communications trouble and his patrol had been rousting bwa kell hot spots when they were bushwhacked by a hundred members of the reptilian triad the goblins had positioned themselves on the rooftops catching the lep squad in a deadly crossfire from softnose lasers and fireballs pretty complex thinking for the bwa kell the average goblin found simultaneous scratching and spitting a challenge they had to be getting their orders from someone trouble and one of his junior corporals were pinned down behind a photo booth while the remaining officers had managed to take cover in spuds emporium for the moment they were keeping the goblins at bay with tasers and buzz batons the tasers had a range of ten metres and the buzz batons were only good for close quarters both ran on electric batteries and would run out eventually after that they were down to rocks and bare fists they didnt even have the advantage of shielding as the bwa kell was equipped with lep combat helmets older models certainly but still fitted with antishield filters a fireball arced over the booth melting through the asphalt at their feet the goblins were wising up relatively speaking instead of trying to blast through the booth they were lobbing missiles over it time was short now trouble tapped his mike kelp to base anything on weapons not a thing cap came the reply plenty of officers with nuthin to shoot cept their fingers were charging up the old lectric guns but thats gonna take eight hours minimum there are a coupla bodyarmour suits over in recon im having em doubletimed over to you right now five minutes tops darvitf swore the cap tain they were going to have to move any second now this booth would fall apart and they would be sitting ducks for goblin fire beside him the corporal was quivering in terror for heavens sake snapped trouble pull yourself together you shut up trub retorted his brother grub through wobbly lips you were supposed to look out for me mummy said trouble waved a threatening finger its captain kelp while were on duty corporal and for your information i am looking out for you oh this is looking out for me is it whined grub pouting trouble didnt know who annoyed him more his kid brother or the goblins ok grubthis booth isnt going to last much longer weve got to make a break for the emporium understand grubs wobbling lip suddenly stiffened considerably no chance im not moving you cant make me i dont mind if i stay here for the rest of my life trouble raised his visor listen to me listen the rest of your life is going to be about thirty seconds we have to go but the goblins trub captain kelp grabbed his brother by the shoulders dont you worry about the goblins you worry about my foot connecting with your behind if you slow down grub winced hed had that experience before were going to be all right arent we brother trouble winked of course we are im the captain arent i his little brother nodded lip losing its stiffness good now you point your nose at the door and go when i say got it more nodding grubs chin was bobbing faster than a woodpeckers beak right corporal standby on my command another fireball closer this time rising black smoke from troubles rubber soles the captain poked his nose around the wall a laser burst almost gave him a third nostril a steel sandwich board spun around the corner dancing with the force of a dozen charges foto finish the sign said or fot finish to be precise the v had been blasted out of it not laserproof then but it would have to do trouble snared the revolving board draping it over his shoulders armour of sorts the lep suits were lined with microfilaments that would dissipate neutrino blasts or even sonic bursts but softnoses hadnt been used below ground for decades so the suits hadnt been designed to withstand them a burst would tear through the lep uniform like so much rice paper he poked his brother in the back ready grub may have nodded or it may have been that his entire body was shaking trouble gathered his legs beneath him adjusting the sandwich board across his chest and back it would withstand a couple of rounds after that his own body would be providing cover for grub another fireball directly between them and the emporium in a moment the flame would sink a hole in the tarmac they had to go now through the fire seal your helmet why just seal it corporal grub did you could argue with a brother but not a commanding officer trouble placed a hand on grubs back and pushed hard go go go they went straight through the white heart of the flame trouble heard the filaments in his suit pop as they tried to cope with the heat boiling tar sucked at his boots melting the rubber soles then they were through stumbling towards the double doors trouble scrubbed the soot from his visor his men were waiting huddled behind riot shields two paramedic warlocks had their gloves off ready to lay on hands ten metres to go on they ran the goblins found range a hail of charges sang through the air around them pulverizing what was left of the emporiums shop front troubles crown lurched forward as a slug flattened itself against his helmet more charges lower down a tight grouping between his shoulder blades the sandwich board held the impact lifted the captain like a kite slapping him into his brother and carrying them both through the decimated double doors they were instantly hauled behind a wall of riot shields grub gasped captain kelp through the pain and noise and soot is he ok fine answered the senior warlock paramedic rolling trouble on to his stomach your back on the other hand is going to have some lovely bruises in the morning captain kelp waved the warlock away any word from the commander the warlock shook his head nothing root is missing in action and cudgeon has been reinstated as commander even worse now theyre saying foaly is behind this whole thing trouble paled and it wasnt from the pain in his back foaly it cant be true trouble ground his teeth in frustration foaly and the commander he had no choice he would have to do it the one thing he had nightmares about captain kelp struggled up on to one elbow the air above their heads was alive with the buzz of softnose bursts it was only a matter of time before they were completely overrun it had to be done trouble took a breath ok people listen up retreat to police plaza the troops froze even grub caught himself in midsob retreat you heard me snarled trouble retreat we cant hold the streets without arms now move it out the lep shuffled to the service entrance unaccustomed to losing call it retreat call it a tactical manoeuvre it was still running away and who would have thought that order would ever come out of trouble kelps mouth arctic shuttle port artemis and his fellow travellers took shelter in the shuttle port holly made the journey slung over butlers shoulder she protested loudly for several minutes until the commander ordered her to shut up youve just had major magical surgery he pointed out so just stay quiet and do your exercises it was vital that holly manipulate her finger constantly for the next hour or so to ensure the right tendons got reconnected it was very important she move her index finger the way she intended to use it later especially as she would be firing a weapon they huddled around a glow cube in the deserted departure lounge any water asked holly i feel dehydrated after that healing root winked something that didnt happen very often heres a little trick i learned in the field he popped a flatnosed shell from a clip in his belt it seemed to be made from perspex and filled with clear liquid you wont get much of a drink from that commented butler more than youd think this is a hydrosion shell a miniature fire extinguisher the water is compressed into a tiny space you fire it into the heart of a fire and the impact reverses the compressor half a litre of water is blasted at the flames more effective than a hundred litres poured we call them fizzers very good said artemis drily if you could use your weapons dont need em said root drawing a large knife manual works just as well he pointed the shells flat tip at the mouth of a canteen and popped the lid a fizzing spray jetted into the container there you are captain never let it be said i dont look after my officers clever admitted artemis and the best thing is said the commander pocketing i the empty fizzer these things are completely reusable all i have to do is stick it in a pile of snow and the compressor will do the rest so i wont even have foaly on my case for wasting equipment holly took a long drink and soon the colour surged i back to her cheeks so we were ambushed by a bwa kell hit team she mused what does that mean it means you have a leak said artemis holding his hands close to the cubes warmth it was my impression i that this mission was top secret not even your council i was informed the only person who isnt here is that centaur holly jumped to her feet foaly it cant be artemis raised his palms logic thats all it is this is all very well interrupted the commander but its conjecture we need to assess our situation what have we got and what do we know for sure butler nodded the commander was a being after his own heart a soldier root answered his own question weve still got the shuttle provided its not wired theres a locker full of provisions atlantean food mostly so get used to fish and squid and what do we know artemis took over we know that the goblins have a source in the ler we also know if they tried to take out the leps head commander root then they must be after the body their best chance of success would be to mount both operations simultaneously holly chewed her lip so that means that means there is probably some kind of revolution going on below ground the bwa kell against the lep scoffed holly no problem generally that may be true agreed artemis but if your weapons are out then so are theirs completed root in theory artemis moved closer to the glow cube worstcase scenario haven has been taken by the bwa kell and the council members are either dead or imprisoned quite honestly things look grim neither fairy responded grim hardly did the situation justice disastrous was closer to the mark even artemis was slightly disheartened none of this was helping his father i suggest we rest here for a while pack some provisions and then proceed towards murmansk as soon as we get some cloud cover butler can search this man vassikins apartment perhaps we will be lucky and my father will be there i realize that we are at a slight disadvantage without weapons but we still have surprise on our side no one spoke for several moments it was an uneasy silence everybody knew what should be said but nobody wanted to say it artemis said butler eventually laying a hand on the boys shoulder were in no shape to go up against the mafiya we dont have any firepower and our colleagues need to get below ground so we dont have any magic if we go in there now were not coming out any of us artemis stared deep into the heart of the glow cube but my father is so close butler i cant give up now in spite of herself holly was touched by his unwillingness to give up against all the odds she was certain that for once artemis wasnt trying to manipulate anybody he was simply a boy who missed his father maybe her defences were down but she felt sorry for him were not giving up artemis she said softly were regrouping theres a difference well be back remember its always darkest before the dawn artemis looked at her what dawn were in the arctic remember operations booth foaly was furious with himself after all the security encryptions hed built into his systems opal koboi had simply strolled in here and hijacked the entire network and whats more the lep had paid her for the job the centaur had to admire her nerve it was a brilliantly simple plan apply for the upgrade contract submit the lowest estimate get the lep to give you an accessallareas chip and then piggyback spy cams on the local systems she had even billed the lep for the surveillance equipment foaly pushed a few buttons experimentally no response not that hed expected any doubtless opal koboi had everything wired down to the last fibre optic perhaps she was watching him at this very moment he could just imagine her coiled up on a koboi hoverboy giggling at the plasma screen his greatest rival gloating over his destruction foaly growled she may have caught him off guard once but it wouldnt happen again he would not go to pieces for opal kobois entertainment then again maybe he would the centaur cradled his head between his hands the picture of a beaten fairy and began to heave theatrical sobs he peeped out between his fingers now if i were a button camera where would i hide somewhere the sweeper wouldnt check foaly glanced at the bug sweeper a small complexlooking mass of cables and chips attached to the roof the only place the sweeper didnt check was inside the sweeper itself so now he knew opals vantage point for all the good it did him if the camera was piggybacking inside the sweeper there would be a small blindspot directly below the units titanium casing but the pixie could still see everything of importance he was still locked out of the computer and locked in the operations booth he began to scan the booth what had come in since the last batch of koboi upgrades there must be some untainted equipment but there was nothing except junk a roll of fibreoptic cable a few conductor clips and a few tools nothing useful then something winked at him from beneath a workstation a green light foalys heart jumped ten beats per minute he knew instantly what it was artemis fowls laptop computer complete with modem and email capability he willed himself to maintain calm opal koboi couldnt possibly have bugged it the device had only come in hours ago he hadnt even got around to dismantling it yet the centaur clopped across to his toolbox and in a fit of frustration dumped the contents on to the plasma tiles he was not so frustrated that he forgot to snag some cable and snips the next step in his faked breakdown was to flop on to the worktop sobbing uncontrollably naturally he had to flop over the precise spot where holly had left the laptop with a casual kick foaly slid the computer into the space where the sweepers blindspot should be he then threw himself on to the floor kicking his legs in a furious tantrum from the button camera opal shouldnt be able to see more than his thrashing legs so far so good foaly popped the laptops lid quickly shutting off the speakers humans would insist on their machines beeping at the most inopportune moments he allowed one hand to drag across the keyboard and moments later he was in the email program now for the problem wireless internet access is one thing but access from the centre of the earth is quite another cradling his head in the crook of one arm foaly jimmied one end of a fibreoptic cable into a scope uplink port the scopes were shrouded trackers concealed on american communications satellites now he had an aerial lets hope mud boy was switched on koboi laboratories opal koboi had never had so much fun the underworld was literally her plaything she stretched on her koboi hoverboy like a contented cat eyes devouring the chaos on the plasma monitors the lep had no chance it was only a matter of time before the bwa kell gained access to police plaza then the city was theirs next came atlantis then the human world opal floated between screens soaking up every detail in the city goblins flowed from every centimetre of darkness armed and thirsty for blood softnose slugs ripped chunks from historical edifices ordinary fairies barricaded themselves in their houses praying that the marauding gangs would pass them by businesses were looted and torched not too much torching she hoped opal koboi had no desire to be queen of a war zone a com screen opened on the main display it was cudgeon on their secure line and he actually seemed happy the cold happiness of revenge briar squealed opal this is wonderful i wish you were here to see it soon i must remain with my troops after all because i was the one who unearthed foalys treachery the council has reinstated me as commander how is our prisoner opal glanced at the foaly screen disappointing frankly i expected some plotting an escape attempt at least but all he does is mope about and throw the odd tantrum cudgeons smile widened suicidal i expect in fact im certain of it then the recently promoted commander was all business again what of the lep any unexpected brainwaves no exactly as you predicted they are cowering in police plaza like tortoises in their shells shall i shut off local communications cudgeon shook his head no they broadcast their every move on their socalled secure channels keep them open just in case opal koboi hovered closer to the screen tell me again briar tell me about the future for a moment annoyance flashed across cudgeons face but today of all days his good humour could not be suppressed for long the council has been told that foaly has orchestrated the sabotage from his locked operations booth but you shall miraculously override the centaurs program and return control of police plazas dna cannons to the lep those ridiculous goblins shall be overrun i shall be the hero of the resistance and you shall be my princess every military contract for the next five hundred years shall belong to koboi laboratories opals breath caught in her throat and then and then together we will rid the earth of these tiresome mud people that my dear is the future arctic shuttle terminal artemiss phone rang something even he hadnt anticipated he stripped off a glove with his teeth tearing the mobile phone from its velcro strip text message he said navigating through the mobile phones menu no one has this number except butler holly folded her arms obviously someone has artemis ignored her tone it must be foaly hes been monitoring my wireless communications for months either hes using my computer or hes found a way to unify our platforms i see said butler and root together two big lies holly was unimpressed by all the jargon so what does it say artemis tapped the tiny screen see for yourself captain short took the mobile phone scrolling through the message and reading it aloud her face grew longer with each line cmndr root trble below havn overrn by goblns plice plaza srrounded cudgeon opl kboi bhnd plot no wpons or cmmunications dna cnons cntrlled by kboi i m trpped in op bth cnclthnks im blm if alive plse hlp if not wrng nmbr holly swallowed her throat suddenly dry this is not good the commander jumped to his feet grabbing the mobile phone to read the message for himself no he declared moments later it certainly isnt cudgeon all the time it was cudgeon why didnt i see it can we get a message to foaly artemis considered it no theres no network here im surprised we could even receive couldnt you rig it somehow certainly just give me six months some specialized equipment and three kilometres of steel girder holly snorted some criminal mastermind you turned out to be butler placed a gentle hand on her shoulder shh he whispered artemis is thinking artemis stared deep into the glow cubes liquidplasma heart we have two options he began after a moment nobody interrupted not even holly after all it had been artemis fowl who had devised a way to escape the time field we could get some human aid no doubt some of butlers more dubious acquaintances could be persuaded to help for a fee of course root shook his head no good they could be mindwiped afterwards sometimes wipes dont take the last thing we need is mercenaries with residual memories option two we break into koboi laboratories and return weapons control to the lep the commander guffawed break into koboi laboratories are you serious that entire compound is built on bedrock there are no windows totally blastresistant walls and dna stun cannons any unauthorized personnel that come within a hundred metres get blasted right between the pointy ears butler whistled seems like a whole lot of hardware for an engineering company i know sighed root koboi labs had special permits i signed them myself butler considered it for several moments cant be done he pronounced eventually not without the blueprints darvit swore the commander i never thought id say this but theres only one fairy for a job like this holly nodded mulch diggums diggums a dwarf career criminal the only fairy ever to break into koboi laboratories and live unfortunately we lost him last year tunnelling out of your manor as it happens i remember him said butler nearly took my head off a slippery character root laughed softly eight times i nabbed old mulch the last one was for the koboi labs job as i recall mulch and his cousin set up as building contractors a way to get plans for secure facilities they got the koboi contract mulch left himself a back door typical diggums he breaks into the most secure facility under the planet then tries to sell an alchemy vat to one of my squeals artemis sat up alchemy you have alchemy vats stop drooling mud boy theyre experimental the ancient warlocks used to be able to turn lead into gold according to the book but the secret was lost even opal koboi hasnt managed it yet oh said artemis disappointed believe it or not i almost miss that criminal he had a way of insulting a person root glanced towards the heavens i wonder if hes up there now looking down on us in a manner of speaking said holly guiltily actually commander mulch diggums is in los angeles chapter mulch ado about nothing los angeles usa mulch diggums was in fact outside the apartment of an oscarwinning actress of course she didnt know he was there and naturally he was up to no good once a thief always a thief not that mulch needed the money hed done very well out of the artemis fowl affair well enough to take out a lease on a penthouse apartment in beverly hills hed stocked the apartment with a pioneer entertainment system a full dvd library and enough beef jerky to last a lifetime time for a decade of rest and relaxation but life is not like that it refuses to curl up and sit quietly in a corner the habits of several centuries would not go away halfway through the james bond collection mulch realized that he missed the bad old days soon the penthouse suites reclusive occupant was taking midnight strolls these strolls generally ended up inside other peoples homes initially mulch just visited savouring the thrill of defeating sophisticated mud man security systems then he began to take trophies small things a crystal goblet an ashtray or a cat if he was peckish but soon mulch diggums began to crave the old notoriety and his pilferings grew larger gold bars goose egg diamonds or pit bull terriers if he was really famished the oscar thing began quite by accident he nabbed one as a curiosity on a midweek break to new york best original screenplay the following morning he was front page news coast to coast youd think hed ripped off a medical convoy instead of a gilded statuette mulch of course was delighted hed found his new nocturnal pastime in the next fortnight mulch filched best soundtrack and best special effects academy awards the tabloids went crazy they even gave him a nickname the grouch after another wellknown oscar when mulch read that one his toes wriggled for joy and dwarf toes wriggling are quite a sight they are as nimble as fingers doublejointed and the less said about the smell the better mulchs mission became clear he had to assemble an entire set over the next six months the grouch struck all across the united states he even made a trip to italy to collect a best foreignlanguage film award he had a special cabinet made with tinted glass that could be blacked out at the touch of a button mulch diggums felt alive again of course every oscar winner on the planet trebled their security which was just the way mulch liked it there was no challenge in breaking into a shack on the beach high rise and hightech thats what the public wanted so thats what the grouch gave them the papers ate it up he was a hero during the daylight hours when he couldnt venture outside mulch busied himself writing the screenplay of his own exploits tonight was a big night the last statuette he was going for a best actress award and not just any old best actress tonights target was the tempestuous jamaican beauty maggie v this years winner for her portrayal of precious a tempestuous jamaican beauty maggie v had stated publicly that if the grouch tried anything in her apartment he would get a lot more than he had bargained for how could mulch resist a challenge like that the building itself was easy to locate a tenstorey block of glass and steel just off sunset boulevard a midnight stroll south of mulchs own home so one cloudy night the intrepid dwarf packed his tools preparing to burglarize his way into the history books maggie v was on the top floor there was no question of going up the stairs lift or shaft it would have to be an outside job in preparation for the climb mulch had not had anything to drink in two days dwarf pores are not just for sweating they can take in moisture too very handy when you are trapped in a cavein for days on end even if you cant get your mouth to a drink every centimetre of skin can leech water from the surrounding earth when a dwarf was thirsty as mulch was now his pores opened to the size of pinholes and began to suck like crazy this could be extremely useful if say you had to climb up the side of a tall building mulch took off his shoes and gloves donned a stolen lep helmet and began to climb chute e holly could feel the commanders glare crisping the hairs on the back of her neck she tried to ignore it concentrating on not dashing the atlantean ambassadors shuttle against the walls of the arctic chute so all this time you knew mulch diggums was alive holly nudged the starboard thruster to avoid a missile of halfmelted rock not for sure foaly just had this theory the commander wrung an imaginary neck foaly why am i not surprised artemis smirked from his seat in the passenger area now you two we need to work together as a team so tell me about foalys theory captain ordered root belting himself into the copilots seat holly activated a static wash on the shuttles external cameras positive and negative charges dislodged the sheets of dust from the lenses foaly thought mulchs death a bit suspicious given that he was the best tunnel fairy in the business so why didnt he come to me it was just a hunch with respect you know what youre like with hunches commander root nodded grudgingly it was true he didnt have time for hunches it was hard evidence or get out of my office until youve got some the centaur did a bit of investigating in his own time the first thing he realized was that the gold recovered was a bit light i negotiated for the return of half the ransom and by foalys reckoning the cart was about two dozen bars short the commander lit one of his trademark fungus cigars he had to admit it sounded promising gold missing mulch diggums within a hundred miles two and two make four as you know its standard procedure to spray any lep property with soliniumbased tracker including the ransom gold so foaly runs a scan for solinium and he picks up hot spots all over los angeles particularly at the crowley hotel in beverly hills when he hacks into the building computer he finds the penthouse resident is listed as one lance digger roots pointy ears quivered digger exactly said holly nodding a bit more than coincidence foaly came to me at that point and i advised him to get some satellite photos before taking the file to you except except mister digger is proving very elusive am i right dead on roots colouring went from rose to tomato mulch that rascal how did he do it holly shrugged were guessing he transferred his iriscam to some local wildlife maybe a rabbitthen collapsed the tunnel so the life signs we were reading belonged to some rabbit exactly in theory ill kill him exclaimed root pounding the control panel cant this bucket go any faster los angeles mulch scaled the building without much difficulty there were external closedcircuit cameras but the helmets ion filter showed exactly where these cameras were pointed it was a simple matter to crawl along the blind spots within an hour the dwarf was suckered outside maggie vs apartment on the tenth floor the windows were triple glazed with a bulletproof coating movie stars paranoid every one of them naturally there was an alarm point sitting on top of the pane and a motion sensor crouching on a wall like a frozen cricket only to be expected mulch melted a hole in the glass with a bottle of dwarf rock polish used to clean up diamonds in the mines humans actually cut diamonds to shine them imagine half the stone down the drain next the grouch used the helmets ion filter to sweep the room for the motion sensors range the red ionstream revealed that the sensor was focused on the floor no matter mulch intended going along the wall pores still crying out for water the dwarf crept along the partition making maximum use of a stainlesssteel shelving system that almost completely surrounded the main sitting room the next step was to find the actual oscar it could be hidden anywhere including under maggie vs pillow but this room was as good a place to start as any you never knew he might get lucky mulch activated the helmets xray filter scanning the walls for a safe nothing he tried the floor humans were getting smarter these days there under a fake zebra rug a metal cuboid easy the grouch approached the motion sensor from above very gently twisting the neck until the gadget was surveying the ceiling the floor was now safe mulch dropped to the rug testing the surface with his tactile toes no pressure pads sewn into the rugs lining he rolled back the fake skin revealing a hatch in the wooden floor the joins were barely visible to the naked eye but mulch was an expert and his eyes werent naked they were aided by lep zoom lenses he wormed a nail into the crack flipping the hatch the safe itself was a bit of a disappointment not even leadlined he could see right into the mechanism with the xray filter a simple combination lock only three digits mulch turned the filter off what was the point in breaking a seethrough lock instead he put his ear to the door jiggling the dial in fifteen seconds the door was open at his feet the oscars gold plating winked at him mulch made a big mistake at that moment he relaxed in the grouchs mind he was already back in his own apartment swigging from a twolitre bottle of icecold water and relaxed thieves are destined for prison mulch neglected to check the statuette for traps plucking it straight from the safe if he had checked he would have realized that there was a wire attached magnetically to the base when the oscar was moved a circuit was broken allowing all hell to break loose chute e holly set the autopilot to hover at three thousand metres below the surface she slapped herself on the chest releasing the harness and joined the others in the rear of the shuttle two problems firstly if we go any lower well be picked up on the scanners presuming theyre still operating why am i not looking forward to number two asked butler secondly this part of the chute was retired when we pulled out of the arctic which means which means the supply tunnels were collapsed we have no way into the chute system without supply tunnels no problem declared root we blast the wall holly sighed with what commander this is a diplomatic craft we dont have any cannons butler plucked two concussor eggs from a pouch on his moonbelt will these do foaly thought they might come in handy artemis groaned if he didnt know better hed swear the manservant was enjoying this los angeles uh oh breathed mulch in a matter of moments things had gone from rosy to extremely dangerous once the security circuit was broken a side door slid open admitting two very large german shepherds the ultimate watchdogs they were followed by their handler a huge man covered in protective clothing it looked as though he were dressed in doormats obviously the dogs were unstable nice doggies said mulch slowly unbuttoning his bumflap chute e holly nudged the flight controls inching the shuttle closer to the chute wall thats as near as we get she said into her helmet mike any closer and the thermals could flip us against the rock face thermals growled root you never said anything about thermals before i climbed out here the commander was spreadeagled on the port wing a concussor egg jammed down each boot sorry commander someone has to fly this bird root muttered under his breath dragging himself closer to the wingtip while the turbulence was nowhere as severe as it would have been on a moving aircraft the buffeting thermals were quite enough to shake the commander like dice in a cup all that kept him going was the thought of his fingers tightening around mulch diggumss throat another metre he gasped into the mike at least they had communications the shuttle had its own local intercom one more metre and i can make it no go commander thats your lot root risked a peek into the abyss the chute stretched on forever winding down to the orange magma glow at the earths core this was madness crazy there must be another way at this point the commander would even be willing to risk an overground flight then julius root had a vision it could have been the sulphur fumes stress or even lack of food but the commander could have sworn mulch diggumss features appeared before him etched into the rock face the face was sucking on a cigar and smirking his determination returned in a surge bested by a criminal not likely root clambered to his feet drying sweaty palms on his jumpsuit the thermals plucked at his limbs like mischievous ghosts ready to put some distance between us and this soontobe hole he shouted into the mike bet on it commander responded holly soon as we have you back in the hold were out of here ok standby root fired the piton dart from his belt the titanium head sank easily into the rock the commander knew that tiny charges inside the dart would blow out two flanges securing it inside the face five metres not a great distance to swing on a piton cord but it wasnt the swing really it was the bonecrushing drop and the lack of handholds on the chute wall come on julius sniggered the mulch edifice lets see what you look like splattered against a wall you shut your mouth convict roared the commander and he jumped swinging into the void the rock face rushed out to meet him knocking the breath from his lungs root ground his back teeth against the pain he hoped nothing was broken because after the russian trip he didnt even have enough magic left to make a daisy bloom never mind heal a fractured rib the shuttles forward lights picked out the laser burns where the lep tunnel dwarfs had sealed the supply chute that weld line would be the weak spot root slotted the concussor eggs along two indents im coming for you diggums he muttered crushing the capsule detonators embedded in each one thirty seconds now root aimed a second piton dart at the shuttle wing an easy shot he made this kind of thing in his sleep in the simrange unfortunately the simulators didnt have thermals fouling things up at the last moment just as the commander fired his dart the edge of a particularly strong whirlpool of gas caught the shuttles rear spinning it forty degrees anticlockwise the dart missed by a metre it spun into the abyss trailing the commanders lifeline behind it root had two options he could rewind the cord using his belt winch or he could jettison the piton and try again with his spare julius unhooked the cord it would be faster to try again a good plan had he not already used his spare to get them out from under the ice the commander remembered this half a second after hed cut loose his last piton darvit he swore patting his belt for a dart which he knew wouldnt be there trouble commander asked holly her voice strained from wrestling with the controls no pitons left and the charges are set there followed a brief silence very brief no time for lengthy thinktanks root glanced at his moonomenter twentyfive seconds and counting when hollys voice came over the headset it was not bursting with enthusiasm or confidence er commander you wearing any metal yes replied root puzzled my breastplate buckle insignia blaster why holly nudged the shuttle a shade closer any nearer was suicide put it like this how fond are you of your ribs why i think i know how to get you out of there how i could tell you but youre not going to like it tell me captain thats a direct order holly told him he didnt like it los angeles dwarf gas not the most tasteful of subjects even dwarfs dont like to talk about it many a dwarf wife is known to scold her husband for venting gas at home and not leaving it in the tunnels the fact is that genetically dwarfs are prone to gas attacks especially if theyve been eating clay in the mine a dwarf can take in several kilos of dirt a second through his unhinged jaws thats a lot of clay with a lot of air in it all this waste has to go somewhere so it goes south to put it politely the tunnels are selfsealing mulch hadnt eaten clay in months but he still had a few bubbles of gas at his disposal when he needed them the dogs were poised to attack slobber hung in ribbons from their gaping jaws he would be torn to pieces mulch concentrated the familiar bubbling began in his stomach pulling it out of shape it felt as though a couple of gnome garbage wrestlers were going a few rounds in there the dwarf gritted his teeth this was going to be a big one the handler blew a football whistle the dogs lunged forward like torpedoes with teeth mulch let go with a stream of gas blowing a hole in the rug and propelling himself to the ceiling where his thirsty pores anchored him safe for the moment the german shepherds were particularly surprised in their time they had chewed their way through most creatures in the food chain this was something new and not altogether pleasantyou have to remember that a dogs nose is far more sensitive than a human one the handler blew his whistle a few more times but any control he might have had disappeared the moment mulch flew through the air on a jet of recycled wind as soon as the dogs nasal passages cleared they began to leap teeth gnashing at the apex mulch swallowed dogs are smarter than the average goblin it was only a matter of time before they thought to scale the furniture and make a jump from there mulch made for the window but the handler was there before him blocking the hole with his padded body mulch noticed him fumbling with a weapon at his belt this was getting serious dwarfs are many things but bulletproof is not one of them to make matters worse maggie v appeared at the bedroom door brandishing a chrome baseball bat this was not the maggie v the public was used to her face was covered with a green mask and there appeared to be a tea bag taped under each eye now we have you mister grouch she gloated and suction pads arent going to save you mulch realized that his career as the grouch was over whether he escaped or not the lapd would be visiting every dwarf in the city come sunrise mulch only had one card left to play the gift of tongues every fairy has a natural grasp of languages as all tongues are based on gnommish if you trace them back far enough including american dog arf grunted mulch arf rrruff rruff the dogs froze one attempted to freeze in midleap landing on his partner they chewed each others tails for a moment then remembered that there was a creature on the ceiling barking at them his accent was terrible something mideuropean but it was dog nevertheless aroof enquired dog number one whaddya sayin mulch pointed at the handler woof arfy arrooof that human has a big bone inside his shirt he grunted obviously thats been translated the german shepherds pounced on their handler mulch scampered through the hole in the window and maggie v howled so much that her mask cracked and her tea bags fell off and even though the grouch knew that this particular chapter in his career was closed the weight of maggie vs academy award inside his shirt gave him no little satisfaction chute e twenty seconds left before the concussors blew and the commander was still flattened against the chute wall they had no wing sets and no time to get one outside even if they had if they couldnt pull root out of there right now then hed be blown off the wall and into the abyss andmagic didnt work on melted slop there was only one option holly would have to use the gripper clamps all shuttles are equipped with secondary landing gear if the docking nodes fail then four magnetic gripper clamps could be blasted from recessed grooves these clamps will latch on to the metal underside of the landingbay dock reeling the shuttle into the airlock the grippers also came in handy in unfamiliar environments where the magnets would seek out trace elements and latch on like sucker slugs ok julius said holly dont move a muscle root paled julius holly had called him julius that was not good ten seconds holly flicked down a small view screen release forward port docking clamp a grating hum signalled the clamps release the commanders image appeared in the view screen even from here he looked worried holly centred a cross hair on his chest captain short are you absolutely sure about this holly ignored her superior range fifteen metres magnets only holly maybe i could jump i could make it im sure i could make it five seconds fire port clamp six tiny charges ignited around the clamps base sending the metal disc rocketing from its socket trailed by a length of retractable polymer cable root opened his mouth to swear then the clamp crashed into his chest driving every gasp of air from his body several somethings cracked reel it in spat holly into the computer mike simultaneously peeling across the chute the commander was dragged behind like an extreme surfer zero seconds the concussors blew sending two thousand kilograms of rubble careering into the void a drop in an ocean of magma a minute later the commander was strapped on a gurney in the atlantean ambassadors sick bay it hurt to breathe but that wasnt going to stop him talking captain short he rasped what the hell were you thinking i could have been killed butler ripped open roots tunic to survey the damage you could have been five more seconds and you were pulp its thanks to holly that you are still alive holly set the autopilot to hover and grabbed a medipac from the firstaid box she crumpled it between her fingers to activate the crystals another of foalys inventions ice packs infused with healing crystals no substitute for magic but better than a hug and a kiss where does it hurt root coughed a bloody string splattered his uniform the general bodily area coupla ribs gone holly chewed her lip she was no doctor and healing was by no means an automatic business things could go wrong holly knew a vicecaptain once who had broken a leg and passed out he woke up with one foot pointing backwards not that holly hadnt performed some tricky operations before when artemis wanted his mothers depression cured she was in a different time zone holly had sent out a strong positive signal with enough sparks in it to hang around for a few days a sort of general pickmeup anyone who even visited fowl manor for the following week should have gone away whistling holly groaned root ook she stammered ok she laid her hands on roots chest sending the magic scurrying down her fingers heal she breathed the commanders eyes rolled back in his head the magic was shutting him down for recuperation holly laid a medipac on the unconscious lep officers chest hold that she instructed artemis ten minutes only otherwise therell be tissue damage artemis applied pressure to the pack his fingers were quickly submerged in a pool of blood suddenly the desire to pass a smart remark utterly deserted him first physical exercise then actual bodily harm and now this these past few days were turning out to be quite educational hed almost prefer to be back in st bartlebys holly returned quickly to the cockpit panning the external cameras towards the supply tunnel butler squeezed into the copilots chair well he asked whatve we got holly grinned and for a second her expression reminded the manservant of artemis fowl weve got a big hole good then lets go visit an old friend hollys thumbs hovered over the thrusters yes she said lets the atlantean shuttle disappeared into the supply tunnel faster than a carrot down foalys gullet and for those who dont know thats pretty fast the crowley hotel beverly hills los angeles mulch made it back to his hotel undetected of course this time he didnt have to scale the walls it would have been more of a challenge than maggie vs building the walls here were brick very porous his fingers would have leeched the moisture from the stone and lost their suction no this time mulch used the main foyer and why wouldnt he as far as the doorman was concerned he was lance digger reclusive millionaire short maybe but short and rich evening art said mulch saluting the doorman on his way to the lift art peered over the marbletopped desk ah mister digger its you he said slightly puzzled i thought i heard you passing below my sightline only moments ago nope said mulch grinning first time tonight hmm the night wind perhaps maybe youd think theyd block up the holes in this building all the rent im paying you would indeed agreed art always agree with the tenants company policy inside the mirrored lift mulch used a telescopic pointer to push p for penthouse for the first few months he had jumped to reach the button but that was undignified behaviour for a millionaire and besides he was certain that art could hear the thumping from the security desk the mirrored box rose silently flickering past the floors towards the penthouse mulch resisted the urge to take the academy award out of his bag someone could board the lift he contented himself with a long drink from a bottle of irish spring water the closest to fairy pure it was possible to get as soon as he had stowed the oscar he would run a cold bath and give his pores a drink otherwise he could wake up in the morning glued to the bed mulchs door was keycoded a fourteennumber sequence nothing like a bit of paranoia to keep you out of prison even though the lep believed that he was dead mulch could never quite shake the feeling that one day julius root would figure it all out and come looking for him the apartments decor was quite unusual for a human dwelling a lot of clay crumbling rock and water features more like the inside of a cave than an exclusive beverly hills residence the northern wall appeared to be a single slab of black marble appeared to be closer inspection revealed a fortyinch flatscreen television a dvd slot and a tinted glass pane mulch hefted a remote control bigger than his leg popping the hidden cabinet with another complicated key code inside were three rows of oscars mulch placed maggie vs on a waiting velvet pad he wiped an imaginary tear from the corner of his eye id like to thank the academy giggled the dwarf very touching said a voice behind him mulch slammed the cabinet door shut cracking the glass pane there was a human youth beside the rockery in his apartment the boys appearance was strange even by mud man standards he was abnormally pale ravenhaired slender and dressed in a school uniform that looked as though it had been dragged across two continents the hairs on mulchs chin stiffened this boy was trouble dwarf hair is never wrong your alarm was amusing continued the boy it took me several seconds to bypass it mulch knew he was in trouble then human police dont break into peoples apartments who are you hu boy i think the question here is who are you are you reclusive millionaire lance digger are you the notorious grouch or perhaps as foaly suspects you are escaped convict mulch diggums mulch ran the last vestiges of gas providing him with an extra burst of speed he had no idea who this mud boy was but if foaly sent him then he was a bounty hunter of one kind or another the dwarf raced across the sunken lounge making for his escape route it was the reason hed chosen this building in the early nineteen hundreds a widebore chimney had run the length of the multi storey building when a centralheating system had been installed in the fifties the building contractor had simply packed the chute with dirt topping it off with a seal of concrete mulch had smelled the vein of soil the second his estate agent had opened the front door it had been a simple matter to uncover the old fireplace and chip away the concrete voila instant tunnel mulch unbuttoned his bumflap on the run the strange youth made no attempt to follow him why would he there was nowhere to go the dwarf spared a second for a parting shot youll never take me alive human tell foaly not to send a mud man to do a fairys job oh dear thought artemis rubbing his brow hollywood had a lot to answer for mulch tore a basket of dried flowers from the fireplace and dived right in he unhinged his jaw and was quickly submerged in the centuryold clay it was not really to his taste the minerals and nutrients had long since dried up instead the soil was infused with a hundred years of burnt refuse and tobacco ash but it was clay nevertheless and this was what dwarfs were born to do mulch felt his anxiety melt away there wasnt a creature alive that could catch him now this was his domain the dwarf descended rapidly chewing his way through the storeys more than one wall collapsed on his way past mulch had a feeling that he wouldnt be getting his deposit back even if he had been around to collect it in a little over a minute mulch had reached the basement car park he rehinged gave his rearend a shake to dislodge any bubbles of gas then tumbled through the grate his specially adapted fourwheel drive was waiting for him fuelled up blacked out and ready to go suckers gloated the dwarf fishing the keys from a chain around his neck then captain holly short materialized not a metre away suckers she said powering up her buzz baton mulch considered his options the basement floor was asphalt asphalt was death to dwarfs sealed up their insides like glue there appeared to be a man mountain blocking the basement ramp mulch had seen that one before in fowl manor that meant the human upstairs must be the infamous artemis fowl captain short was dead ahead looking none too merciful only one way to go back into the flue up a couple of storeys and hide out in another apartment holly grinned go on mulch i dare you and mulch did he turned launching himself back into the chimney expecting a sharp shock in the rearend he was not disappointed how could holly miss a target like that chute eii below los angeles the los angeles shuttle port was sixteen miles south of the city hidden beneath the holographic projection of a sand dune root was waiting for them in the shuttle he had recovered just enough to crack a grin well well he grunted hauling himself off the gurney a fresh medipac strapped across his ribs if it isnt my favourite reprobate back from the dead mulch helped himself to a jar of squid pate from the atlantean ambassadors personal cooler why is it julius that you never pay me a social visit after all i did save your career back in ireland if it hadnt been for me you never would have known about fowls copy of the book when root was fuming as he was now you could have toasted marshmallows on his cheeks we had a deal convict you broke it and now im bringing you in mulch scooped dollops of pate from the jar with his stubby fingers could use a little beetle juice he commented enjoy it while you can diggums because your next meal is going to be pushed through a slot in a door the dwarf settled back in a padded chair comfortable i thought so agreed artemis some form of liquid suspension expensive i shouldnt wonder sure beats prison shuttles agreed mulch i remember this one time they caught me selling a van gogh to atexan i was transported in a shuttle the size of a mouse hole they had a troll in the next cubicle stank something awful holly grinned thats what the troll said root knew he was being goaded but he blew his top anyway listen to me convict i have not travelled all this way to listen to your war stories so shut your trap before i shut it for you mulch was unimpressed by the outburst just out of interest julius why have you travelled all this way the great commander root commandeering an ambassadors shuttle just to apprehend little old me i dont think so so whats going on and whats with the mud men he nodded at butler especially that one the manservant grinned remember me little man seems to me i owe you something mulch swallowed he had crossed swords with butler before it hadnt ended well for the human mulch had vented a bowel full of dwarf gas directly at the manservant very embarrassing for a bodyguard of his status not to mention painful for the first time root chortled even though it stretched his ribs ok mulchyoure right something is going on something important i thought so and as usual you need me to do your dirty work mulch rubbed his rump well assaulting me isnt going to help you didnt have to buzz me so hard captain thats going to leave a mark holly cupped a hand around one pointed ear hey mulch if you listen really hard you can just about make out the sound of nobody giving a hoot from what i saw you were living pretty well on lep gold that apartment cost me a fortune you know the deposit alone was four years of your salary did you see the view used to belong to some movie director holly raised an eyebrow glad to see the money was put to good use heaven forbid you should squander it mulch shrugged hey im a thief what did you expect id start a shelter no mulch funnily enough i didnt expect that for one second artemis cleared his throat this reunion is all very touching but while youre exchanging witticisms my father is freezing in the arctic the dwarf zipped up his suit his father you want me to rescue artemis fowls father in the arcticthere was real fear in his voice dwarfs hated ice almost as much as fire root shook his head i wish it were that simple and in a few minutes so will you mulchs beard hairs curled in apprehension and as his grandmother always said trust the hair mulch trust the hair chapter the boys are back operations booth foaly was thinking always thinking his mind popped off ideas like corn in a microwave but he couldnt do anything with them he couldnt even call up julius and pester him with his hairbrained schemes fowls laptop seemed to be the centaurs only weapon it was like trying to fight a troll with a toothpick not that the human computer was without some merit in an ancienthistory kind of a way the email had already proved useful provided there was anybody alive to answer it there was also a small camera mounted on the lid for videoconferencing something the mud people had only come up with recently until then humans had communicated purely through text or sound waves foaly tutted barbarians but this camera was pretty high quality with several filter options if the centaur didnt know better hed swear someone had been leaking fairy technology foaly swivelled the laptop with his hoof pointing the camera towards the screens on the wall come on cudgeon he thought smile for the birdie he didnt have long to wait within minutes a com screen flickered into life and cudgeon appeared waving a white flag nice touch commented foaly sarcastically i thought so said the elf waving the pennant theatrically im going to need this later cudgeon pressed a button on the remote control why dont i show you whats going on outside the windows cleared to reveal several squads of technicians feverishly trying to break the booths defences most were aiming computer sensors at the booths various interfaces but some were doing it the oldfashioned way whacking the sensors with big hammers none were having any luck foaly swallowed he was a rat in a trap why dont you fill me in on your plan briar isnt that what the powercrazed villain usually does cudgeon settled back into his swivel chair certainly foaly because this isnt one of your precious human movies there will be no hero rushing in at the last moment short and root are already dead as are their human partners no reprieve no rescue just certain death foaly knew he should be feeling sadness but hatred was all he could find just when things are at their most desperate i shall instruct opal to return weapons control to the lep the bwa kell will be rendered unconscious and you will be blamed for the entire affair provided you survive which i doubt when the bwa kell recover they will name you cudgeon wagged a finger only a handful know i am involved and i shall take care of them personally they have already been summoned to koboi labs i shall join them shortly the dna cannons are being calibrated to reject goblin strands when the time comes i shall activate them and the entire squadron will be out for the count and then opal koboi becomes your empress i suppose of course said cudgeon aloud but then he manipulated the remotes keyboard making certain they were on a secure channel empress he breathed really foaly do you think id go to all this trouble to share power oh no as soon as this charade is over miss koboi will have a tragic accident perhaps several tragic accidents foaly bristled at the risk of sounding cliched briar youll never get away with this cudgeons finger hovered over the terminate button well if i dont he said pleasantly you wont be alive to gloat this time and he was gone leaving the centaur to sweat it out in the booth or so cudgeon thought foaly reached below the desk to the laptop and cut he murmured pausing the camera take five people thats a wrap chute eii holly clamped the shuttle to the wall of a disused chute we got about thirty minutes internal sensors say theres a flare coming up here in half an hour and no shuttle is built to withstand that kind of heat they gathered in the pressurized lounge to put together a plan we need to break into koboi labs and regain control of the lep weaponry said the commander mulch was out of his chair and heading for the door no way julius that place has been upgraded since i was there i heard theyve got dnacoded cannons root grabbed the dwarf by the scruff of his neck one dont call me julius and two youre acting like you have a choice convict mulch glared at him i do have a choice julius i can just serve out my sentence in a nice little cell putting me in the line of fire is a violation of my civil rights roots facial tones alternated from pastel pink to turnip purple civil rights he spluttered youre talking to me about civil rights isnt that just typical then strangely he calmed down in fact he seemed almost happy those who were close to the commander knew that when he was happy somebody else was about to be extremely sad what asked mulch suspiciously root lit one of his noxious fungus cigars oh nothing just that youre right thats all the dwarf squinted im right youre saying in front of witnesses that im right certainly you are putting you in the line of fire would violate every right in the book so instead of cutting you the fantastic deal that i was about to offer im going to add a couple of centuries to your sentence and throw you in maximum security root paused blowing a cloud of smoke at mulchs face in howlers peak mulch paled beneath the mud caking his cheeks howlers peak but thats a a goblin prison completed the commander i know but for an obvious escape risk such as yourself i dont think id have any trouble convincing the board to make an exception mulch dropped into the padded gyro chair this wasnt good the last time hed been in a cell with goblins it hadnt been any fun and that had been in police plaza he wouldnt last a week in general population so what was this deal artemis smiled fascinated commander root was smarter than he looked then again it would be almost impossible not to be oh now youre interested i might be no promises mind ok here it is onetime offer dont even bother bargaining you get us into koboi labs and i give you a twoday head start when this is over mulch swallowed that was a good offer they must be in a whole lot of trouble police plaza things were hotting up at police plaza the monsters were at the door literally captain kelp was running between stations trying to reassure his men dont worry people they cant get through those doors with softnoses nothing less than some kind of missile at that moment a tremendous force buckled the main doors like a child blowing up a paper bag they held barely cudgeon came rushing out of the tactical room his commanders acorns glinting on his breast with his reinstatement by the council he had made history by becoming the only commander in the lep to have been appointed twice what was that trouble brought up a front view on the monitors a goblin stood with a large tube on his shoulder bazooka of some kind i think its one of the old widebore softnose cannons cudgeon smacked his own forehead dont tell me they were all supposed to have been destroyed a curse on that centaur how did he manage to sneak all that hardware out from under my nose dont be too hard on yourself said trouble he fooled all of us how much more of that can we stand trouble shrugged not much a couple more hits maybe they only had one missile famous last words the doorway shook a second time large chunks of masonry tumbled from the marble pillars trouble picked himself off the ground magic zipping a gash on his forehead paramedics check for casualties have we got those weapons charged yet grub hobbled over hampered by the weight of two electric rifles ready to go captain thirtytwo weapons twenty pulses each ok best marksfairies only not one shot fired until i give the word grub nodded his face grim and pale good corporal now move it out when his brother was out of earshot trouble spoke quietly to commander cudgeon i dont know what to tell you commander they blew the atlantis tunnel so theres no help coming from there we cant get a pentagram around them to stop time were completely surrounded outnumbered and outgunned if the bwa kell breaches the blast doors it will be over in seconds we have to get into that operations booth any progress cudgeon shook his head the techies are working on it we have sensors pointed at every centimetre of the surface if we hit on the access code it will be blind luck trouble rubbed the tiredness from his eyes i need time there must be a way to stall them cudgeon drew a white flag from inside his tunic there is a way commander you cant go out there its suicide perhaps admitted the commander but if i dont go we could all be dead in a matter of minutes at least this way well have a few minutes to work on the operations booth trouble considered it there was no other way what have you got to bargain with the prisoners in howlers peak maybe we could negotiate some kind of controlled release the council will never go for that cudgeon drew himself up to his full height this is not a time for politics captain this is a time for action trouble was quite frankly amazed this was not the same briar cudgeon he knew someone had given this fairy a spine transplant now the newly appointed commander was going to earn that acorn cluster on his lapel trouble felt an emotion well up in his chest one that hed never before associated with briar cudgeon it was respect open the front door a crack ordered the commander in steely tones foaly would be just loving this on camera im going out to talk to these reptiles trouble relayed the command if they ever got out of this he would see to it that commander cudgeon was awarded a posthumous golden acorn at the very least uncharted chute below koboi laboratories the atlantean shuttle sped down a vast chute sticking tightly to the walls close enough to scrape paint from the hull artemis poked his head through from the passenger bay is this really necessary captain he asked as they avoided death by a centimetre for the umpteenth time or is it just more flyboy grandstanding holly winked do i look like a fly boy to you fowl artemis had to admit that she didnt captain short was extremely pretty in a dangerous sort of way blackwidow pretty artemis was expecting puberty to hit in approximately eight months and he suspected that at that point he would look at holly in a different light it was probably just as well that she was eighty years old im hugging the surface to search for this alleged crack that mulch insists is along here holly explained artemis nodded the dwarfs theory just incredible enough to be true he returned to the aft bay for mulchs version of a briefing the dwarf had drawn a crude diagram on a backlit wall panel in fairness there were more artistic chimpanzees and less pungent ones mulch was using a carrot as a pointer or more accurately several carrots dwarfs liked carrots this is koboi labs he mumbled around a mouthful of vegetable that exclaimed root i realize julius that it is not an accurate schematic the commander exploded from his chair if you didnt know better youd swear there was dwarf gas involved an accurate schematic its a rectangle for heavens sake mulch was unperturbed thats not important this is the important bit that wobbly line its a fissure protested the dwarf anybody can see that anybody in kindergarten maybe so its a fissure so what this is the clever bitysee that fissure is not usually there root began strangling the air again something he was doing more and more lately but artemis was suddenly interested when does the fissure appear but mulch wasnt just going to give a straight answer us dwarfs we know something about rocks been digging around em for ages roots fingers began beating a tattoo on his buzz baton what fairies dont realize is that rocks are alive they breathe artemis nodded of course heat expansion mulch bit the carrot triumphantly exactly and of course the opposite they contract when they cool down even root was listening now koboi labs is built on solid mantle three miles of rock no way in short of sonix warheads and i think opal koboi might notice them and that helps us how a crack opens up in that rock when it cools down i worked on the foundations when they were building this place gets you right in under the labs still a way to go but at least youre in the commander was sceptical so how come opal koboi hasnt noticed this gaping fissure oh i wouldnt say it was gaping how big mulch shrugged dunno maybe five metres at its widest point thats still a pretty big fissure to be sitting there all i day only its not there all day interrupted artemis is it mulch all day i wish id say at a guess this is only an approximation mind root was losing his cool being one step behind all the time didnt agree with him tell me convict before i add another scorch mark to your behind mulch was injured stop shouting julius youre curling my beard root opened the cooler letting the icy tendrils play over his face ok mulch how long three minutes max last time i did it with a set of wings wearing a pressure suit nearly got crushed and fried fried let me guess said artemis the fissure only opens when the rock has contracted sufficiently if this fissure is on a chute wall then the coolest time would be moments before the next flare mulch winked smart mud boy if the rocks dont get you the magma will hollys voice crackled over the com speakers ive got a visual on something could be a shadow or it could just be a crack in the chute wall mulch did a little dance looking very pleased with himself now julius you can say it i was right again you owe me julius you owe me the commander rubbed the bridge of his nose if he made it through this alive he was never leaving the station again koboi laboratories koboi labs was surrounded by a ring of bwa kell goblins armed to the teeth tongues hanging out for blood cudgeon was hustled past roughly prodded by a dozen barrels the dna cannons hung inoperative in their towers for the moment the second cudgeon felt the bwa kell had outlived its usefulness then the guns would be reactivated the commander was taken to the inner sanctum and forced to his knees before opal and the bwa kell generals once the soldiers had been dismissed cudgeon was back on his feet and in command everything proceeds according to plan he announced crossing to stroke opals cheek in an hour haven will be ours general scalene was not convinced it would be ours a lot faster if we had some koboi blasters cudgeon sighed patiently weve been through this general the disruption signal knocks out all neutrino weapons if you get blasters so will the lep scalene shuffled into a corner licking his eyeballs of course that was not the only reason for denying the goblins neutrino weapons cudgeon had no intention of arming a group he intended to betray as soon as the bwa kell had disposed of the council opal would return power to the lep how are things proceeding opal swivelled in her hoverboy legs curled beneath her deliciously the main doors fell moments after you left to negotiate cudgeon grinned good thing i left i might have been injured captain kelp has pulled his remaining forces into the operations room ringing the booth the council is in there too perfect said cudgeon another bwa kell general sputa banged the conference table no cudgeon far from perfect our brothers are wasting away in howlers peak patience general sputa said cudgeon soothingly actually laying a hand on the goblins shoulder as soon as police plaza falls we can open the cells in howlers peak without resistance internally cudgeon fumed these idiot creatures how he detested them clothed in robes fashioned from their own castoff skin repulsive cudgeon longed to reactivate the dna cannons and stop their jabbering for a few sweet hours he caught opals eye she knew what he was thinking her tiny teeth showed in anticipation what a delightfully vicious creature which was of course why she had to be disposed of opal koboi could never be happy as second in command he dropped her a wink soon he mouthed silently soon chapter into the breach below koboi laboratories an lep shuttle is shaped like a teardrop bottom heavy with thrusters and a nose that could cut through steel of course our heroes werent in an lep shuttle they were in the ambassadors luxury cruiser comfort was definitely favoured over speed it had a nose like a gnomes behind bulky and expensivelooking with a grill you could use to barbecue buffalo so youre saying this fissure is going to open up for a couple of minutes and i have to fly through and thats the entire plan said holly its the best weve got said root glumly well at least well be in padded seats when we get squashed this thing handles like a threelegged rhinoceros how was i to know grumbled root this was supposed to be a routine run this shuttle has an excellent stereo butler raised his hand listen whats that sound they listened the noise came from below them like a giant clearing its throat holly consulted the keel cams flare she announced big sucker itll be roasting our tail feathers any minute the rock face before them cracked and groaned in constant expansion and retraction fissures heaved like grinning mouths lined with black teeth thats it lets go urged mulch that fissure is going to seal up faster than a stink worms not enough room yet snapped holly this is a shuttle not one fat dwarf riding stolen wings mulch was too scared to be insulted just move it itll widen as we go generally holly would have waited for root to give the green light but this was her area no one was going to argue with captain holly short at the controls of a shuttle the chasm shuddered open another metre holly gritted her teeth hold on to your ears she said ramming the thrusters to maximum the crafts occupants clutched their armrests and more than one of them closed their eyes but not artemis he couldnt there was something morbidly fascinating about flying into an uncharted tunnel at a reckless speed with only a kleptomaniac dwarfs word for what lay at the other end holly concentrated on her instruments hull cameras and sensors fed information to various screens and speakers sonar was going crazy beeping so fast it was almost a continuous whine fixed halogen headlights fed frightening images to the monitors and laser radar drew a green d line picture on a dark screen then of course there was the quartz windscreen but with sheets of rock dust and larger debris the naked eye was next to useless temperature increasing she muttered glancing at the rearview monitor an orange magma column blasted past the fissure mouth spilling over into the tunnel they were in a desperate race the fissure was closing behind them and expanding before the crafts prow the noise was terrific thunder in a bubble mulch covered his ears next time ill take howlers peak quiet convict growled root this was all your idea their arguing was interrupted by a tremendous grating sending sparks dancing across the windscreen sorry apologized captain short there goes our communications array she flipped the craft sideways scraping between two shifting plates the magmas heat coated the rock face dragging the plates together a jagged edge clipped the shuttles rear as the plates crashed behind them a giants handclap butler held his sig sauer it was a comfort thing then they were through spiralling into a cavern towards three enormous titanium rods there gasped mulch the foundation rods holly rolled her eyes you dont say she groaned firing the docking clamps mulch had drawn another diagram this one looked like a bendy snake were being led by an idiot with a crayon said root with deceptive calmness i got you this far didnt i julius said mulch pouting holly was finishing the last bottle of mineral water a good third of it went over her head dont you dare start sulking dwarf she said as far as i can see were stuck in the centre of the earth with no way out and no communications mulch backed up a step i can see youre a bit tense after the flight lets all calm down now shall we nobody looked very calm even artemis seemed slightly shaken by the ordeal butler still hadnt let go of the sig sauer thats the hard bit over were in the foundations now the only way is up oh really convict said root and how do you suggest we go up exactly mulch plucked a carrot from the cooler waving it at his diagram this here is a snake no julius its one of the foundation rods the solid titanium foundation rods sunk in impregnable bedrock the very ones except one isnt exactly solid artemis nodded i thought so you cut corners on this work didnt you mulch mulch was unrepentant you know what building regulations are like solid titanium pillars do you have any idea how expensive that is threw our estimate right off so me n cousin nord decided to forget the titanium packing but you had to fill that column with something interrupted the commander koboi would have run scans mulch nodded guiltily we hooked up the sewage pipes to it for a couple of days the sonographs came up clean holly felt her throat clench sewage you mean no not any more that was a hundred years ago its just clay now very good clay as it happens roots face could have boiled a large cauldron of water you expect us to climb through twenty metres of manure the dwarf shrugged hey do i care stay here forever if you want im going up the pipe artemis did not like this sudden turn of events running jumping injury ok but sewage this is your plan he managed to mutter whats the matter mud boy smirked mulch afraid of getting your hands dirty it was only a figure of speech artemis knew but true nevertheless he glanced at his slender fingers yesterday morning they were pianists fingers with manicured nails today they could have belonged to a builder holly clapped artemis on the shoulder ok she declared lets do it as soon as we save the lower elements we can get back to rescuing your father holly noticed a change in artemiss face almost as if his features werent sure how to arrange themselves she paused realizing what she had said for her the remark had been a casual encouragement the kind of thing an officer said every day but it seemed as though artemis was not accustomed to being a member of a team dont think im getting chummy or anything its just that when i give my word i stick to it artemis decided not to respond hed already been punched once today they descended from the shuttle on a folding stairway artemis stepped on to the surface picking his way through the jagged stones and construction debris abandoned by mulch and his cousin a century earlier the cavern was lit by the starlike twinkle of rock phosphorescence this place is a geological marvel he exclaimed the pressure at this depth should be crushing us but it isnt he knelt to examine a fungus sprouting from a rusting paint tin theres even life mulch wrenched the remains of a hammer from between two rocks so thats where this got to we overdid it a bit on the explosives blasting the shaft for these columns some of our waste must have fallen down here holly was appalled pollution is an abomination to the people youve broken so many laws here mulch i dont even have the fingers to count them when you get that twoday head start you better move fast because im going to be the one chasing you here we are said mulch ignoring the threat when youd heard as many as he had they just rolled right off there was a hole bored into one of the columns mulch rubbed the edges fondly diamond laser cutter little nuclear batterythat baby could cut through anything i remember that cutter too said root you nearly decapitated me with it once mulch sighed happy days eh julius roots reply was a swift kick in the behind less talk more eating dirt convict holly placed her hand into the hole air currents the pressure field from the city must have equalized this cave over the years thats why were not flat as manta rays right now i see said butler and root simultaneously another lie for the list mulch undid his bumflap ill tunnel up to the top and wait for you there clear as much of the debris as you can ill spread the recycled mud around to avoid closing up the shaft artemis groaned the idea of crawling through mulchs recyclings was almost intolerable only the thought of his father kept him going mulch stepped into the shaft stand back he warned unhinging his jaw butler moved quickly he was not about to get nailed by dwarf gas again mulch disappeared up to his waist in the titanium column in moments he had disappeared entirely the pipe began to shudder with strange unappetizing sounds chunks of clay clattered against the metal walls a constant stream of condensed air and debris spiralled from the hole amazing breathed artemis what i could do with ten like him fort knox would be a pushover dont even think about it warned root he turned to butler what have we got the manservant drew his pistol one sig sauer handgun with twelve rounds in the magazine thats it ill take the gun as im the only one who can lift it you two pick up whatever you can on the run and what about me asked artemis even though he knew what was coming butler looked his master straight in the eye i want you to stay here this is a military operation all you can do is get yourself killed but my job is to protect you artemis and this is quite possibly the safest spot on the planet artemis didnt argue in truth these facts had already occurred to him sometimes being a genius was a burden very well butler i shall remain here unless butlers eyes narrowed unless what artemis gave a dangerous smile unless i have an idea police plaza in police plaza the situation was desperate captain kelp had pulled the remaining forces into a circle behind overturned workstations the goblins were taking pot shots through the doorway and none of the warlocks had a drop of magic left in them anyone who got injured from now on stayed injured the council was huddled behind a wall of troops all except wing commander vinyaya who had demanded to be given one of the electric rifles she hadnt missed yet the techs were crouched behind their desks trying every code combination in the book to gain access to the operations booth trouble didnt hold out much hope on that front if foaly locked a door then it stayed locked meanwhile inside the booth all the centaur could do was pound his fists in frustration it was a sign of cudgeons cruelty that he allowed foaly to view the battle beyond the blast windows it seemed hopeless even if julius and holly had received his message it was too late now to do anything foalys lips and throat were dry everything had deserted him his computer his intellect his glib sarcasm everything below koboi laboratories something wet slapped butler in the head what was that he hissed at holly who was bringing up the rear dont ask croaked captain short even through her helmet filters the smell was foul the contents of the column had had a century to ferment and smelled as toxic as the day it went in probably worse at least thought the bodyguard i dont have to eat this stuff root was on point his helmet lights cutting swathes through the darkness the pillar was on a fortydegree angle with regular grooves that were intended to anchor the titanium block filling mulch had done a sterling job of breaking down the pipes contents but the recycling had to go somewhere mulch in fairness to him chewed every mouthful thoroughly to avoid too many lumps the raiding party struggled on grimly trying not to think about what they were actually doing by the time they caught up with the dwarf he was clinging to a ridge face constricted in pain what is it mulch asked root concern accidentally slipping into his tones geddup mulch groaned geddup rih now roots eyes widened with something approaching panic up he hissed everybody up they scrambled into the tight wedge of space above the dwarf not a second too soon mulch relaxed releasing a burst of dwarf gas that could have inflated a circus tent he rehinged his jaw thats better he sighed lotta air in that soil now would you mind getting that beam out of my face you know how i feel about light the commander obliged switching to infrared ok now were up here how do we get out you didnt bring your cutter i seem to remember the dwarf grinned no problem a good thief always plans on a return visit see here mulch was pointing to an area of titanium that seemed exactly like the rest of the pipe i patched this up last time its just flexibond root had to smile you are a cunning reprobate how did we ever catch you luck replied the dwarf elbowing a section of the pipe a large circle popped out revealing the hundredyearold hole welcome to koboi labs they clambered into a dimly lit corridor loaded hover trolleys were stacked four deep around the walls strip lighting operated with minimum illumination overhead i know this place noted root ive been here before on inspection for the specialweapons permits were two corridors across from the computer centre we have a real chance of making it what about these dna stun cannons enquired butler tricky admitted the commander if the cannons onboard doesnt recognize you youre dead they can be programmed to reject entire species tricky agreed the manservant im betting theyre not active continued root first if this place is crawling with goblins they hardly came in through the front door and second if foaly is being blamed for this little uprising koboi will want to pretend they had no weapons just like the lep strategy asked butler not much admitted the commander once we turn the corner were on camera so down the corridor as fast as you can hit anything that gets in your way if it has a weapon confiscate it mulch you stay here and widen the tunnel we may need to get out fast ready holly extended a hand gentlemen its been a pleasure the commander and manservant laid their hands on hers likewise they headed down the corridor two hundred goblins versus our three virtually unarmed heroes it was going to be close inner sanctum koboi laboratories intruders squealed opal koboi delightedly inside the building cudgeon crossed to the surveillance plasma screen i do believe its julius amazing obviously your hit team was exaggerating general sputa sputa licked his eyeballs furiously lieutenant nyle would be losing his skin before shedding season cudgeon whispered into opals ear can we activate the dna cannons the pixie shook her head not immediately theyve been reprogrammed to reject goblin dna it would take a few minutes cudgeon turned to the four goblin generals have an armoured squad come up behind and another one from the flank we can trap them at the door there will be no way out cudgeon stared raptly at the plasma screen this is even better than id planned now my old friend julius its my turn to humiliate you artemis was meditating this was a time for concentration he sat crosslegged on a rock visualizing the various rescue strategies that could be utilized when they returned to the arctic if the mafiya managed to set up the drop before artemis could reach them then there was only one plan that could work and it was a highrisk plan artemis searched deeper inside his brain there must be another way he was disturbed by an orchestral noise emanating from the titanium column it sounded like a sustained note on a bassoon dwarf gas he reasoned the column had decent acoustics what he needed was a brainwave one crystal thought that would slice through this mire he had become embroiled in and save the day after eight minutes he was interrupted again not gas this time a cry for help mulch was in trouble and in pain artemis was about to suggest that butler deal with it when he realized that his bodyguard wasnt there off on his mission to save the lower elements it was up to him he poked his head into the column it was black as the inside of an old boot and twice as pungent artemis decided that an lep helmet was his first requirement he quickly retrieved a spare from the shuttle and after a moments experimentation activated the lights and seals mulch are you up there no reply could this be a trap was it possible that he artemis fowl was about to fall for the oldest ruse in the book entirely possible he decided but in spite of that he couldnt really afford to take chances with that hairy little creatures life somewhere since los angeles and against his better judgement he had bonded with mister diggums artemis shuddered it was happening more and more since his mothers return to sanity artemis climbed into the tube beginning his journey to the disc of light above the smell was horrendous his shoes were ruined and no amount of drycleaning could redeem the st bartlebys blazer mulch had better be in a lot of pain when he reached the entrance he found mulch writhing on the floor face contorted in genuine agony what is it he asked peeling off the helmet and kneeling by the dwarfs side blockage in my gut grunted the dwarf beads of sweat sliding down his beard hairs something hard cant break it down what can i do artemis asked though he dreaded the possible replies my left boot take it off your boot did you say boot yes howled the dwarf pain stiffening his entire torso get it off artemis couldnt stifle a relieved sigh hed been fearing much worse he hefted the dwarfs leg into his lap and pulled at the climbing boot nice boots he commented rodeo drive gasped mulch now if you wouldnt mind sorry the boot slid off revealing a notquitesodesigner sock complete with toe holes and darn patches little toe said mulch eyes closed with pain little toe what squeeze the joint hard squeeze the joint must be a reflexology thing every part of the body corresponds to an area of the foot the bodys keyboard so to speak practised in the orient for centuries very well if you insist artemis placed his finger and thumb around mulchs hairy toe it could have been his imagination but it seemed that the hairs parted to allow him access squeeze gasped the dwarf why arent you squeezing artemis wasnt squeezing because his eyes were crossed looking at the laser barrel in the middle of his forehead lieutenant nyle who was holding the weapon couldnt believe his luck hed singlehandedly captured two intruders plus hed discovered their bolt hole who said hanging back to avoid the fighting didnt have advantages this was turning out to be an exceptional revolution for him hed be colonel before shedding his third skin on your feet he ordered panting blue flames even through the translator it sounded reptilian artemis stood slowly lifting mulchs leg with himthe dwarfs bumflap flopped open whats wrong with him anyway asked nyle bending in for a closer look something he ate said artemis and squeezed the joint the resulting explosion knocked the goblin off his feet sending him tumbling down the corridor there was something you didnt see every day mulch hopped to his feet thanks kid i thought i was a goner there mustve been something hard granite maybe or diamond artemis nodded not ready for words those goblins are dumb did you see the look on his face artemis shook his head still not ready do you want to go look the tactless humour snapped artemis out of his daze that goblin i doubt he was on his own mulch buttoned up his bumflap nope a whole squadron of em just went past this guy must have been trying to avoid the action typical goblin artemis rubbed his temples there must be something he could do to help his friends he had the highest tested iq in europe for heavens sake mulch i have an important question for you i suppose i owe you one for saving my hide artemis draped an arm around the dwarfs shoulder i know how you got into koboi labs but you couldnt go back that way the flare would get you so how did you get out mulch grinned simple i activated the alarm then left in the lep uniform i came in artemis scowled no use there must be another way there has to be the dna cannons were obviously out of commission root was just starting to feel optimistic when he heard the thunder of approaching boots darvit rumbled you two keep going ill hold them here as long as i can no commander said butler with respect we only have one weapon and i can hit a lot more with it than you ill take them coming around the corner you try to get the door open holly opened her mouth to argue but who was going to argue with a man that size ok good luck if youre wounded lie as still as you can until i get back four minutes remember butler nodded i remember and butler yes captain that little misunderstanding last year when you and artemis kidnapped me butler gazed at the ceiling he would have stared at his shoes but holly was in the way yes that ive been meaning to talk to just forget it after this all square holly move it out ordered root butler dont let them get too close butler wrapped his fingers around the guns moulded grip he looked like an armed bear they better not for their sake artemis climbed up on a hover trolley tapping one of the overhead conduits that ran the length of the corridor this pipe appears to run along the entire ceiling structure what is it a ventilation system mulch snorted i wish its the plasma supply for the dna cannons so why didnt you come in this way oh a little matter of there being enough charge in every drop of plasma to fry a troll artemis placed his palm against the metal what if the cannons werent operational once the cannons are deactivated the plasma is just so much radioactive slop radioactive mulch tugged at his beard thoughtfully actually julius reckons the cannons have been turned off any way to be certain we could open this unopenable panel mulch ran his fingers along the curved surface ahh see here a microkeyhole to service the cannons even plasma needs recharging he pointed to a tiny hole in the metal it could have been a speck of dirt now observe a master at work the dwarf fed one of his chin hairs into the hole when the tip reappeared mulch plucked the hair out by the root the hair died as soon as mulch plucked it stiffening in rigor mortis and retaining the precise shape of the locks interior mulch held his breath twisting the makeshift key the hatch dropped open that my boy is talent inside the pipe an orange jelly pulsed gently occasional sparks roiled in its depths the plasma was too dense even to spill from the hatch and hung on to its cylindrical shape mulch squinted through the wobbling gel deactivated all right if that stuff were live our faces would be getting a nice tan about now what about those sparks residual charge theyd give you a bit of a tingle but nothing serious artemis nodded right he said strapping on the helmet mulch blanched you are not serious mudwhelp do you have any idea what will happen if those cannons are activated im trying not to think about it its probably just as well the dwarf shook his head bewildered ok youve got thirty metres to go and no more than ten minutes of air in that helmet keep the filters closed the air may get a bit stale after a while but its better than sucking plasma and here take this he plucked the stiffened hair from the keyhole what for i presume you will want to get out again at the other end or hadnt you thought of that genius boy artemis swallowed he hadnt there was more to this heroism thing than rushing in blindly just feed it in gently remember its hair not metal feed it in gently got it and dont use any lights halogen could reactivate the plasma artemis felt his head beginning to spin and make sure you get foamed as soon as you canthe antirad canisters are blue theyre everywhere in this facility blue canisters anything else mister diggums well there are the plasma snakes artemiss knees almost collapsed youre not serious no mulch conceded im not now your reach is about half a metre so calculate for sixty pulls and then get out of there slightly under half a metre id say perhaps sixtythree pulls he placed the dwarf hair inside his breast pocket mulch shrugged whatever kid its your skin now in you go the dwarf interlaced his fingers and artemis stepped into the makeshift stirrup he was considering changing his mind when mister diggums heaved him into the pipe the orange gel sucked him in enveloping his body in a second the plasma coiled around him like a living being popping bubbles of air trapped in his clothing a residual spark brushed his leg sending sharp pain spasming through his body a bit of a tingle artemis gazed out through the orange gel mulch was there giving him the thumbs up grinning like a loon artemis decided that if he made it through this then he would have to place the dwarf on the payroll he began to crawl blindly one pull two pulls sixtythree seemed a long way off butler cocked the sig sauer the footsteps were earsplitting now bouncing off the metal walls shadows stretched around the corner ahead of their owners the manservant took approximate aim a head appeared froglike licking its own eyeballs butler pulled the trigger the slug punched a melonsized hole in the wall above the goblins head the head was hurriedly withdrawn of course butler had missed on purpose scared was always better than dead but it couldnt last forever twelve more shots to be precise the goblins grew braver sneaking out further and further eventually butler knew he would be forced to shoot one the manservant decided that it was time to go closequarters he rose from his hunkers making slightly less noise than a panther and hurtled down the corridor towards the enemy there were only two men on the planet better educated in the various martial arts than butler and he was related to one of them the other lived on an island in the south china seas and spent his days meditating and beating up palm trees you really had to feel sorry for those goblins the bwa kell had two guards on the sanctum door both armed to the teeth and both as thick as several short planks in spite of repeated warnings they were both falling asleep inside their helmets when the elves came running around the corner look mumbled one elves huh said the other the denser of the two dont matter said number one lep dont got no guns number two gave his eyeballs a lick yeah but they sure are irritable and that was when hollys boot impacted with his chest slamming him into the wall hey complained number one bringing up his own gun not fair root didnt bother with fancy spinning kicks preferring instead to bodyslam the sentry against the titanium door there panted holly two down that wasnt so hard a premature statement as it happened because that was when the rest of the twohundredstrong bwa kell squadron thundered down the perpendicular corridor that wasnt so hard mimicked the commander curling his fingers into fists artemiss concentration was failing him there seemed to be more sparks now and each shock disrupted his focus he had lost count twice he was at fiftyfour now or fiftysix the difference was life or death he trawled ahead reaching out one arm and then the other swimming through a turgid sea of gel vision was next to useless everything was orange and the only confirmation he had that any progress was being made was when his knee sank into a recess where the plasma diverted into a cannon artemis punched one last time through the gel filling his lungs with stale air sixtythree that was it soon the air purifiers in his helmet would be useless and he would be breathing carbon dioxide he placed his fingertips against the pipes inner curve searching for a keyhole again his eyes were no help he couldnt even activate the helmet lamps for fear of igniting a river of plasma nothing no indent he was going to die here alone he would never be great artemis felt his brain going spiralling off into a black tunnel concentrate he told himself focus there was a spark approaching a silver star in the sunset it coiled lazily along the tube lighting each section it passed there a hole the hole revealed for a moment by the passing spark artemis reached into his pocket like a drunken swimmer pulling out the dwarf hair would it work there was no reason this access port should have a different locking mechanism artemis slid the hair into the keyhole gently he squinted through the gel was it going in he thought so perhaps sixty per cent sure it would have to be enough artemis twisted the flap dropped open he imagined mulchs grin that my boy is talent it was quite possible that every enemy he had in the underworld was waiting outside that hatch big nasty guns pointed at his head at that point artemis didnt much care he couldnt bear one more of his own oxygendepleted breaths or one more excruciating shock to his body so artemis fowl poked his helmet through the plasmas surface he flipped the visor savouring what could very well be his last breath lucky for him the rooms occupants were looking at the view screen watching his friends fight for their lives not so lucky for his friends there are too many thought butler as he rounded the corner and saw almost an entire army of bwa kell slotting fresh batteries into their weapons the goblins when they noticed butler began to think things like o gods its a troll in clothes or why didnt i listen to mummy and stay out of the gangs then butler was above them and on the way down he landed like the proverbial tonne of bricks except with considerably more precision three goblins were out cold before they knew theyd been hit one shot himself in the foot and several others lay down pretending to be unconscious artemis watched it all on the control rooms plasma screen along with all the other occupants of the inner sanctum it was entertainment to them tv the goblin generals chuckled and winced as butler decimated their men it was all immaterial there were hundreds of goblins in the building and no way into this room artemis had seconds to decide on a course of action seconds and he had no idea how to use any of this technology he scanned the walls below him for something he could use anything there on a small pictureinpicture screen away from the main console was foaly trapped in the operations booth the centaur would have a plan he had certainly had time to come up with one artemis knew that as soon as he emerged from the conduit he was a target they would kill him without hesitation he dragged himself from within the tube falling to earth with a thick slap his saturated clothes slowed his progress to the monitor bank heads were turning he could see them out the corner of his eye figures came his way he didnt know how many there was a reed mike below foalys image artemis pressed the button foaly he rasped globs of gel splatting on to the consolecan you hear me the centaur reacted instantly fowl what happened to you five seconds foaly i need a plan or were all dead foaly nodded curtly ive got one ready put me on all screens what how press the conference button yellow a circle with lines shooting out like the sun do you see it artemis saw it he pressed it then something pressed him very painfully general scalene first noticed the creature flopping out of the plasma pipe what was it a pixie no no by all the gods it was human look he cackled a mud man the others were oblivious too interested in the spectacle onscreen but not cudgeon a human in the inner sanctum how could this be he seized scalene by the shoulders kill him all the generals were listening now there was killing to be done with no danger to themselvesthey would do this the oldfashioned way with claws and fireballs the human stumbled to one of the consoles and they surrounded him tongues dangling excitedly sputa spun the human around to face his fate one by one the generals conjured fireballs around their fists closing in for the kill but then something made them completely forget the injured human cudgeons face had appeared on all the screens and the bwa kell executive didnt like what it was saying just when things are at their most desperate i shall instruct opal to return weapons control to the lep the bwa kell will be rendered unconscious and you will be blamed for the entire affair provided you survive which i doubt sputa whirled on his ally cudgeon what does this mean the generals advanced hissing and spitting treachery cudgeon treachery cudgeon was not unduly worried ok he said treachery it took cudgeon a moment to figure out what had happened it was foaly he must have recorded their conversation somehow how tiresome still you had to hand it to the centaur he was resourceful cudgeon quickly crossed to the main console shutting off the broadcast it wouldnt do for opal to hear the rest of it particularly the part concerning her tragic accident he really would have to cut out this grandstanding still no matter everything was on track treachery hissed scalene ok admitted cudgeon treachery and directly after that he said computer activate dna cannons authorization cudgeon b alpha alpha two two on her hover chair opal spun with sheer joy clapping her tiny hands in delight briar was sooo ugly but he was sooo evil throughout koboi labs robot dna cannons perked up in their cradles and ran swift selfdiagnostics apart from a slight drain in the inner sanctum everything was in order and so without further ado they began to obey their program parameters and target anything with goblin dna at a rate often blasts per second it was swift and as with everything koboi efficient in less than five seconds the cannons settled back into their cradles mission accomplished two hundred unconscious goblins throughout the facility phew said holly stepping over rows of snoring goblins close one tell me about it agreed root cudgeon kicked sputas sleeping body you see you havent accomplished anything artemis fowl he said drawing his redboy your friends are out there youre in here and the goblins are unconscious soon to be mindwiped with some particularly unstable chemicals just as i planned he smiled at opal hovering above them just as we planned opal returned the smile at another time artemis would have been forced to pass a snide comment but the possibility of imminent death was occupying his thoughts for the moment now i simply reprogram the cannons to target your friends return power to the lep cannons and take over the world and nobody can get in here to stop me of course you should never say something like that especially when youre an archvillain its just asking for trouble butler hurried down the corridor catching up with the others outside the inner sanctum he could see artemiss predicament through the doors quartz pane in spite of all his efforts master artemis had still managed to place himself in mortal danger how was a bodyguard supposed to do his job when his charge insisted on jumping into bear pits so to speak butler felt the testosterone building in his system one door was all that separated him from artemis one little door designed to withstand fairies with ray guns he took several steps backwards holly could tell what he was thinking dont bother that door is reinforced the manservant didnt answer he couldnt the real butler was submerged beneath layers of adrenalin and brute force with a roar butler charged the entrance concentrating all of his considerable might in the triangular point of his shoulder it was a blow that would have felled a mediumsized hippopotamus and while this door was tested for plasma dispersion and moderate physical resistance it was certainly not butlerproof the metal portal crumpled like tin foil butlers momentum took him halfway across the inner sanctums rubber tiling holly and root followed pausing only to grab some softnose lasers from the unconscious goblins cudgeon moved fast dragging artemis upright dont move any of you or ill kill the mud boy butler kept right on going his last rational thought had been to disable cudgeon now this was his sole aim in life he raced forward arms outstretched holly dived desperately latching on to butlers belt he dragged her like a string of cans behind a wedding car butler stop she grunted the bodyguard ignored her holly hung on digging in her heels stop she repeated this time layering her voice with the mesmer butler seemed to wake up he shook the cave man from his system thats right mud man said cudgeon listen to captain short surely we can work something out here no deals briar said root its all over so just put the mud boy down cudgeon cocked the redboy til put him down all right this was butlers worst nightmare his charge was in the hands of a psychopath with nothing to lose and there was nothing he could do about it a phone rang i think its mine said artemis automatically another ring definitely his mobile phone amazing the thing worked at all really considering what it had been through artemis ripped open the case yes it was one of those frozen moments nobody knew what to expect artemis tossed the handset at opal koboi its for the pixie swooped low to catch the tiny mobile phone cudgeons chest heaved his body knew what was happening even if his brain hadnt figured it out yet opal placed the tiny speaker to her pointed ear really foaly said cudgeons voice do you think id go to all this trouble to share power oh no as soon as this charade is over miss koboi will have a tragic accident perhaps several tragic accidents all colour drained from opals face you she screeched its a trick protested cudgeon theyre trying to turn us against each other but his eyes told the real story pixies are feisty creatures in spite of their size they put up with so much and then explode for opal koboi it was explosion time she manipulated the hoverboys controls dropping in a steep dive cudgeon didnt hesitate he put two bursts into the chair but the thick cushion protected its pilot opal koboi flew straight at her former partner when the elf raised his arms to protect himself artemis slid to the floor briar cudgeon was not so lucky he became entangled in the hoverboys safety rail and was borne aloft by the wildcat pixie they whirled around the chamber ricocheting off several walls before crashing straight through the open plasma panel in the cannon pipe unfortunately for cudgeon the plasma was now active he had activated it himself but this irony did not occur to him as he was fried by a million radioactive tendrils koboi was lucky she was pitched from the hoverchair and lay moaning on the rubber tiles butler was on the move before cudgeon landed he flipped artemis over checking his frame for wounds a couple of scratches superficial nothing a shot of blue sparks wouldnt take care of holly checked opal kobois status she conscious asked the commander kobois eyes flickered open holly shut them with a swift rabbit punch to the forehead nope she said innocently out cold root took one look at cudgeon and realized there was no point checking for vitals maybe he was better off the alternative would have been a couple of centuries in howlers peak artemis noticed movement by the door it was mulch he was grinning and waving waving goodbye just in case julius forgot about his twoday head start the dwarf pointed to a blue canister mounted on a wall bracket and he was gone butler rasped artemis with the absolute last ounce of his strength could someone spray me down and then could we please go to murmansk butler was mystified spray what spray holly unhooked the antirad foam canister flipping the safety catch allow me she said grinning it would be my pleasure she directed a jet of foulsmelling foam at artemis in seconds he resembled a halfmelted snowman holly laughed who said there were no perks in law enforcement operations booth once the cannon plasma had shortcircuited cudgeons remote control power came rushing back to the operations booth foaly lost no time in activating the subcutaneous sleepers planted below goblin offenders skin that put half of the bwa kell out of action straight away then he reprogrammed police plazas own dna cannons for nonlethal bursts it was all over in seconds captain kelps first thought was for his subordinates sound off he shouted his voice slicing through the chaos did we lose anyone the squadron leaders answered in sequence confirming that there had been no fatalities we were lucky remarked a warlock medic theres not a drop of magic left in the building not even a medipac the next officer to go down would have stayed down trouble turned his attention to the ops booth he did not look amused foaly depolarized the quartz window and opened a channel hey guys i wasnt behind this it was cudgeon i just saved everyone i sent a sound recording to a mobile phone that wasnt easy you should be giving me a medal trouble clenched his fist yeah foaly come on out here and let me give you your medal foaly may not have had many social skills but he knew thinly veiled threats when he heard them oh no not me im staying right here until commander root gets back he can explain everything the centaur blacked out the window and busied himself running a bug sweep he would isolate every last trace of opal koboi and flush it out of the system paranoid was he who was the paranoid one now holly who was the paranoid one now chapter fathers day murmansk the arctic seascape between murmansk and severomorsk had become a submarine graveyard for russias once mighty fleet easily a hundred nuclear submarines lay rusting in the coastlines various inlets and fjords with only the odd danger sign or roving patrol to warn off curious passersby at night you didnt have to look too hard to see the glow or listen too hard to hear the hum one such submarine was the nikodim a twentyyearold typhoon class with rusty pipes and a leaky reactor not a healthy combination and it was here that the mafiya kingpin britva had instructed his lackeys to make the exchange for artemis fowl senior mikhael vassikin and kamar were none too happy with the situation they had been bunked in the captains quarters for two days already and were convinced their lives were growing shorter by the minute vassikin coughed you hear that my guts arent right its the radiation im telling you this whole thing is ridiculous snarled kamar the fowl boy is thirteen thirteen hes a baby how can a child raise five million dollars its crazy vassikin sat up on his bunk maybe not ive heard stories about this one they say he has powers kamar snorted powers magic oh go stuff your head in the reactor you old woman no i have a contact in interpol they have an active file on this boy thirteen years old and with an active file i am thirtyseven and still no interpol file the russian sounded disappointed an active file whats magic about that but my contact swears that this boy fowl is sighted all over the world on the same day the same hour kamar was unimpressed your contact is a bigger coward than you are believe what you want but ill be happy to get off this cursed boat alive one way or the other kamar pulled a fur cap down over his ears ok lets go its time finally sighed vassikin the two men collected the prisoner from the next cabin they were not worried about an escape attempt not with one leg missing and a hood secured over his head vassikin slung fowl senior over his shoulder and climbed the rungs to the conning tower kamar used a radio to check in with the backup there were over a hundred criminals hiding among the petrified bushes and snowdrifts cigarette tips lit the night like fireflies put those cigarettes out idiots he hissed over an open frequency its almost midnight fowl could be here any second remember no one shoots until i give the order then everybody shoots you could almost hear the hiss as a hundred cigarette butts were flicked into the snow a hundred men it was a costly operation but a mere drop in the ocean compared to the twenty per cent promised them by britva wherever this boy fowl came from he would be trapped in a deadly crossfire there was no way out for him or his father while he and vassikin were safe behind the steel conning tower kamar grinned lets see how much magic you have then irlanskii holly surveyed the scene through the hires nightsight filter in her helmet with the eyes of a seasoned recon officer butler was stuck with plain old binoculars how many cigarettes did you count more than eighty replied the captain could be up to a hundred men you walk in there and youll be carried out root nodded in agreement it was a tactical nightmare they were bivouacked on the opposite side of the fjord high on a sloped hill the council had even approved wings on account of artemiss recent services foaly had done a mail retrieval from artemiss computer and found a message five million us the nikodim murmansk midnight on the fourteenth it was short and to the point what else was there to say they had missed their opportunity to snatch artemis senior before he was moved to the drop point and now the mafiya were in control they gathered around while butler sketched a diagram in the snow with a laser pointer i would guess that the target is being held here in the conning towerto get there youve got to walk all the way along the sub theyve got a hundred men hiding out around the perimeter we have no air support no satellite information and minimal weaponry butler sighed im sorry artemis i just dont see it holly knelt to study the diagrama timestop would take days to set up we cant shield either because of the radiation and theres no way to get close enough to mesmerize what about lep weaponry asked artemis though he knew the answer root chewed an unlit cigar we discussed this artemis we have as much firepower as you like but if we start blasting your father will be their first target standard kidnapping rules artemis pulled an lep field parka closer to his throat staring at the rough diagram and if we give them the money foaly had run them up five million in small bills on one of his old printers he had even had a squad of sprites crumple it up a bit butler shook his head thats not the way these people do business alive mister fowl is a potential enemy he has to die artemis nodded slowly there was absolutely no other way he would have to implement the plan he had concocted in the arctic shuttle port very well everyone he said i have a plan but its going to sound a bit extreme mikhael vassikins mobile phone rang shattering the arctic silence vassikin almost fell down the tower hatch da what is it im busy this is fowl said a voice in flawless russian colder than arctic pack ice its midnight im here mikhael swung around scanning the surroundings through his binoculars here where i dont see anything close enough how did you get this number a chuckle rattled through the speakers the sound set vassikins fillings on edge i know someone he has all the numbers mikhael took deep breaths settling himself do you have the money of course do you have the package right here again the cold chuckle all i see is a fat imbecile a little rat and someone with a hood over his head it could be anyone im not paying five million for your cousin yuri vassikin ducked below the lip of the tower fowl can see us he hissed at kamar stay low kamar scuttled to the far side of the tower opening a line to his men hes here fowl is here search the area vassikin brought the phone back to his ear so come down here and check youll see soon enough i can see fine from right here just take the hood off mikhael covered the phone he wants me to take the hood off what should i do kamar sighed now it was becoming plain who was the brains in this outfit take it off what difference does it make either way theyre both dead in five minutes ok fowl im taking off the hood the next face you see will be your fathers the big russian propped up the prisoner high over the lip of the conning tower he reached up with one hand and pulled off the rough sackcloth hood on the other end of the line he heard a sharp intake of breath through the filters of his borrowed lep helmet artemis could see the conning tower as though it were a metre away the hood came off and he could not suppress a sharp gasp it was his father different certainly but not beyond recognition artemis fowl the first without a shadow of a doubt well said a russian voice in his ear is it him artemis struggled to stop his voice from shaking yes he said it is him congratulations you have an item of some value in the conning tower vassikin gave his partner the thumbs up its him he hissed were in the money kamar didnt share his confidence there would be no celebrating until the cash was in his hand butler steadied the fairy far shoot rifle on its stand he had selected it from the lep armoury fifteen hundred metres not an easy shot but there was no wind and foaly had given him a scope that did the aiming for him artemis fowl seniors torso was centred in the crosshair he took a breath artemis are you surethis is risky artemis did not reply checking for the hundredth time that holly was in position of course he wasnt sure a million things could go wrong with this deception but what choice did he have artemis nodded just once butler fired the shot the shot caught artemis senior in the shoulder he spun around slumping over the startled vassikin the russian howled in disgust heaving the bleeding irishman over the lip of the conning tower artemis senior slid along the keel crashing through the brittle ice plates clinging to the subs hull he shot him yelped the khuligany that devil shot his own father kamar was stunned idiot he howled youve just thrown our hostage overboard he peered into the black arctic waters nothing remained of the irlanskii but ripples go down and get him if you wish said vassikin sullenly was he dead his partner shrugged maybe he was bleeding bad and if the bullet doesnt finish him the water will anyway its not our fault kamar swore viciously i dont think britva will see it that way britva breathed vassikinthe only thing the menidzher understood was money o gods were dead the mobile phone rattled on the deck the speaker was vibrating fowl was still on the other end mikhael picked up the mobile as though it were a grenade fowlyou there yes came the reply you crazy devil what are you doingyour father is as good as dead i thought we had a deal we still do a new one you can still make some money tonight mikhael stopped panicking and started paying attention could there possibly be a way out of this nightmare im listening the last thing i need is for my father to return and destroy what i have built up over the past two years mikhael nodded this made perfect sense to him so he had to die i had to see it done myself just to be sure but i could still leave you a little something mikhael could barely breathe a little something the ransom all five million and why would you do that you get the money i get safe passage home fair enough seems fair to me very well now look across the bay above the fjord mikhael looked there was a flare burning right at the snowcovered hills tip there is a briefcase tied to that flare the flare goes out in ten minutes id get there before then if i were you otherwise the case could take years to find mikhael didnt bother to cut the connection he just dropped the phone and ran the money he shouted at kamar up there the flare kamar was after him in a heartbeat shouting instructions into the radio someone had to reach that money who cared about a drowning irlanskii when there were five million dollars to be claimed root pointed at holly the moment artemis senior had been shot go he ordered captain short activated her wings launching herself right off the hilltop of course what they were doing here was against all the regulations but the council was cutting foaly a lot of slack having more or less convicted him of treason the only conditions were that the centaur was in constant communication and that every member of the party was fitted with remote incineration packs so that they and all their fairy technology could be destroyed in the event of capture or injury holly followed events on the submarine through her visor she saw the charge impact on artemis seniors shoulder knocking him against the larger russian blood registered in her field of vision it was still warm enough to be picked up by her thermal imager holly had to admit it looked effective maybe artemiss plan could actually work maybe the russians would be fooled after all humans generally saw what they wanted to see then things went horribly wrong hes in the water shouted holly into her helmet mike opening the wing rigs throttle to the max hes alive but not for long unless we get him out she skimmed silently over the glistening ice arms crossed over her chest for speed she was moving too fast for human vision to pin her down she could be a bird or a seal breaking the waves the submarine loomed before her on board the nikodim the russians were evacuating clambering down the tower ladder feet slipping in their haste and ashore the same men breaking cover crashing through the frosted undergrowth the commander must have set the flare those mud men would be delirious to find their precious money only to have it dissolve in seventytwo hours that should just about give them time to deliver it to their boss odds on he wouldnt be happy with disappearing cash holly skimmed the subs keel safe from radiation in her suit and helmet at the last moment she flipped upwards shielded from the northern shore by the conning tower she popped the throttle hovering above the ice hole where the human had fallen in the commander was talking into her ear but holly didnt reply she had a job to do and no time for talk fairies hate cold they hate it some are so phobic about low temperatures that they wont even eat ice cream the last thing holly wanted to do right now was put so much as a toe into that subzero radioactive water but what choice did she have darvit she swore and plunged into the water the microfilaments in her suit deadened the cold but they could not dispel it entirely holly knew that she had seconds before the temperaturedrop slowed her reactions and sent her into shock below her the unconscious human was as pale as a ghost holly fumbled with her wing controls a touch too much on the throttle could send her too deep not enough and she would fall short and at these temperatures you got one shot only holly hit the throttle the engine buzzed once sending her ten fathoms down perfect she grabbed fowl senior by the waist quickly clipping him on to her moonbelt he hung there limply he needed an infusion of magic and the sooner the better holly glanced upwards it seemed as though the ice hole was already closing was there anything else that could go wrong the commander was shouting in her ear but she shut him out concentrating on getting back to dry land ice crystals spun themselves across the hole like spiders webs the ocean seemed determined to claim them i dont think so thought holly pointing her helmeted head at the surface and opening the throttle as far as it would gothey crashed through the ice arced through the air and landed on the slatted surface of the subs forward deck the humans face was the colour of the surrounding landscape holly crouched on his chest like a predatory creature exposing the supposed wound to the night air there was blood on the deck but it was artemis juniors blood they had pried the cap from a hydrosion shell and half filled it with blood taken from artemiss arm on impact the fizzer had knocked artemis senior off his feet sending the crimson liquid spiralling through the air very convincing of course being thrown into the freezing waters had not been part of the plan the shell had not penetrated his skin but mister fowl was not safe yet hollys thermal imager showed that his heartbeat was dangerously slow and weak she laid her hands on his chest heal she whispered heal and the magic scurried down her fingers artemis couldnt watch hollys rescue attempt had he done the right thing what if the hydrosion shell penetrated how could he ever face his mother again oh no said butler artemis was at his side in an instant what is it your father is in the water one of the russians threw him in the boy groaned that water was as deadly as any bullet hed been afraid that something like this would happen root had also been following the rescue attempt ok shes over the water can you see him holly no answer just static in his earphones status captain respond nothing holly shes not talking because its too late thought artemis theres nothing she can do to save my father and its all my fault roots voice cut through his thoughts the russians are evacuating he said hollys at the sub now over the hole in the ice shes going in holly what have you got come on holly talk to me nothing for the longest time then holly erupted through the ice like a mechanized dolphin she arced briefly through the arctic night crashlanding on the typhoons deck she has your father said the commander artemis slipped on the spare recon helmet willing hollys voice to sound through the speakers he magnified the picture in his visor until it seemed as though he could touch his father and watched holly lean over his fathers chest pulses of magic shooting down her fingers after several moments holly looked up straight into artemiss eyes as though she knew he was watching i got him she gasped one live mud man hes not pretty but hes breathing artemis sank to the ground sobs of relief shaking his thin shoulders he cried for a whole minute then he was himself again well done captain now lets get out of here before foaly activates one of these incinerator packs by accident in the bowels of the earth the centaur leaned back from his communications console dont tempt me he chuckled an epilogue or two tara artemis was heading back to st bartlebys this was where he had to be when the helsinki medical services identified his father from the suitably weathered passport foaly had run up for him holly had done her best for the injured man healing his chest wound and even restoring sight to his blinded eye but it was too late to reattach the leg which they didnt have in any case no artemis senior needed prolonged medical attention and it had to begin somewhere that could be rationally explained so holly had flown southwest to helsinki depositing the unconscious man at the doors of the university hospital one porter had spotted the flying patient but he had been successfully mindwiped when artemis senior regained consciousness the past two years would be a blur and his last memory would be a happy one bidding his family farewell at dublin harbour thanks again to foaly and his mindwiping technology why dont i just move in with you the centaur had quipped when they returned to police plaza do your ironing while im at it artemis smiled he had been doing that a lot lately even the parting with holly had gone better than he could have expected considering shed seen him shoot his own father artemis shuddered he anticipated many sleepless nights over that particular strategy the captain escorted them to tara slipping them out through a holographic hedge there was even a holographic cow chewing the virtual leaves to throw humans off the fairy scent artemis was back in his school uniform which had been miraculously restored by the peoples technology he sniffed his lapel this blazer smells unusual he commented not unpleasant but unusual its completely clean said holly smiling foaly had to put it through three cycles in the machine to purge to purge the mud people from it completed artemis exactly there was a full moon overhead bright and pocked like a golf ball holly could feel its magic singing to her foaly said in the light of the help youve given us hes pulling the surveillance on fowl manor thats good to know said artemis is it the right decision artemis considered it yes the people are safe from me good because a large section of the council wanted you mindwiped and with a chunk of memory this big your iq could take a bit of a dip butler extended a hand well captain i dont suppose ill see you again holly shook it if you do itll be too late captain short turned towards the fairy fort i had better go it will be light soon i dont want to be caught unshielded on a spy satellite the last thing i need is my photo all over the internet not when ive just been reinstated at recon butler elbowed his employer gently oh holly eh captain short eh artemis couldnt believe hed actually said eh it wasnt even a word yes mud b yes artemis artemis looked holly in the eye just as butler had instructed this being civil business was more difficult than one would think i would like to i meanwhat i mean is another elbow from butler thank you i owe you everything because of you i have my parents and the way you flew that craft was nothing short of spectacular and on the train well i could never have done what you a third elbow this time to stop the babbling sorry well you get the idea hollys elfin features wore a strange expression somewhere between embarrassment and could it possibly be delight she recovered quickly maybe i owe you something too human she said drawing her pistol butler almost reacted but decided to give holly the benefit of the doubt captain short plucked a gold coin from her belt flicking it twenty metres into the moonlit sky with one fluid movement she brought her weapon up and loosed a single blast the coin rose another twenty metres then spun earthwards artemis somehow managed to snatch it from the air the first cool moment of his young life nice shot he said the previously solid disc now had a tiny hole in the centre holly held out her hand revealing the stillraw scar on her finger if it wasnt for you i would have missed altogether no mechdigit can replicate that kind of accuracy so thank you too i suppose artemis held out the coin no said holly you keep it to remind you to remind me holly stared at him frankly to remind you that deep beneath the layers of deviousness there is a spark of decency perhaps you could blow on that spark occasionally artemis closed his fingers around the coin it was warm against his palm yes perhaps a small twoseater plane buzzed overhead artemis glanced skywards and when he looked back holly was gone a slight heat haze hovered above the grass goodbye holly he said softly the bentley started on the first turn of the key in less than an hour they arrived at st bartlebys main gate make sure your phones switched on butler said holding the door the helsinki officials should be getting the results of their trace from interpol soon your fathers file has been reactivated in their mainframe thanks once again to foaly artemis nodded checking his phone was switched on try to locate mother and juliet before the news comes through i dont want to be hunting through every spa in the south of france looking for them yes artemis and check my accounts are well hidden no need for father to know exactly what ive been up to for the past two years butler smiled yes artemis artemis took a few steps towards the school gates then turned and butler one more thing in the arctic artemis couldnt ask but his bodyguard knew the answer anyway yes artemis he said gently you did the right thing it was the only way artemis nodded standing by the gates until the bentley had disappeared down the avenue from this moment on life would be different with two parents in the manor his schemes would have to be much more carefully planned yes he owed it to the people to leave them alone for a while but mulch diggums that was a different matter so many secure facilities so little time counsellors office st bartlebys school for young gentlemen not only was doctor po still employed at st bartlebys but he seemed fortified by his break from artemis his other patients were relatively straightforward cases of anger management exam stress and chronic shyness and that was just the teachers artemis settled on to the couch taking care not to accidentally press the power button on his mobile doctor po nodded at his computer principal guiney forwarded me your email charming im sorry about that muttered artemis surprised to find that he actually was sorry upsetting other people didnt usually upset him i was in denial so i projected my anxieties on to you po half chuckled yes very good just what it says in the book i know said artemis and he did know doctor f roy dean schlippe had contributed a chapter to that particular book doctor po laid down his pen something he had never done before you know we still havent resolved that last issue which issue is that doctor the one we touched on at our last session about respect ah that issue po steepled his fingers i want you to pretend im as smart as you are and give me an honest answer artemis thought of his father lying in a helsinki hospital of captain holly short risking her life to help him and of course butler without whom he would never have made it out of koboi laboratories he looked up catching doctor po smiling at him well young man have you found anyone worthy of your respect artemis smiled back yes he said i believe i have year
