story of the bad little boy by mark twain once there was a bad little boy whose name was jim though if you will notice you will find that bad little boys are nearly always called james in your sundayschool books it was strange but still it was true that this one was called jim he didnt have any sick mother eithera sick mother who was pious and had the consumption and would be glad to lie down in the grave and be at rest but for the strong love she bore her boy and the anxiety she felt that the world might be harsh and cold towards him when she was gone most bad boys in the sundaybooks are named james and have sick motherswho teach them to say now i lay me down etc and sing them to sleep with sweet plaintive voices and then kiss them goodnight and kneel down by the bedside and weep but it was different with this fellow he was named jim and there wasnt anything the matter with his mother no consumption nor anything of that kind she was rather stout than otherwise and she was not pious moreover she was not anxious on jims account she said if he were to break his neck it wouldnt be much loss she always spanked jim to sleep and she never kissed him goodnight on the contrary she boxed his ears when she was ready to leave him once this little bad boy stole the key of the pantry and slipped in there and helped himself to some jam and filled up the vessel with tar so that his mother would never know the difference but all at once a terrible feeling didnt come over him and something didnt seem to whisper to him is it right to disobey my mother isnt in sinful to do this where do bad little boys go who gobble up their good kind mothers jam and then he didnt kneel down all alone and promise never to be wicked any more and rise up with a light happy heart and go and tell his mother all about it and beg her forgiveness and be blessed by her with tears of pride and thankfulness in her eyes no that is the way with all other bad boys in the books but it happened otherwise with this jim strangely enough he ate that jam and said it was bully in his sinful vulgar way and he put in the tar and said that was bully also and laughed and observed that the old woman would get up and snort when she found it out and when she did find it out he denied knowing anything about it and she whipped him severely and he did the crying himselfeverything about this boy was curious everything turned out differently with him from the way it does to the bad jameses in the books once he climbed up in farmer acorns appletree to steal apples and the limb didnt break and he didnt fall and break his arm and get torn by the farmers great dog and then languish on a sick bed for weeks and repent and become good oh no he stole as many apples as he wanted and came down all right and he was all ready for the dog too and knocked him endways with a brick when he came to tear him it was very strange nothing like it ever happened in those mild little books with marbled backs and with pictures in them of men with swallowtailed coats and bellcrowned hats and pantaloons that are short in the legs and women with the waists of their dresses under their arms and no hoops on nothing like it in any of the sundayschool books once he stole the teachers penknife and when he was afraid it would be found out and he would get whipped he slipped it into george wilsons cap poor widow wilsons son the moral boy the good little boy of the village who always obeyed his mother and never told an untruth and was fond of his lessons and infatuated with sundayschool and when the knife dropped from the cap and poor george hung his head and blushed as if in conscious guilt and the grieved teacher charged the theft upon him and was just in the very act of bringing the switch down upon his trembling shoulders a whitehaired improbable justice of the peace did not suddenly appear in their midst and strike an attitude and say spare this noble boy there stands the cowering culprit i was passing the schooldoor at recess and unseen myself i saw the theft committed and then jim didnt get whaled and the venerable justice didnt read the tearful school a homily and take george by the hand and say such a boy deserved to be exalted and then tell him to come and make his home with him and sweep out the office and make fires and run errands and chop wood and study law and help his wife do household labors and have all the balance of the time to play and get forty cents a month and be happy no it would have happened that way in the books but it didnt happen that way to jim no meddling old clam of a justice dropped in to make trouble and so the model boy george got thrashed and jim was glad of it because you know jim hatedmoral boys jim said he was down on them milksops such was the coarse language of this bad neglected boy but the strangest thing that ever happened to jim was the time he went boating on sunday and didnt get drowned and that other time that he got caught out in the storm when he was fishing on sunday and didnt get struck by lightning why you might look and look and look all through the sundayschool books from now till next christmas and you would never come across anything like this oh no you would find that all the bad boys who go boating on sunday invariably get drowned and all the bad boys who get caught out in storms when they are fishing on sunday infallibly get struck by lightning boats with bad boys in them are always upset on sunday and it always storms when bad boys go fishing on the sabbath how this jim ever escaped is a mystery to me this jim bore a charmed life that must have been the way of it nothing could hurt him he even gave the elephant in the menagerie a plug of tobacco and the elephant didnt knock the top of his head off with his trunk he browsed around the cupboard after essence of peppermint and didnt make a mistake and drink aqua fortis he stole his fathers gun and went hunting on the sabbath and didnt shoot three or four of his fingers off he struck his little sister on the temple with his fist when he was angry and she didnt linger in pain through long summer days and die with sweet words of forgiveness upon her lips that redoubled the anguish of his breaking heart no she got over it he ran off and went to sea at last and didnt come back and find himself sad and alone in the world his loved ones sleeping in the quiet churchyard and the vineemboweredhome of his boyhood tumbled down and gone to decay ah no he came home as drunk as a piper and got into the stationhouse the first thing and he grew up and married and raised a large family and brained them all with an axe one night and got wealthy by all manner of cheating and rascality and now he is the infernalest wickedest scoundrel in his native village and is universally respected and belongs to the legislature so you see there never was a bad james in the sundayschool books that had such a streak of luck as this sinful jim with the charmed life
